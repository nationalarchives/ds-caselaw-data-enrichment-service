In the course of the trial however the Claimants and Novatrust reached an agreement which settled not only the Claimants’ claims in this action against Novatrust and Spartan, but also the entirety of the derivative action and the petition.  I am therefore now only concerned with the one action, and only with the claims brought by the Claimants against the Defendants other than Novatrust and Spartan.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The protagonists are two wealthy businessmen from New Zealand, Sir Owen Glenn (he was not knighted until late 2012 but I will refer to him as <span style="font-weight:bold">“Sir Owen”</span> throughout) and Mr Eric Watson (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Mr Watson”</span>).  Over the course of a long career, Sir Owen had founded and built up from nothing a highly successful international logistics business known as OTS Logistics Group or <span style="font-weight:bold">“OTSLG”</span>.  In 2012, by which time he was in his early 70s, he sold OTSLG for a substantial sum – I do not think the precise amount is in evidence, but it was about US$350m (in the rest of this judgment I will use $ to refer to US dollars, with A$ and NZ$ for Australian and New Zealand dollars respectively).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sir Owen had formerly owned OTSLG himself, but by the time of the sale it was held by an offshore trust called the Corona Trust which had been established in 2009 for the benefit of Sir Owen’s family and a foundation which he used for his charitable and philanthropic activities called the Glenn Family Foundation (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the GFF”</span>).  As a result of the sale the trust had a large amount of cash to invest, and the proceedings arise out of investment opportunities that Mr Watson made available for this purpose, in particular two investments put forward by Mr Watson codenamed Project Edsel and Project Spartan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Project Edsel came first.  This was an investment in an affordable housing scheme for the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham (<span style="font-weight:bold">“LBBD”</span>).  The basic idea was that Sir Owen’s interests would provide 90% of the capital required and Mr Watson’s 10% but that the profits, after repayment of capital and interest, would be split 50/50.  On the Sir Owen side the investment was made by Kea, which was then owned (indirectly) by the Corona Trust (it is now owned by Sir Owen personally).  On the Watson side the investment was made by Novatrust, a professional trustee company, in its capacity as trustee of the Clearview Trust (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Clearview”</span>), one of several trusts established by or associated with Mr Watson.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The venture was a success and returned substantial profits to both Kea and Novatrust.  However Mr Watson also benefited from a share in the management “carry”, that is a share of profits payable to the managers of the investment, which in the event also gave him very substantial amounts.  The Claimants in the current action bring personal and proprietary claims against Mr Watson on the basis that this aspect of the arrangement involved a breach of fiduciary duty owed to them by Mr Watson, and on various other grounds.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Project Spartan followed.  This was a project on a much larger scale.  It was again a joint venture, with the participants again being Kea on the Sir Owen side, and Novatrust on the Watson side, in this case in its capacity as trustee of the Park Trust (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Park”</span>), another trust associated with Mr Watson.  Kea and Novatrust each became 50% shareholders in Spartan, a BVI company, and each had a representative on Spartan’s board of directors.  Kea also agreed to lend substantial sums to Spartan which could then be deployed on a number of potential investments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Documents to give effect to this, such as a shareholders’ agreement and loan agreement, were entered into in July 2012.  Although an initial presentation had been made to Sir Owen in April 2012, the negotiation of the detailed terms and the decision to go ahead were dealt with not by him but by two individuals who between them ran the Corona Trust: Mr David Miller (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Mr Miller”</span>), a long-standing adviser to, personal friend and close confidant of Sir Owen’s, who was the Protector; and Mr Peter Dickson (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Mr Dickson”</span>), who owned and ran Pizarro Company Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Pizarro”</span>), a Nevis company that was the Trustee.  The formal agreements were signed on behalf of Kea by Mr Dickson who was a director of Kea.  They involved Kea agreeing to lend Spartan over £12m in effect as the price for participating in Spartan and to make further substantial loans (initially £50m) to Spartan for it to deploy on investments, and committed Spartan to a number of transactions (set out in schedule 2 to the shareholders’ agreement and referred to in these proceedings as <span style="font-weight:bold">“the schedule 2 transactions”</span>). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sir Owen however fell out with Mr Miller and Mr Dickson and proceedings were brought, first by Sir Owen in California against Mr Miller, and then by his daughter, a beneficiary of the Corona Trust, in Nevis against both Mr Miller and Mr Dickson (and Pizarro and others).  The upshot of that was that the Nevis Court appointed a new trustee of the Corona Trust, namely a company called Harneys (Nevis) Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“HNL”</span>), initially on an interim basis, and a new director, Harlaw Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Harlaw”</span>), was subsequently appointed to Spartan’s board as Kea representative.  HNL and Harlaw were companies associated with Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Harneys”</span>), a firm of solicitors practising in the BVI and elsewhere, and Mr Ross Munro, a partner in Harneys, acted as director of both HNL and Harlaw.  In April 2013 Mr Munro approved Spartan entering into the schedule 2 transactions.  Spartan had already made one investment, which was successful, but thereafter no further investments were made, Spartan’s board was deadlocked and Spartan’s business came to a complete halt. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That forms the background to the action.  In essence the Claimants sought to unwind Kea’s investment in Spartan by avoiding or setting aside the Project Spartan agreements entered into by Kea in July 2012.  That claim was based on a number of alternative grounds, including allegations that Messrs Miller and Dickson were deceived into entering into them by fraudulent misrepresentations, or alternatively that Mr Dickson entered into them in breach of his duty as director of Kea (to the knowledge of Novatrust), or that Mr Watson acted in breach of a fiduciary duty owed to Sir Owen or Kea.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After leaving school Sir Owen began his career in logistics and as already mentioned over the course of a long career built up a very successful logistics business known as OTSLG.  In an affidavit in the Nevis proceedings, he said that it was always his intention to build up OTSLG and sell it so as to realise significant capital which could be used to diversify his business interests, support his extensive philanthropic activities and secure his own and his family’s future, and that from the early 2000s, he began to think seriously about selling OTSLG.  As a result of certain advice he received about the possible US tax consequences of a sale while he was resident in the US, he gave up his green card on or around 30 December 2003 and moved to Monaco. </p>

Sir Owen established a group called the OTSLG Advisory Board which had its inaugural meeting in Long Beach, California in March 2011.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together various people to discuss his plans to sell the business and what he proposed to do afterwards.  By then matters were sufficiently far advanced for the Board to be told that Mancap was doing due diligence into a potential acquisition at $400m.  This was the transaction that eventually completed in the shape of a sale of OTSLG to Mancap, albeit not until January 2012.  Among the attendees on the Advisory Board was Mr Roger Hamilton SC, an Australian tax barrister and Senior Counsel who was a long-standing adviser and friend of Sir Owen’s (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Mr Hamilton”</span>); his evidence to the Nevis Court was that a considerable part of the meeting was devoted to outlining what Sir Owen would like to do if the Mansour transaction were successful, with Sir Owen referring to various investments and projects and making provision for his family and the GFF.  Mr Hamilton’s notes of the meeting indicate that there was discussion of $100m being put into broad investments (with the income for Sir Owen’s children and grandchildren), with other investments being held for the benefit of the GFF.  </p>

The details of this are not relevant to the issues in the action but it is apparent that Sir Owen has, through the GFF, given large sums of money to charitable and philanthropic causes over the years, not only in New Zealand, but also in India and elsewhere.  In his affidavit in the Nevis proceedings, he said that the GFF had over the last 30 years given an estimated NZ$41m to a wide variety of worthwhile causes all over the world.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One notable example concerns the setting up of the trust arrangements in 2009.  It is accepted by Ms Jones QC, who appeared for the Claimants – and indeed has been accepted since my first involvement in these proceedings at a case management conference in April 2016 – that these arrangements were entered into as a result of a concern about a potential liability to US estate tax.  Sir Owen had given up his green card at the end of 2003, but if he died within a 10-year window thereafter, there would have been a potential liability to US estate tax.  The Defendants have at various stages in the proceedings suggested that another concern might have been a potential liability to US income tax (which includes tax on capital gains), and in the course of his cross-examination Sir Owen expressly accepted that the advice he took and received was in relation to income tax.  That led to Mr McCaughran QC, who appeared for Mr Watson, making an application in the course of the trial for specific inspection of certain documents dealing with the establishment of the trusts that had been withheld; the application was vigorously opposed by Ms Jones, but at my suggestion her solicitors wrote to confirm that none of those documents had in fact referred to US income tax, and on that basis Mr McCaughran did not pursue his application.  In those circumstances I conclude, as Ms Jones invited me to, that Sir Owen was simply wrong in thinking that US income tax had played any part in the decision to set up the trusts in 2009 – despite the fact that he had been quite clear in his evidence that this was so.  </p>

In cross-examination Mr McCaughran asked him if he recalled going to Hong Kong in October 2011 for the purpose of making an agreement for the sale of OTSLG to Mancap.  He said he did not recall doing so.  Further disclosure was however then given which showed beyond doubt that a trip to Hong Kong on 4 October 2011 was arranged for him, and when recalled for further cross-examination, he admitted being in Hong Kong for a meeting to close the transaction with Mancap: there was in fact a last-minute hitch and the deal went off, but he decided to go anyway.  He said he just did not recall it when first asked. </p>

In the 1980s he acted as Chief Financial Officer for several of Sir Owen’s companies, but resigned to run his own business; not long afterwards, he re-joined Sir Owen to oversee the administration of Sir Owen’s various interests.  In his affidavit in the Nevis proceedings, Sir Owen said that Mr Miller was from then on closely involved in the running of his businesses and his personal financial affairs, that he (Sir Owen) came to place complete trust and confidence in him, and that Mr Miller was not only a trusted adviser but a personal friend, such that Sir Owen asked him to hold his power of attorney and act as executor of his will; Mr Miller is also godfather to Sir Owen’s fourth daughter Michelle.  An e-mail in January 2011 from Sir Owen to Mr Miller when agreeing to pay him a bonus described his role as looking out for the shareholders’ interests, told Mr Miller that he should subscribe to the creed that Sir Owen should be kept informed day by day on all matters that were part and parcel of his affairs, and thanked him for being on his side; Mr Miller replied that he had always been on his side.  Mr Miller was called to give evidence before me by the Defendants, and I will have to consider the quality of his evidence later; he accepted in evidence the description of himself as Sir Owen’s adviser and right-hand man.  </p>

In his affidavit in the Nevis proceedings he said that his focus was on developing and running his businesses so he left all points of detail concerning the establishment, operation and administration of the trusts to Mr Miller, but continued to make the substantive decisions (including investment decisions and the distribution of funds for his philanthropic activities).

It appears that the shares had previously been held by Mr Dickson and were put into Sir Owen’s beneficial ownership in connection with a sale that was then proposed.  One of the subsidiaries held by Pacifico was Kea, Pacifico being the sole registered shareholder of Kea from 8 May 2007 until 27 February 2013 (when the shares were transferred to HNL).</p>

Sir Owen did not therefore appear as settlor on the face of the documents, although it was not disputed that he was the economic settlor, and there was no attempt to hide his connection with the trusts on the face of the trust deeds, with prominent reference for example to his US and non-US children and grandchildren.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In April and May 2009 arrangements were entered into the result of which was that the Corona Trust acquired OTSLG but there was a sum of $82m left outstanding as owed by the Corona Trust to the Regency Trust (and hence available to Sir Owen).  The precise mechanics are of less importance but the material I have seen indicates that (i) on 1 April 2009 a company owned by the Corona Trust, Trans Pacifico Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“TPL”</span>), bought from Global Transport Holdings Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“GTHL”</span>), a company owned by Pacifico and hence ultimately by Sir Owen personally, the shares in a company called Global Logistics Holdings Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“GLHL”</span>), whose subsidiaries included OTSLG, for $91m (apparently its then book value, which was considerably less than its then market value); (ii) of the $91m, $9m was paid in cash and $82m was left outstanding as a loan from GTHL to TPL, to be repaid by TPL over a period; and (iii) on 1 May 2009 Pacifico was contributed to the Regency Trust.  Mr Miller in his evidence initially suggested the arrangements had taken place in a different order, but what I have set out above is what the available documentary material indicates, as indeed he accepted.  The net effect was that by the middle of 2009 the (irrevocable) Corona Trust owned OTSLG (although it later came to light that the share register was not then updated), and the (revocable) Regency Trust had the benefit of a receivable of $82m from the Corona Trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By deed dated 30 September 2011 the Corona Trust was amended.  By clause 13(a) of the original declaration of trust the Trustee (Pizarro) had power to amend the trusts with the written consent of the Protector (Mr Miller) provided that the Trustee was <span style="font-style:italic">“reasonably satisﬁed that such alteration … does not prejudice the general interests of the Beneﬁciaries”</span>.  The amendment took the form of a restated declaration of trust which was executed by Mr Dickson on behalf of Pizarro; I have not I think seen the written consent of Mr Miller.  A number of amendments were made: the restated deed incorporated the provisions as to payments of Sir Owen’s debts and funeral expenses on his death which had been in the Regency Trust; the beneficiaries were restated and now excluded Sir Owen’s US children and grandchildren; and a new schedule of fees was added.  The original declaration of trust had provided that the Trustee could charge fees in accordance with Pizarro’s fee schedule (although no such schedule was set out), and that the Protector should be provided reasonable compensation based on the amount of time spent by him and the extent of his duties and responsibilities; the restated declaration of trust provided for the Trustee to receive annual fees based on the size of the fund, a 3% <span style="font-style:italic">ad valorem</span> fee on purchases and sales of assets, and other fees on distributions, retirement and the like.  The annual fee was 1.5% on the first $100m, 1% on the next $100m, and 0.5% on the next $200m, so for a fund of $400m would amount to $3.5m pa.  The restated trust deed also introduced a minimum annual fee of $300,000 for the Protector.  It does not appear that these fees had been agreed or discussed with Sir Owen.  Nor were they disclosed at the time: Mr Miller accepted in evidence that Sir Owen was not copied in when the trust was amended, that he did not know at any time until the latter part of March 2012 what fees Mr Miller and Mr Dickson were proposing to charge, and that he was furious when he found out.  (It may also be noted in passing that among other amendments this deed deleted the proviso to the amendment power that the Trustee be reasonably satisfied that any amendment did not prejudice the general interests of the Beneficiaries; this particular amendment was not something raised in evidence or submissions and I express no views on whether it was of any effect, but it is at first blush somewhat surprising that a trustee or protector should think it a proper amendment to make).</p>

The mechanics are again of less importance but briefly (i) by a Deed of Inclusion of Beneficiary dated (at least ostensibly) 31 October 2011 Pizarro as Trustee of the Regency Trust added the Corona Trust as a beneficiary of the Regency Trust (the Trustee having power to add <span style="font-style:italic">“persons”</span> as beneficiaries and <span style="font-style:italic">“person”</span> being defined to include an <span style="font-style:italic">“entity”</span>); (ii) as recorded in a memorandum also dated 31 October 2011 Pizarro as Trustee of the Regency Trust made an <span style="font-style:italic">in specie</span> distribution of the shares in Pacifico to the Corona Trust; and (iii) by a Deed of Exclusion of Beneficiary dated 30 November 2011, Pizarro as Trustee of the Regency Trust excluded the Corona Trust as a beneficiary of the Regency Trust.  The practical effect was that the Corona Trust came to hold both OTSLG, and the benefit of the receivable of $82m owed by TPL to GTHL (and also Kea, Pacifico’s subsidiary).

What does clearly emerge is that the decanting was not something that had been planned when the two separate trusts were set up in 2009.  It is part of the Claimants’ case that the decanting, which had the effect of removing the receivable of $82m from a trust where Sir Owen could, by revoking the trust, claim it for himself, to a trust where he had no rights over it, without taking into account his interests or even informing him, was wrongful and in breach of trust.

Sir Owen was therefore disconcerted to be told that decisions on such matters were not a matter for him at all but for Messrs Miller and Dickson.  At a meeting at his house in Sydney in January 2012 Mr Dickson referred to new <span style="font-style:italic">“rules of engagement”</span> by which he meant that Sir Owen would henceforth have a limited role in investment decisions.

He also suggested limiting or dispensing with Mr Dickson’s services.  Mr Miller took advice from Mr Ord, a US attorney of the firm of Ord &amp; Norman which had been involved in setting up the trusts, as a result of which he wrote Sir Owen a long e-mail dated 25 February 2012 passing on Mr Ord’s comments.  It is not necessary to detail them: the general thrust was that there was a high risk of an audit by the IRS (the US revenue authority) as a result of the Mancap transaction, and that there would be significant adverse consequences if the trust were to be seen as a sham.  That meant avoiding any inappropriate or questionable payments to the settlor, and that the trustees should, at least on paper, be seen to be making the investment decisions, with communications from the settlor being couched as requests not demands. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 21 March 2012, Mr Dickson wrote a formal letter to Sir Owen on behalf of Pizarro (describing himself as Managing Director, and copied to Mr Miller as Policy Director, although Mr Miller never occupied a formal position as director of Pizarro), saying that Pizarro had become very concerned about his apparent misconception with respect to his relationship to the trust.  Sir Owen asked Mr Miller for a copy of the Corona Trust Deed and was provided with a copy of the Amended Deed dated 30 September 2011; this revealed the scale of trustee fees which shocked Sir Owen.  After an unproductive meeting between Sir Owen and Mr Miller in the Bahamas in which Sir Owen said that the Trustee should be replaced, Mr Miller should resign and the fees not paid as they had never been approved, Mr Miller wrote another formal letter to him on 13 April 2012 (on Pizarro letterhead, describing himself as Policy Advisor to Pizarro) rejecting his suggestion of replacing the Trustee, and declining to invest in two projects that Sir Owen had put forward, a tourist railway in New Zealand, and a film about the first New Zealand rugby team to tour the British Isles in 1905 (when the name All Blacks was coined).  Both this letter and that of Mr Dickson of 21 March 2012 emphasised that Sir Owen had no control over the trust.   </p>

Sir Owen replied to Mr Miller by e-mail dated 15 April 2012 saying he was flabbergasted and apoplectic at his and Mr Dickson’s decision not to approve the funding of the All Blacks film, saying that he would not let <span style="font-style:italic">“little people like you two stand in my way”</span>, an expression which he was unapologetic about in cross-examination.  Mr Hamilton became involved and spoke to Mr Miller by telephone on 24 April 2012; among other things he pointed out that under the terms of the Amended Corona Trust Deed Sir Owen had a right to information about the trust, a provision which Mr Miller appears to have been unaware of.  After a further meeting in London on 7 May 2012, which was also unproductive (it was described by Mr Miller in evidence as confrontational, and by Sir Owen in his affidavit in the Nevis proceedings as somewhat heated), Mr Miller wrote another formal letter to Sir Owen on 9 May 2012 rejecting Sir Owen’s demands that he and Mr Dickson resign.  The letter refers to Sir Owen having threatened litigation if his demands were not met, and Sir Owen accepted in cross-examination that by this time there had been quite a serious breakdown in the relations between him and Messrs Miller and Dickson.  By 6 June 2012 Sir Owen had instructed Mr Richard Reuben of Fladgate LLP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Fladgates”</span>), who had in turn consulted David Brownbill QC and who passed on to Sir Owen a number of options for taking proceedings, and Sir Owen accepted in cross-examination that by this date he was contemplating bringing proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the event Sir Owen brought proceedings in California against Mr Miller by Complaint dated 5 September 2012.  By then Messrs Miller and Dickson had taken a number of steps in reaction to Sir Owen’s threats.  Mr Miller had been drawing fees from the trust at a rate of $25,000 per month (in accordance with his entitlement to a minimum $300,000 per year) and by 2 May 2012 had already drawn 5 such payments covering the period down to and including May; on 15 May 2012 however he drew a further $225,000 described as <span style="font-style:italic">“fees on account for 2012”</span>.  At the same time a similar sum was paid to Mr Dickson, also described as fees on account.  Mr Miller accepted in cross-examination that that was him and Mr Dickson getting some money out of the trust for their own benefit quickly now that Sir Owen had threatened litigation.  On 11 June 2012 Messrs Miller and Dickson amended the Corona Trust again, this time to make Sir Owen’s right to information subject to the absolute and sole discretion of the Trustee.  Then on 3 August 2012, Mr Dickson paid himself some $3.1m, and Mr Miller some $2.9m, in respect of trustee fees.  I did not receive any explanation as to how these sums were calculated at the time.  There is in evidence a subsequent reconciliation dating from December 2012 which allocates them to the period since the inception of the trust in February 2009.  It seems unlikely however that that explains how the sums paid on 3 August were calculated, as it is based on a revised fee schedule which Messrs Miller and Dickson only adopted on 20 August 2012 after receiving advice, dated 14 August 2012, from consultants called Altus Economics Inc to the effect that the trustee fees given in the original fee schedule were much higher than the level of trustee fees paid to firms providing similar trustee services, and that a significantly lower fee schedule would be more appropriate.  It is noticeable that Mr Miller’s $2.9m was on any view considerably more than the fees payable to him as Protector, but he explained in evidence that Mr Dickson took the view that it was not fair that he should accept all the trustee fees and thought it was fair that Mr Miller should also share in them due to the work he had done over the years, not least in relation to the negotiations with Mancap.  To put it another way, Mr Dickson simply agreed to split the trustee fees with Mr Miller, as the latter accepted.</p>

The claimant was Sir Owen’s daughter Mrs Connah in her capacity as a beneficiary under the Corona Trust (and other trusts), and the defendants included Pizarro, Mr Miller and Mr Dickson.  On 13 February 2013 Mrs Connah applied <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> for injunctive relief; among the matters particularly relied on was Pizarro’s attempt to force Sir Owen to give up his claim against Mr Miller by announcing that until that claim was settled Pizarro would not support the work of the GFF.  On 6 November 2012 Mr Dickson had sent an e-mail to the effect that in the light of the proceedings taken by Sir Owen in California against Mr Miller, Pizarro was not prepared to consider any requests for funding from the GFF, thereby putting the funding of existing projects carried out by the GFF in India and New Zealand at risk, and leading to the resignation of senior staff; and on 30 January 2013 he sent another e-mail refusing Sir Owen and his associates any access to Ubiquitous until the claim against Mr Miller was settled.  Ubiquitous was a new yacht that had been bought in December 2011; it was paid for and held by one of the companies under the Corona Trust but Mr Miller accepted in evidence that it was intended for Sir Owen’s use (indeed Mr Dickson had told Sir Owen at the time of purchase that it was a real beauty to fully enjoy and that he deserved it).  It had been shipped to New Zealand, at considerable expense, where it was due to be used for a series of promotional events for the GFF commencing on 17 February 2013; these were again put at risk by Mr Dickson’s refusal to allow Sir Owen access to it.   </p>

He was hesitant, nervous, easily shown in cross-examination to have a far less clear recollection or even understanding of the detail than his witness statement had suggested, often confused, and on occasion given to long pauses before answering.  On many occasions he gave evidence readily accepting matters put to him in cross-examination, but which were entirely at odds with his own written evidence, and struggled to explain the discrepancies when they were pointed out.  Mr McCaughran submitted that he was suggestible; that I think is probably so, but is a submission liable to backfire as it may have been his witness statement that was the product of his suggestibility rather than his answers in oral evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On trust matters generally his conduct seems to me to have been questionable at best.  It is not my function in these proceedings to go into the detailed rights and wrongs of the disputes raised in the California and Nevis proceedings, which the parties agreed to compromise long ago, and which are not the subject-matter of this action; but I do have to form some assessment of Mr Miller as a witness, and his conduct is relevant to that.  I was not impressed with it.  No doubt Sir Owen’s habit of treating the trust assets as if they were his own made running the trust in a way that would satisfy any IRS audit more difficult than usual, but one suspects that Sir Owen’s attitude, that he was the one who had made the money and who wanted to decide what happened to it, is not that uncommon with wealthy settlors, and one would have thought that most competent offshore trustees would be well used to the somewhat delicate task of accommodating the demands of settlors without imperilling the tax advantages.  Messrs Miller and Dickson however seem to have badly mishandled the relationship by adopting an aggressive and confrontational stance, to the stage when litigation was first threatened and then brought.  And I was very unimpressed with Mr Miller’s conduct over the fees.  Mr Miller was the protector and had significant powers.  One might have thought the very essence of the role of a protector would be to act as a check on the trustee, trustees very often being given extensive discretionary powers which can be abused by the unscrupulous, and that an obvious case in point would be for the protector to ensure that the trustee was not milking the fund by charging excessive fees.  But far from looking out for the beneficiaries’ interests, Mr Miller agreed with Mr Dickson to the setting of fees that were later said to be unjustifiably high, and then benefited from them himself, having agreed to split them with Mr Dickson, at the same time resisting any attempt to replace Mr Dickson as trustee.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that he allowed his own personal interest to influence if not dictate his dealings with the trust; indeed some of his answers suggested that he did not think Sir Owen had rewarded him adequately for the work he had done on getting Mancap to increase their offer, and that he saw Mr Dickson’s agreement to split the trustee fees with him as no more than his just reward.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I saw him being cross-examined in the witness box for a long time.  I have come to the conclusion that I should be very hesitant about accepting his evidence, save where corroborated by contemporary documents or inherently probable.  Mr McCaughran pointed out that he was a resident of California and not compellable and submitted that the most probable explanation for his coming to give evidence was that he wanted to tell the truth; Ms Jones submitted that he gave deliberately false evidence to support a false account by Mr Watson, and that Mr Watson had corrupted him to do so.  Having reached the conclusion I have that his evidence cannot be relied on, I do not think I ultimately have to decide on his motivation, but I suspect the true position is probably more nuanced than the black and white choice counsel suggested.  Having fallen out badly with Sir Owen (something for which he himself must bear much of the responsibility), I think he was persuaded by Mr Watson, who had gone to some lengths to woo him and Mr Dickson, into thinking that Project Spartan was a wonderful proposition; and that the worse that his relations with Sir Owen became, to the extent of his being personally sued for $350m, the more he (and Mr Dickson) sided with Mr Watson and signed up to the project, to the extent (as appears below) of colluding in steps designed to pre-empt further litigation by Sir Owen.  He clearly felt very aggrieved by Sir Owen’s actions, as was apparent from his evidence.  In effect the consequence of the breakdown in relations with Sir Owen was to throw him and Mr Dickson more and more into the Watson camp.  Having become an uncritical and indeed enthusiastic supporter of Project Spartan, I suspect his main motivation for giving evidence in support of Mr Watson was an attempt to justify his own (and Mr Dickson’s) conduct and demonstrate that they were running the trust perfectly well, and everything would have been fine had Sir Owen not interfered.  That I suspect in turn led him to subscribe to Mr Watson’s account of events even though, as I have referred to, his oral evidence demonstrated how far from his actual recollection it was.  </p>

He also said that he commonly borrows all or a significant part of his investment from one of the other parties to the deal thereby enabling him to invest without seeking bank finance.

It was ostensibly owned by Mr Leahy, but in reality it only had one client – Mr Watson – and he financed it, decided what money should be paid to Mr Leahy from it (as so-called “advances”) and took the vast majority of any receipts from it, as shown by a number of “wash up”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>spreadsheets that were in evidence.  For example one from 30 April 2013 showed that Nucopia’s operating profit for the period 1 July 2012 to 30 April 2013 of $405,772 was to be allocated 79% to Mr Watson and only 8% to Mr Leahy (with 5% for Mr Gibson and 8% for Mr Paul Vassilakos, another person who worked with Mr Watson), the amounts for the latter three being set against distributions that they had already received.  Included in these sums were fees received by Nucopia from Spartan.  There is a dispute between the parties whether (as the Claimants contend) Nucopia is in truth simply Mr Watson’s vehicle, or whether (as Mr Watson contends) it is Mr Leahy’s vehicle but he was in practice constrained to share its receipts with Mr Watson.  On any footing Mr Watson had a very significant interest in it.</p>

However that included, as already referred to, being drawn by Mr Watson into deception, and although I found much of his evidence of considerable assistance in understanding the technicalities, that inevitably undermines the confidence that I can have in it.  His evidence was also necessarily heavily coloured by reconstruction from the documents and on one key episode (the signing of the Second and Third Kea Loan Agreements) was demonstrated beyond doubt to have been entirely wrong, which naturally again reduces the confidence I can have in him.</p>

Despite the primacy which our trial system has long given to oral evidence, it is by now a commonplace that the memory even of witnesses who are doing their honest best is often unreliable (see <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin SGPS SA v Credit Suisse (UK) Ltd </span>[2013] EWHC (Comm) at [15]-[23] per Leggatt J); and in cases of fraud when the credibility of witnesses is in issue, it has long been recognised to be essential to test their veracity by reference to the objective facts proved independently of their testimony, in particular by reference to the documents in the case, and also to pay particular regard to their motives and to the overall probabilities (<span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Frost </span>[1985] 1 Ll Rep 1, 57 per Robert Goff LJ).  </p>

In a very recent judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">re Edwardian Group Ltd </span>[2018] EWHC 1715 (Ch), Fancourt J made some remarks about the witness statements in that case and their value (or the lack of it) as evidence (see at [90]-[92]), and much the same could be said in this case.  As for the oral evidence, I think with hindsight that I would have benefited from more of the trial time being devoted to examining the documented course of events and less with the witnesses: it is not I think necessary to challenge a witness on every statement with which issue is taken, and I have taken no account of submissions that if a witness was not challenged on a particular point his evidence must be treated as accepted.  I do not understand that to be the law or the modern practice. </p>

Sir Owen’s evidence was that he thought that they had been introduced by Mr Rob Hersov, a South African entrepreneur who was a mutual friend; that he and Mr Watson were fellow Kiwis and had a number of shared interests (rugby, horses, golf and philanthropy); that he liked Mr Watson and thought him good company and a good bloke; that from about 2010 he began to spend more time with him; and that from early 2011 their relationship became much closer to a point where by early 2012 he thought of Mr Watson as a very good friend.  Mr Watson, despite pleading in his Defence that they were business acquaintances, that he regarded Sir Owen as a potential investor/business associate, that they were not good friends and that when they arranged to meet they always did so to discuss business matters, accepted in his witness statement that the relationship was a friendly one (although based on their business relationship), and in oral evidence that by January 2012 they were certainly friends.  </p>

All of this indicates a social relationship that went beyond a merely business or commercial one.  Mr Watson himself explained in his witness statement that his business dealings depend on personal connections, that it helps if there is a good rapport with the individuals he is dealing with, and that he used social and informal occasions such as a round of golf or a lunch or dinner to discuss business.  That suggests (and the evidence in this case amply bears this out) that Mr Watson makes a practice of cultivating personal relationships with those he thinks he might be able to do business with; there is nothing very surprising or unusual in that, and I see no reason to think that it was any different with Sir Owen.  It is not really in dispute that their relationship could be described as that of friends, and I do not think it matters whether or not it could be said to be that of close or good friends.  </p>

Mr Watson was one of the original investors, as was Mr Hersov, and when in early 2011 Red Mountain was looking to raise additional capital for further acquisitions, Mr Watson and Mr Hersov each drew up lists of potential investors who could be approached.  Sir Owen was one of those on Mr Hersov’s list and Mr Hersov sent him a teaser on 9 March 2011, followed by a call the next day, and thought he could invest a large amount.  Mr Watson followed this up on 14 March with an e-mail to Sir Owen encouraging him to pursue it (which he described as <span style="font-style:italic">“co-investing”</span>), and offering him the analysis that had been done by <span style="font-style:italic">“Miles, who works with us”</span> (a reference to Mr Leahy); Sir Owen’s response was that Mr Miller was looking at it for him, and Mr Watson then gave Mr Miller contact details for Mr Leahy, commenting that it looked like a very good deal.  Mr Miller did look at it for him, speaking to Mr Leahy, and on 17 March e-mailed Sir Owen with a recommendation not to invest, to which Sir Owen replied that he agreed, and asked him to tell Mr Hersov.  Mr Miller sent an e-mail to Mr Leahy, copying in Mr Watson and Mr Hersov, which made it clear that it was Sir Owen’s decision not to proceed.</p>

Mr Dickson’s advice was that it was a gamble in an industry Sir Watson was unfamiliar with; the advice from Lazards was also unfavourable; and on 21 June Sir Owen e-mailed Mr Watson and Mr Hersov again declining to invest, on the grounds that there were too many uncertainties for his liking.  He told Mr Miller of his decision not to invest two days later.  On 28 June Mr Hersov tried again, asking Sir Owen to have a call with him and Mr Watson, to which Sir Owen replied that he had informed them he was not interested in the venture.  </p>

Mr Miller told Mr Leahy that they would proceed on this basis, and the paperwork was completed by Mr Dickson in the name of Kea (then a subsidiary of Pacifico and an asset of the Regency Trust) on 20 July.

In autumn 2009 he was told that Mr Astor, who was then managing a portfolio of ground rents for Mr Victor Tchenguiz, wanted to set up his own business.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Watson had a meeting with Mr Astor and was attracted by the idea of investing in ground rents, or to be more precise, in freehold reversions on leasehold residential properties.  Where a housebuilder sells residential properties on a long leasehold basis, it will retain a freehold reversion.  This is standard on the sale of flats, but had also become more common with houses.  The freehold reversion will carry the right to the ground rent reserved by the lease: in the Business Plan referred to below it was said that the ground rent is typically 10-25 basis points (that is 0.1% to 0.25%) of the leasehold value of the property, usually subject to periodic reviews, on an upwards only basis, either linked to inflation (via RPI or the capital value of the property) or increased by a fixed amount (for example doubling at each review).  So for example on a sale of a property at a premium of £100,000 the initial ground rent might be anything from £100 to £250 pa, but if doubling every 20 years would reach £1600 to £4000 after 80 years.  The owner of a freehold can also derive ancillary income from the property such as fees for granting consent under the lease, or for registering transfers, or premiums on the grant of extensions to the lease.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The practice of selling new houses on a leasehold basis has much more recently become politically controversial because some housebuyers have found themselves trapped into expensive contracts whose terms they may not have fully appreciated, and which may make their properties difficult to sell.  What particularly struck Mr Watson back in 2009/10 however was the fact that for the reversioner the ground rents were a very secure form of income, because leaseholders risk having their leases forfeited if they do not pay and hence in practice do not default.  (And if a leaseholder is unable to pay, his mortgagee will usually pay to avoid losing its security; if neither pays, the freeholder receives a windfall by recovering vacant possession).  He was also struck by the fact that a freehold has a reversionary value that increases over time; and it was also clear to him that by aggregating ground rents it was possible to securitise the income streams at a much lower yield (that is at a much higher value) than they had been acquired at.  If for example it was possible to acquire ground rents at a “19x multiple” (that is for a capital sum of 19 times the annual rent roll) and securitise them, or sell them, at a 23x multiple (not unrealistic), then significant profits could be made, especially if the acquisition was highly leveraged.  </p>

He had a prospective partner called Mr James Aumonier, a property developer.  They needed capital however, which they did not have, and were looking for investors to invest £10m.  Mr Watson found a contact of his, Mr Neil Richardson, who was willing to invest on the terms that Mr Watson wanted, namely that Mr Richardson would not only invest himself but provide the funds for Mr Watson to do so, the profits being split equally.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The documentation for this (codenamed Project Attila) was completed in March 2010.  A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Abacus Land 1 LLP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Abacus 1”</span>) was incorporated in February 2010, and an LLP Agreement dated 17 March 2010 was entered into which set out the basis on which Abacus 1 was to be operated.  There were three Members of the LLP: two were “InvestorCos”, that is BVI companies associated with the two “Investors”, Mr Richardson and Mr Watson, respectively (namely Berryblue Enterprises Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Berryblue”</span>) for Mr Richardson and Gaucin International Holdings Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Gaucin”</span>) for Mr Watson, held by the Summit Trust (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Summit”</span>), a trust associated with him), and the third was Attila (GR1) LLP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Attila GR1”</span>), an LLP owned by the “Managers” (Mr Astor, Mr Aumonier and an associate of theirs, Mr Aldred Drummond) and which enabled them to share in the profits of the business (after a specified return to the InvestorCos) by way of management carry.  Abacus 1’s business was to be the acquisition, holding and disposal of portfolios of residential freehold and long leasehold interests for the purpose of investing in underlying ground rent income.  A Business Plan annexed to the agreement shows that the aim was to acquire a £40m portfolio, funded by an investment of £10m from Mr Richardson and Mr Watson and £30m of bank lending, and by cl 11.2 of the agreement Berryblue and Gaucin agreed to make available an aggregate of £10m of funding by way of capital contributions.  Messrs Astor, Aumonier and Drummond did not provide significant capital (they were to contribute £200,000 through Attila GR1), but they were to provide (through a company called Attila Asset Management Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“AAM”</span>) and in return for fees) such services as identifying opportunities for acquiring ground rents, conducting due diligence on potential acquisitions, arranging financing and instructing property managers.  As this shows AAM was not itself to provide property management (collecting the ground rents and the like), but it was envisaged by cl 4.7 that the parties might in due course set up their own property management and services company in which case it would be owned one-third each by Berryblue, Gaucin and AAM, and would be paid fees for providing property management services; in July 2010 such a company, called Homeground Management Ltd, was duly set up, with Berryblue and Gaucin each owning one-third of the shares (Mr Astor and Mr Aumonier alone appear to have owned the balance).  </p>

It can be seen that the Managers had a number of sources of possible receipts: as well as a return on Attila GR1’s own modest capital contribution, they would benefit primarily from fees to be paid to AAM for their services, but secondarily from the management carry, and in addition have the possibility of owning one-third of a property management and services company which would be paid further fees.  </p>

This involved the establishment of a limited partnership (LP) in Guernsey called Abacus Land 2 LP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Abacus 2”</span>), and Berryblue, Gaucin and Attila GR1 becoming limited partners on the terms of an LP Agreement dated 24 March 2011.  At the same time Berryblue put up another £8m, £4m by way of loan to Abacus 2 and £4m by way of loan to Gaucin which Gaucin loaned in turn to Abacus 2.  A similar exercise took place in June 2011 when a further Guernsey LP called Abacus Land 3 LP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Abacus 3”</span>) was established with the same partners: I do not think I was specifically told why this was thought necessary or desirable, but Mr Watson’s evidence was that he did not understand these restructurings to affect the nature of the investment.  Although split into Abacus 1, 2 and 3 in this way, it is not generally necessary to distinguish between them and I will refer to them together as <span style="font-weight:bold">“Abacus”</span>.  (There was in due course an Abacus 4 but it is convenient to use “Abacus” to refer to Abacus 1, 2 and 3 only). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Watson was also interested in another type of property-backed investment, which was referred to as “affordable housing”.  This involved the acquisition of a stock of housing and the leasing of it to providers of social housing (local authorities or housing associations) for subletting to occupiers.  The acquisition might take the form of a purchase of existing stock belonging to local authorities and housing associations; or a purchase of the affordable housing component of new private sector developments; or a joint venture with a local authority to develop new housing on land belonging to the local authority.  In each case the housing would be leased to the local authority or housing association on terms that would provide an index-linked return on the capital provided by the investor.  The yield that could be thus obtained was both higher than could be obtained on local government bonds, and more secure.</p>

It was suggested to Mr Watson in cross-examination that this indicated that HW was expecting him to invest as referred to under the Investment Amount, but he said that his understanding was that he had a right to invest not an obligation to do so.  I agree with Mr Watson on this.  Leaving aside the point that the Term Sheet was not legally binding in any event, its wording is far from precise but it does seem clear that the Investment Amount provision by itself did not commit Mr Watson to anything, as it refers to a <span style="font-style:italic">right</span> to participate in <span style="font-style:italic">up</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">to</span> 20%.  In those circumstances I do not regard the reference under Founder Investors’ commitment as converting this into an obligation, not least because there is also a reference to the Affordable Housing Commitment under the <span style="font-style:italic">“Management team commitment”</span> and the management team was not committed to do anything.  In draft advice given to HW by K&amp;L Gates LLP in December 2011 they noted that certain individuals would collectively have the right (but not requirement) to invest pari passu with HW up to 20% in aggregate of the total HW investment, and that <span style="font-style:italic">“It is not yet known whether any of the Individuals will take up this right.”</span>  I infer that that probably reflected HW’s understanding in December 2011, and no doubt from April 2011.</p>

On the face of it that would entitle both HW and Mr Watson to a share in the whole of the business.  But that does not seem to have been the contemporary understanding of the parties.  Everyone proceeded as if HW was at that stage only interested in the affordable housing side of the business, not the ground rents; and the position with Mr Watson can be seen from an e-mail exchange he had with Mr Gibson on 20 April 2011.  Mr Watson wanted to make sure that if the ground rent business expanded (so that it was not relying solely on him and Mr Richardson) the shareholders in Atlantic other than HW would have a share in its management, and indeed he wanted to be joined in the management of all ventures including ground rents going forward.  Mr Gibson however said that he had sat down with Mr Astor the previous week and not pressed too hard on this point.  They (Messrs Astor and Aumonier) were ok with what was proposed with affordable housing, but it would require some pressure to lock them in on everything going forward.  That seems to me to indicate that nothing had at that stage been agreed about Mr Watson’s share in future ground rent business.  Mr Watson’s evidence was that although he wanted a share in the management company profits and carry from both the ground rent and affordable housing investments, the issue on ground rents was that if he acquired a share in AAM, he would have to disclose it to Mr Richardson, who could have prevented him.</p>

By then the process of drafting and agreeing the long-form documents for Project Atlantic had begun: Mr Astor had circulated the commercial terms for what was then called the Atlantic Regeneration Fund on 29 November 2011, indicating that the then intention was that HW and Mr Watson would become equal partners with Mr Astor and Mr Aumonier, with Mr Drummond selling his stake; and a first draft of a Shareholders’ Agreement relating to Long Harbour dated 9 December 2011 referred to Mr Watson (as well as Messrs Astor and Aumonier, and an HW vehicle) as a shareholder.  Mr Mark Flay (then the Finance Director of Cullen Investments Ltd in New Zealand) suggested to Mr Watson on 12 December that his 25% be put under a new trust rather than in his personal name, to which Mr Gibson replied <span style="font-style:italic">“Agree re Entity vs personal name… we are still working on which one this will be, I will let you know once finalised”</span>; and by 20 December the proposed shareholder in Long Harbour was being referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">“Eric Watson’s vehicle”</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The proposed structure involved a Jersey Unit Trust.  That meant that both the Jersey lawyers involved (Mourants) and the trust operator (Aztec) would need to disclose information on the shareholders and directors of Long Harbour to the Jersey Financial Services Commission.  On 21 December Mr Gibson produced a short biography of Mr Watson for this purpose, Mr Astor explaining that it would be needed as Mr Watson was a shareholder of Long Harbour, or UBO, to which Mr Gibson replied that at the moment they were looking at a structure where the UBO was a family member of Mr Watson’s.  On 23 December Mr Astor said that although Mr Watson was neither a director or shareholder, since he was clearly arranging the deal it was best to disclose his involvement up front and asked for information in particular about two historic matters (Blue Star and Hanover) involving Mr Watson.  This was provided but by 31 December Mr Reuben was referring to a decision having been made <span style="font-style:italic">“to delay Eric’s vehicle taking up its interest in Long Harbour to post close”</span>, and on 4 January to the intention of the parties that Mr Watson’s vehicle would come alongside when able to do so, adding that he appreciated that this was <span style="font-style:italic">“subject to any constraints arising from Jersey regulatory matters”</span>; on the same day he told Mr Simpson of Grant Thornton (who was providing tax advice to Mr Watson) that there was a Jersey regulatory issue if Mr Watson were to hold a direct interest in the Long Harbour shares, and that only an ultimate discretionary trust holding would be acceptable.  Draft 4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement on 5 January therefore omitted any reference to Mr Watson, the shareholders now being Messrs Astor and Aumonier and Atlantic Property Management Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“APM”</span>, an HW entity), but a draft Joint Venture Agreement to which EWV (an unspecified Eric Watson vehicle) would be party recited the intention that EWV would be entitled to subscribe for shares in Long Harbour so that all parties would hold 25% each.</p>

These were that Long Harbour itself would have no right to management carry, and would not therefore generate value, being initially a cost centre, and that the agreed split (of the carry) would be dealt with in the JV agreement, the good news being that the JV agreement had nothing to do with the Jersey regulators.  When Project Atlantic closed therefore on 17 February 2012 (at the same time as Project Edsel (below)), the Shareholders’ Agreement was made between Mr Astor, Mr Aumonier and APM, reciting that APM would become a 25% shareholder in Long Harbour (with Messrs Astor and Aumonier holding 37.5% each), and the JV Agreement (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the Ladoga JV Agreement”</span>) was made between these three and Ladoga.  The JV Agreement no longer recited an intention that Ladoga would be entitled to subscribe for shares, but contained a provision that any future carried or profit-related interests relating to any transaction involving Long Harbour should be divided equally between the four parties to the agreement, Long Harbour itself not being entitled to participate in any carried interests.

By August Sir Owen had met Mr Astor and there had been discussion of a deal under which Sir Owen would make an investment in ground rents when the sale of OTSLG took place (which at that stage was expected to complete in October).  The proposal was that of a total investment of £20m, Sir Owen’s entity would put in £10m itself and lend £9m to Mr Watson’s entity, Mr Watson’s entity putting in the £9m borrowed and a further £1m of its own.  Mr Gibson took this forward with Mr Miller and in an e-mail of 23 August explained that the division of the profit (after costs and expenses) would be a return of capital together with a Preferred Investor return of 8% pa, and then a split of 75% to investors and 25% to management – in other words the proposed deal was similar in structure to the existing arrangement Mr Watson had with Mr Richardson, except the 8% return was rather lower than the 12.75% return agreed with Mr Richardson.  In due course draft agreements were prepared showing that the proposed structure was to use another Guernsey LP (to be named Abacus Land 4 LP).  Sir Owen was keen on the proposal, telling Mr Miller on 24 August (copying in Mr Dickson, Mr Astor, Mr Watson and Mr Gibson) that: </p>

It was not until 25 November that Sir Owen told Mr Watson that the Mancap deal was back on track, and would take another 2 months to finalise; on 21 December he told Mr Watson that he was aiming for a close by 10 January and asked if the Astor deal was still on the cards.

On 9 January Mr Flay circulated to Mr Leahy, Mr Gibson and Mr Watson a draft Term Sheet to give effect to these terms, referring now to a loan of £5.3m from OGV to a Watson vehicle (EWV) and a preferred return of 8%, with OGV having an effective 50% equity participation in EWV after repayment of the funding.  In a covering e-mail Mr Flay explained that OGV could either take a 50% interest in EWV, or since <span style="font-style:italic">“there may be optical reasons (i.e. OGV visibility) that you may not want to go down this path”</span>, OGV could receive the 50% through some sort of super interest linked to the funding. </p>

On 9 January Mr Leahy had told Mr Aumonier that Mr Watson would be investing his full 20% and asked him to update the IM (information memorandum) presentation (this had been produced by AAM in November 2011).

He then e-mailed Mr Leahy (copying in Mr Watson) saying he would need to have some sort of answer for Mr Astor when he called him that night.  Mr Astor also e-mailed Mr Leahy on 10 January asking him to confirm that they were not intending to circulate the IM to any external third parties, as the information was highly confidential and they would need to have very strict confidentiality agreements signed beforehand.

But it was plainly misleading to refer to it as just for internal use, as (as he accepted) he was intending to produce a pack of information to send to a third party.  Mr Leahy’s explanation was in effect that it was not his role to decide what Mr Watson did or did not disclose to Mr Astor: he was very conscious of the fact that in Mr Watson’s business relationships were very important, so he wouldn’t want to go and put his foot in it and go into more detail than was his place to do.  </p>

(In fact Mr Leahy had sent him that morning the draft Term Sheet referring to OGV having an effective 50% participation in the net equity of EWV post repayment of the Funding Arrangement).  Mr Leahy, in answer to the suggestion he was asking Mr Gibson to tell Mr Astor something that was untrue, accepted that the draft Term Sheet at the time contemplated that effectively Sir Owen’s vehicle would be taking an equity interest, and that <span style="font-style:italic">“that was not what was being communicated at that point in time”</span>, and said that he was suggesting to Mr Gibson that he not give the full picture at this stage; Mr Gibson, rather more simply, said that he had to accept that the explanation wasn’t true, and that the arrangement in the Term Sheet was one that did contemplate Sir Owen as an equity investor.  </p>

I am not sure this was put in terms to Mr Watson; but on any view Mr Leahy and Mr Gibson were acting for Mr Watson’s interests and their reluctance to answer simple questions from Mr Astor and Mr Aumonier in a straightforward way is, I find, illustrative of a tendency to be secretive which accurately reflected the way Mr Watson liked to operate.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The investment discussion document was a 3-page presentation prepared by Mr Leahy.  It described Project Edsel as an affordable housing opportunity providing a high quality inflation-linked 60-year income stream guaranteed by LBBD and with debt funding offers already in place for 70% of the project cost, the balance to come from equity investors.  The arrangement proposed was an investment of £5.3m, of which 10% (£0.53m) would come from Mr Watson or his nominee and 90% (£4.77m) from Sir Owen or his nominee.  The £5.3m represented 20% of the total equity needed of £26.5m, the other 80% coming from HW.  The proposed structure was that the £4.77m and £0.53m would go into an Owen Glenn vehicle (OGV), which would then fund an Eric Watson vehicle (EWV) with the full £5.3m; EWV would then participate alongside HW as an Equity Investor in an English LP.  The LP would have an Asset Management Agreement with AAM and pay it management and performance fees, and after debt servicing and management fees, the Equity Investors would receive an 8% preferred return (which would be passed up by EWV to OGV).  Any upside over that would be shared 50/50 with EWV.  A note under Equity Investor Returns showed that after the 8% hurdle was achieved AAM would receive performance fees of between 20% and 25%.  A worked example was included which assumed debt of £53.46m, equity investment of £26.51m and sales proceeds of £103.96m.  After (i) repaying the debt, fees and interest, (ii) returning the £26.5m capital to the Equity Investors (of which £5.3m would go to EWV and thence back to OGV) and (iii) paying interest at 8% to the Equity Investors totalling £5.04m (of which £1.01m would go to OGV), there would be £17.19m left.  This would be sufficient to trigger the higher 25% performance fee for AAM, which would take £4.29m, leaving £12.89m for the Equity Investors, of which OGV would receive 10% (£1.29m) – this is only 10% not 20% as the upside after return of capital and interest was to be split 50/50 with EWV.  The upshot was that OGV would receive back £7.6m in all for an outlay of £5.3m or a total return of £2.3m.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This presentation therefore makes it clear in two places that there are performance fees payable to management, without any suggestion that OGV would share in them.  A careful reading would also have made it clear that the performance fees could be substantial – in the worked example £4.29m as compared with the £2.3m total return for OGV.  Mr McCaughran suggested to Sir Owen (who accepted that he read this document) that he must have appreciated these points, but despite initially accepting that it was likely that he read it with some care, Sir Owen said that he did not scrutinise the document, leaving it to Miller and Dickson, mainly Miller.  I accept this evidence, but it can be said that the document fairly discloses the existence and extent of the performance fees or management carry.  On the other hand, it does not disclose that Mr Watson had any interest in the carry, although he accepted in cross-examination that at that stage he expected to have a pro rata share with management, or about a quarter.</p>

	      <span style="font-style:normal">This is the evolution of the deals with Astor, ground rents and govt properties.  This deal is the first of the govt/local authority residential property deals. HWL (Hutchison Whampoa listed hk group market cap $40b) have committed to fund the equity for the rollout.  Oxford University funds are funding the capital for the ground rent investments.  I have a right to co invest in both, and given the quality and pipeline of deals and co investors plus, the fact that all the equity and debt is arranged I am very keen to do so.  We also have a small stake in the management carry for pulling the deal together.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Several of the witnesses were asked about the final sentence.  Sir Owen accepted that he did not understand Mr Watson to be suggesting, by the use of the word <span style="font-style:italic">“We”</span>, that he (Sir Owen) or his vehicle would share in the management carry.  In fact he had never encountered a management carry in his business life, and although he understood with hindsight that it was a reference to the performance fee payable to the management, he made the point that Mr Watson did not specify what a small stake was, and that he did not understand that it would be disproportionate to the investment.  He accepted however that he did not question it: he was talking to Mr Miller, and if he had questions he would question Mr Miller.  Mr Miller said that he didn’t think they really knew what percentage of the management carry Mr Watson was going to get, but that he wasn’t overly worried about the participants and what they would get out of the management carry.  What was important was who was managing the project and could they do it.  He saw Mr Watson as the <span style="font-style:italic">“prime mover”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“leader”</span> of this project.  Mr Watson, when asked if he regarded this as disclosure of his interest said that he regarded it as <span style="font-style:italic">“preliminary disclosure”</span>, and that he thought full disclosure was made by Mr Gibson to Mr Miller.  He did not accept that the use of the word <span style="font-style:italic">“We”</span> was intended to mislead; and he justified the reference to a <span style="font-style:italic">“small stake”</span> both by saying that 23% was small compared to 100%, and that as a percentage of overall profits it was around 5%.  When it was put to him that it was in fact considerably larger than the return to Kea, he said that the management return was very significant because the deal was so successful.  That answer I think slightly missed the point in that so long as the profits were sufficient to trigger the higher level of management fee (then 25%), the <span style="font-style:italic">proportion</span> in which the profits were split would not change however large they were, although of course the absolute figures would.  Nor do I think he was right in saying his stake was 23%; his pleaded case is that his share was not 23% but 28.18%, which would appear to be correct (see below), and 28.18% does not seem to me a small stake.  But it does not ultimately matter as the relevant question is whether this was a full disclosure of his interest which it plainly was not.</p>

On 6 February Mr Gibson e-mailed Mr Miller attaching what he described as the proposed Affordable Housing Structure Chart.  This showed a Trust at the top, an offshore company, a UK company, a Jersey LP and another LP, and Mr Gibson identified the relevant entities in his e-mail.  Mr Miller replied that Kea would be the entity from their side, and sent Mr Gibson a structure chart that he had created, based on Mr Gibson’s but with the names put in, and asked him to confirm it was correct, which Mr Gibson did on 7 February.  Mr Miller’s structure chart, headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Project Edsel Diagram of Investment Entities”</span> showed Kea and Clearview (a Jersey Trust established by Stonehage, and described by Mr Gibson as <span style="font-style:italic">“Eric’s entity”</span>, the trustee being Novatrust and the beneficiaries Mr Watson, his children and issue and others) at the top; each of Kea and Clearview holding 50% of a BVI company called Copperstone Property Investments Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Copperstone”</span>); Copperstone holding 100% of a Jersey LP called Streamside Jersey LP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Streamside”</span>), in part directly and in part via a UK company called Foreshore Investment Holdings Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Foreshore”</span>); and Streamside holding 20% of an English LP called Atlantic Regeneration Investment 1 LP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Atlantic 1”</span>).  It also showed capital repayments as going direct from Streamside to Copperstone, but the income as going from Streamside to Foreshore and from Foreshore to Copperstone (as Mr Miller accepted in cross-examination).  Ms Jones drew my attention to the fact that there was no suggestion on the diagram that Streamside would have any other interest in Atlantic 1.  </p>

It required all the relevant parties to transmit funds to K&amp;L Gates’ client account, where they would be dealt with in accordance with a letter of undertaking from K&amp;L Gates.  The amount required from Streamside was £1,901,546.81 as its subscription for its interests in Atlantic 1, made up of £1,894,501.81 for its A interest and £7,045 for its B interest (as set out in the formal documentation (below) the A interest carried the entitlement to repayment of the investment with interest and profits, and the B interest Mr Watson’s share of the management carry).  In order to fund this, on 16 February the directors of Copperstone passed a resolution to contribute the sum of £1,901,600 to Streamside as a capital contribution under the terms of the Streamside LP Agreement.  That enabled Mr Reuben of Fladgates to send the £1,901,546.81 on 16 February to K&amp;L Gates (to be held to his order) on behalf of Streamside.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Closure duly took place on 17 February, and the sums in K&amp;L Gates’ client account were dealt with in accordance with its letter of undertaking.  Among other things that meant that £7,045 of the money sent by Mr Reuben was used by K&amp;L Gates to subscribe for Streamside’s B interest in accordance with an Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Deed for Atlantic 1, which was the primary vehicle for Project Edsel.  This provided for two A limited partners (Atlantic Regeneration Investment Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“ARI”</span>), which was the vehicle for HW’s investment, and Streamside, the vehicle for Sir Owen’s and Mr Watson’s investment), and a number of B limited partners (Messrs Astor, Aumonier, Drummond and Noble, and Streamside).  Each A partner agreed to make an immediate capital contribution (some £6.7m in the case of ARI and £1,894,501.81 in the case of Streamside) and commit to further capital contributions (some £3.2m in the case of Streamside), and each B partner agreed to make much smaller capital contributions, £7,045 each in the case of Streamside, Mr Astor and Mr Aumonier and lesser sums in the case of Mr Drummond and Mr Noble, the B contributions totalling £25,000 in all.  Under a provision dealing with partnership returns, the A partners were entitled to repayment of their investments with interest at 8% and further profits were then split between A and B interests, the initial split being 78.08% (A) to 21.92% (B), but so long as the A investors had received back at least 1.35 times their investment, the split would be 72.75% (A) to 27.75% (B).  The profits payable to the B partners would be split between themselves in proportion to their capital contributions, so Streamside’s B interest would entitle it to 7,045 / 25,000 or 28.18% of the B interest profits.</p>

Then on 24 February JP Morgan transferred £530,000 to Fladgates’ client account: JP Morgan had agreed to lend this as a personal loan to Mr Watson, the payment to Fladgates being treated as a loan by Mr Watson to Clearview, and a contribution by Clearview to Copperstone.  The sum of £530,000 was then returned to Kea on 10 April 2012.  By 16 April 2012 Copperstone had its own bank account and Mr Gibson asked Mr Reuben to transfer the remaining balance to it, which he agreed to do.  The balance on the Fladgates account was then £3,325,498.19, which equated to the £5.3m introduced by Kea and Clearview less the £1,894,501.81 transferred to K&amp;L Gates for Streamside’s A interest and £80,000 for Fladgates’ fees.  </p>

These included a draft shareholders’ agreement for Copperstone which provided for 2 classes of shares, 100 A shares to be held equally by Kea and Clearview, and 1 B share to be held by Clearview.  Mr Maislish had a meeting with Mr Miller (who had come over to London) that afternoon, and that evening Mr Miller called Mr Gibson and asked for an explanation of the A and B interests, from which it seems probable that Mr Maislish had asked Mr Miller for an explanation but he had been unable to give one.  Mr Gibson told Mr Miller on the telephone that the A interests related to the investment in Project Edsel, and the B interests to entitlement of part of the management company for <span style="font-style:italic">“Cullen/Nucopia” </span>interests for putting the deal together, referring him to the split in the financial model originally provided; and in an e-mail later that evening repeated that the A interests related to the investment of the transaction (HW’s 80% and Copperstone’s 20%) and were entitled to the 8% initial investor return, and then between 78.02% and 72.25% of the project profits; the B interests related to the management company entitlement <span style="font-style:italic">“of which Nucopia Partners have a portion of for putting the deal together/bringing in HWL and the ability to co-invest against”</span>.  He attached a model from the due diligence folder, showing how profits were split between investors and management.  Mr Miller and Mr Maislish both attended a meeting the next morning at Fladgates’ offices, and from notes made by them (undated but almost certainly made at this meeting) it seems clear that a similar explanation was given.  Both notes refer to the order of repayments with monies first being used to repay the investors their principal and interest at 8% and any other capital advances, and profits then being split between investors and management, Mr Miller’s note giving the split as A 80% / B 20% and Mr Maislish’s rather more detailed note giving the split as either A 80% / B 20% or A 75% / B 25% <span style="font-style:italic">“after 1.35”</span> which is a reference to the increased share for management once the investors’ returns had reached 1.35 times their investment; Mr Miller’s note also shows the A interests flowing through to Kea and Clearview, but the B interest only to Clearview with the note <span style="font-style:italic">“Only CT has ‘B’ shares”</span>.   </p>

Dividends were to be paid to the A and B shareholders in respect of Copperstone’s interests (via Streamside) in Atlantic 1 as A Limited Partner and B Limited Partner respectively.  In other words, the profits from Copperstone’s participation as an investor in Project Edsel would be split equally between Kea and Clearview, but the profits from Mr Watson’s interest in the management carry would all go to Clearview.  </p>

That may be because (as in the case of solicitor and client, or principal and agent) B has himself put his affairs in the hands of A; or it may be because (as in the case of trustee and beneficiary, or receivers, administrators and the like) A has agreed, and/or been appointed, to act for B’s benefit.  In each case however the nature of the relationship is such that B can expect A in colloquial language to be on his side.  That is why the distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty, the principal being entitled to <span style="font-style:italic">“the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary”</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">Mothew</span> at 18A): someone who has agreed to act in the interests of another has to put the interests of that other first.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">That was not in fact a case about fiduciary duties but about promissory estoppel, but I do not think that detracts from the force of what Lord Walker says, or from its good sense.  Parties negotiating for a contract are normally entitled to act in their own interests and are not obliged to have regard to the interests of the other party, and it takes particular circumstances before fiduciary duties are to be imposed on them.  Mr McCaughran said that in the case of negotiations for a joint venture such cases were very rare, the only example he had found being <span style="font-style:italic">Murad</span>.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Murad</span> the claimants were two sisters who lived abroad and looked to the defendant, a Mr Al-Saraj, to make appropriate recommendations and assist them in connection with investments in England; they had no relevant experience, had no knowledge of the arrangements made by the defendant with third parties, and entrusted him with extensive discretion to act in matters affecting their interests.  They were, in the words of Etherton J <span style="font-style:italic">“wholly dependent” </span>on him for his advice and recommendation, the negotiations with the vendors, and the instruction of professionals on their behalf, including in relation to the structure of the transaction and documentation; see at [328], [332].  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that most of the authorities I was referred to were dealing not with the question whether a fiduciary duty arose in the <span style="font-style:italic">negotiation</span> of a joint venture, but with the different question whether a fiduciary duty arose in the <span style="font-style:italic">operation</span> of the joint venture; that different considerations apply in the two situations; and that it takes particular facts before the Court will conclude that one party to a negotiation (itself usually a situation where the parties’ interests are divergent) owes a fiduciary duty to the other party.  Ms Jones put forward <span style="font-style:italic">Longstaff v Birtles </span>[2001] EWCA Civ 1219 as another example where a fiduciary duty was owed in a negotiation, but that was a case where the defendants had formerly acted as solicitors to the claimants.  That relationship, being one of solicitor and client, was undoubtedly a fiduciary one which gave rise to a relationship of trust and confidence, and the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision was that that relationship of trust and confidence did not cease on the termination of the retainer (see per Mummery LJ at [35]).  Once that had been held to be the position, it was entirely orthodox to hold that the solicitors continued to owe fiduciary duties to their former clients which affected their negotiations with them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I will add one further point here.  The reference in the cases (such as <span style="font-style:italic">John v James</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> Mothew</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Longstaff v Birtles</span>) to a relationship of <span style="font-style:italic">“trust and confidence”</span> does not mean that every relationship in which one party trusts the other is a fiduciary relationship.  Contracting parties usually do trust each other – indeed they would be unlikely to do business with each other if they did not – but this does not mean that they owe each other the duties which are peculiar to fiduciaries.  What I think is meant by a relationship of trust and confidence in this context is where one party places himself, or is placed, in the position where he trusts and confides that the other party will act exclusively in the first party’s interests.  If the concept of trust and confidence is not confined in this way, it seems to me to cease to be of any utility in determining whether a fiduciary duty is owed: cf the recent decision of Leggatt LJ (at first instance) in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheikh Al Nehayan v Kent </span>[2018] EWHC 333 (Comm) (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Al Nehayan”</span>) at [164]-[165].  This judgment, which contains a valuable analysis of the whole question of fiduciary duties (see at [153ff]), was not available at the time of the hearing, but it contains nothing with which I disagree, and on this particular point seems to me plainly right, and I have not thought it necessary to ask for the parties’ further submissions on it. </p>

As set out above (paragraphs 62 to 63) this was not really in dispute.  I do not however see that this by itself is of any real significance.  Some of the cases do refer to parties having a close personal relationship in considering whether fiduciary duties are owed (see eg <span style="font-style:italic">Wetherspoon </span>at [77]-[78]), and those who have a good personal relationship may naturally be more inclined to place trust and confidence in each other; but it is also no doubt very common for friends to do business with each other without the relationship being one where fiduciary duties are owed (see eg <span style="font-style:italic">Cullen </span>at [261]-[266] where Barling J held that despite the personal friendship between Mr Watson and Mr Brown, the arrangements were formal, commercial and at arms’ length and no supplementary fiduciary obligations were owed).<span style="font-style:italic"> </span> Friends may act for each other in such a way as to owe fiduciary obligations, but friends may equally be no more than contracting counterparties.</p>

I accept that Sir Owen had no particular experience in property, but he was very far from naïve; he was a very experienced businessman, Mr Watson at one stage referring to him having <span style="font-style:italic">“probably bought and sold more companies than I have had hot dinners”</span>.  The relevant question it seems to me is not so much what relevant experience he had, but whether as a result he relied on Mr Watson to look after his interests in this respect.  One can compare the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Murad</span> where the claimants were not only inexperienced but wholly dependent on the defendant and entirely in his hands (see paragraph 132 above).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones submitted that Mr Watson took advantage of Sir Owen’s lack of relevant expertise to put himself forward to look after his interests.  She referred to Mr Watson’s acceptance in evidence that he was recommending deals to them, and giving his opinion to Sir Owen on the suitability of investments such as ground rents for the trust; to Sir Owen’s reference to Mr Watson’s offer to <span style="font-style:italic">“watchdog my investments”</span> (paragraph 92 above), in respect of which Mr Watson said in evidence that he assumed that if Sir Owen was going to invest in ground rents, <span style="font-style:italic">“we would certainly be keeping an eye on it for all of us in general, including him”</span>; and to Mr Miller’s reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“other vetted investment projects”</span> (paragraph 107 above), and his agreement in oral evidence that the vetted investments meant that he was relying on Mr Watson to help him and Sir Owen, who were novices in the area, understand whether the projects were good and suitable.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again however I think caution is needed.  There is no doubt that Mr Watson was putting forward, indeed pushing, various proposals for Sir Owen to invest in, on the basis that he and his team had looked at them, and that they were very valuable.  To that extent it could no doubt be said that he was <span style="font-style:italic">“recommending investments”</span> and that they were being put forward as <span style="font-style:italic">“vetted”</span> by him and his team, but the same is likely to be the case whenever one party is trying to persuade another to invest in a proposed venture.  Indeed his actual answer when asked to confirm that he was recommending investments for the trust monies was:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.30in;text-indent:-0.08in">“Yes, I am promoting deals, selling deals, recommending deals to them, yes.” </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">That looks much more like an acceptance that what he was doing was pitching opportunities to Sir Owen, rather than advising him.  It does not follow from the fact that Mr Watson was recommending deals in this way that Sir Owen was relying on Mr Watson to advise him, or entrusting him with discretions, or otherwise placing himself in Mr Watson’s hands, or trusting him to act with single-minded loyalty in his (Sir Owen’s) interests rather than his own.  And I also accept Mr Watson’s explanation of the offer to <span style="font-style:italic">“watchdog” </span>Sir Owen’s investments: if Sir Owen were persuaded to invest alongside him, his and Mr Watson’s interests would be aligned and it would be natural for Mr Watson to keep an eye on how they were performing.  That does not seem to me to amount to the assumption of a responsibility to put Sir Owen’s interests first, or turn the relationship into one where fiduciary duties were owed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this aspect of the case I prefer the submissions of Mr McCaughran.  These were in effect that Sir Owen did not trust Mr Watson to be acting exclusively in his interests, or rely on him to protect them.  Instead he was anxious that the investments promoted by Mr Watson should be properly scrutinised by his own advisers.  Thus when Mr Watson first proposed the Red Mountain investment, Sir Owen asked Mr Miller to look at it for him, and then accepted Mr Miller’s recommendation against investing; he accepted in oral evidence that his usual way of operating when a deal was proposed for the trust was to ask Mr Miller to look at it for him, do due diligence and assess it for him (paragraph 64 above).  When Mr Watson tried again, Sir Owen asked both Mr Dickson and a contact at Lazards to advise him, and on their advice again declined to invest (paragraph 65 above).  When Mr Watson proposed the investment in ground rents in the summer of 2011, Sir Owen was keen and said he was looking to invest £50m in the venture <span style="font-style:italic">“subject to our due diligence”</span> (paragraph 92 above); Mr Astor did provide a significant amount information to Mr Miller for him to assess (paragraph 93 above); and Sir Owen confirmed in evidence that before the Mancap transaction went off Mr Miller was engaged in that process and reporting back to him.  In relation to Project Edsel, when it was first proposed by Mr Watson in January 2012, Sir Owen asked Mr Miller to have a look at it (paragraph 96 above); when the investment discussion document was provided, Sir Owen said that he left it to Messrs Miller and Dickson, mostly Mr Miller (paragraph 103 above); and Sir Owen only agreed to proceed after Mr Miller had said that it was a good project and the risk was low, and Mr Dickson that it was very promising (paragraph 107 above).  In relation to Project Drive, Sir Owen asked Mr Tony Holt, another adviser of his, to look at the figures and put together a team to conduct due diligence (paragraph 108 above); Sir Owen accepted in evidence that it was on the basis of Mr Holt’s analysis that <span style="font-style:italic">“the Owen Glenn side”</span> proceeded to invest in the Warriors.  </p>

Again the contrast with <span style="font-style:italic">Murad</span> is instructive: there the claimants did not receive proposals from Mr Al-Saraj which they considered with their own advisers – rather, they left it to Mr Al-Saraj to find investments for them and were wholly dependent on his advice.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two other relatively minor points were relied on by Ms Jones which I do not consider take matters any further.  One is that in the Project Edsel Term Sheet there was an express obligation on the parties to use good faith in seeking to agree the long-form documentation (paragraphs 104 and 113(1) above); although the relevant party was Clearview (that is Novatrust as trustee of Clearview), she submitted that that in practice required Mr Watson to act in good faith, as Mr Watson had accepted in evidence (paragraph 104 above).  In my judgment Ms Jones gets no assistance from this provision.  A fiduciary undoubtedly does owe an obligation of good faith, this being the very first facet of the core obligation of loyalty identified by Millett LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Mothew</span> (at 18B); but there is nothing unusual about contracting parties owing each other obligations of good faith (express or implied) without thereby becoming fiduciaries.  A contractual obligation of good faith owed by a contracting party who is not a fiduciary requires not so much loyalty to the interests of the other party but loyalty to the contract, to the spirit of the bargain (on all this see again the valuable analysis of Leggatt LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Nehayan</span> at [167]-[176], especially at [175], with which again I entirely agree).  In the case of the Project Edsel Term Sheet there are I think two quite strong indications that the obligation of good faith was of this contractual type, rather than an expression of a fiduciary obligation owed by Mr Watson.  First, the obligation is mutual, which scarcely fits with Mr Watson loyally subordinating his interests to those of Sir Owen but not vice-versa (parties may of course, as in the case of partnership, owe each other mutual fiduciary duties, but Sir Owen’s case is that Mr Watson owed him fiduciary duties, not that they owed each other mutual duties).  Second, the obligation of good faith is not a general obligation, but a specific obligation to use good faith, best commercial endeavours to seek to agree, execute and deliver the necessary long-form documentation.  In circumstances where the Term Sheet was quite sketchy, and expressly contemplated both that the structure was not yet finalised and might have to be agreed subsequently, and that the long-form documentation might have to contain other necessary or desirable terms (see paragraph 113(6) and (7) above), it is entirely understandable why there should be this express obligation to negotiate the long-form documentation in good faith, in the contractual sense of being loyal to the bargain; whereas if what had been intended was a contractual expression of the good faith and loyalty appropriate to fiduciaries, there would have been no reason to confine it to the agreement of the long-form documentation in this way.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones’ other minor point is that Mr Watson had a habit of referring to Sir Owen as his <span style="font-style:italic">“partner” </span>or as <span style="font-style:italic">“partnering”</span> him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There are other examples which I need not refer to.  I do not think that any weight can be attached to this at all: <span style="font-style:italic">“partner”</span> is one of those words which can have a technical meaning but is very commonly used in a looser sense.  It is not suggested that any of the arrangements between Mr Watson and Sir Owen amounted to a partnership governed by the Partnership Act 1890, and I do not see that Mr Watson meant anything other than that he and Sir Owen (or their vehicles) were participating in a number of joint ventures together.  That was true, but, as set out above, it is common ground that a joint venture is not without more a relationship that gives rise to fiduciary duties.  In those circumstances I do not consider that for Mr Watson to refer to Sir Owen as a <span style="font-style:italic">“partner”</span> in the sense of co-venturer takes matters any further.  </p>

That is a potentially important one which I will come to, but before doing so I will summarise my conclusions so far.  In my judgment none of the matters so far referred to establish that Mr Watson owed Sir Owen (or Kea) any fiduciary duties in relation to Project Edsel.  Leaving aside the point which I am about to come to, that means that the relationship between Mr Watson and Sir Owen/Kea was the same as that of any other parties negotiating for a contractual relationship: Mr Watson owed the usual obligation not to misrepresent the position, but was otherwise free to act in his own interests and did not owe the special obligation peculiar to fiduciaries not to make a profit from his position without the fully informed consent of Sir Owen/Kea.</p>

This is admitted on the pleadings as a matter of fact (save that Mr Watson says he was dealing with them on behalf of Copperstone, but I agree with Ms Jones that Copperstone is just a vehicle for the interests of Kea and Clearview, and this does not affect matters).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This point requires careful consideration.  As already stated, in the case of joint ventures fiduciary duties may in particular be found to arise where one party has control of assets which are to be exploited for the joint benefit of both; thus in <span style="font-style:italic">John v James</span> the deciding factor was that the defendant publisher had control over the exploitation of the copyrights, but the intention was that this be done for the benefit of the venture (paragraph 131(9) above).  In principle it seems to me that similar considerations apply where one of the parties controls not assets as such, but a relationship with a third party.  If the intention is that he should make use of that relationship to benefit the joint venture, then it is not difficult to see that he may owe a fiduciary duty to his co-venturer not to use it for his own exclusive benefit.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the context of Project Edsel, what that means in practice I think is this.  If Mr Watson had first agreed with Sir Owen that they should co-invest and had then gone to Messrs Astor and Aumonier and HW and used the fact that he and Sir Owen/Kea were going to invest to obtain a share of the management carry for himself, I would have had little difficulty in finding that he could not keep that share of the management carry to himself but would have had to share it with Sir Owen/Kea.  That would have been closely analogous to the position of the publisher in <span style="font-style:italic">John v James</span>, who could not use the exploitation of the copyrights to benefit sub-publishers associated with itself at the expense of the plaintiffs.     </p>

Project Edsel was first mentioned to Sir Owen’s camp (in fact Mr Miller) on 7 January 2012 (paragraph 96 above).  But Mr Watson had agreed with Messrs Astor and Aumonier as early as February 2011 (in the Attila JV Agreement) that the three of them would share pro-rata in the management carry on all deals (paragraph 80 above); and the three of them had then agreed with HW in April 2011 (in the Project Atlantic Term Sheet) for a management carry on Project Atlantic, being 20%, rising to 25% once the return to investors met the 1.35x multiple (paragraph 82 above).</p>

I have already said that the Project Atlantic Term Sheet did not in my view oblige Mr Watson to co-invest, but gave him a right to do so, and that there is evidence that as late as December 2011, HW did not know if any of the individuals who had that right were going to do so (paragraph 83 above).  Ms Jones relied on an answer given by Mr Gibson in oral evidence, in answer to the suggestion that HW wanted to see the colour of Mr Watson’s money, to the effect that HW <span style="font-style:italic">“would have liked to see some skin in the game … but they liked the investment and the level of that skin in the game was not clarified”</span>, together with Mr Watson’s intention in January 2012 to put in £1.5m to £2m (paragraph 95 above) to suggest that HW required an investment of that order.  But I do not think that can fairly be taken from Mr Gibson’s evidence; Mr Watson’s evidence was that HW did like to have management investing but that he was sure they would have proceeded if he hadn’t invested alongside them; and there is nothing in the contemporaneous documents which contradicts this, or supports the idea that HW were insisting on significant investment from Mr Watson.  There was evidence that HW wanted Mr Watson, if he was going to invest, to put his money in upfront so they were not taking a credit risk on him not completing future drawdowns, but that is a different point.  </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentpara">I find that it has not been established that it was a requirement of HW that Mr Watson make a substantial investment, or that Project Edsel would not have gone ahead without it.  It is true that Mr Watson, with the collusion of Mr Gibson and Mr Leahy, deliberately concealed Sir Owen’s involvement both from HW and from Messrs Astor and Aumonier, something that is scarcely laudable, but whatever right that might have given them to complain, I do not see that it alters the position as between him and Sir Owen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Subject to one point of detail, therefore, I find that Mr Watson did not obtain his share of the management carry by exploiting his relationships with HW and Messrs Astor and Aumonier in circumstances in which he should have been doing so for the joint benefit of himself and Sir Owen.  As submitted by Mr McCaughran, he had negotiated for those rights long before Sir Owen was ever approached to invest.  They were therefore not benefits that he acquired in breach of a fiduciary duty to Sir Owen to acquire them for their joint benefit rather than for himself, and in those circumstances I do not see that he was obliged to bring them into the joint venture, or indeed say anything about them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should add for the sake of completeness that I have not overlooked the fact that the Project Atlantic Term Sheet was not legally binding, but only an agreement in principle and subject to contract (paragraph 82 above), but there is nothing in the contemporary record to suggest any reluctance on the part of HW to adhere to and formalise the agreement they had negotiated and agreed in principle.  In this intensely fact-sensitive area the Court should I think have regard to the factual realities, and I accept that in reality HW had agreed that Messrs Watson, Astor and Aumonier could have a management carry from Project Edsel long before Sir Owen was approached.  When Sir Owen <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> approached, it was on the express basis that after repayment of capital and interest, the remaining profits would be split between investors and management, with the management carry (or performance fees) being 20% or 25%, and with no suggestion that his investment would give him any right to any part of the management carry, as the presentation in the investment  discussion document set out in some detail (paragraphs 102 to 103 above).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I said that this was subject to one point of detail.  That is that when Project Edsel came to be finalised on 17 February 2012, the share of profits that went to management had increased.  In the Project Atlantic Term Sheet the split between investors and management was either 80% : 20%, or (once the return to investors was 1.35 times) 75% : 25% (paragraph 82 above), and this was what was presented to Mr Miller in the investment discussion document.  By 17 February 2012 however the Amended and Restated Partnership Deed for Atlantic 1 provided for the split to be either 78.08% : 21.92%, or 72.75% : 27.75% (paragraph 118 above), apparently in order to accommodate a share for Mr Noble.  If Mr Watson agreed to this change after Sir Owen / Kea had agreed to invest, that might be thought to be an example of his using his relationship with Messrs Astor, Aumonier and HW to benefit himself or others at the expense of the Sir Owen interests, and so raise the question whether it involved a breach of fiduciary duty.  But nothing is pleaded along those lines, the circumstances in which the percentages were changed and the reasons for it were not I think explored in evidence, and the point was not argued or relied on in Ms Jones’ comprehensive written submissions and only very briefly touched on in oral argument.  In those circumstances I do not think the question is one I can or should pursue and I say no more about it.  </p>

But she also submitted that if it were necessary for Sir Owen to have an interest in or connection with the assets, he did, relying on three different matters, namely (i) that Sir Owen could be added as a beneficiary to the Corona Trust and had a particularly strong claim on the trustee’s discretion; (ii) that the “decanting” under which the assets of the Regency Trust were moved across to the Corona Trust (paragraph 31 above) was improper and in breach of trust; and (iii) that Sir Owen had a legitimate interest in being consulted about investments. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is because I do not accept the premise of Mr McCaughran’s submissions, namely that it is necessary for Sir Owen to have had an interest in the trust assets before Mr Watson could be found to owe any fiduciary duties.  His submissions can be tested in this way.  An investor A is proposing to invest his own money, and an adviser B expressly agrees to find investments for him and in doing so to act exclusively in his interests.  That would be a classic case where fiduciary duties were owed by B to A, and if B puts forward an investment on which he had taken a secret commission, there would be no serious doubt that he would be accountable for it to A.  Now suppose that the facts were the same except that A tells B that the money he was looking to invest was not actually his own money but belonged to his daughter C, and asked B to put forward suitable investments for C to invest in.  I do not see that that would prevent a fiduciary duty arising, and if B put forward to C an investment on which he had taken a secret commission, I see no reason why he should not be accountable for it, either to A or to C, or perhaps to both.  The suggestion that because A had no beneficial interest in the monies no duty was owed to anyone, with the result that B was not accountable for his secret commission at all, seems to me to be wrong in principle.  In short the essence of a fiduciary duty is a duty to act loyally in another’s interests, and I see no reason why A cannot deal with B on terms that B will loyally serve his daughter C’s interests, any more than there is any objection to a contract under which A engages B to paint his daughter C’s house. </p>

I do not see that it matters in such a case that A himself has no beneficial interest in the trust, or expectation of benefiting directly from it, or indeed whether he expects to have or does have any say in the investment decisions or those are left entirely to the trustees.  In a non-technical sense he clearly has an interest in seeing that the investment is suitable for the trust, and hence in the best interests of the beneficiaries, as he was the one who established the trust and selected those beneficiaries to be the object of his bounty; and it would in my judgment be absurd to suggest that just because he himself had no beneficial interest in the trust, it was no concern of his whether B acted loyally in the interests of the vehicle put forward by the trust, or instead abused his position to line his own pocket.  That would be like saying that if A engaged B to paint his daughter’s house, he had no interest in whether B complied with the contract because he did not have a beneficial interest in the house.</p>

I do not need to decide if such a duty would have been owed to Sir Owen or to Kea or both (or whether the duty would have been owed to Sir Owen, but would have given rise to a duty to account to Kea) partly as it does not in fact arise, and partly because if it did, both Sir Owen and Kea join in bringing the claim in any event.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That makes it strictly unnecessary in my judgment to decide the three matters relied on by Ms Jones, but I will deal with them.  The first was that Sir Owen could be added as a beneficiary to the Corona Trust and had a particularly strong claim on the trustee’s discretion.  It is not disputed that Sir Owen could be added as a beneficiary – indeed he was in 2014.  The mere potential to be added cannot however have given him any particular interest in the assets of the Corona Trust in 2012, as almost anyone in the world could be so added, and it could not sensibly be suggested that everyone had a sufficient interest.  So the real contention is that he had a strong claim to be so added.  Mr Miller accepted in evidence that he and Mr Dickson <span style="font-style:italic">“wanted Sir Owen to enjoy those fruits </span>[of the sale to Mancap]<span style="font-style:italic"> as much as we could”</span>; and that there was always a possibility that Sir Owen could be included as a beneficiary at a later date, but he said that that would be outside the 10-year timeframe (a reference to the 10-year tax window applicable to US tax residents who become non-resident), and maybe another 3 or 4 years beyond that because of the concern about an IRS audit.  But I do not think this establishes that Sir Owen had a strong claim to be added as a beneficiary.  Mr Miller’s evidence about him and Mr Dickson wanting Sir Owen to enjoy the fruits as much as they could was not I think directed at the question of adding him as a beneficiary, but more directed at finding ways of enabling him to benefit from trust assets despite not being one – such as permitting him to use the yacht Ubiquitous (which could perhaps be justified as promoting the work of the GFF, which was a beneficiary), or a proposal to pay him a finder’s fee in connection with the Mancap sale or otherwise remunerate him.  And Mr Miller’s cautious acceptance that there was a possibility of adding him after the end of the 10-year window and the danger of an IRS audit had passed did not amount to an acceptance that that was the intention in 2012, or had even been contemplated, nor indeed was that suggested to him.  The fact that he was in fact so added in 2014 does not really assist on the likelihood in 2012 of that happening – it may well have been driven by his desire to be in the driving seat in relation to the disputes which have led to this litigation.  In the absence of that factor the probability of Sir Owen being added as a beneficiary to the trust would be likely to depend on such matters as what other assets he had access to, the tax consequences if he received benefits from the trust, and the financial position of the existing beneficiaries.  I had no real evidence on any of these matters; nor did I have any evidence, for example, that it had been contemplated when the trust structure was first set up in 2009, or at any time subsequently, that he would or might be added after the end of the 10-year window, or what Sir Owen’s intentions as settlor were.  The closest that the evidence came to shedding light on Sir Owen’s understanding and intentions as to who would benefit from the trusts was Mr Hamilton’s notes of the OTSLG Advisory Board meeting in March 2011 (paragraph 15 above).  These indicate that it was contemplated that a number of investments would be held for the benefit of his children and grandchildren, and the GFF, but (apart from a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“$8m for piggy bank”</span>) contain nothing that could be said to contemplate Sir Owen himself directly benefiting.  I am not persuaded that in 2012 there was any significant prospect of his being added as a beneficiary, and as I have said I do not find it established that he had a strong claim to be added.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second matter that Ms Jones relied on was that the decanting was improper.  This is a point of some intricacy, starting with a submission that the decanting did not in fact take place on its ostensible date of 31 October 2011, but took place between February and April 2012, the documents being backdated.  This was something the Claimants only came to suspect at a late stage in preparation for trial, and is not in fact part of their pleaded case, which still refers to it as having taken place on 31 October 2011, but the suggestion was put to Mr Miller in cross-examination, who denied it.  It was based on the fact that in December 2011 Maples and Calder in BVI had told Messrs Dickson and Miller that the shares in Pacifico were still held by SHR for Sir Owen, and that when in February 2012 Mr Dickson was asked to provide information to Ms Huggett of Stonehage in connection with Project Edsel, he sent her KYC information on Sir Owen, completed a questionnaire to the effect that Mr Watson and Sir Owen would each be 50% beneficial owners, and sent her a copy of the declaration of trust under which SHR held the shares in Pacifico for Sir Owen; it was not until April 2012 that Mr Dickson sent to Maples and Calder in BVI the documents dated 31 October 2011 and asked them to correct the share ownership of Pacifico.  The submission was supported by evidence that other trust documents were backdated, by the fact that there is no trace in the documentary record to the decanting being referred to before April 2012, and to some very hesitant answers given by Mr Miller in evidence and his inability to explain why Mr Dickson was telling Ms Huggett in February 2012 that Sir Owen was the beneficial owner of the investment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It does appear that there is no express reference to the decanting in any correspondence or e-mails before April 2012 (although there is a structure chart purporting to show the Corona Trust structure as at 5 January 2012 which has the Corona Trust owning Pacifico); and I accept that the matters relied on by Ms Jones do cast doubt on whether the decanting took place on its ostensible date, but I do not on this evidence find the backdating proved.  There is in fact no positive evidence in support of the backdating.  Nor are the inferences from what Mr Dickson was telling Ms Huggett as clear as they might be; she was also sent a structure chart showing Mr Dickson as the owner of Pacifico, and she found what she was being told confusing, as indeed it was.  I am not satisfied that I have enough material on which to find this unpleaded allegation proved; the true position remains obscure.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones’ next point was that Sir Owen did not know about the transfer.  Mr Miller gave evidence that he told Sir Owen about it when they were in Hong Kong in early October 2011 (paragraph 19 above), and explained why it was necessary.  Sir Owen said he had no recollection of that; but since he had initially denied being in Hong Kong for the Mancap closing at all, I place little weight on that.  After documents had been disclosed establishing the trip had taken place, Sir Owen was recalled and accepted that he had been wrong, explaining that he had simply not remembered the trip.  Although I do not accept Mr McCaughran’s invitation to find that he was lying about that, it does mean I have little confidence in his evidence as to what was discussed: if he could forget the whole trip, he could certainly forget a discussion by Mr Miller about the trust structures, his general attitude being that while he understood there were such structures for tax purposes, he left the detail to Mr Miller and did not expect them in practice to prevent him both investing and distributing the money as he wanted (paragraph 24 above).  That was why he was so incensed when Mr Dickson told him in January 2012 that the rules of engagement had changed (paragraph 34 above), and when Messrs Miller and Dickson declined to fund his pet projects (paragraph 38 above).  In those circumstances I do not find it at all surprising that he might have no recollection of Mr Miller telling him that they needed to take steps to move assets around the structure.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, for reasons I have given above, I did not find Mr Miller’s evidence impressive.  I am prepared to accept that he may have explained to Sir Owen, as he said in evidence, that there were potential problems in the light of the Mancap transaction and they were going to take steps to reduce the risk, or tidy things up, but I do not accept that he gave Sir Owen a clear and coherent explanation that the steps taken would include transferring assets from the revocable Regency Trust to the irrevocable Corona Trust, leaving him with no access to them, or the reasons for it.  By the time of the Nevis proceedings in early 2013, Sir Owen does not seem to have appreciated that this was what had happened, as his reaction when it came to light in April 2013 that the Regency Trust was revocable was that it was news to him, and I see no reason not to accept this.  And having heard Mr Miller attempt to explain the reasons for the transfer to me, I have no difficulty in finding that he did not give a comprehensible explanation to Sir Owen.  Mr Miller’s evidence was that he and Mr Dickson were concerned about US legislation which concerned what were called private foreign investment companies or PFICs, and that the safest thing to do was to transfer the assets from the Regency Trust into the Corona Trust where they viewed it as a lot safer and where the US beneficiaries had been removed.  That did not explain, nor did I receive any explanation, why, if the concern was the presence of US beneficiaries, they could not be removed from the Regency Trust as well; nor did it explain in what other respects the Corona Trust was safer.  I am not prepared to conclude that Mr Miller did give an account to Sir Owen in Hong Kong which adequately explained to him the proposed transfer.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones then submitted that Messrs Miller and Dickson did not consult with Sir Owen or the beneficiaries before executing the documents, and that this made the transfer improper and in breach of trust.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones submitted that in the circumstances this was a breach of trust and improper, because the trustee and protector failed to consult the settlor and beneficiaries or to consider their best interests.  I do not think the failure to consult with beneficiaries made the transfer a breach of trust: a trustee is not in general obliged to consult beneficiaries, even if adult.  Nor is there in general any obligation to consult a settlor.  The real question I think is whether the transfer was done in the best interests of the beneficiaries and for proper reasons, that is to defend the trust against possible adverse consequences arising out of an IRS audit; or was done for improper reasons.  I am left in real doubt whether there was a good reason for it, for the following reasons: (i) I have not understood the PFICs issue, and Mr Miller was unable coherently to explain it; (ii) the September 2011 amendment which excluded the US beneficiaries appears to have been drafted by Ord &amp; Norman because of the PFICs issue, and one would have expected them to deal with the transfer at the same time if the Regency Trust were really a problem, whereas in fact the documents were according to Mr Miller later drafted by Liburd &amp; Dash; (iii) Mr Dickson gave an account to the Nevis Court in which he referred to the PFICs issue as the reason for the September 2011 amendment but did not suggest that it was also the reason for the decanting, saying simply that <span style="font-style:italic">“At the same time Sir Owen was anxious that Pacifico Holdings Ltd should be moved from the Regency Trust to the Corona Trust”</span>, a statement that is impossible to reconcile with Mr Miller’s account and which, having seen Sir Owen give evidence, I find highly improbable; (iv) even though I have accepted that as a matter of law a trustee is not obliged to consult a settlor, it is a momentous step to remove $80m or so of value from a revocable trust where it is ultimately at the disposal of the settlor to an irrevocable trust, and one would have expected a trustee contemplating such a step (and a protector considering whether to consent to it) to have taken great care to inform the settlor with the benefit of professional advice why it was necessary to do it, and document that they had done so, but there is no suggestion this was done and even on Mr Miller’s account Sir Owen was informed of this significant step in an informal fashion; and (v) it is indeed striking that in all the increasingly acrimonious communications between Sir Owen and Messrs Miller and Dickson about the trust, they did not refer to the transfer at all, and that inevitably raises the suspicion that they did not do so because they wished to conceal it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, I have not really understood why the decanting might have taken place if it was not done, as Mr Miller said, in the belief that it was safer from the point of view of a possible IRS audit.  Ms Jones suggested that it was done to bolster Messrs Miller and Dickson’s own position.  But this does not make much sense: the bulk of the assets were in the irrevocable Corona Trust in any event, and even without the decanting Messrs Miller and Dickson were in control of that structure, and able to pay themselves substantial fees, and the existence of the Regency Trust did not really threaten that.  In the end it is the Claimants who allege that the transfer was carried out for an improper reason, and it is they who have to establish that.  Mr Watson was neither under any obligation, nor realistically in a position, to establish the true position.  I was ultimately left with very little material against which to assess Mr Miller’s assertion that the transfer was done for <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> reasons: I heard no expert evidence on the PFICs issue, and no attempt was made to explore in evidence what contemporary advice Ord &amp; Norman might have given Messrs Miller and Dickson.  Nor do I have any evidence casting light on the reason for the Regency Trust having been set up on a revocable basis: it might be relevant for example whether the revocability was regarded as an important feature for Sir Owen, always likely to be used in due course, or as a longstop protection that would be very unlikely to be resorted to in practice.  But the Claimants have throughout these proceedings steadfastly resisted any disclosure of the advice given on the establishment of the trusts in 2009, and I know nothing of the reasons why the trusts were structured in this way.  In the circumstances, despite my real doubts, I have concluded that I do not have a solid enough basis to find it proved that the transfer was carried out for an improper reason or in breach of trust.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third of the three matters relied on by Ms Jones is that Sir Owen had a legitimate expectation of being consulted about investments.  Up to and including Project Edsel, I do not think the facts are really in dispute: although the ultimate decision on investments was that of Messrs Miller and Dickson, in practice they acted more like advisers to Sir Owen who made the decisions.  Thus, in relation to matters such as Red Mountain, and the proposal to invest in ground rents in 2011, Mr Miller said in evidence that they were all working closely together, everything seemed to be working fine, and as long as things were working out they weren’t going to make a big issue of the final decision coming from the trust; he said he admired Sir Owen and admired his input, he was the wealth creator and Mr Miller didn’t want to put up any unnecessary road blocks in his way as long as it didn’t get out of control.  The same was true of Project Edsel where Sir Owen took advice from both Mr Dickson and Mr Miller but they deferred to his decision (<span style="font-style:italic">“Await Papal response”</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>on whether to go ahead with Mr Watson’s proposed split of profits (paragraph 107 above); and Project Drive where they let Sir Owen make the decision.  In relation to this period, Sir Owen not only expected to be consulted about investments, but expected Messrs Miller and Dickson to implement his decisions, which they consistently did.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Matters admittedly became much more contentious after relations between them deteriorated: Mr Miller said the point where Sir Owen crossed the line and it became very difficult was when he instructed Mr Dickson to transfer A$25m to his personal account, which was on 18 February 2012 (paragraph 36 above).  Thereafter Messrs Miller and Dickson took an increasingly formal position with Sir Owen (Mr Miller referred to the letters they wrote as <span style="font-style:italic">“military”</span>), ultimately excluding him altogether from the decision on investment in Project Spartan.  But for Project Edsel, I accept that Sir Owen had a legitimate expectation of consultation over the investments made by the trust.  Mr McCaughran said that did not give him an interest sufficient to found a fiduciary duty.  It did not of course mean that he had a beneficial interest in the trust assets, but for reasons already given I do not accept that that is necessary.  And he did in my judgment have a real interest in the investment of the trust assets because he had an interest in the trust doing what he had established it to do, that is provide for the beneficiaries.  </p>

This is relatively straightforward.  One of the duties of a fiduciary is not to make a secret profit from his position, and in order to avoid being in breach the fiduciary must show that he gave full and proper disclosure of the nature and extent of his interest and that thereafter his principal gave his fully informed consent.  It is not sufficient simply to disclose the existence of some interest or to say something that would put the principal on inquiry; disclosure requirements are not confined to the nature of the fiduciary’s interest, but extend to disclosure of its extent, including the source and scale of the profit made from his position.

Taking these explanations together, what they revealed was that the profits after repaying capital and interest would be split between investors and management (80/20 or 75/25, although these figures were no longer accurate), that the B interest represented a share of the management carry, and that it would flow through to Clearview alone.  There is nothing however to suggest that any explanation was given of the amount of Mr Watson’s share, or indeed that it would go to Mr Watson, Mr Gibson referring in his e-mail to Nucopia, which was untrue but what he had been told to say by Mr Watson.  By the time the long-form documentation was executed in September 2012, it is clear, as Ms Jones accepted, that Messrs Miller and Dickson knew that the B interest would be going to Clearview, but I accept her submission that there had still not been any disclosure of the size or value of the B interest, and that there is no evidence or even suggestion that the percentage of the total B interest taken by Clearview had been disclosed.

The Term Sheet, which appears to have been drafted without professional assistance (initially by Mr Flay, with some input from Mr Leahy, neither of whom was a lawyer), is relatively brief and informal, and seems to me a paradigm case of a contract where the Court should give weight to the wider context, that is to the background matrix of fact known to the parties and the implications of the competing constructions.  By its own terms it is not intended as a definitive and complete statement of the parties’ rights but as a brief summary of the key terms which the parties agree to address in long-form documentation: see the preamble, the reference under <span style="font-style:italic">“Future Assurances”</span> to the structure not yet being finalised, and the reference under <span style="font-style:italic">“Other Terms”</span> to other terms which were necessary or desirable being included.  It does not itself seek to describe Project Edsel but refers under <span style="font-style:italic">“Business Purpose”</span> to <span style="font-style:italic">“the documents attached to this document”</span>; there is no evidence that any documents were in fact so attached, but that does not affect the fact that the provision shows that the Term Sheet itself contemplated that if one wanted to know about Project Edsel one would go outside the four corners of the document to other material which explained it.  That too indicates that it is appropriate to look at the background material known to both parties.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was not disputed by Ms Jones that the background material which forms part of the matrix of fact admissible to construe the Term Sheet includes the investment discussion document.  This had been sent by Mr Leahy to Mr Miller at the same time as the Term Sheet in draft, and explained the proposed terms of participation by Sir Owen’s vehicle in Project Edsel (paragraph 102 above).  The investment discussion document referred (twice) to the upside over the 8% interest being split 50/50 between Sir Owen’s vehicle (OGV) and Mr Watson’s (EWV), but also made it clear that what was being shared was EWV’s share of the Equity Investor Returns, and that the Equity Investor Returns were subject to the performance fees payable to AAM or management carry.  The worked example also demonstrated this.  Reading the documents together there is no doubt that the provisions under <span style="font-style:italic">“Equity Arrangement”</span> in the Term Sheet were intended to implement this 50/50 split, and construed against this background I accept Mr McCaughran’s submission that what was intended to be split in this way was Copperstone’s interest in the returns payable to equity investors, not any part of the management carry.  When therefore the second sentence under <span style="font-style:italic">“Equity Arrangement” </span>refers to payments only being made if Copperstone receives additional income or capital profits <span style="font-style:italic">“from its participation in Project Edsel”</span>, it seems to me that that is to be construed as referring to Copperstone’s participation <span style="font-style:italic">as an equity investor</span> in Project Edsel, as the discussion document makes clear that that is the participation which is proposed to be split 50/50.  Now coming to the first sentence, it seems to me that Mr McCaughran is right that <span style="font-style:italic">“effective 50% participation in the net equity”</span> should be construed consistently with that so that it is limited to a 50% interest in Copperstone’s interest as an equity investor in Project Edsel, and hence in the profits payable to Copperstone after repayment of loans, interest and the management carry.  That may not be the most natural interpretation of the language viewed in isolation, but viewed against the context that the Term Sheet was intended only to document in a brief and informal way the key terms offered for Kea’s participation in Project Edsel, and that the terms offered did not include any part of the management carry but were limited (after repayment of principal and interest) to a 50% share of the Equity Investor Returns arising from the equity investment, it would be anomalous to construe the Term Sheet as also giving Kea a right to any interest in the management carry simply because Mr Watson used Copperstone for that participation as well.  That would be to give Kea a windfall that was never on offer and which it never expected to have.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should add, although in my view it does not arise, that even if the Term Sheet as a matter of construction strictly entitled Kea to 50% of the whole of Copperstone, including its B interest, it is not obvious either that Mr Dickson would have been in breach of fiduciary duty in agreeing the long-form documentation in the terms he did, or that Mr Watson would have known that he was.  Mr Dickson had the benefit of Mr Maislish’s advice, and there is no suggestion that he thought Mr Dickson was doing anything wrong.  Moreover, the Term Sheet required the parties to use good faith endeavours to agree the long-form documentation, and in particular to agree the ultimate structure of the business; it also contemplated that the long-form documentation would include other necessary or desirable terms not included in the document.  In those circumstances, I think it distinctly arguable that if the point had been taken, Mr Watson would have taken the view that all that had been offered to Kea was a share in the equity investor returns and not a share of the management carry, and that Kea’s good faith obligations required it to agree a structure for the business which respected that bargain, and hence to agree long-form documentation which included other terms required by Clearview such that Kea did not also share in the management carry.  I need not decide if he would have been right about that, but it does suggest that even if I am wrong on the construction of the Term Sheet, it is far from obvious that Mr Dickson would have been giving up anything of value, or that Mr Watson would have known that he was.</p>

Mr Watson’s Defence refers to the fact that he had previously (through Cullen) paid more than £107,000 in due diligence costs for Project Edsel, the benefit of which was taken by Copperstone, which is confirmed by a cash analysis of the Edsel monies; but it is not suggested that any of this money was still available at the time of closing and it is admitted that the £7,045 that was paid by Fladgates on 17 February 2012 was paid out of the monies held on their client account, and that those were the monies which had been paid into that account by Kea. </p>

Fladgates clearly held the money on trust, as is accepted, but the question is for whom and on what terms?  Ms Jones’ primary submission is that the money was held by Fladgates on trust for Kea; Mr McCaughran’s that it was held on trust for Copperstone, Kea having advanced the £5.3m to Copperstone by way of loan.  </p>

So far as the documents are concerned, all that they show is that after Sir Owen had agreed to proceed and asked Mr Miller to expedite matters, Mr Gibson (i) asked Mr Miller to have the Term Sheet signed, which Mr Dickson did on 7 February; and (ii) told Mr Miller that Mr Reuben had requested that the funds be in his account by 9 February, which Mr Dickson arranged (paragraphs 111, 112 and 115 above).  There they sat until Mr Reuben transferred the £1.9m to K&amp;L Gates on 16 February; at that date although Mr Dickson had signed the Term Sheet on behalf of Kea, Novatrust had not done so.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first step in Mr McCaughran’s argument is that when Kea transferred the money to Fladgates, Fladgates was holding the money for Copperstone, not for Kea.

I do not think Mr Reuben’s confirmation in 2014 takes matters much further, as what he was asked to confirm was that the money was held for Copperstone rather than Clearview, and he was not asked the question precisely when and how he thought that Kea’s money became Copperstone’s.    </p>

There are two significant difficulties with this analysis.  The first is that on 9 February it is difficult to see that any loan had been agreed.  It is true that the Project Edsel Term Sheet provided under <span style="font-style:italic">“Funding Arrangement”</span> that Kea would provide funding to Copperstone equal to 20% of the total transaction equity, currently anticipated at £5.3m.  But Project Edsel had not yet closed so it would be surprising if the payment by Kea to Fladgates was the completion of the loan contemplated in the Term Sheet; it looks much more like a payment of money in advance in anticipation of a loan.  As a matter of general principle if A pays money to B in anticipation of a particular transaction, I would have thought the normal inference would be that B could use the money for that transaction if and when it went ahead, but could not use it for any other purpose, and if the transaction did not go ahead would have to return it to A.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Ms Jones submitted, that in my judgment gave rise to a <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose </span>trust (see <span style="font-style:italic">Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd </span>[1970] AC 567).  There was no dispute as to the principles applicable to such a trust and I was not addressed on them, Mr McCaughran accepting that they were as stated by Lord Millett in <span style="font-style:italic">Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley </span>[2002] UKHL 12 AC at [100].  Lord Millett’s analysis is that such a trust arises where A pays money to B for a particular purpose, B is not free to apply it for any other purpose, and B has to return it if for any reason the purpose cannot be carried out (see at [99]), the effect being that B holds the money on resulting trust for A, subject to B’s power (or in some cases duty) to apply the money for the particular purpose.  On my analysis, that precisely describes the position of the payment of the £5.3m by Kea to Fladgates on 9 February.  I do not think it matters for this purpose whether B is regarded as Fladgates (so that Fladgates was trustee for Kea subject to a power to use the money for Project Edsel), or B is regarded as Copperstone (so that Fladgates held the money for Copperstone who in turn held it for Kea subject to such a power), although I think the former is probably the better analysis.  On either view the money was held on trust for Kea subject to the power of Fladgates or Copperstone to use it for a particular purpose, and if used for any other purpose that would be a breach of trust.  </p>

That requires a more precise identification of the purposes for which Fladgates / Copperstone held the money.  Ms Jones says that the purpose for which the money was held was to cause it to be applied to Project Edsel in accordance with the Project Edsel Term Sheet.  So far I agree with her, and this is supported by Mr Miller’s evidence of his understanding.  She then says that this in effect was to invest in a 50/50 joint venture, and was able to refer to an answer from Mr Watson that the £5.3m would be used to buy Kea’s A interest in the transaction.  As such she says it cannot have been a proper use of the money to use it to acquire a B interest for Mr Watson.</p>

That would then become Copperstone’s money.  Copperstone would be under a contractual obligation to deliver the investment returns set out in the Term Sheet, and no doubt it was expected that in order to do that the money received would be applied as an investment through Streamside in the Atlantic 1 partnership; but that did indeed happen in due course.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I propose to address this by assuming first, contrary to the facts, that the Term Sheet had been signed by Novatrust by closure of Project Edsel on 17 February.  On that hypothesis, Kea would have been contractually obliged (to Clearview) to provide funding of £5.3m to Copperstone.  (I leave aside the fact that the Term Sheet envisaged that Kea would be funded as to 10% of this (£530,000) by Clearview; this aspect of the arrangements had changed but I do not think it affects the analysis, as Messrs Miller and Dickson understood that Kea was providing £5.3m in the first instance and £530,000 would be repaid later).  When therefore, as Mr Miller agreed in evidence, the £5.3m was sent to Fladgates <span style="font-style:italic">“on the basis that they would use it for the purpose of the termsheet you had signed”</span>, that would mean that on closure of Project Edsel Fladgates was authorised to advance the £5.3m to Copperstone in fulfilment of Kea’s obligation to provide funding to Copperstone.  It is true that Copperstone was not a party to the Term Sheet and so not contractually obliged to accept the advance; but I see no difficulty in finding that Copperstone did accept the advance on the terms of the Term Sheet: apart from anything else, Fladgates, who were Copperstone’s solicitors, sent c. £1.9m to K&amp;L Gates on 16 February and released it to them on 17 February as a payment on behalf of Streamside, which they could only do if Copperstone had accepted the money and advanced it to Streamside.  Certainly by mid-April 2012 when Mr Reuben agreed to transfer the remaining balance to Copperstone’s own bank account (paragraph 121 above), he must have regarded Fladgates as holding it for Copperstone (and hence the loan from Kea to Copperstone as having been made), but there is no trace in the documentary record of there having been any event, or discussion, after 17 February which could be pointed to as the occasion on which Kea agreed that the loan should be completed.  That tends to support the analysis that Kea was regarded as having authorised Fladgates to complete the loan on closure of Project Edsel on 17 February.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Does it make a difference that on 17 February Novatrust had not signed the Term Sheet?  In my judgment it does not.  What this means is that Kea could have refused to allow completion to happen until it had received back the signed Term Sheet, and if Mr Dickson and Mr Miller had been acting with due caution, they no doubt should have insisted on this, and refused to permit Fladgates to use the £5.3m until the Term Sheet was contractually binding on Clearview.  In fact they were content to allow Fladgates to close Project Edsel without this, presumably in the expectation that the Term Sheet would be signed in due course.  That is an indication of the rather casual way they dealt with millions of pounds of trust money, and by permitting Fladgates to close Project Edsel before the Term Sheet was signed they were no doubt running a risk which could have led to some difficult questions for them if Novatrust had not in the event signed.  But I do not think it changes the analysis of what happened on 17 February: Kea had authorised Fladgates to use the £5.3m for Project Edsel on the terms set out in the Term Sheet, and had thereby authorised Fladgates to provide it as funding to Copperstone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I understood it Ms Jones accepted in closing submissions that if the £5.3m was loaned to Copperstone it would be Copperstone’s money and that would be different (because it would not be held on trust for Kea).  That seems to me to be right, but I should explain why I take that view.  The question is whether Copperstone was obliged to use the £5.3m in any particular way once it had received it under the Term Sheet.  There is no conceptual difficulty in a loan and a <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose</span> trust subsisting together: that was the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose</span> itself.  But where A lends money to B, even for a particular purpose, it normally becomes B’s money beneficially and B does not hold it on trust for A.  In the present case the Term Sheet certainly envisaged that Copperstone would participate in Project Edsel: see the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“its participation in Project Edsel”</span>, and to the Funding Arrangement only becoming repayable as Copperstone <span style="font-style:italic">“receives income or capital profits from Project Edsel”</span>; the same is also clear from the investment discussion document, which I have already said is admissible to understand the Term Sheet.  And since Copperstone had no other funds, I have no hesitation in concluding that it was envisaged that Copperstone would use the £5.3m to invest in Project Edsel, that is by advancing the funds to Streamside, which would then contribute them as A partner in Atlantic 1.  That was the whole purpose of Kea advancing the money.  But it is a curiosity that although there is evidence that HW wanted Mr Watson to put in all his money upfront, Streamside was not in fact obliged under the terms of Atlantic 1’s partnership deed to put all its money into Atlantic 1 at closing, but only some £1.89m (paragraph 118 above).  That means that Copperstone did not need to invest the entirety of the £5.3m immediately, and did not do so.  In those circumstances I do not see that Copperstone was obliged to keep the balance of the £5.3m intact for future investment by Streamside in Atlantic 1, so long as it was in a position to invest when called on to do so.  To put it another way, I do not see that Copperstone was in breach of any trust in favour of Kea by lending (as in effect it did) £7,045 to Mr Watson for 4 days.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For those reasons in my judgment the breach of trust claim is not made out.

I accept that if the £7,045 had been held on trust for Kea, it would have been a breach of trust for Copperstone to use it to acquire the B interest, as Kea never gave authority for it to be used for that purpose.  Indeed Mr Miller was asked in evidence about a statement in his witness statement to the effect that he and Mr Dickson knew in advance that the monies used to close the deal would be monies transferred from Kea to Fladgates as Mr Watson’s vehicle was having problems in finalising its funding, as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones says that on this simple analysis the use of the £7,045 to acquire Mr Watson’s B interest entitles Kea to claim the proceeds of that interest.  But there are nevertheless two reasons which cause me to have some doubt if this is right.  First the simple case posited by Lord Millett at 130A assumes that the trust money is used exclusively to acquire the asset; he goes on to consider the more complex questions which arise where the trustee acquires the asset partly with trust money and partly with his own, in which case the beneficiary and trustee share the asset proportionately to their contributions.  Ms Jones’ argument assumes in effect that the £7,045 was used exclusively to acquire the B interest.  It is true that this is the only cash contribution that Mr Watson (or more precisely Streamside) was obliged to make as B partner, but to regard this as the means by which he acquired the B interest seems to me to ignore the fact that he had negotiated for and obtained his share in the management carry long before (see paragraph 148 above).  The reality is that he did not acquire the B interest for the sum of £7,045, a relatively nominal sum; he acquired the B interest (or perhaps more accurately the right to complete the acquisition of the B interest for £7,045) by virtue of the fact that Messrs Astor and Aumonier had agreed to share the management carry equally with him.  They did this for reasons that do not matter, but were probably because of his ability to introduce them to sources of capital; they did not do it because he had agreed to contribute £7,045.  It seems to me rather doubtful in those circumstances if it would be right to regard the £7,045 as having been used exclusively to acquire the B interest; a better analysis might be that Mr Watson had already in effect acquired the right to the B interest, and the payment of £7,045 did no more than increase the value of that right by that amount.  That might give Kea no more than a right to a lien on the asset to secure repayment of the £7,045, and since the £7,045 was repaid almost immediately the lien would be discharged.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second doubt I have is a different one and is this.  This is not a case where a trustee uses trust money to acquire an asset for himself and then simply keeps the asset without accounting to the fund; it is a case where four days after the £7,045 was used to complete the acquisition of the B interest, Mr Watson restored the £7,045 to the fund.  I was referred to a statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>(19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn, 2015) that:</p>

It was held that the trustee could not avoid accounting for a proportionate share of the profits by repaying the £1,014 to the trust fund.  That seems plainly right.  But it can be seen that that is very different from the proposition that the trustee could not have made good his breach of trust by accounting for the £1,014 four days after the misappropriation and at a time when the house had not increased in value at all.  There is some indication that the High Court thought he would have been able to do this (at para 12):</p>

And it could perhaps be said that that would more closely reflect the nature of the breach of trust which (assuming there was one at all) did not consist of misappropriating £7,045 and pocketing it, but of the unauthorised borrowing of £7,045 from the fund for 4 days.

Neither the fact that Mr Watson himself was entitled to a share in the management carry, nor the fact that he used Copperstone for this purpose so that the long-form documentation was drafted in such a way as to deliver this to him, had any effect on Kea’s receipt of the profits that it was expecting to get.  Nor did the way in which he concealed Kea’s participation from HW and Messrs Astor and Aumonier, nor the way in which £7,045 of money deriving from Kea was used.  To have successfully claimed in addition either the whole or 50% of Mr Watson’s share of the management carry would have given Kea a bonus that it never bargained for.

Sir Owen gave his go-ahead to the idea but was not involved either in any of the detailed negotiations or the ultimate decision to sign the contractual documents.  These were all handled by Messrs Miller and Dickson, with the assistance of Mr Maislish.  It is necessary to consider the whole period between the initial presentations and 24 July 2012 when Mr Dickson executed a number of agreements (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the July agreements”</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>on behalf of Kea, but it can be conveniently be divided into the following parts: (i) the background to the initial presentations; (ii) the initial presentations on 29 March and 1 April 2012; (iii) the period after the presentations down to 28 May 2012; (iv) Mr Leahy’s e-mail to Mr Dickson of 28 May 2012 when he told him the project would have to be restructured; (v) the period from then until 7 June 2012 when Mr Dickson signed the Term Sheets for Project Spartan; and (vi) the period between then and 24 July 2012 when the July agreements were signed.  The Claimants rely on fraudulent misrepresentations at various stages during these periods; these have to be considered one by one, but it is also necessary to stand back at the end of the exercise and consider the overall picture.  The Claimants’ essential claim is to set aside the July agreements, either as having been procured by deceit, or as having been entered into by Mr Dickson in breach of his fiduciary duties, not being in the best interests of Kea and the Corona Trust, or as having been procured by breaches by Mr Watson of fiduciary duties that he is said to have owed to Sir Owen or Kea, or by inducements offered to Messrs Miller and Dickson.  Mr Watson was not a party to the July agreements, and they have now in fact been set aside by agreement between the Claimants and Novatrust; but it is still necessary to consider whether the Claimants have established their right to set aside the July agreements because it affects the claims against Mr Watson and the other remaining Defendants.</p>

Mr Watson also had what he referred to as the LH Investment Right, that is the benefit of the covenant by Messrs Astor and Aumonier (in cl 24 of the LLP Agreement for Abacus 1) that they would not, while interested in the business and for 12 months thereafter, be interested in any other ground rent business without the consent of Berryblue and Gaucin (paragraph 75 above); as the terms of this clause make clear, this did not in fact confer any positive right to invest on Mr Watson, but was in the nature of a non-compete clause, and was held jointly with Mr Richardson.   </p>

This included the new JV vehicle acquiring the whole of the existing ground rent portfolio.  Mr Leahy suggested buying out Mr Richardson’s interest (at a possible cost of £8m, based on a 23x multiple) and repaying the Berryblue loan (a further £7.15m), so that it would cost £15.15m to acquire the whole portfolio, but convincing Sir Owen that the equity in the portfolio was worth £20m (based on a 26x multiple).  He also suggested Mr Watson and Sir Owen contributing to the JV on a 10%/90% basis, with profits, after repayment of the contributions and 10% preferred interest, being split 50/50.  On his assumed figures that would give Sir Owen a return of 2.6x his money (an internal rate of return or IRR of 29.6%) but Mr Watson a return of 12x his money and an IRR of 76.6%.  It can be seen that the structure proposed by Mr Leahy with Sir Owen putting up 10% of the capital and the profits being split 50/50 was the same as had been used on Project Edsel: Mr Leahy commented that he thought this was probably a long shot and that it was hard to justify, but Sir Owen’s returns still looked attractive. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentpara">During the remainder of March Mr Leahy considered how best to present the opportunity to Sir Owen and Mr Miller.  By 16 March he had produced a draft powerpoint presentation on Project Spartan: this described it as a joint venture to be owned 50/50 by Mr Watson and Sir Owen, with Sir Owen investing £75m (in return for an 8% preferred return) and Mr Watson assigning various assets to Spartan, that is by contributing his interest in the Abacus ground rent business, arranging the purchase of the balance of Abacus, and assigning the LH Investment Right, the Ladoga Investment Right, x% ownership in Homeground and the right to seed fund a residential REIT and take [50%] of the ongoing management company.  It also explained that the purchase of Abacus with its existing ground rent portfolio was integral to the long term strategy of Spartan; that a premium multiple would have to be applied, likely to be at least a [30]x multiple; that Abacus was currently owned 50% by Mr Watson and 50% by another partner, referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">“NR”</span>, and that Mr Watson owed c. £7.2m to NR; and that it was proposed that Spartan acquire Abacus by buying out NR’s 50% at £15.3m (equivalent to a 30x multiple) and by Mr Watson contributing his 50% for the cost of the loan (£7.2m), thereby contributing his 50% at a 53% discount and meaning that Spartan would acquire Abacus for £22.5m.  This version of the presentation would therefore (a) have made it clear that Spartan was not an existing business but a new venture to which Mr Watson would contribute the property rights he had, and (b) made explicit that Mr Watson owed his partner £7.2m which would be paid off.  It is also noticeable that in contrast to the numbers used in Mr Leahy’s e-mail of 9 March, the 10% preferred return had reduced to 8%, and the 26x multiple used to value the ground rents had increased to a 30x multiple.</p>

This last page was not in the 29 March presentation.  It must therefore have been added after Mr Leahy had explained the project to Mr Miller, as part of the redrafting that was carried out jointly by the two of them, which makes it unlikely that Mr Leahy explained that Spartan had not itself done anything over the past 18 months.  </p>

This was the case with the 16 March, 17 March and 26 March versions.  These versions also explained that Spartan would acquire Abacus, by (i) buying out Mr Richardson’s 50% and (ii) Mr Watson contributing his 50% in return for Spartan paying off the Berryblue loan.  The version of 27 March, which formed the basis of the 29 March and 1 April presentations, was noticeably different.  Instead of referring to Spartan as an opportunity in which Mr Watson <span style="font-style:italic">“will take a number of established property investments and partnerships and contribute these”</span>, it now referred to Spartan as an <span style="font-style:italic">“established property investment opportunity”</span> and instead of listing the various assets and opportunities as ones which Mr Watson would assign to Spartan, listed them as existing assets and opportunities that Spartan had.  It also deliberately omitted any reference to the Berryblue loan.  Mr Watson admitted on the pleadings that on or about 27 March he and Mr Leahy decided to represent that he and Mr Richardson had equal interests in an existing business; and he confirmed this in oral evidence.  Having gone to the trouble of rewriting the presentation in this way, it would seem <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> surprising if Mr Leahy then proceeded to undo the effect of this change by explaining that Spartan was not an existing business at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Mr Leahy’s evidence in his witness statement was to the effect that he explained to Mr Miller that the idea was to pull together a collection of opportunities that sat outside Abacus and put them into Spartan; and that he remembered saying that the rights listed were sitting in different places and would have to be brought together.  He also said that he repeated the key issues discussed with Mr Miller when he met Sir Owen, and explained that after Mr Watson’s partner had been bought out, various assets and opportunities would be put into the new Spartan vehicle.  And in oral evidence he repeated that things would be pulled together and that the assets all sat in different places.  In relation to an issue like this (namely, what was said orally at a meeting more than 5 years before) witness evidence is necessarily of limited weight, but I will assume that Mr Leahy did explain that the rights were sitting in different places and would be all pulled together.  Nevertheless I accept Ms Jones’ submission that this is not inconsistent with, and does not take away the force of, the representations that Spartan was an existing business with existing assets which was owned 50% by Mr Watson’s partner.  A business can be carried on through a number of different entities, and as Mr Leahy himself said in his witness statement it is inevitable that behind an investment proposal there will be a large amount of complex moving parts, and the purpose of the presentation was not to deal with the complexities of the structure but to present the fundamentals of the proposal in a simplified form.  The fundamentals of the proposal that it presented were that Sir Owen should buy out Mr Watson’s existing 50% partner in a business which owned all the various rights and opportunities listed, and so replace him; and this is not affected by statements that the various rights and opportunities currently sit in different places and would all be pulled together into one place.</p>

There was some attempt to suggest that Mr Richardson could have caused difficulties with Long Harbour but Mr Watson said in oral evidence that his view and the advice he had at the time was that the agreement he had with Mr Richardson was more specific to ground rents than affordable so it was unlikely he would have any rights to affordable.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Watson again does not of course dispute the actual statements in the presentations but Mr McCaughran makes a number of points on his behalf.  The first is that he and Mr Leahy did believe that it would cost £22.5m to buy out Mr Richardson, on the basis of paying £15m (actually £15.3m) for his 50% share of the Abacus portfolio and £7.5m (actually £7.2m) to repay the Berryblue loan.  There is a substantial dispute as to whether they really thought it might cost this much or expected that it would be possible to buy out Mr Richardson for very much less (see below), but even if it were true that this is what they thought, I do not see that it would help Mr Watson.  The statements in the presentation clearly indicated that the £22.5m was being put forward as the expected price of acquiring Mr Richardson’s 50%: see in particular the statement on page 9 which expressly refers to <span style="font-style:italic">“PT’s 50%”</span> being acquired for £22.5m.  That is also supported by the diagram on page 3 which in the box marked Spartan has the legend:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">the implication being that the £22.5m was an appropriate price to pay for half an interest in a business worth £45m.  It is also supported by a statement in a cash flow break down on page 7 that refers to the £22.5m as:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is similarly supported by a statement on page 9 that £22.5m represented a:</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>

	    <p class="Quote1non-I"> “˜60% discount to the NPV value at a 10% discount”.  </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">When read with the other statements on that page, what this refers to is a net present value (NPV) of Spartan calculated by taking discounted cash flows, based on the three asset classes of ground rents, affordable housing and the residential fund.  The NPV naturally depends on the discount rate selected, but at a 10% discount rate is shown as £118.4m, the reference being to the fact that £22.5m is at a c. 60% discount to the value of half this (£22.5m being 38% of £59.2m).  If the true expectation was that Mr Watson would have to pay £15.3m to Mr Richardson to acquire his 50% interest in Abacus and £7.2m to repay the Berryblue loan, then the £7.2m would not be being used to acquire his 50% of anything, but to benefit Mr Watson by discharging his liability.  There is not a hint of this in the presentation which had omitted any reference to the Berryblue loan.  Both Mr Watson and Mr Leahy accepted that Mr Watson had deliberately decided to omit any reference to the Berryblue loan, although they said that was because it would complicate matters and weaken his negotiating position.  The real reason in my judgment was that if it had been apparent that £7.2m of the £22.5m was being used to discharge the Berryblue loan, it would have shown that Mr Watson’s partner could be bought out of his 50% share for £15.3m, which would have exploded the idea that £22.5m was needed to acquire his 50%, or that the business which he was represented as owning 50% of was worth £45m.  </p>

This has become a key plank in Mr Watson’s defence, but I do not accept it.  Sir Owen’s evidence was that Mr Leahy never said anything about Mr Watson doing a separate and different deal with his partner, and that he trusted him to do the best deal he could.  Mr Leahy himself accepted in evidence that the reason he gave for Sir Owen not being in touch with Mr Watson’s existing partner was a precaution to get the best deal possible; and that if Mr Watson had done a deal it would have been for <span style="font-style:italic">Spartan’s</span> benefit (that is for both his and Sir Owen’s interests).  In other words there is nothing to suggest that what Mr Leahy explained to Sir Owen was that if Mr Watson could do a better deal with Mr Richardson he would keep the balance for himself.  Mr Leahy also at one point said that the concern was that if Mr Richardson had full insight into the proposal for Spartan, he would have wanted more money and the deal (that is the deal with Sir Owen) would have had to have been renegotiated: in other words he was neither accepting that Mr Watson would take the benefit of negotiating a lower figure with Mr Richardson, nor that he would bear the risk of having to pay a higher figure.    </p>

Mr McCaughran said that that would obviously raise a question as to why all the goodwill payment was to be paid to the existing partner if it was known that the goodwill was made up of discounted cashflow values attributed to all three classes of investment (ground rents, affordable housing and residential), and that the existing partner did not own 50% of all the rights and opportunities to invest in those classes.  He said that Mr Miller knew as at 1 April that not all the rights were jointly owned by Mr Watson and his existing partner as he knew that the Ladoga Investment Right was owned by Mr Watson and not his partner.  I accept that the so-called goodwill was based on the £45m valuation which was itself based on discounted cashflows from all three asset classes; but I do not accept that Mr Miller understood at the time that Mr Watson’s partner had no rights in relation to the affordable housing.

That seems to me a strained interpretation.  What was put to Mr Miller was that he presumably believed that there had been current discussions which suggested that the partner was willing to sell his 50% for about £22.5m.  He accepted that and that does seem to me the natural meaning of the statement.  As such it was untrue and known to be untrue by Mr Watson and Mr Leahy, as there had as yet been no discussions with Mr Richardson, as they both knew.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to whether these representations were false, I will start with representation (3).  This is a representation of fact that there were current offers on the table to securitise at a 25-28x multiple.  Mr Leahy was necessarily dependent on what he was told by Mr Astor in relation to this.  So far as appears from the documentary record, he had been told of two potential counterparties, M&amp;G and Axa; M&amp;G were negotiating at a 25x multiple but that was for the whole business not a securitisation.  When Mr Leahy on 5 March suggested Axa were also offering that multiple for a securitisation, Mr Astor’s response was <span style="font-style:italic">“Maybe, still working on it but ideally yes”</span>.  However on the afternoon of 30 March Mr Watson asked Mr Leahy to be sure that he fully understood the offers on the ground rents that Mr Astor had before departing, and Mr Astor confirmed to him (copied to Mr Watson) that the up-to-date position was that:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is no trace in the documentary record of Mr Leahy being told of any other offer on the table.  The statement that there were current offers (in the plural) to securitise at 25-28x was therefore false: there was one offer to securitise at 22.5x, and one offer to buy the business at 25x.  Mr Leahy accepted in cross-examination that the statement was probably inappropriate (and although he suggested in cross-examination that it would have been corrected in the meeting, it was admitted by Mr Watson in answer to a request for further information (an answer which was adopted by Mr Leahy) that Mr Leahy did not at his meeting with Sir Owen contradict or retract any of these statements).  Mr Watson, after referring to the fact that this was a sales pitch, suggested that Mr Leahy’s view was that they could get those sort of prices, but this is not the same as offers being on the table, and he accepted that that language was <span style="font-style:italic">“very promotional”</span>.  In fact it was plainly untrue and known to Mr Watson and Mr Leahy to be untrue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Representations (2) and (4) are also concerned with securitisation of the ground rents.  Representation (4) is a statement that Mr Leahy and Mr Watson believed that Long Harbour could securitise at 25-30x, and representation (2) that they believed it likely that a 60-year bond would be entered into at 26x.  As Mr Leahy himself said in evidence, although he knew broadly about ground rents he wouldn’t have classified himself as a ground rent expert, and went to Mr Astor, who was expert, as the main source for accurate information; but none of Mr Astor’s e-mails gave any support for a securitisation at any higher than 25x.  Mr Leahy said in evidence that Mr Astor was thought to be conservative, and Mr Watson thought he was undervaluing the asset; he (Mr Leahy) thought a range of 25-30x was reasonable, and hence picked 26 as being at the bottom of the range.  It seems to me however that it was an exaggeration to say that Long Harbour <span style="font-style:italic">“can … securitize … at 25-30x”</span>; and also an exaggeration to say that it was <span style="font-style:italic">“likely”</span> that the portfolio would be subject to a bond refinance <span style="font-style:italic">“at a ˜26x valuation”</span>; both are rather more definite statements than the material available to Mr Leahy warranted, as he must have appreciated.</p>

Project Royal was the codename for the acquisition of an existing residential portfolio being offered by Savills.  Mr Astor had initially told Mr Leahy that he estimated it could be acquired for £65m with 65% leverage but by 17 March, when Mr Leahy forwarded the then current draft of the presentation to Mr Watson, he explained:</p>

This was only an early draft but in the final 1 April presentation he kept a similar statement that the equity required for Project Royal was £23-£25m.  In his evidence Mr Leahy made the points that the equity required for Project Royal might change, and in any event that Project Royal was only one possible way for Spartan to seed the fund; neither of these however justify the specific statement as to what equity was required for Project Royal.  It was not suggested that there was any further information from Mr Astor that could justify that.  That was therefore a false statement and known to Mr Leahy to be false, and Mr Watson had no reason to think it was true.</span>

Mr Leahy said in oral evidence that Mr Astor was talking about the specific right to co-invest with HW, but HW did not come into deals to deploy £50m or £100m, they had billions of capital to deploy and although HW may have made an initial commitment of a smaller amount, their expectation was that the opportunity would be huge; and even if HW had decided to pull out after 3 years, Spartan would continue to be able to work with Long Harbour to deploy significantly more capital into that space, and that it was perfectly reasonable to suggest this opportunity.  I have my doubts as to whether Mr Leahy was really justified in asserting this, but I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he did believe this, which means that this representation was not untrue.</p>

These assumptions included the following: (on page 17) an assumption that the existing ground rent portfolio could be securitised into a bond at a 26x multiple (producing net proceeds of £20m); (on page 18) an assumption that future ground rents could be securitised into a bond at a 26x multiple; and (on page 26) that Spartan provide seed investment to the residential fund by acquiring Project Royal as an initial portfolio at a cost to Spartan of £25m and then selling it into the fund for £28m.  Each of these assumptions feeds through into the cashflow which is used to generate the discounted cashflow figure of £45m as a valuation.  Since I have already concluded that none of these three assumptions was justified (and that Mr Leahy must have appreciated that), I accept that the representation that Mr Leahy believed the assumptions to be justified must itself be false.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones also suggested to Mr Leahy that the £22.5m figure (and the £45m valuation) was simply the number which Mr Watson liked the look of.  Mr Leahy denied this, giving a lengthy explanation that in an investment proposal like this, you are trying to figure out what the entry price should be, and that has to cater for two things.  First it has to generate a good return for the incoming investor based on the forecast cash flows, and second it has to be large enough to take out any existing partners.  You then put these two together, in an iterative process.  In the present case the £45m figure achieved both these things: it achieved a sensible return for the incoming investor of around 30%, and it was also enough to buy out Mr Richardson.  I accept his account of what he was trying to do and the two objectives he had, but I do not think this quite answers Ms Jones’ point.  I have concluded above that Mr Watson and Mr Leahy did not genuinely think it would cost £22.5m to buy out Mr Richardson’s interests, but that it was a figure that it was hoped would generate enough to clean up other outstanding matters with him (the American Apparel loan).  The £22.5m figure itself initially came from the 16 March version of the presentation where it was presented as the supposed cost of buying Mr Richardson’s half-share of Abacus (£15.3m) and the cost of paying off the Berryblue loan (£7.2m).  When the presentation was revised on 26 March to present the transaction as simply buying out Mr Watson’s partner’s 50% interest, the price for doing so was put at £22.5m, and it seems probable that this was because Mr Watson did want the entry price to be this high so as to enable him to deal with Mr Richardson.  Mr Leahy was I consider indeed trying to produce cashflows which could make this entry price look like one that produced a healthy return for an incoming investor.  That was why for example he did not go with the £35m equity required for Project Royal, as it did not produce a large enough return.  In other words I accept the submission that in essence Mr Leahy was trying to produce cashflows that could be used to justify the entry price of £22.5m that Mr Watson wanted, and that in doing so to some extent he used assumptions that could not be justified by the evidence he had had from Mr Astor, as he must have appreciated.</p>

I will have to look at that below, but even if that is right it does not affect my overall conclusion that the 1 April presentation was a thoroughly misleading and deceitful document.  It presented Spartan as a collection of assets and opportunities owned jointly by Mr Watson and his partner in which the proposal was that Sir Owen’s interests invest £22.5m to step into the shoes of Mr Watson’s partner by acquiring his 50% interest.  The reality was that Mr Richardson was only interested in the ground rent business of Abacus and Homeground and had no interest or rights in relation to affordable housing or the proposed residential fund, and was only presented as a co-owner of everything to justify the entry price of £22.5m, this being put forward as 50% of what Spartan was worth, the valuation of £45m itself being bolstered by a number of unjustifiable statements.  This was designed so that Sir Owen and his side would see £22.5m being paid out to buy the 50% share, while it could in fact be used to buy Mr Richardson out, pay off the Berryblue loan and clean up the American Apparel loan, the latter two being for Mr Watson’s benefit.  The central deceit was effectively accepted by Mr Leahy in oral evidence as follows:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By 14 April the strategy had changed.  As explained by Mr Leahy in an e-mail of that date to Mr Armitage the plan now was to <span style="font-style:italic">“bring NR on-side re. the 22.5mn receipt.”  </span> On 18 April Mr Leahy set out some proposals in two papers headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Berryblue Proposals”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“Real Estate Joint Venture Proposal”</span>.  The background to these was that under the current discussions with M&amp;G, M&amp;G were understood to be likely to deliver c. £18.8m to the partners in Abacus, that is £9.4m each for Berryblue (Mr Richardson) and Gaucin (Mr Watson), for their interests in the Abacus portfolio and Homeground.  Since however Gaucin owed Berryblue £7.5m on the Berryblue loan, the total that Berryblue would receive from the M&amp;G deal would be £16.9m.  In the two papers it was suggested instead that the JV should buy the Abacus portfolio and their interests in Homeground, matching the M&amp;G deal, and sell the assets on to M&amp;G.  In that way Berryblue would again receive £9.4m for its share.  Instead of simply paying it £7.5m to discharge the Berryblue loan however, the proposal was that Berryblue would receive £13.1m (described as <span style="font-style:italic">“additional £13.1mn Goodwill Payment”</span>).  In exchange for receiving it, Mr Richardson would receive an additional £1m, taking his total receipts to £17.9m (ie £9.4m for his share in Abacus, £7.5m for the Berryblue loan and £1m additional), and return the balance of £4.6m (ie £13.1m – (£7.5m + £1m)) by some process to be determined.  The reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">“additional £13.1mn Goodwill Payment”</span> is to the difference between the £22.5m to be paid and the £9.4m of that actually required to buy out Mr Richardson.  In other words what Mr Leahy was proposing was that in return for Mr Richardson agreeing to appear to receive the entire £22.5m (but in fact returning £4.6m of it to Mr Watson) he would be paid £1m.  Indeed in the Real Estate Proposal there is a reference to discussions with the vendors (that is of Berryblue, ie Mr Richardson) as follows:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote1non-I" style="margin-right:0.30in">“Per discussions with vendors, balance of value, which amounts to a total of £13.1mn, has been agreed to be paid to Berryblue as part of the JV’s purchase of 50% share in GR portfolio (“Goodwill Payment”), on the basis that value can be returned to appropriate parties through alternative means – ie <span style="font-weight:bold">Berryblue to receive £4.9mn + £13.1mn = £22.5mn in cash.</span>”</p>

	<level>

Mr Leahy (although saying this was an internal document, and that it never progressed very far) indeed appeared to accept in cross-examination that this was his draft of how Mr Richardson was going to be brought on side, and that Kea would see £22.5m going to Mr Richardson for his half share in the assets, while behind the scenes the loan would be paid off and the £4.6m returned to Mr Watson; Mr Watson (although also saying that these were ideas that were being bounced around and didn’t eventuate) accepted that you could interpret this proposal as being in effect that Mr Richardson would look as if he was receiving the £22.5m for his 50% interest but he would only keep the £9.4m plus the loan repayment and an extra £1m as some kind of inducement.</p>

That is I think inaccurate: what the spreadsheet shows is the positions Mr Watson would end up in depending on what the M&amp;G deal was worth.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to this was that Long Harbour had been pursuing a possible deal with M&amp;G for some time, since at least January 2012 (paragraph 235(1) above).  Mr Watson was naturally interested in what this might mean, not only because it involved a sale to M&amp;G of Abacus’s existing portfolio (in which he was interested through Gaucin) but also because M&amp;G was interested in an ongoing relationship in the form of an “offtake” arrangement (also called an origination agreement) under which Long Harbour would originate and manage future ground rents for M&amp;G, and Mr Watson had a 1/3 interest in profits from any new ground rent investments (paragraph 86 above).  Thus for example on 2 April 2012, when he was preparing for a trip to the Dominican Republic where he had been invited by Sir Owen to play golf, he asked Mr Gibson to bring him <span style="font-style:italic">“a full analysis of the m&amp;g deal and what it delivers to the management co.”</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Watson arrived in the Dominican Republic on 13 April 2012 and was there with Sir Owen for about 3 days.  During that time they spoke about a number of things.  Mr Watson’s evidence was that this included the possibility of the M&amp;G deal.  I think there is little doubt that Mr Watson did speak to Sir Owen about M&amp;G as on 15 April he got Mr Idicula to send him detailed information on M&amp;G which he sent on to Sir Owen.  There is no documentary record of what Mr Watson might have said, but his evidence was that he raised the possibility of Spartan acquiring a piece of the management company.  Sir Owen denied this when it was put to him, but he accepted that if he was to proceed on any front with Long Harbour, his proposal was that he have a percentage shareholding in that company, and in general his recollection of what was discussed was (understandably) quite vague.  I consider it probable that Mr Watson did raise the possibility of Spartan acquiring a part of the company which would manage M&amp;G’s investments in ground rents if that happened, not least because that could provide another source of profit to him, and that Sir Owen was interested in, if not indeed excited by, the suggestion.  </p>

On the face of it, as Mr Leahy accepted in evidence, the proposal was that the vendors should be Messrs Astor and Aumonier alone and the purchaser Spartan; Mr Watson however had an equal interest in the profits of the ground rent business and it may have been that the actual intention even at this stage was a sale by the three of them equally – it is not I think necessary to resolve this question.  </p>

On 14 May they were told that the relevant individual at M&amp;G was waiting for one more sign-off but felt confident they could move ahead with the deal; Mr Leahy’s reaction was to tell Mr Watson that they needed to be careful that whatever was signed did not hold back what they were doing (that is with Spartan); Mr Watson agreed and told him to keep close to Mr Astor.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By 22 May however Mr Leahy was working on a different proposal for the sale of a share in LHRF.  This was that the bulk of the share to be sold to Spartan should come from Mr Watson’s 33.3% interest with the aim that after the sale Mr Watson (through a combination of his remaining interest and his half-share in Spartan’s interest) would still be on equal terms with each of Mr Astor and Mr Aumonier.  This was designed to allay a concern that Mr Astor had that Mr Watson should not end up with a larger share of the company than he and Mr Aumonier.  Mr Leahy’s first iteration of this on 22 May had Mr Watson sell Spartan 22.2% and Messrs Astor and Aumonier 5.6% each (making a total of 33.4% of which Mr Watson would pick up 16.7%), thereby leaving Messrs Astor and Aumonier with 27.8% each, and Mr Watson the same (11.1% + 16.7%, making 27.8%).  His second iteration, which he proposed to Mr Astor later that day, was that Mr Watson sell Spartan 26.7% and Messrs Astor and Aumonier 6.7% each (making a total of 40%), thereby leaving Messrs Astor and Aumonier with 26.7% each, and again the same for Mr Watson (6.7% + 20%, making 26.7%).  Mr Leahy proposed a price of 30% at a £12m valuation, and 10% at a £17.5m valuation (that is £3.6m + £1.75m, making £5.35m for 40%, equivalent to a valuation of £13.375m for the whole).  Since Mr Watson on this scenario was selling 26.7% to Spartan and acquiring (through Spartan) 20%, it is evident that Mr Watson was selling more than he was buying and that it was no longer in his interest to keep the price down, but to push it up.  Mr Leahy asked Mr Astor: </p>

He also asked Mr Astor for the latest draft of Project Antarctica and the origination deal, saying that the quicker they could get these sorted, the sooner he could sit down with Kea and show them the new deal.  Mr Astor sent it that evening: this referred to LHRF having agreed a £250m origination contract with M&amp;G, and for LHRF to continue to acquire residential freeholds for a period of 4 years for Spartan <span style="font-style:italic">“where expressly permitted by the Long Harbour/M&amp;G Term Sheet”</span> but on a non-exclusive basis; and to continue to do so after 4 years subject to no further agreement with M&amp;G continuing.  </p>

Mr Leahy then suggested 30% at £12m and 12% at a £17.5m valuation, saying <span style="font-style:italic">“Let me know if you are happy with that, I will see if we can squeeze it out of them.”</span>  Mr Astor however repeated that they did not want to sell any further shares, just an increased valuation.  Mr Leahy said he would see what he could do but <span style="font-style:italic">“assuming we can’t get higher valuation than this, are you ok on the terms described previously?” </span>and on the afternoon of 28 May sent a further draft of the Term Sheet (now called the Project South Sea Term Sheet) which had Messrs Astor and Aumonier selling 40% of LHRF to Spartan for £5.35m.  Then on 29 May he e-mailed Mr Astor as follows:</p>

In the event the proposal put to Kea (Mr Dickson and Mr Maislish) on 30 May was that 40% of LHRF be acquired for <span style="font-style:italic">“up to £8m”</span>; and by 8 July when a draft of the Project South Sea Term Sheet was provided to Messrs Miller and Dickson, the proposal was that 40% be acquired for £7m. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Both Mr Watson and Mr Leahy were asked about these various proposals.  Mr Watson said that he pushed Mr Astor to get a better deal for Spartan; Mr Leahy said that he was trying to get the price as low as possible.  That seems to me impossible to reconcile with the e-mails and I cannot accept this evidence.  Since Mr Watson under the most recent iteration was selling 26.7% to Spartan and acquiring (through Spartan) 20%, Mr Watson was selling more than he was buying and it was no longer in his interest to keep the price down, but to push it up (paragraph 281 above).  Mr Leahy accepted this to be the case <span style="font-style:italic">“on day one”</span> but said this was not necessarily the case going forwards as Mr Watson was a 50% shareholder in Spartan, his evidence being echoed in a submission by Mr McCaughran that as a matter of mathematics Mr Watson benefited <span style="font-style:italic">“in the short term”</span> by an increase in the price to be paid by Spartan, but this was not what was going on.  I do not understand this.  It seems to me that Mr Watson would benefit from a higher price, and that there would be no ongoing disadvantage to him.  Mr Leahy said he found it difficult to say whether he was acting for one side or the other and that he was just trying to get a deal across the line; I find that he was certainly not acting in Kea’s interests and trying to keep the price down, but was trying to find a price that he could persuade Messrs Dickson and Miller to pay – this is what he meant by <span style="font-style:italic">“squeez[ing] it out of them”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“getting this across the line”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“what we are shooting for”</span>.   </p>

She relied first on the loss of the LH Investment Right.  The original proposal in relation to ground rents, as presented in the 1 April presentation and the draft Term Sheet, was that by buying into Spartan Kea would acquire not only an interest in the existing portfolio in Abacus but also the LH Investment Right.  This was responsible for the majority of the discounted cashflow valuation of Spartan as presented in the 1 April presentation.  The cashflows were premised on Spartan having an exclusive right to continue to work with Long Harbour on all future ground rent portfolios, amounting to a c. £40m annual pipeline of future purchases, and leverage of 75%, meaning an annual deployment by Spartan of £10m, or £100m over 10 years, and a return of £210.5m over the same period, or profits of £110.5m over 10 years.</p>

And the opportunity to acquire 40% of LHRF could not begin to make up the loss of the LH Investment Right: on 4 June Mr Leahy produced cashflows for LHRF based on M&amp;G buying £300m of ground rents over 4 years which he estimated to produce a net income for LHRF; on this basis Spartan would have 40% of that, or £12.9m (but would have to pay over £5m for this); and this was nowhere near the cashflows projected for the LH Investment Right.  </p>

This was based on Mr Leahy’s evidence that he had already discussed with Mr Dickson the potential M&amp;G deal and its consequences (namely that the origination agreement would generate value in LHRF, that Spartan could acquire a share in LHRF, and that Spartan could still deploy capital into acquiring ground rents, albeit behind M&amp;G), but initially with a view to Spartan acquiring the Abacus portfolio from Gaucin and Berryblue, and then subsequently selling it on to M&amp;G; and that when in his 28 May e-mail he said that the revised structure was commercially the same, the comparison he was making was between this understanding of what would happen if the M&amp;G deal closed after Spartan had acquired the assets, and the revised deal under which the assets would be sold direct to M&amp;G.</p>

First, it is a clear demonstration of what Mr Leahy meant by <span style="font-style:italic">“goodwill”</span>, namely what Spartan would be paying for over and above the Abacus assets, which was in effect access to various other opportunities.  That is why he described the M&amp;G deal as putting clear numbers on the value of the Abacus assets, and hence on the <span style="font-style:italic">“implied goodwill being paid by Spartan”</span>, this being the £24m difference between the £45m to be paid by Spartan and the £21m value placed on the Abacus assets by the M&amp;G deal.  Second, it confirms that the previous proposal involved the acquisition of the Berryblue assets for £22.5m, that is that the price to be paid to Berryblue was both for Berryblue’s Abacus assets and for half the goodwill – this is confirmed by the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“Buying Berryblue assets for £22.5mn (including the goodwill price)…the rightful true asset value (excluding goodwill) of £10.5mn”</span>, and the reference to the advantage of not doing this being that it avoided stamp duty issues, namely the risk that HMRC would treat the whole of the £22.5m payable to Berryblue and Gaucin as the price for their assets, not attributing any of it to goodwill, and hence as stampable.  Third, it explains the new transaction as attaching the goodwill payment to the acquisition of South Sea from its holders, this being the two 50% owners of Newco, of which Holder 1 was a Mr Watson entity (it being proposed that Spartan acquire Holder 1’s 50% interest in Newco <span style="font-style:italic">“in form of EW ownership in Spartan” </span>such that post deal, <span style="font-style:italic">“Kea and EW Entity will have 50-50 holding”</span>).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Leahy said several times in oral evidence that he could not remember the details of the meeting and did not precisely recall it, nor did he have any notes of it that he could look back on.  But he denied that Holder 2 was Berryblue – they had made it very clear that Berryblue was no longer a part of the transaction and Holder 2 was intended to be another Park entity related to Mr Watson, and although it didn’t say that anywhere in the <span style="font-style:italic">“Changes to Proposals”</span> document, it was <span style="font-style:italic">“inherent in the discussion”</span>.  He said he wouldn’t have said what Mr Maislish said he did, for two reasons; first, it was not the case at the time – Mr Watson was still concerned that Mr Richardson might look to participate in some of the value so Mr Leahy might have mentioned that he might participate but he wouldn’t have said that he was going to be the owner in its entirety; and second, Mr Maislish’s account did not make sense as he thought Mr Dickson and Mr Miller knew full well that it was Mr Richardson.</p>

For this, Mr McCaughran referred to a document which Mr Maislish produced from his files.  This is a copy of the first draft of the Term Sheet for Project Spartan (as sent by Mr Leahy to Mr Dickson and Mr Miller on 9 May) with extensive manuscript markings, one of which identifies Berryblue as <span style="font-style:italic">“Neil Richardson”</span> and another of which notes <span style="font-style:italic">“NR selling assets of Berry Blue Not Berry Blue – no legacy issues as buying assets”</span>.  Mr Maislish’s evidence was that the writing was not his; he thought that it was either Mr Dickson’s or Mr Miller’s and that it was likely he had swept up the notes at the end of one of the meetings he had had on 11, 14 or 15 May.  Mr McCaughran suggested that that meant that Mr Maislish had been at a meeting at which Mr Richardson’s name had been mentioned and therefore that he already knew the name.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>I do not accept this suggestion.  The handwriting appears in fact to be that of Mr Dickson (this was not disputed).  He was noting on a copy of the first draft Term Sheet the change to purchasing the assets of Berryblue as opposed to its shares.  In an e-mail to Mr Dickson of Sunday 13 May Mr Leahy referred to this change and said <span style="font-style:italic">“we went through that in our meeting”</span> and given the timing, that must I think be a reference to a meeting that Mr Dickson had with Mr Leahy on 11 May (before meeting Mr Maislish).  In the circumstances I think it most likely that Mr Dickson made the manuscript notes at that meeting on 11 May.  Mr Maislish was not present at that meeting.  Accepting therefore that this document shows that Mr Dickson knew the name of Mr Richardson, and that Mr Maislish probably swept it up at the end of one of his meetings with Mr Dickson, I nevertheless agree with Ms Jones that it does not establish that Mr Maislish was present at a meeting at which Mr Richardson’s name was mentioned, or undermine Mr Maislish’s evidence, which was to the effect that he did not recollect the name being said and that he did not recall the name Richardson at all.</p>

I find therefore that all that has been established is that Mr Dickson (and possibly Mr Miller) knew Mr Richardson’s name, not that Mr Maislish did.   It might seem odd that Mr Dickson knew Mr Richardson’s name and did not tell Mr Maislish, but Mr Maislish’s account of Mr Dickson telling him not to concern himself about it (in oral evidence he said that Mr Dickson, who was sitting on his left, obviously knew all about it because he raised his hand and said <span style="font-style:italic">“David, it is okay” </span>and so he moved on) rings true and is consistent with his evidence that in both Project Edsel and Project Spartan his instructions were not to get involved in the commercial merits of the transactions.  I accept that this however does not affect the point that it would have made no sense for Mr Leahy to say that they did not want Kea knowing the name of the partner when Mr Dickson already knew it.  This is a point I come back to below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Mr McCaughran’s next point was that Mr Maislish could not have understood that Mr Watson and his existing partner were each contributing half the business that Kea was funding Spartan to acquire, and that the £12m shown on the document (or £12.5m as it in due course became) was going to the partner.  He knew that Spartan was a new joint venture company being set up to acquire assets; that Gaucin and Berryblue owned the Abacus assets, but the Ladoga Investment Right was owned by an Eric Watson vehicle (and Mr Dickson had told him this was very valuable); that it was intended that Spartan would invest in residential property with Long Harbour using Mr Watson’s relationship with Long Harbour; and that the £12m (or £12.5m) was for goodwill, which would have included the goodwill for the Ladoga Investment Right and the access to residential property deals.  He cannot therefore have understood that the goodwill payment would be going to Mr Watson’s partner as on the information he had, that partner had no apparent interest in the rights and opportunities that were the subject of the revised Spartan deal.  Although he had said in his witness statement that he understood that after the revision to the deal to take account of the sale of the Abacus assets to M&amp;G, Kea would pay some £12.5m to enable Spartan to acquire assets from a third party, in oral evidence he said he could not remember what assets he was referring to as he did not have the transaction in his head any more; and when it was put to him that it must have occurred to him that the £12.5m payment could not all be going to the owner of Berryblue, he said that he did not remember what occurred to him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>I accept that Mr Maislish had material, had he thought it was a matter he needed to concern himself with, which might have given him reason to query why the £12.5m was still going to Mr Watson’s partner.  But I do not think that is a reason to reject his evidence that he thought the payment was still going to Mr Watson’s partner.  I do not find it surprising that he could not when giving oral evidence reconstruct what he understood would be acquired from the partner; indeed he said at one point that when Mr Leahy explained why the revised proposal was really the same, <span style="font-style:italic">“it was going, as far as I was concerned, at 100 miles an hour”</span>. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>What appears however from Mr Leahy’s <span style="font-style:italic">“Changes to Proposal”</span> document – and hence what Mr Leahy would, I find, have explained at the meeting – was (i) that previously the £22.5m was going to Berryblue, of which part represented payment for the Abacus assets and part for goodwill; (ii) that the Abacus assets would no longer be acquired but the payment for goodwill would still be made; (iii) that the goodwill payment would now be used to acquire Project South Sea, that is Newco (or its assets); (iv) that Newco was owned by two 50% owners, of whom Holder 1 was a Mr Watson entity (identified as Park, as Mr Maislish wrote down) and Holder 2 was not identified as such.  I see nothing improbable in Mr Maislish understanding from this that the payment of £12/£12.5m for goodwill going to Holder 2 was going to Mr Watson’s partner, just as it would have done when the payment of £22.5m was going to go to Berryblue.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>I can deal with Mr McCaughran’s next point very briefly.  This relied on a typed note that Mr Maislish made in preparation for the meeting on 15 May which referred to Park incorporating Newco, which would acquire an investment right (that is the Ladoga Investment Right) and enter a joint venture (that is Project South Sea with LHRF) and that Spartan would buy Newco or its assets.  This note therefore is completely silent as to the involvement of Berryblue, and Mr McCaughran said it suggested that Spartan would acquire Newco or its assets from Park.  But whatever Mr Maislish might have understood or thought when he prepared his typed note, by the time of the meeting on 30 May the proposed transaction was clearly presented as one under which Newco would have two separate owners, who were indeed to be treated differently.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Mr McCaughran also made the point that Mr Miller’s evidence did not support Mr Maislish’s account.  Mr Miller was not at the meeting on 30 May but in his witness statement he said that Mr Dickson updated him after the meeting and that one of the key points was that Mr Watson’s partner would be removed from the transaction and all the goodwill value would be going to Mr Watson’s interests.  I am however unable to place any reliance on this evidence.  First it was not Mr Leahy’s evidence that he had expressly said this – what he said was that it was <span style="font-style:italic">“inherent”</span> in the discussion, which I take to mean that it was not expressly said.  Second, when Mr Miller was asked in oral evidence whether he recalled Mr Dickson passing on to him what Mr Maislish said had been said, he answered <span style="font-style:italic">“Generally that’s the context of what my understanding was”</span>.  Mr McCaughran said that no attempt was made to explore this further or put to him clearly that his witness statement was wrong, but I am satisfied that this is an example of how little reliance can be placed on Mr Miller’s written evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My findings are as follows.  I start with a disposition to accept Mr Maislish’s evidence: he was apparently credible, and has no particular reason to do anything other than give his genuine recollection, and the very fact that in other respects he could not remember details makes it more likely that he is reliable when he says that he has a clear recollection of this particular matter.  I see no reason therefore to doubt that Mr Leahy told Mr Maislish that Newco would be owned by Park and another – this is what Mr Maislish wrote down, twice; it is also effectively what the diagram on Mr Leahy’s document shows, where Holder 1 is presented as an EW entity and Holder 2 is not.  I also see no reason to doubt Mr Maislish’s evidence that he asked who the other was – as he said that was not because he thought it was important but it was just a natural part of the conversation – or that Mr Leahy did not tell him and Mr Dickson said it was okay, and that as a result Mr Maislish did not pursue the point.  The only question that is of any difficulty is whether Mr Leahy said that it was Mr Watson’s partner, but that they did not want to give his name.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At this point it is worth asking why Holder 2 was introduced into the transaction at all.  If it had been intended to explain that all the goodwill would now be going to Mr Watson and his interests, it is difficult to see why Holder 2 would be needed: Park was going to incorporate Newco, so Spartan could have simply bought Newco from Park.  But there is no doubt that Mr Leahy was anxious that Newco should be presented as having two equal owners, not just be owned by Park: not only is this what the diagram on his document shows, but he sent an e-mail to Mr Gibson on the evening of 29 May reminding him that he needed to set up Newco <span style="font-style:italic">“and it’s appropriate shareholdings asap”</span>; Grant Thornton, who gave tax advice to Novatrust in its capacity as trustee of Park on 7 June, had also been given to understand that Newco would initially be owned by Park but that a third party would then acquire a 50% interest for a nominal consideration.  The obvious inference is that Mr Leahy wanted Newco to have two equal owners because he wanted to be able to present the new proposals as consistent with the previous proposals: under the previous proposals half the £45m value of Spartan (£45m) was (ostensibly) going to go to Berryblue, in part for the Abacus assets and in part for goodwill, and now that Spartan was no longer going to purchase the Abacus assets, it would be consistent for Mr Watson’s partner to receive the same goodwill payment.  Having two equal holders allowed Mr Leahy to present the goodwill as going equally to two different parties, and hence half the goodwill as continuing to go somewhere else than to Mr Watson, namely to his partner.  It will be recalled that he had earlier expressed the view that they wanted Sir Owen to see the whole £22.5m going to Mr Richardson, and that <span style="font-style:italic">“JV is unwilling to pay EW-associated vehicles any goodwill for any assets”</span> (paragraphs 235(5) and 256 above) and it seems to me unlikely that he would have done anything to suggest that the goodwill was going to Mr Watson’s interests, or anywhere other than to Mr Watson’s existing partner (there being no hint of a suggestion that anyone else was involved).    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In these circumstances, I accept Mr Maislish’s evidence and find that when Mr Maislish asked who the other was, Mr Leahy said words to the effect that it was Mr Watson’s partner.  I am more doubtful if Mr Leahy went on to give the explanation that Mr Maislish ascribed to him, namely that they did not want any chance of Kea and this person having any contact, because I see the force of the point that this would make no sense if Mr Dickson, to Mr Leahy’s knowledge, already knew Mr Richardson’s name (which he did), and I therefore make no finding to that effect.  But that does not detract from my finding that Mr Leahy gave Mr Maislish to understand that Holder 2 was Mr Watson’s existing partner.  As such that statement was untrue and known by him to be untrue as it was not intended that Mr Richardson would receive the benefit of the payment for goodwill.</p>

Mr Miller thanked Mr Leahy for the amended Term Sheets, and asked him to send <span style="font-style:italic">“the latest business model showing all cash flows and projections”</span>.  Mr Leahy replied with two documents.  One he described as <span style="font-style:italic">“the main Spartan business model, which is the same as the original that was provided”</span>, although he went on to explain that in the light of the M&amp;G deal, the quantum of the ground rent investment would be likely to change.  The document he sent was headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Overall returns summary”</span>, and was a copy of a document that he had first provided to Mr Miller on 30 March 2012.  It contained lines for <span style="font-style:italic">“Equity Return for OG”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“Equity Return for EW”</span> which show the equity returns being split equally.  The Claimants’ pleaded case is that there is no reference on this document to an additional £12.5m profit being made by Mr Watson, and this is said to be a representation that the only profits which Mr Watson and his interests would make from the Spartan joint venture would be the dividends which Novatrust would receive on its proposed 50% shareholding in Spartan.</p>

Moreover it does not purport to do anything other than reproduce what the original business model was.  I do not think it can fairly be read as saying anything about the £12.5m not being received by Mr Watson – it is simply silent on the destination of the £12.5m, and it does not claim to say anything about the initial transaction in setting up Spartan.     </p>

The purpose of the e-mail was to give an <span style="font-style:italic">“Explanation on cash paid”</span> by reference to the Term Sheets.  It assumed that Gaucin and Berryblue would receive £10m each from the M&amp;G deal so the amount paid for Newco would be £25m, and it included the line:</p>

That was saying no more than the diagram on Mr Leahy’s <span style="font-style:italic">“Changes to Proposal”</span> document with its depiction of Holder 1 and Holder 2.  The 7 June e-mail however by itself said nothing about who the owner of the other half would be.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were two Term Sheets.  The explanation for this is that although Messrs Astor and Aumonier would have been content to grant the Project South Sea rights (that is the right to buy shares in LHRF and the right to invest in ground rents behind M&amp;G) direct to Spartan, and the initial draft Term Sheet had been drafted by Mr Astor on this basis, Mr Watson and Mr Leahy wanted those rights put into a separate company (Newco), so that Newco could be sold into Spartan in return for the goodwill payment.  On 28 May therefore Mr Leahy told Mr Astor that South Sea <span style="font-style:italic">“might not be directly with Spartan, possibly a separate vehicle but that doesn’t impact the commercials of what we are agreeing”</span> and on 4 June the relevant Term Sheet was redrafted to substitute NewCo as the grantee of the rights (now an option to acquire 40% of LHRF for £5.35m) instead of Spartan.  That still left Messrs Watson and Leahy with a problem, however, which was that Messrs Astor and Aumonier wanted to see the Spartan Term Sheet (as noted by Mr Leahy in a file note on 25 May).  Mr Leahy and Mr Watson however did not want to show Messrs Astor and Aumonier the whole deal as they did not want to disclose to them the goodwill payment; if they had done, Mr Astor might have wanted some of that payment.  The solution, as foreshadowed in Mr Leahy’s file note of 25 May, was to have two Term Sheets, one dealing with the initial steps (which could be shown to Messrs Astor and Aumonier) and the other with the goodwill payment.</p>

As in Term Sheet 1, there was then provision in respect of Spartan’s business, for Kea to carry out due diligence and confirm that it was satisfied, and for the parties to negotiate documentation in good faith.</p>

This is entirely in line with the way the revised proposal had been presented by Mr Leahy at the meeting on 30 May with Holder 1 and Holder 2 owning Newco equally.  But Term Sheet 2 does not say anything about who the recipient of the cash would be, and I do not think it can be read as representing that the recipient would be Mr Watson’s business partner.  On the basis of my finding that this is what Mr Leahy told Mr Maislish on 30 May, it can fairly be said that the Term Sheet left that uncorrected, but I do not think it can be treated as repeating it.</p>

Up until 28 May the proposal was that Kea pay £22.5m to acquire a half share in Spartan (Spartan being valued at £45m), the £22.5m being represented as the expected cost of buying out Mr Watson’s existing 50% partner, whereas the real cost was expected to be very much less; under the revised deal from 28 May onwards, the proposal was that Kea pay for the goodwill element alone (c. £12m or £12.5m), which was represented as going to one of the two 50% owners of Newco, namely Holder 2 as shown on Mr Leahy’s diagram (paragraph 296 above), and Mr Leahy told Mr Maislish that this was Mr Watson’s partner (paragraph 304 above), whereas the real intention was that the goodwill payment would benefit Mr Watson.  I will come back to the question whether Messrs Miller and Dickson were deceived by these misrepresentations or not at the time of entering into the July agreements after considering the matters relied on in the period down to 24 July. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Jones invited me to find that Mr Watson’s 4 July e-mail was a misleading account of his conversation with Sir Owen, designed to be used by Mr Leahy for his e-mail to Messrs Miller and Dickson.  Mr Watson did not claim to have any recollection of the conversation but said he believed his e-mail to be an accurate record, and that he would have been very keen on promoting Voltaire to Sir Owen.  I agree however that it is unlikely that in the course of a relatively short telephone conversation (Mr Watson said his records showed it took 20 minutes) Sir Owen would have expressed enthusiasm either about increasing the investment in Spartan to £100m+ or about putting £100m+ into Voltaire; that seems inconsistent with his 27 July e-mail which reveals him as both conscious of being excluded from any involvement in the decision making and anxious that Messrs Miller and Dickson proceed cautiously.  It seems to me probable, and I find, that Mr Watson did give a misleading account of his conversation in his e-mail, and that it was indeed written to be sent to Messrs Miller and Dickson with a view to persuading them to increase Kea’s investment from £50m to £200m.</p>

This had provided that after the sale of Abacus to M&amp;G by Summit, Park would procure Summit to make a loan to Spartan of <span style="font-style:italic">“up to”</span> the amount of the sale proceeds received by Summit (paragraph 311 above).  The proposal as put to Mr Dickson and Mr Maislish on 29 and 30 May had been that Mr Watson would contribute cash equivalent to the sale proceeds of Abacus, then assumed to be likely to be about £10.5m, as shown on Mr Leahy’s <span style="font-style:italic">Changes to Proposal </span>document (paragraph 296 above).  But the wording of Term Sheet 1 specified only that it would be up to that amount, and the Step Plan envisaged that this might be £2.5m to £5m; in the event what was agreed at the Los Angeles meetings was £3.5m.</p>

The Step Plan then dealt with the proposed purchase by Newco of 40% of LHRF, which was contemplated as taking place immediately after Spartan had acquired Newco.  In support of that Mr Leahy provided a draft of the Project South Sea Term Sheet; this was drafted as an agreement between Newco and Messrs Astor and Aumonier (referred to as “Management”) under which Management, which had established LHRF, agreed that Newco should have the option to acquire 40% of LHRF for £7m.  It is noticeable (i) that the Term Sheet is expressly subject to contract and hence not legally binding; (ii) that the Term Sheet presents the vendors of the 40% interest as Messrs Astor and Aumonier without any reference to Mr Watson being one of the vendors (and in fact the principal vendor); and (iii) that the price for 40% was now £7m (compared to the £5.35m proposed by Mr Leahy on 28 May and the £6m that <span style="font-style:italic">“we are shooting for”</span> on 1 April (paragraph 284 above)).    </p>

On 11 July Mr Leahy e-mailed Mr Gibson asking him to set up bank accounts for Spartan as soon as possible, ideally that week before Kea bought in as 50% partner as they wanted to avoid all the KYC on Kea.  Ms Jones invited me to find that the potential difficulty was that Sir Owen was still shown as UBO of Kea, and that no-one wanted to disclose to Sir Owen exactly what was going on.  Mr Leahy clearly did think that doing KYC on Kea would be a problem: he repeated to Mr Gibson in further e-mails on 11 July and 12 July that he wanted to get moving while only they were the shareholders (in Spartan) and that they needed to get moving so that for the KYC the banks were only seeing Park.  It was also put to him in oral evidence that the desire to sign Kea up and get its money in quickly was all aimed at getting as much money out of the trust as they could before Sir Owen could take proceedings, to which he replied: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sir Owen’s relationship with Messrs Miller and Dickson had deteriorated sharply by 15 April 2012 (paragraph 38 above).  Mr Watson was in the Dominican Republic playing golf with him at around this time (paragraph 273 above), and Sir Owen’s evidence was that he explained to Mr Watson that he had lost all confidence in Messrs Miller and Dickson and felt he had been tricked into the position where all the proceeds of sale of his business were in their hands and he had no control over them.  Mr Watson denied this but he accepted in oral evidence that he had a lot of conversations with Sir Owen at that time, and that he certainly learnt that Sir Owen was not happy with the way Messrs Miller and Dickson were not listening to his recommendations and was clearly upset and frustrated with them because they would not do what he wanted; and that the relationship was becoming very acrimonious.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The breakdown of his relationship with Mr Miller had an impact on Sir Owen’s health: on 18 April, shortly after Mr Watson had left the Dominican Republic, Sir Owen was admitted to hospital there with raised blood sugar.  Sir Owen confided in Mr Watson, telling him he was suffering anxiety attacks and that his doctor told him it was stress related, and on 19 April that although his health was normal, the underlying cause for the stress was still there and suggested that Mr Watson keep on arms’ length terms with Mr Miller.  Later that day he sent an e-mail to Mr Hamilton suggesting a meeting in Los Angeles with Mr Miller on 2 May and that it would be useful to have a litigation attorney there, the objective being to<span style="font-style:italic"> “shake DJM’s cage”</span> and force him to replace Mr Dickson, or for both him and Mr Dickson to retire or alternatively <span style="font-style:italic">“consider an action against them for misinformation and fraud”</span>.  Although not openly copied into the e-mail, Mr Watson received a copy (no doubt by being blind copied in), as on the same day he forwarded it to Mr Leahy.  He and Mr Leahy therefore knew from 19 April that relations between Sir Owen and Mr Miller had reached a stage at which Sir Owen was actively contemplating litigation with Mr Miller and Mr Dickson on the grounds of misinformation and fraud.</p>

	    <p class="Judgmentpara">Sir Owen came to London in early May.  Mr Watson had gone to some lengths to arrange meetings and social events for him.  Among other things Sir Owen had asked Mr Watson when he was in the Dominican Republic to introduce him to some solicitors in London.  Mr Watson asked Mr Gibson to set up a meeting for him with Mr Reuben of Fladgates, and it took place on 3 May.  As well as Sir Owen, Mr Watson and Mr Gibson were there, and three Fladgates representatives (Mr Reuben, Mr David Way (a trust and private client partner) and Ms Ella Leonard).  An attendance note (no doubt made by Ms Leonard) showed that the meeting was taken up with the trust matters, with Sir Owen wanting to know what his rights were and what he should do, and that there was discussion of potential litigation, possibly in the Nevis courts.  An engagement letter from Mr Reuben dated 17 May to Sir Owen confirmed that he had instructed them to act on his behalf in relation to his relationship with the Corona Trust and specifically that he was concerned that the acts of the trustee and protector were not in the interests of the beneficiaries, and mentioned that the matter was likely to involve litigation in Nevis, and possibly elsewhere.  Mr Watson said in his witness statement that he spent much of the meeting reading and sending e-mails on his mobile and that at some point he left the meeting, but it seems probable that he understood at the very least that Sir Owen was asking for advice on what he could do in the circumstances, and that the dispute with Messrs Miller and Dickson had reached the stage when litigation was a real possibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Reuben in his engagement letter also raised the question of a possible conflict of interest given that Fladgates were acting for the other party in Project Spartan which was being considered by the trustee; he said that he had already discussed this both with Sir Owen and the other party to Project Spartan and had explained that if a conflict arose, he would cease to act for Sir Owen but the remainder of the team (Mr Way and others in the litigation department) would continue to act for him.  Mr Reuben had in fact spoken to Mr Gibson on 14 May about whether he should attend a meeting the next day between Mr Way and Sir Owen’s tax advisor, and told him (as reported by Mr Gibson to Mr Watson) that:</p>

Mr Brownbill followed it up with an e-mail to Mr Reuben (who had evidently been on the call) raising the question whether Voltaire should be put on hold, and in terms which make it clear that at that stage freezing orders were contemplated and that he had given advice about the effect of intended injunctions on future and existing transactions.  Mr Reuben replied that he would recall that Fladgates were involved in the Spartan deal and that they were about to become involved in Voltaire.  The next day Mr Watson told Mr Gibson and Mr Leahy that he had asked Sir Owen to replace Fladgates as Mr Reuben was conflicted, adding <span style="font-style:italic">“This will happen”</span>.  Sir Owen sent Mr Reuben an e-mail on 20 July confirming that Mr Watson had suggested that his continued representation bordered on a conflict and making it clear that he was not happy as they had discussed it in some detail and Mr Reuben had convinced him he did not see any conflict, and it was a waste of his time and resources.

Mr Dickson however was going to be on holiday that week and was not planning to sign anything before he was back on 24 July.  Mr Leahy told him and Mr Miller that delaying signing until then could create problems on Project Royal as they had been putting off due diligence whilst they waited for the operating capital from Spartan and if they delayed further they could risk losing the deal.  He suggested signing soft copies in the meantime and wiring an initial £100,000, or just wiring it anyway.  The suggestion that Project Royal was at risk was untrue, as Mr Leahy told Ms Huggett (<span style="font-style:italic">“Ignore the comments below – this was getting them to hurry up with the wire”</span>); but it worked as Mr Dickson agreed to remit the £100,000 before signing. </p>

Mr Dickson duly sent an e-mail to Mr Watson saying that the maximum the trust could commit to Voltaire would be $20m, as the second £50m Spartan loan had denuded the ability to invest any more at that time; Mr Watson replied that $20m was fine and they would do their best to keep the opportunity open to allow him to increase the $20m, to which Mr Dickson said that <span style="font-style:italic">“If we can squeeze out more later, we will.”</span></p>

Again this was a change from the provision in Term Sheet 1 which had provided that the £50m loan would be secured against the assets of Spartan.  By clause 4 of the Security Deed, Kea could only enforce the charge after the conclusion of an Orderly Winding Up of Spartan and if there then remained any sums outstanding.  Since an Orderly Winding Up was defined as a procedure whereby Spartan’s board had implemented a sale down process to ensure all of its assets were sold, it is not obvious that there were any circumstances in which the charge was likely to be of any benefit to Kea as by the time it came to be enforced, it is likely that Spartan would have no assets and the shares no value.</p>

But under the July agreements (i) Kea was not acquiring an interest in any existing business, as the only existing business (Abacus) was to be sold to M&amp;G; (ii) Kea was not buying out an existing partner as Mr Richardson was in effect selling all his interests to M&amp;G; (iii) Spartan had no existing rights or assets of any kind, as Newco was still negotiating the joint venture arrangement with LHRF; Atherton, which was said to hold the Ladoga Investment Right, had not in fact acquired it; and although there had been discussion of Spartan seeding a residential fund (Project Royal) and acquiring an interest in the management company, there were no enforceable rights to any of this; and (iv) the rights that Newco was intended to acquire (and in effect what Kea was paying £12.5m for) were dependent on Newco paying <span style="font-style:italic">“up to £8m”</span> for <span style="font-style:italic">“up to 40%”</span> in LHRF.

(In fact paragraph 4 did not specify any particular amount of the loan, the amount being left to be agreed between Park and Kea).  Moreover Mr Watson stood to benefit from (i) the goodwill payment of £12.5m; (ii) the bulk of the <span style="font-style:italic">“up to £8m”</span> to be paid by Newco for its stake in LHRF; (iii) any investments made by Spartan through Long Harbour or Voltaire; and (iv) the obligation for Spartan to enter into a consultancy agreement with Nucopia (on the basis that although ostensibly owned by Mr Leahy he would in fact benefit from the (bulk of) such payments).  Again I accept this submission; and I further accept that the deal delivered a very large number of benefits to Mr Watson, and was very far from the proportionate sort of deal that Sir Owen had made it clear that he wanted.</p>

The most significant of these are the various representations as to what was to happen to Kea’s payment to buy into Spartan, initially £22.5m and after 28 May c. £12m or £12.5m (which I will refer to as <span style="font-weight:bold">“the £12.5m”</span>).  The various misrepresentations to this effect that I have found proved are: (i) representations in the 1 April presentation that the £22.5m which Sir Owen and his interests would be required to pay (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the £22.5m”</span>) was intended and expected to be invested in order to buy out Mr Watson’s existing partner and paid out to that partner’s vehicle, and that current discussions with Mr Watson’s existing partner suggested that his interest could be acquired for around £22.5m (paragraphs 232 to 241 above); (ii) representations in the various drafts of the Term Sheets prepared by Mr Leahy (or as redrafted by Mr Maislish and not corrected by Mr Leahy) that it was contemplated that Kea would make an investment of £22.5m, all of which sum was required to buy out and would be used to buy out Berryblue, or the assets of Berryblue (paragraphs 264 to 269 above); and (iii) a representation by Mr Leahy at the meeting with Mr Dickson and Mr Maislish on 30 May that it was intended that Newco would be owned by Park and its or Mr Watson’s existing partner (paragraphs 299 to 304 above).  In each case I have found that these representations were made, were untrue and were known to be untrue.</p>

On the contrary, as I have sought to show above, elaborate lengths were gone to to make it look first as if the £22.5m was going to be used to buy out Mr Watson’s partner, or to acquire Berryblue or its assets; and then that the £12.5m was going to one of two equal holders of Newco, the other being Park.   </p>

It was made on behalf of Novatrust in the derivative action brought by Novatrust (see paragraph 2 above) for the purposes of Novatrust’s opposition to an application by Kea and Harlaw challenging the jurisdiction of the English court.  Mr Leahy had been asked by Novatrust to give an account of Project Spartan.  When explaining the original proposal presented to Sir Owen on his yacht, he said that the £22.5m was:</p>

The value of the existing ground rent portfolio was around £20 million. Accordingly, the original deal had Corona / Kea paying £10 million for 50% of that portfolio, with the balance of the £22.5 million (£12.5 million) being an agreed payment for its 50% share of the Goodwill Value which Novatrust (through Mr. Watson and his network of connections) was bringing to Spartan.”</p>

Nor is it possible to reconcile with the contemporaneous documents: in particular it does not explain how the 1 April presentation could suggest that the £22.5m was expected to be used to buy out Mr Watson’s partner, or how the draft Term Sheets could indicate that the £22.5m would be used to acquire Berryblue or its assets; nor is it consistent with Mr Leahy’s explanation to Mr Armitage on 6 April that they simply wanted Sir Owen to see £22.5m being paid out to buy Mr Richardson’s 50% share (paragraph 235(5) above).  It may have contained some truth in revealing that <span style="font-style:italic">from Mr Watson’s perspective</span> the original proposal was intended to deliver a goodwill payment of about £12.5m to his entities; but the suggestion that this was something understood by Kea is impossible to reconcile with Mr Leahy’s explanation in his Real Estate paper of 18 April that the JV was unwilling to pay EW-associated entities any goodwill for any assets (paragraph 256 above).</p>

In response Mr Watson pleaded that Mr Leahy had calculated £22.5m by ascribing half the value of the assets it was proposed Spartan would hold to Berryblue, because Mr Watson believed that Berryblue had the potential ability to inhibit the exercise of the Ladoga Investment Right, and that: </p>

He gave a similar explanation as to the reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">“owners of Newco”</span> in the draft Term Sheets; and as to why Mr Gibson was instructed to have Newco set up with two owners.  I find it impossible to accept this explanation.  What Mr Leahy presented to Mr Maislish on 30 May (and to Mr Dickson on 29 May) was a proposal under which Newco would have two equal owners, one being Park.  Mr Watson’s explanation that having the second owner was to cater for the unlikely possibility of having to accommodate Mr Richardson makes no real sense, quite apart from the fact that I am satisfied that Mr Richardson had long since been brought on side anyway.  </p>

He relied on three matters in particular: (1) meetings that Mr Watson and Mr Leahy had with Mr Dickson in Paris on 23 October 2012 and with Mr Miller in London on 31 October and 1 November 2012; (2) a telephone call between Mr Leahy and Mr Dickson on 16 November 2012; and (3) a revised Business Plan drafted by Mr Leahy and initially provided to Mr Dickson and Mr Maislish on 8 December 2012.  </p>

This indicated that the M&amp;G acquisition of Abacus had closed with total net proceeds to Gaucin and Berryblue of c. £19.5m, meaning that the price for Newco was estimated at c. £25.5m and that Kea’s cash payment would be c. £12.74m rather than £12.5m.  It said nothing about the ownership of Newco or who would receive the £12.74m.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That does not itself resolve whether it was accurate or deliberately inaccurate.  Mr McCaughran said that at that date the issue of the destination of the £12.5m had not arisen so there was no reason for Mr Leahy to be misleading about it, but as Ms Jones pointed out, the question of who was going to receive the £12.5m, and what Messrs Miller and Dickson were or were not told about it, had obviously been and continued to be a matter of significant concern.  Mr Watson and Mr Leahy were undoubtedly concerned as to the possible impact of Sir Owen’s proceedings on Kea’s investment in Spartan, and I take the view that it is not all unlikely that they thought it might be helpful to be able to point to material demonstrating that Messrs Miller and Dickson had been told of the destination of the £12.5m and had agreed to it.  </p>

First, the e-mail is written as if what it records (or purports to record) is that Messrs Miller and Dickson had been told for the first time that the cash was going to Park/Watson entities and that this was a change (see the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“now”</span> the ultimate beneficial owner, and <span style="font-style:italic">“re-allocation”</span>).  That is very difficult to reconcile with the case now being put forward that Messrs Miller and Dickson appreciated the likely destination of the £12.5m before the July agreements were signed, and indeed supports the Claimants’ case that they did not know in July that the payment would (in all probability) go to Mr Watson.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, there is nothing in writing from Mr Leahy to Messrs Miller and Dickson at or around the time of these meetings confirming that this is what was going to happen.  When asked about this, Mr Leahy referred to the revised Business Plan, but this was not sent until over a month later; and in any event does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> clearly state that the £12.5m would go to Watson entities (see below).     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, as again Ms Jones pointed out, the steps to ensure that Newco (or Rygen as it became) had two equal owners continued after this date.  As appears above (paragraph 323) Rygen had been established by EH&amp;P with a nominee holding 100% of the shares for Munil, the intention being to sell 50% to Park.  That agreement was not signed until 21 December 2012 (although backdated to 1 December 2012).  If by that stage Messrs Miller and Dickson understood that Rygen was effectively 100% owned by Watson interests and the £12.5m would all go to Park/Watson entities, it is not obvious why these arrangements would still need to be put in place.</p>

On 8 December Fladgates circulated the participants, including Mr Dickson and Mr Maislish, with a package of documents in preparation for the meeting.  This included a draft of the revised Shareholders’ Agreement, attaching the revised Business Plan.  It also included a covering letter from Mr Dan Morrison of Grosvenor Law explaining the rationale for the proposed amendments to the Shareholders’ Agreement: under the existing version, if Spartan were to become deadlocked for any reason, Spartan would not be in a position to continue with its Business Plan, but under the revised version, Spartan could continue to carry on executing its Business Plan notwithstanding a deadlock.  For this purpose the Business Plan had been revised to provide clarity of the projects Spartan was looking to invest in.</p>

I do not accept this.  It is true that the box marked Park and Related Entities includes Newco Owner (in the singular).  But it had been intended since the revision to the transaction at the end of May that Newco should have two equal owners, one of which would be Park, and that Park should receive £12.5m for its 50% share of Newco to be left outstanding as a vendor’s loan.  The arrow from Newco Owner to Spartan refers to this vendor’s loan, and does not refer to the £12.5m cash for the other 50%.  That is shown as going to Newco, which is shown separately.  The diagram seems to me at best ambiguous – it is to my mind consistent with the transaction as presented by Mr Leahy to Mr Dickson and Mr Maislish on 30 May and incorporated into the Term Sheets and the July agreements under which Park was to be a 50% owner of Newco and receive 50% of the consideration (left outstanding as a vendor’s loan) and Holder 2 would be the other 50% owner and receive its half of the consideration in cash.  The diagram does not to my mind say anything about who the recipient of that cash will be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover there is a revealing contrast with the corresponding diagram in an earlier draft by Mr Leahy of the revised Business Plan which was not circulated.  This is very similar but here there is a dotted line from the box marked Newco (below Spartan) to the box marked Park and Related Entities (to the right of Spartan), and the latter contains boxes marked Summit and Newco Owners (in the plural).  That to my mind did make it clear that both Newco Owners were Park or related entities; and the dotted line reinforces that by linking the Newco box (and hence the receipt of the £12.7m cash) with the Park and Related Entities box.  The obvious question is why Mr Leahy removed these features of the diagram.  He was asked but could not explain it, suggesting only that maybe he had thought it unnecessary.  I regard that as wholly unconvincing, and I have not been able to think of a good reason why Mr Leahy should have deliberately altered the diagram in the way he did, which had the effect of making it more obscure.  I accept Ms Jones’ submission that the most plausible explanation is that Mr Leahy wanted to create a paper trail that could later be pointed to, while not being explicit.  It is notable that the reference in the text to the changes do refer to Spartan no longer buying Gaucin or Berryblue and the original partners in the form of Berryblue and its shareholders no longer being part of the structure or transactions but do <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> say that the £12.5m payment is now going to Park and related entities.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McCaughran referred to the fact that Mr Maislish accepted in cross-examination that the diagram in the revised Business Plan (as sent to him on 12 December which was in the same form as circulated on 8 December) stood out from the page, would have been very helpful, and made it absolutely clear that Park and related entities owned Newco.  But Mr Maislish said he had no recollection of it at all.  He accepted that he did read through the redline version of the revised Shareholders’ Agreement sent to him on 8 December as he made manuscript notes on it.  However although he made notes on various other parts of it, his note on the revised Business Plan (schedule 2) was: </p>

I therefore accept Mr Maislish’s evidence that he did not in fact consider the revised Business Plan when first sent to him (and the redline version which he did consider did not in fact contain the relevant diagram in any event).  Mr McCaughran relied on the fact that Mr Maislish later passed on to Fladgates a minor textual amendment suggested by Mr Dickson to the revised Business Plan, and that he accepted that he would have checked that Fladgates had duly incorporated it (as they did), and submitted that it was more likely than not that he would have read through at least one version of the revised Business Plan.  I think that unlikely – it is a dense and detailed document and having been told it was not for him, I see no reason why he should have troubled to read through it, and it would have been easy enough to check that the minor amendment had been made without doing so.  That means that Mr Maislish’s acceptance of what the revised Business Plan shows is not a reflection of what he thought at the time, but what he now thinks it shows, and as such I do not regard it as carrying any particular weight.  </p>

In those circumstances, and in circumstances where I have not felt able to trust any of the oral evidence or Mr Leahy’s e-mails to Mr Watson, I am left quite uncertain what Mr Watson and Mr Leahy did tell them.  I am not persuaded that they were told, or did understand, in the autumn of 2012 that the £12.5m would now be going to Watson entities, and on the balance of probabilities I find that they were not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McCaughran made the point that Mr Leahy would scarcely have drafted the revised Business Plan in the way he did (referring to the owners of Berryblue no longer being part of the structure or transactions) if he and Mr Watson had successfully deceived Messrs Miller and Dickson as to the destination of the £12.5m.  I have given careful thought to this point.  The most likely explanation I think is as follows.  By this stage Mr Watson and Mr Leahy were very confident that Messrs Miller and Dickson had been so persuaded by them of the merits of Spartan that they were very keen to pursue it.  Indeed the threats posed to Spartan by Sir Owen’s litigation had made them all the keener to press on with Spartan and try to prevent it being derailed, Mr Dickson for example describing the impetus for the proposed amendments in an e-mail of 5 December to Mr Maislish as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In other words Messrs Miller and Dickson saw Kea’s interests as being to pursue Spartan, and the effect of Sir Owen’s litigation against Mr Miller had been to drive them to align themselves closely with Mr Watson and Mr Leahy who also wished to progress Spartan.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In those circumstances I think Mr Leahy and Mr Watson were confident that if necessary they could persuade Messrs Miller and Dickson that it did not matter that the owners of Berryblue were no longer part of the transaction as it did not affect the fundamentals of the deal: Kea had always been going to pay for goodwill and was still going to pay the same and it did not matter who it had been re-allocated to.  It is noticeable that Mr Watson and Mr Leahy had a dim view of Messrs Miller and Dickson’s critical abilities: on 17 July Mr Leahy had described Mr Dickson in an e-mail to Mr Watson as <span style="font-style:italic">“incredibly lazy about the whole thing”</span> and said (in relation to completing the agreements on 24 July)<span style="font-style:italic">“I don’t imagine either of them will have given it much thought”</span>; again on 18 July he said in another e-mail to Mr Watson <span style="font-style:italic">“These two are unbelievably lazy about the whole thing”</span>.  By the time of the revised Business Plan, I think Mr Leahy thought (with some justification) there would be little difficulty in persuading them to continue with Spartan despite any re-allocation of the goodwill.  Mr Miller in his evidence did come across as genuinely enthusiastic about Spartan, although he found it difficult to explain why he thought it was worth paying £12.5m for it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McCaughran also made the point that Mr Leahy and Mr Watson would scarcely have provided the revised Business Plan to Mr Maislish (as Mr Leahy and Fladgates did on more than one occasion) if they had previously sought to deceive him.  Mr Leahy had in fact been very reluctant for Mr Maislish to give any advice to Kea at this stage (as is apparent from the notes of a meeting on 31 October 2012 in which Mr Leahy suggested variously that Mr Dickson was taking advice from Spartan; that it would cause a timing issue; that maybe they should get a different lawyer for Kea; that a lawyer wearing a lender hat would see things that they would not like, and asking if they could look at it just from a shareholder perspective; and that perhaps Mr Morrison could advise Kea).  But I also consider that Mr Leahy understood that Mr Maislish was not expected by Messrs Miller and Dickson to concern himself with the underlying commercial terms but with the legalities; and again that if any question had been raised by him (which it was not) the matter would have been explained as a re-allocation.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the final analysis the evidence in relation to the autumn of 2012 does not cause me to change my provisional view as to what Mr Dickson understood in July.  I find that Mr Dickson did not understand at any stage before executing the July agreements that the £12.5m would be going, or would be very likely to be going, to Mr Watson’s interests.  That involves not only rejecting the evidence of Mr Watson and Mr Leahy but also that of Mr Miller, but I have already said that I have not felt able to regard any of this evidence as reliable.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I can deal much more shortly with the other elements of the deceit claim.  First, there is on the pleadings a question as to whether all the representations made by Mr Leahy were made on behalf of both Novatrust and Mr Watson, Mr Watson’s pleaded case being that the 1 April presentation was made on behalf of him but not Novatrust (as Mr Watson had not yet decided which entity to use), and that later representations were made on behalf of Novatrust but not Mr Watson.  These points were not pressed in Mr Watson’s closing submissions, but I will deal with them briefly.  The latter point seems to me plainly unsustainable: Mr Leahy was at all time acting not only for the benefit of Mr Watson (who stood to benefit from Project Spartan in a number of ways) but worked very closely with him, seeking his instructions, direction and approval, and in his own words was part of a <span style="font-style:italic">“team”</span> acting for Mr Watson, saying for example in answer to one question:</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I do not think there is any doubt that any representations made by Mr Leahy throughout the period from the 1 April presentation to the signing of the July agreements were made on behalf of Mr Watson even once Novatrust had been identified as the other contracting party.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to whether the representations in the 1 April presentation were made on behalf of Novatrust, again I do not think there is any difficulty.  Novatrust may not have been identified by 1 April as the vehicle that Mr Watson would use (although the proposal at that stage did in fact involve Novatrust, in its capacity as trustee of Summit, selling Gaucin to Spartan), but Novatrust (in its capacity as trustee of Park) had been identified as the vehicle to be used by 17 April 2012, and had been told the bare outlines of the transaction.  At that date nothing had been said to correct the representations in the 1 April presentation and on general principles the representations were therefore continuing.  I do not see why the representations initially made on 1 April in order to induce a contract with an as yet unidentified vehicle should not be regarded as continuing to be made on and after 17 April when the vehicle was identified as Novatrust, and hence as being from that date made on behalf of Novatrust.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also a requirement that the representations be made with the intention that they be acted upon.  Again I do not think there is any difficulty about that.  The whole purpose of the way in which the 1 April presentation was drafted was to make it look as if Sir Owen was being asked to provide the £22.5m to buy out Mr Watson’s existing partner.  As submitted by Ms Jones, when taken with the statement that current discussions suggested that the partner could be bought out for £22.5m, that provided support for the valuation of £45m.  That was why the reference to the Berryblue loan was taken out of the presentation, Mr Leahy accepting that Mr Watson: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.30in;text-indent:-0.08in">“did not want to put that loan into the presentation precisely because he thought it would upset the negotiation position with Owen.” </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As Mr Leahy said, what they wanted Sir Owen to see was the £22.5m being paid out to buy Mr Richardson’s share, and they can only have wanted him to see that because they understood that that would help induce him to approve the transaction.  The suggestion that the £22.5m was expected and intended to be paid out to acquire his 50% share also indicated that Mr Watson’s 50% share was equally worth £22.5m, and hence that he would be contributing equally with Sir Owen.  Mr Watson and Mr Leahy knew that Sir Owen thought he had been too generous to Mr Watson on Project Edsel and wanted other deals to be done on a proportionist basis.  That was why Mr Leahy commented that the JV was unwilling to pay any goodwill to EW-associated vehicles (paragraph 256 above).  And the various steps taken to make it look as if the whole £22.5m was going to Mr Richardson (and later that the £12.5m was going to Mr Watson’s partner as one of the two 50% owners of Newco), including setting up Rygen with two equal owners, long after the July agreements had been concluded, only make sense if Mr Watson and his team continued to think it material to do that.  I have no doubt in the circumstances that Mr Watson and Mr Leahy understood their representations to be material and intended them to be relied upon.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next question is whether Mr Dickson was induced to enter into the July agreements by the representations.  (Both parties had a tendency to ask this question by reference to whether Mr Dickson <span style="font-style:italic">“relied”</span> on the representations,  but strictly the better formulation of the law is I think whether he was <span style="font-style:italic">“induced”</span> by them).  Ms Jones pointed out that there is a presumption of inducement in a case where a false statement has been made: see <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>(32<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> edn, 2015) at §7-040:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the former submission, Mr Miller gave some evidence to that effect, but I do not accept it.  It seems to me to underplay the effect of the 1 April presentation which, as Ms Jones submitted, was the platform on which everything else was built.  The whole purpose of Mr Leahy flying out to the Bahamas and presenting the 1 April presentation to Sir Owen was to persuade him to give his go-ahead to the deal, which he did in his e-mail of 2 April saying that he had given his approval to proceed with the purchase of the existing partner’s shares (paragraph 230(7) above).  It seems to me a reasonable inference that if the presentation had not represented that the £22.5m was expected to be needed for that purpose he would not have done so.  The fact, relied on by Mr McCaughran, that Sir Owen had forgotten by April 2013 that any up front payment was to be made at all, does not mean that it was not something that was material and that induced him to agree to proceed in April 2012.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as Messrs Miller and Dickson are concerned, I think it is too simplistic to take one element of the transaction (who was going to end up receiving the £12.5m?) and look at it in isolation as if it stood on its own.  The 1 April presentation was carefully constructed so that the various parts of it reinforced each other.  Thus the valuation of £45m, which justified asking Sir Owen / Kea to pay £22.5m for a 50% share, was supported and reinforced by the statement that it was expected that the £22.5m was going to be used to buy out Mr Watson’s 50% partner, and that current discussions suggested that this would be possible.  That set the value for Spartan at £45m and Kea’s entry price to acquire 50% of Spartan at £22.5m.  Since Messrs Miller and Dickson never obtained any valuation of their own of the rights and opportunities that Spartan would give Kea, it is impossible to believe that the representation that that was what was expected to be needed to buy out Mr Watson’s partner did not form part of the material inducing them to proceed at that price – that was the whole purpose of including it.  At any rate the presumption that Mr Dickson was so induced has not in my judgment been rebutted.  And once the entry price of £22.5m had been set, that became the source of the calculation of the £12.5m which was the price for what was left of Spartan after the M&amp;G acquisition.  In that way the initial deceit in the 1 April presentation led directly to Mr Dickson agreeing to pay the £12.5m.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Quite apart from that, there is material showing that Messrs Miller and Dickson were just as keen as Sir Owen to see that Mr Watson was not getting disproportionate benefits from a deal.  In relation to Project Edsel they had agreed with Sir Owen that he was being generous to Mr Watson, and Mr Dickson had said that they could seek to moderate his return on future projects and <span style="font-style:italic">“sharpen our pencil”</span> (paragraph 107 above).  It was certainly Mr Leahy’s understanding that the Sir Owen side would not be willing to pay goodwill to Mr Watson associated entities; that is precisely why he initially pretended the £22.5m was all expected to go to Mr Watson’s partner for his 50% share, and later that the £12.5m which replaced it was going the same way.  I find that the presumption that these representations induced Mr Dickson has not been rebutted.</p>

There are three reasons why I do not accept this: (i) the point is not pleaded and Ms Jones objected to it on that basis; (ii) I have not been persuaded that Messrs Miller and Dickson did understand in the autumn of 2012 that the £12.5m would be going to Watson entities; and (iii) even if they did understand that, affirmation requires full knowledge of the material facts.  As set out above, the destination of the £12.5m was only part of the original deception and should not be looked at in isolation.  The original scheme involved Sir Owen’s interests paying £22.5m to participate in Project Spartan on the basis that that was what was expected to be needed to buy out Mr Watson’s 50% partner.  That deception was used to support the £45m valuation, which in turn formed the basis for the calculation of the £12.5m.  Even if Messrs Miller and Dickson understood in the autumn of 2012 that the £12.5m had been re-allocated to Mr Watson, there is nothing to suggest that they understood that the basis on which Kea had initially been asked to pay £22.5m was itself an entirely false basis.  I do not think they had the requisite full knowledge to affirm the agreements in autumn 2012; and I do not think Harlaw had the requisite full knowledge in April 2013 to affirm the agreements either.</p>

It follows that Kea was entitled to set aside the July agreements as having been induced by fraudulent misrepresentations.  Ms Jones submitted that if that were right, none of the subsequent agreements could stand, as they all proceeded on the basis that the July agreements were valid.  That seems to me to be right, and I did not understand Mr McCaughran to contend to the contrary.</p>

It also appears that it was essential for her to have a training contract in order to start the LPC course in October, as well of course as being essential to becoming a fully qualified solicitor.  It is also common knowledge that trainees are paid a reasonable salary, and no attempt was made to suggest, let alone establish, that that would not have been a significant amount.

In relation to some of the disputed trades, the LIA relied on a specific instance of actual undue influence, namely that Goldman Sachs improperly influenced the deputy chairman of the LIA by offering his younger brother a prestigious internship at the bank: see at [6], [10] and [162]-[194].

The claim was squarely put as a case of actual undue influence, and in such a case the influence has to be proved, and all that Rose J in the end decided was that it was not established on the facts: see at [190]-[193].  The claim was, for whatever reason, not put on the basis that the offer of the internship attracted the consequences of bribery, although both parties recognised that that might have been possible.  Thus Goldman Sachs accepted that the offer of, for example, a free holiday to a director or agent of a company in his personal capacity would be improper and give rise to other remedies, but submitted it would not amount to undue influence (at [165]); whereas the LIA submitted that while there were other causes of action by which a company could challenge a bribe to its director or agent, that did not preclude there being a claim for undue influence (at [166]).  In the light of her conclusion on the facts, Rose J did not have to decide this point of law; nor did she decide anything about whether the internship would in fact have attracted the consequences of bribery had that been the claim pleaded.  A case is of course only authority for what it decides, not what it does not decide, let alone what the parties have not even suggested that it should decide.</p>

I consider that that is to take too narrow a view.  The essence of the law of bribery is that a principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his agent, free from anything which gives rise to a realistic possibility of a conflict of interest.  See for example <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> at 1260G:</p>

It is available whenever, without his principal’s knowledge and consent, the agent has put himself in a position where his interest and duty may conflict. A principal is entitled to the disinterested advice of his agent free from the potentially corrupting influence of an interest of his own. Any such private interest, whether actual or contemplated, which is not known and consented to by his principal, disqualifies him.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question therefore is whether the agent has been offered something that gives rise to a realistic possibility of a conflict of interest.  I have not been shown any authority which confines this to the payment of money or the conferring of benefits of a monetary value, and I see no reason why it should be so confined.  No doubt in most cases that come before the courts the thing that gives rise to a realistic possibility of a conflict is the payment or promise of money or something equivalent, but it seems to me that anything that could realistically give rise to such a conflict ought to fall within the principle.  Most people after all are interested in many things other than money.  In my judgment the question is not whether the benefit takes the form of money or something with a monetary value but whether it is something that could realistically give rise to a possibility of a conflict of interest.</p>

I do not find this surprising.  It seems to me entirely natural for a father with a daughter of the age of Ms Dickson to wish to see her able to pursue her chosen profession; one cannot put a monetary value to the father on that, but for the law to take the view that it would therefore have been of no interest to him seems to me quite unrealistic.  Indeed I suspect that for many parents in Mr Dickson’s position seeing their children safely established in their own careers is something that is likely to be one of the things of most importance to them at that particular stage in their life.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the same reason, I do not think the benefit to him can be dismissed as trivial.  On the contrary, I find that it was something that could give rise to a realistic possibility of a conflict of interest.  Mr McCaughran said that Mr Watson had not promised that he would be able to secure a training contract only that he had offered to help try to find her one.  Ms Jones was in fact able to point to a statement by Mr Leahy that Mr Watson was embarrassed because he had <span style="font-style:italic">“promised to deliver a training contract” </span>(paragraph 328 above);  but in any event I do not think it matters.  Mr Watson had not been able to deliver on a training contract by 24 July, but he was evidently still hoping to be able to, and Mr Dickson no doubt hoped he would be able to assist – indeed Mr Leahy said he was getting worked up because he thought Mr Watson could deliver it.  Mr Watson’s agreement to assist his daughter, even if not a promise, seems to me something that is realistically capable of having the effect of undermining Mr Dickson’s single-minded loyalty to the interests of Kea (and hence the trust and the beneficiaries) and giving rise to a conflict of interest.  Those are precisely the circumstances that the rules against bribery are designed to address.</p>

In addition to the matters she relied on down to the closing of Project Edsel in February 2012, she referred to the way in which Mr Watson offered practical and emotional support to Sir Owen once he fell out with Mr Miller who had been his right-hand man for many years.  There is indeed plenty of evidence to that effect: Mr Watson had learned when in the Dominican Republic that Sir Owen was very unhappy with Mr Miller, appreciated that the relationship was becoming very acrimonious, and knew by 19 April that the stress had made Sir Owen unwell and that he was thinking of suing him for misinformation and fraud (paragraphs 340 to 341 above); and when Sir Owen came to London, Mr Watson arranged many meetings, both professional and social for him, including a meeting with Fladgates (paragraph 342 above).  Sir Owen’s evidence was that Mr Watson had been very supportive to him during this period, and this is reflected in an e-mail he sent Mr Watson on 11 May with the subject <span style="font-style:italic">“My gratitude”</span> in which he said:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not see that it did.  Although Sir Owen had initially said in his e-mail of 2 April to Mr Watson that he wished to be kept directly involved, by the time of the Dominican Republic trip, Sir Owen’s evidence was that he told Mr Watson that the use of the proceeds of sale of his business was out of his control; and Mr Watson said in evidence that Sir Owen encouraged him to deal with Messrs Miller and Dickson as they were the ones making the decisions.  Thereafter Mr Watson and Mr Leahy dealt with Messrs Miller and Dickson in relation to Project Spartan and not with Sir Owen; indeed one of Sir Owen’s complaints is that Mr Watson did not keep him informed as to what was going on, giving the impression that Messrs Miller and Dickson were dragging their feet.  But whether that is so or not, I do not see that the strength of the personal relationship between Mr Watson and Sir Owen and the emotional and practical support Mr Watson gave to Sir Owen in this period meant that Mr Watson came under fiduciary obligations to Sir Owen in relation to the negotiation of Project Spartan when it was known that that was being progressed not by Sir Owen but by Kea, and that it was something over which he had no control or even involvement.  However much Sir Owen was relying on Mr Watson for support generally, I do not see that he was relying on Mr Watson to look out for his interests in relation to Project Spartan.  In his e-mail of 27 July to Mr Miller he said that since he had been excluded from any involvement, he cautioned him to protect trust funds; and that he would not proceed with Voltaire without thorough due diligence (paragraph 333 above); that seems to me more consistent with his expecting Mr Miller to look out for the interests of the trust than expecting Mr Watson to.  In my judgment despite the increased support and friendship that Mr Watson showed him in the period from April 2012 onwards, Mr Watson did not owe Sir Owen a fiduciary duty in relation to Project Spartan any more than he did in relation to Project Edsel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as concerns Kea, Ms Jones relies in particular on the fact that at the time of the July agreements many of the underlying rights and projects had yet to be finalised and delivered, and that it was Mr Watson who had the relationships with the parties involved.  The rudimentary nature of the rights that Kea would be paying for under the schedule 2 transactions is quite striking.  As set out above (paragraph 352) paragraph 2 of schedule 2 to the Shareholders’ Agreement provided that if the M&amp;G acquisition happened, the transactions in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 would then take place; paragraph 5 provided that <span style="font-style:italic">“Once Newco acquires or owns the Newco Assets” </span>Spartan would acquire Newco or its assets for a sum of £45m less the net proceeds of sale of Gaucin and Berryblue (or their assets), a sum expected to be around £25m; and paragraph 6 obliged Kea to provide Spartan with a cash loan equal to half that amount.  The <span style="font-style:italic">“Newco Assets”</span> were defined as the assets or rights intended to be acquired by Newco as set out in paragraph 3; but paragraph 3 merely referred to Newco acquiring the benefit of a JV agreement with LHRF which would include:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That seems to me to fall directly within the principle that I have referred to above (paragraph 146) that where one joint venturer controls a relationship with a third party and the intention is that he should make use of the relationship to benefit the joint venture, then he may owe a fiduciary duty to his co-venturer not to use it for his own benefit.  In circumstances where Kea was dependent on Mr Watson negotiating an agreement between Newco (Rygen) and Long Harbour, which Spartan and hence Kea was going to pay for, Mr Watson in my judgment owed Kea a fiduciary duty to do that in the exclusive interests of Spartan (and hence Kea), and not to exploit that position for his own benefit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If that is right, there does not seem to be any doubt that Mr Watson was in breach of that duty.  A core aspect of a fiduciary duty is that the fiduciary is not at liberty to make any undisclosed profit for himself.  In the present case, Mr Watson at the time of the July agreements was not only intending to benefit from the receipt of the £12.5m (by having it paid to Munil), but also from the sale of LHRF to Rygen, where he was expected to be the vendor of the majority of the shares.  None of that was disclosed: on my findings of fact Messrs Miller and Dickson did not know that the £12.5m was going to Mr Watson’s interests.  Equally they did not know that Mr Watson was expected to be the vendor of LHRF shares to Rygen.  The highest it was put by Mr Miller was that he did not know for sure that part of the payment for LHRF would be going to Mr Watson, but he suspected that Mr Watson was involved with Messrs Astor and Aumonier; and in closing Mr McCaughran submitted that Mr Miller <span style="font-style:italic">“believed/suspected/assumed”</span> that Mr Watson would have an interest in LHRF and that he would receive part of the purchase price for the acquisition by Spartan of shares in LHRF.  Even if that were right (and I need not go into the detail of that) it would not constitute disclosure by Mr Watson of his interest.  Indeed Mr McCaughran very fairly accepted in terms in the course of his oral closing submissions that he had not sought to say that if there was a fiduciary duty in relation to Spartan everything that should have been disclosed was disclosed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I add for the sake of completeness that in the event Mr Watson never became a shareholder in LHRF in his own name, the shares being taken in the name of Ivory Castle Ltd, an entity ostensibly owned by a trust associated with Mr Gibson.  The Claimants’ case is that Ivory Castle is yet another nominee for Mr Watson, Mr Gibson simply acting as a placeholder for him.  Mr Watson’s case is that Mr Gibson was indeed the beneficial owner of the structure, that he had a longstanding arrangement under which Mr Gibson had a percentage interest in Mr Watson’s total net wealth, and that allowing Mr Gibson to have the LHRF shares was a means of fulfilling, at least in part, that understanding.  None of this in my judgment makes any difference, and I need not resolve who is right: on any view Mr Watson was potentially interested in the sale of LHRF in a way which was not disclosed.</p>

It is indeed difficult to see how Messrs Miller and Dickson could have thought that it was appropriate to enter into the July agreements.  But on the pleadings this claim is only advanced if Messrs Miller and Dickson realised that the effect of the July agreements was to transfer significant value to Mr Watson’s interests for no consideration.  On my findings of fact, this was not the case, and I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to consider the question on the hypothesis that the facts were different.  </p>

Her submission was that the real reason for going ahead with the July agreements was the desire to get money out of the trust and into Spartan before Sir Owen could take any steps to prevent it, and that that could not be a proper purpose.  There is I think considerable force in that submission: see Mr Leahy’s evidence in relation to the Los Angeles meetings on 10 and 11 July that they wanted to <span style="font-style:italic">“get the capital safe”</span> (paragraph 339 above).</p>

Again it is obvious – and Mr Miller accepted – that that was designed to prevent Mr Dickson being removed and replaced without Mr Watson’s consent, and was put in place because of the threat of litigation from Sir Owen.

As referred to above (paragraph 56) although Nucopia was ostensibly owned by Mr Leahy, Mr Watson took the vast majority of any receipts from it, and there is a dispute between the parties whether (as the Claimants contend) Nucopia is in truth simply Mr Watson’s vehicle, or whether (as Mr Watson contends) it is Mr Leahy’s vehicle but he was in practice constrained to share its receipts with Mr Watson.  For present purposes however I do not think that it matters.  What is undeniable is that Mr Watson directly benefited (and to a far greater extent than anyone else) from fees charged by Nucopia to Spartan, and it was no doubt always expected by him and Mr Leahy that he would do so.  </p>

To that end they provided for the appointment of an <span style="font-style:italic">“independent director”</span>  (in fact a company called Jupiter Directors One Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Jupiter”</span>), represented by a Mr Chris de Putron, who had previously acted in Mr Watson’s affairs) if there were two inquorate meetings; and if there were failure to agree on material issues (and in certain other circumstances) for a procedure called the <span style="font-style:italic">“Orderly Execution of Business Plan” </span>to be implemented.  If this were triggered, Nucopia would carry out the Orderly Execution over a 10 year term and be given full authority to do so.  Any loans from Kea would have their terms extended to the end of the 10 years, and Nucopia would be paid additional fees, expressed to be a monthly fee of 2% of the assets under management (although this may have been intended to be an annual fee of 2% paid monthly rather than as drafted an annual fee of 24%).  Provision was also made for the introduction of a new 5% shareholder called Genovela Ltd – this was intended to be the means of delivering the 5% carry that had been suggested for Nucopia.</p>

His own evidence to the Nevis Court was that he became aware of the injunction when he switched on his computer in the Philippines on the morning of Sunday 17 February and downloaded an enormous number of documents that had been sent to him.  The time zone for the Philippines is UTC + 8, which means that in February, when London is on GMT, Manila is 8 hours ahead.  Mr Leahy e-mailed the agreements to him at 16.56 London time on 17 February, which would therefore have been 00.56 on 18 February in Manila.

That is I think distinctly arguable but I need not resolve that, as even if that were not the case, the Loan Agreements were in my judgment in breach of paragraph 15 of the Order which restrained Kea from disposing of or dealing with or diminishing the value of any assets that it held (paragraph 478(6) above), the asset in question being the £16m sitting in Fladgates’ client account and the effect of Kea entering into the Loan Agreements being to release that money to Spartan.  I do not see how Mr Dickson could have had authority to cause Kea to breach the injunction in this way.  That seems to me quite sufficient to establish that he had no authority to execute the Loan Agreements on behalf of Kea once he knew of the injunction.  </p>

The obvious inference from his backdating of the documents to 11 February 2013 is that he did so in an attempt to circumvent the injunction, and that cannot possibly have been a proper purpose.  Mr Dickson was therefore acting in breach of s. 121 of the BVI Business Companies Act.  As already referred to, Mr McCaughran, while not formally admitting this, advanced no case to the contrary.</p>

There was otherwise no rush as the money itself was already at Fladgates, and was not due to be paid over until completion of the acquisition of Rygen; the amount of the Third Kea Loan had not been settled; and the Second Kea Loan was meant to be matched by an equal loan of £3.5m from Summit.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is apparent that Mr Leahy had spoken to Mr Dickson on Saturday 16 February, as he refers to it in his e-mail that evening to Ms Leonard and said that Mr Dickson was expecting the documents (paragraph 488(1) above).  That e-mail was sent at 20.45 London time, which was 04.45 on 17 February in Manila.  It seems to me that the most likely explanation for Mr Leahy sending the e-mail is that Mr Dickson had switched on his computer in the Philippines at some time between getting in the previous evening and 04.45, found the injunction, and spoken to Mr Leahy asking him for the documents.  (That is not necessarily inconsistent with Mr Dickson’s statement that he became aware of the injunction on the morning of 17 February, but for obvious reasons I place little weight on his statement.)  If he did that, it seems to me very probable that he would have explained to Mr Leahy why he wanted them.  Everyone had been concerned at a possible injunction for weeks, and I think it highly improbable that Mr Dickson would have just asked for the documents without explaining why.  Mr Leahy was clearly told of the Court Order at some time before 21 February, but was unable to say when he first learned of it, but I find on the balance of probabilities that he did learn of the injunction on 16 February.  That means that he knew when he received the agreements back signed by Mr Dickson and put his signature as witness to them that Mr Dickson had executed them after learning of the injunction and in order to defeat it.  </p>

If Mr Dickson told them of the Order, as he plainly did, it seems very unlikely that he would have pretended that all it did was require him to supply information and not explain that it was the injunction which they had been anticipating.  </p>

She gave judgment on 27 August 2013 in favour of Mrs Connah and made an Order removing Pizarro as trustee of various trusts, including the Corona Trust, and replacing it with HNL as sole trustee, and removing Messrs Miller and Dickson from all their offices and positions under the trust.  She was critical of their actions, finding that Mr Dickson had resisted giving a clear and detailed account of the trust to the beneficiaries, and that it was patently obvious that what was foremost in the minds of Mr Dickson and Mr Miller was not the interest of the beneficiaries but the interest of the trustee.  </p>

To take a concrete example, I have found that Mr Dickson executed the Second and Third Kea Loan Agreements after knowing of the Nevis injunction and hence for an improper purpose, which was a breach of the duty owed by Mr Dickson as director to Kea.  Mr McCaughran submits however that Kea can no longer sue him for this breach: cl 3.1 must have the effect that any company owned by the Corona Trust such as Kea could not sue him because any other interpretation would mean that he was not released in any meaningful sense.  The agreement is governed by California law and its meaning and effect is therefore a matter for that law, but I will assume that Mr McCaughran is or may be right that the agreement by Sir Owen and HNL to release Mr Dickson prevents Kea (formerly owned by the Corona Trust and now owned by Sir Owen) from suing him as well.</p>

Just as a principal might wish to ratify the contract with the third party but preserve his rights against the agent, there are circumstances (such as the present case) where he might wish to abandon or compromise his rights against the agent but preserve the right to claim as against the third party that the contract was unauthorised.  I do not see why he should not be equally able to do that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If that is right, and in my judgment it is, the only remaining question is what the effect of the mutual general release in the 23 May 2014 agreement was.  As before this is technically a question of California law, but no attempt was made to suggest that there were any particular principles of California law that applied, and I therefore proceed on the assumption that California law is the same as English law.  Construing the agreement on this basis I see nothing in the relevant clause which says anything at all about ratifying or adopting any contract or other transaction: it is all about releasing claims against the relevant parties (who do not include Mr Watson or the other Defendants to this action).  I therefore reject Mr McCaughran’s submission that the Settlement Agreement has any bearing on the claims in this action. </p>

The Claimants also advanced a separate tracing claim under which Kea claimed to be entitled to trace into and make a proprietary claim to such part of the Munil Money as was retained by Munil in its accounts and to any assets held by Munil which are the traceable product of any part of the Munil Money.  Kea also asserted tracing claims (i) against any assets obtained by use of the Munil money and held by Mr Watson and (ii) against a particular property in Richmond, Surrey said to have been acquired with the traceable product of the Munil Money and held by Mr Watson and Mr Gibson as trustees of a trust known as the Richmond Trust.

That is of course duplicative of the common law claim for money had and received or restitution, but has this difference, namely that it enables Kea to claim interest not just under s. 35A of the Senior Courts Act 1981 but under the equitable jurisdiction of the Court.  There was no dispute that this was so, Mr McCaughran expressly accepting in his oral closing submissions that if the claim against Spartan to set aside the agreements was well-founded, so that the agreements would not only be set aside by agreement but could have been set aside for legal reasons, he would not dispute that there would have been a claim for interest as well, and that would have been a claim either under the equitable jurisdiction of the Court or for statutory interest under s. 35A of the Senior Courts Act. </p>

As has just been explained, Kea had a claim against Spartan to make it account as constructive trustee for the £129m and equitable interest.  But Kea always expected that Spartan would be unable to pay the entirety of that sum.  The claim for equitable compensation is a claim against Mr Watson for breach of fiduciary duty if the total recoverable from Spartan and the other parties falls short of that claim.  The way it was explained by Ms Jones in her closing submissions was as follows:</p>

This seems to me to be justified in principle.  The primary remedy where a fiduciary has failed in breach of duty to disclose his interest in a transaction with his principal is to set aside the transaction and restore the parties to the position they were in.  It is however well established that if this cannot be done, the fiduciary can come under a liability to pay equitable compensation in lieu, the locus classicus being <span style="font-style:italic">Nocton v Lord Ashburton </span>[1914] AC 392, and I see no reason to doubt that the same applies if the claimant does set aside the agreement but is unable to receive back from the counterparty all the sums paid under it with interest.  I did not understand Mr McCaughran to advance any reason why equitable compensation should not in principle be awarded if I found, as I have, that Mr Watson was in breach of a fiduciary duty.

I accept that the borrowing rate, which has been said to be suitable in commercial cases, is not necessarily suitable in all types of case (see Hildyard J’s detailed analysis of this point in <span style="font-style:italic">Challinor v Bellis</span>) and that where the claimant that is out of pocket is a trustee that would otherwise have invested in proper trustee investments, the appropriate rate would not be the borrowing rate but a rate to reflect the return on such investments.  I also accept that this would apply to Kea which although not itself a trustee is a vehicle for trustee investment.  However I do not see that this affects the principle that in assessing such a rate the Court adopts a broad brush approach based on what a person with the general characteristics of the claimant might have received by way of investment on trustee investments, not a rate that reflects what the individual claimant would itself have done.  </p>

I would accept, by analogy with what Forbes J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Tate &amp; Lyle v GLC</span>, that the Court could take into account the general characteristics of the trust in question, so if large private trusts were shown to earn higher investment returns than small ones that could be taken into account, but I do not accept that under this jurisdiction the Court would have regard to what the claimant itself would have done or its particular appetite for investments.</p>

There is no objection to the proposed pleading in paragraph 265B (3% above base rate), but Mr McCaughran opposes the proposed pleading in paragraph 265A (8%).  Having decided that this is not open to the Claimants on the current pleading, I agree with Mr McCaughran that it should not be permitted.  By the time the draft pleading was produced, the trial was well under way.  There had been nothing to alert the Defendants that the claim was going to be put in this way – Ms Jones accepted that nowhere in her opening did it suggest that an interest rate of 8% would be claimed.  I do not think it necessary to refer to the principles on which applications for permission to amend at a late stage are made; it is accepted that they have to be determined in accordance with the overriding objective, which is to deal with cases justly; and in my judgment it is not fair or just that an amendment of this significance should be introduced half way through the trial at a stage at which much of the evidence had been called without the Defendants knowing that this point was going to be taken.  If the point had been clearly pleaded before the trial started, the evidence might well have been different.  In any event, since I have already decided that the claim as sought to be put forward is not an appropriate way to approach the question of equitable interest, it seems only logical to decline to allow it to be put on the face of the pleading. </p>

What is already in issue in the action is the appropriate rate of interest that the Court should award either under s. 35A of the Senior Courts Act 1981 or as equitable interest, and for the reasons given above that is in principle an enquiry as to what is a suitable rate having regard to the investment return that a large private trust could expect to have made on proper trustee investments.

That is not something that the parties have really addressed.  Ms Jones quite correctly points out that the question of what rate of interest should be awarded is very often dealt with after judgment, and it appears, judging from the reported cases (and my own experience), that it is not uncommon for parties to put material before the Court after judgment to justify a particular interest rate.  </p>

It would appear to be bound up with the question of what payments were made out of the Munil Money, although as I understand it Ms Jones’ point is that since the payment was calculated as a bonus of 2% of the Munil Money it does not matter if it was in fact made out of that money or other money.

The plaintiff, an employer under a building contract, sued the architect (Stone Toms) and the contractor (Laings).  Most (but not quite all) of the claims against Laings overlapped with the claims against Stone Toms in the sense that the damage was the same: for example, a claim against Laings for defective workmanship was almost entirely matched by a claim against Stone Toms for defective supervision, and a claim against Laings for overpayment by a claim against Stone Toms for wrongful certification.  There were also distinct claims against Stone Toms for defective design.  Laings made a payment into court of £30,000 which the plaintiff accepted.  He continued to trial against Stone Toms.  The trial judge proceeded as follows.  He first assessed to what extent the plaintiff could have recovered on their claims against Laings.  He found that figure at £25,130.10 – in other words he assessed it to the last penny.  It is to be noted that the <span style="font-style:italic">claims</span> against Laings had been pleaded at a much larger figure (about £229,000) but the judge was obviously unpersuaded that claims of that size were well founded.  Against that the plaintiff had recovered £30,000 and his costs.  That meant that he had fully recovered from Laings all the damage he had suffered on defective workmanship, overpayment and consequential loss.  He therefore concluded that the plaintiff’s claims for that damage had been fully satisfied and hence that the plaintiff had no further claim against Stone Toms for the same damage.  He therefore awarded him nothing for any claim where their liability was concurrent and co-extensive.</p>

	    <p class="Quote1non-I" style="margin-right:0.30in">“But granted for the moment that there may appear to be a question of apportionment of the sum between claims which are good, claims which are bad, and claims which are not concurrent, the mere fact that this may not be altogether straightforward does not, to my mind, absolve the Judge from attempting the task. It is said that the burden lies on the defendant to show that a part of the claim against him has already been satisfied, and to demonstrate the extent to which recovery has already been completed by the plaintiff; and reliance is placed on the decision in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">The World Beauty</span> [1970] P 144. Allowing this, however, it seems to me that that initial burden is discharged when the defendant shows acceptance of a payment in, in respect of causes of action where there are concurrent claims against him. If it is to be said that the payment in relates to some claims which are not concurrent, or which could not succeed against the defendant, the only person capable of providing that guidance is the plaintiff himself, who has accepted the payment. That the payment has to be taken into account in some way seems to me to be beyond doubt, and it is, of course, always open to a plaintiff who wishes to accept a payment in or thinks that its acceptance may cause him some embarrassment in the matter of apportionment to request an amendment of the notice of payment in to apportion the sum paid among the causes of action in respect of which it is paid. In the ordinary way that would, I think, solve any difficulty, though I would like to reserve the position — which of course does not arise here — where there may be grounds for asserting that the apportionment is collusive or is not made <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> . </p>

What he had to ascertain was what the plaintiffs had lost, and to what extent that loss had been mitigated or satisfied by what had been received. There was really no other reliable way of doing this except by assessing the true value of the plaintiffs’ claims against Laings, and comparing it with the £30,000 received.”</span>

In my judgment Chemical’s argument that they would have recovered against Notcutt the costs which were disallowed against Skandia ought not to succeed. I do not regard it as a reasonably foreseeable head of loss, and its recovery in an action against Notcutt is not demanded by the dictates of common sense or justice. It is too remote.

I am satisfied that Keysers’ claim in respect of the first loan would have succeeded against Notcutt if the action against Notcutt had not been settled.  Indeed the contrary was not seriously suggested.  Counsel for Keysers took his stand on the principle that a plaintiff is entitled to appropriate a recovery from one defendant to separate additional claims, giving credit to a second defendant only to the extent that recoveries are necessarily referable to overlapping claims.  That is a proposition which is supported by the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">The Morgengry</span> and by dicta in [<span style="font-style:italic">Townsend</span>].

Here a number of companies in the Barings group had brought claims against their auditors.  Two of these (the Coopers defendants) settled the claims against them at an early stage for £65m, the amount not being appropriated between the various claims or the various claimants; the third (D&amp;T) was found liable at trial, but not in respect of the post-1994 period.  The claimant in the claim against D&amp;T (BFS) appropriated the recovery from the Coopers defendants entirely to that period; D&amp;T contended that it was not open to them unilaterally to do so – this was a matter for the Court and should only be done if the recipient were able to establish that that claim would have succeeded at trial.
