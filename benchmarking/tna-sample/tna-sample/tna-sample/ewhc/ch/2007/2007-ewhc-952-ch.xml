	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In this action the Attorney General of Zambia (“AGZ”) for and on behalf of the Republic of Zambia claims to recover sums which were transferred by the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) between 1995 and 2001.  The money in question was transferred on the basis that it was required to pay debts owed by the Government.  It is acknowledged by the Claimant (“AGZ”) that some money was used in that way but most of it was not.  It is alleged that very large sums were diverted away for private purposes for various of the Defendants and he seeks to recover these sums from the Defendants.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The case falls into 3 distinct parts.  The first arises out of the transfer of about $52,000,000 from Zambia to a bank account operated, it is alleged, outside ordinary governmental processes called the Zamtrop Account held at Zambia National Commercial Bank Limited (“ZANACO”) in London.  This has been called throughout the proceedings <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“The Zamtrop Conspiracy</span>”.  The second claim relates to a UK registered property company called MOFED Ltd owned by the Zambian Government.  This has been known as the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“MOFED Claim”</span> and relates solely to the Fifth Defendant Atan Shansonga (“AS”).  It is a claim for breach of fiduciary duty on the basis that a consultancy agreement was improperly obtained by him in relation to the letting of the property owned by MOFED which provided for him to receive £100,000 per annum.  The third related to payments of about $20,000,000 made by Zambia pursuant to an alleged arms deal with Bulgaria and paid into accounts in Belgium and Switzerland at least some of which funds found their way to London.  This claim has been known throughout the litigation as <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“the BK Conspiracy”.</span></p>

Some assets have been sold, some have not been sold and some are still used by the Defendants.  Dr Chiluba (“FJT”) (the former President and so referred after the monogram on the clothing recovered by AGZ) still resides in a property, which is said to have been acquired using misappropriated funds for example.  As the closing submissions developed it was clear that it would not be possible in the event of primary findings of liability to determine the ultimate figure for liability without more submissions relating to the realisations and the effect those realisations have on any relevant liability.  This judgment therefore will not attempt to address any final amounts.  That will arise after judgment.</p>

It is alleged that they were at the centre of the frauds and the claims against them are framed in conspiracy and breach of fiduciary duty.  The fraud alleged involves the transfer of MOF money to the Zamtrop account and from the Zamtrop account (inter alia) to the accounts of Access Financial Services Ltd a company providing financial services incorporated in Zambia (“AFSL”).  The main controlling officers of AFSL were Mr Faustin Kabwe (“FK”) Mr Aaron Chungu (no relation to XFC) (“AC”) and Mr Francis Kaunda (no relation to the first President of the Republic Kenneth Kaunda) (“Francis K”).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AGZ considered it appropriate for these proceedings to be brought in the High Court in London for a number of reasons.  First it is alleged that significant Defendants namely MCD, CM and AS were based in London and large amounts of the allegedly stolen monies were passed through accounts held by them onward to other destinations both in Europe and elsewhere.  Accordingly AGZ concluded that the claims he brought were centred in London.  The correctness of that belief and its success is demonstrated by virtue of the Belgian recoveries which provided a complete justification for this course of action.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">As Defendants are both Zambian based and UK based a decision would have to be made as how to deal with that.  Given the close nexus with London and the advantage of having orders that could be enforced because they are made in an English Court rather than a Zambian Court AGZ also determined that it was appropriate that the proceedings should be London based for that reason.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">That could be seen to create an immediate difficulty as regards the Zambian based Defendants.  They are all charged with criminal offences arising out of the same subject matter of this action.  They have not yet been brought to trial in Zambia.  They are however all on bail the terms of which require them to surrender their passports.  They could not attend a trial in London as AGZ was (quite understandably) not willing to lift the bail restrictions to enable them to attend such a trial.  It should be pointed out that XFC fled Zambia and his whereabouts are not known precisely but he is currently believed to be in the Republic of Congo.  That provides clear support for AGZ’s view that it would not be appropriate to risk permitting any of the Zambian Defendants to leave Zambia to attend.  The Republic however permitted FJT to go to South Africa for medical treatment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly FJT, SC, AC, FK and Francis K all issued applications challenging the decision of AGZ to commence the proceedings in the English Court.  It is worthy of note that they did not do so on the basis that the proceedings had not been properly brought in the High Court in London.  Their challenge was based on two factors.  First it was said that they had a right to attend their trial in person and were not being given that opportunity because they would not be allowed to attend in London.  Second it was contended that the civil proceedings should be adjourned until after the criminal proceedings were heard.  The justification for this was that they would be required to give evidence in the civil proceedings and thereby reveal matters which they would deploy or not in the criminal case.  Thus their right to silence would be infringed and the prosecution would be given advance warning of what they would say or might say.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">I heard their application and I rejected it.  In so rejecting it I addressed their two concerns in the following way.  First I indicated that I would be willing to go to Zambia as a Special Examiner so I could hear their evidence live in a court in Zambia.  The rest of the proceedings would take place via a live video link to Zambia.  In addition they would be provided with daily transcripts at the initial expense of AGZ.  I accepted that was not the best solution as the best solution would be for them to be at their trial all the time.  However that could not happen for the reasons set out above.  Nor would it be appropriate to have trial proceedings simultaneously against Zambian Defendants in Zambia and London based Defendants in London arising out of the same dispute.  Nobody argued against that point.</p>

Thereafter in June 2006 (coincidental with their petition) they wrote to me saying they had “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">discontinued participation”</span> in this action.  There is of course no power on the part of a Defendant to “discontinue participation” in proceedings.  The facilities in Zambia were nevertheless made available for them but they chose not to attend for no- justified reason.  </p>

They were provided with daily transcripts up to a certain date.  Finally arrangements were put in place for a property that was under restraint in Zambia to be realised to enable them to pay their lawyers.  Despite being afforded that opportunity they took no steps to realise the property in question (Serioes Farm).  The reason for this was that they had made a decision not to play any role in the proceedings once their attempt to remove themselves had failed.  The fact that funds could be made available is well demonstrated by the orders I made during the course of the trial in favour of AS to permit him to arrange for the sale by De Garnier Holdings Limited of shares it oened in a Zambian Hydro Electrical company and for Mr Shansonga to have access to those funds not only to defend himself but to pay his living expenses.  Such a course of action was open to all the other Zambian based Defendants but they chose not to avail themselves of it.

Similarly the Zambian based Defendants gave statements to various newspapers in Zambia alluding to such material.  Such delivery was in a selective way and was once again a breach of the ring fencing order which was put in place for their protection.  Accordingly I removed their right to transcripts unless they attended court in Zambia personally on a daily basis to collect the transcript and signed a confidentiality agreement.  After that requirement none of the Zambian based Defendants attended to obtain the documents.  Unfortunately towards the end of the hearing in Zambia a member of the AGZ’s chambers released some transcripts to a representative of the Zambian based Defendants and those transcripts were then promptly published in a selective way in the press again.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Zambia suffered a number of factors which ruined its economy.  First the UDI of what was then called Southern Rhodesia had a serious impact on it.  Its main wealth was (and largely still remains) the export of copper.  The route for the export passed through Southern Rhodesia.  Zambia was faced with the dilemma of submitting to the Smith based regime in Southern Rhodesia and thereby alienating itself from all the other African countries but saving its economy or not submitting and ruining its economy.  It chose the latter course.  Exports of copper became very difficult.  The situation was exacerbated in later years by the conflicts in other potential export routes namely Angola and Mozambique.  Further in the 1970’s commodity prices fell and Zambia’s exports in real terms therefore fell.  This was coupled with the huge rise in oil prices following the Yom Kippur war.  The impact of that on the western world is well known but the impact on Zambia was equally catastrophic as it has no indigenous oil resources.  It has large amounts of coal but they tend to be used solely for the processing of copper.  Coal is not widely used other than for that process.  This still affects Zambia today.  When I went to Zambia I was surprised to see that the price of petrol in Zambia did not differ much from that of the price in the UK.  This is an example of the high cost of living which ordinary Zambians suffer.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">This case reinforces that view.  In addition as a substantial body of evidence which was unchallenged put before me shows there is a climate of fear operating in the public service.  It is difficult in a western world to perceive how intimidatory those in power can be in a country like Zambia.  The threat of losing one’s job in the public service is a strong deterrent against questioning matters.  There is no residual back up system of a welfare state approaching anything like that in western countries.  To lose one’s job is to force one’s family into starvation and potential homelessness.  Thus that is a powerful weapon without any need to issue threats of violence.  It is quite clear from the evidence that those in power and those associated with those in power were not questioned.  What they said went unchallenged because of the fear.  I would find it difficult to criticise lower level civil servants who took a decision not to challenge what was going on. In fact many did try to stem the tide as the evidence showed but were blocked from above and sometimes penalised for trying to challenge what was going on.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">I have set out above the low level of income enjoyed by ordinary Zambians.  The country will of course like any country have a small cadre of wealthy people at the top.  It is generally the case in most countries that public servants are not to the fore in the terms of high salary.  According to the evidence of Mr Kalabo and Mr Goma which I accept FJT from November 1991 to March 2002 (10 years) earned K157,340,505.12.  On a rough and ready basis that was approximately $10,000 per annum.  There was a dispute as to whether or not FJT had access to other funds for expenses but I reject the suggestion that in real terms he had access to any other governmental funds and I accept the evidence of Mr Kalabo and Mr Goma who were respectively the Permanent Secretary in charge of the Administration in the Cabinet Office and the Accountant General at the Office of the Accountant General (part of the Ministry of Finance and Planning).  Of course I accept that where Zambian Government Officials are required to carry out duties or incur expenditure abroad the low level in comparative terms of Zambia’s income is not a relevant factor.  However what is striking in this case is the level of alleged frauds in the context of the available income of the publicly employed Zambian Defendants.  I will set out below in this judgment the sums allegedly spent by the Zambian Defendants for their own benefit.  They dwarf any level of income or other assets they could reasonably have expected to have from legitimate means.  Take but one example.  FJT demanded and obtained £30,000 in cash from BT. Assuming a generous exchange rate of $1.5 equals £1 that represents nearly half of his presidential salary for 10 years.  </p>

The Zambian based Defendants chose not to avail themselves of the expensive procedures that were put in place solely for their benefit.  That is a matter of regret.

The participating Defendants gave evidence but called nobody else to support their case.  In addition Grant Thornton (“GT”) were retained by AGZ and CM as a joint expert to advise on tracing of monies from MOF into the Zamtrop account and its subsequent disbursement.  That exercise was extremely complicated and difficult.  I am grateful for the results because it shortened what was undoubtedly an area which could have taken an incredible amount of time.  It meant that there has been substantial acceptance of the result of that exercise so that unusually in a case like this there is no serious dispute over figures. The limited nature of the retainer should be noted. They were not retained by the other parties. Nor were they retained (for example) beyond the Zamtrop conspiracy. They did not investigate either the OOP payments or the Permase General Account. Their report establishes that the bulk of the monies received into the Zamtrop account can be traced back to MOF. They have also substantially traced the funds out of the Zamtrop Account. AGZ’s concession limiting their claim to traced amounts also extends to sums which he can establish are Government monies. Whilst his argument on a statutory right has failed ( see paragraph 160 below) he has persuaded me that on the balance of probabilities some sums which were paid into the Zamtrop Account are Government monies although they have not been successfully traced back to MOF in the GT Report (see paragraph 274 below).</p>

The record needs to be set out fully so that the people in Zambia can see what has gone on in the past in relation to the governance of their country and the custodianship of assets that the Government has to apply for the benefit of its people.  This case has shown a quite cynical abuse of office by senior officials in the former Zambian Government namely FJT and XFC.  The corruption extended to other officials as this judgment will show.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The most serious revelation in this case is the cynical and unjustified misappropriation of funds for the private purposes of Government officials.  I set out below the types of expenditure to which I am referring.  Not all the Defendants were aware of these purchases save FJT, XFC and FK but in one way or another they have participated in some of the acquisitions.  I set out next in tabular form some examples.</p>

The items seized by the Task Force were considerable.  First there were 349 shirts.  A large number of these bore the FJT monogram on them and they were from virtually every designer outlet.  Second there were 206 jackets and suits.  A large number of these were from Basile bearing the FJT monogram.  Third there were 72 pairs of shoes.  A large number of these were hand made by Basile with the FJT logo.  All were for FJT’s unique personal specification (high heels).  Many of them were in their original shoe covers and had not been used. There were a large number of other items.  The full list can be found in bundle 17.2 page 217 et seq.</p>

It reflected as I have said over 5 times the totality of his salary when he was in office for 10 years.  I have already commented that there is nothing from his pre Presidential lifestyle to suggest he had wealth and there appears to be nothing in his post Presidential lifestyle to suggest he has wealth.

Grant Thornton has traced $879,400 of the $1,029,400 paid to Basile (H4/13 of their report).  The balance is due to a difference of methodology.  The larger figure is traced back to MOF accounts.  The relevant figure therefore exceeds the identified value of the clothing received by FJT.  His statement in his press release insofar as it suggests the clothing was received via the Zamtrop account fed by gifts is a blatant lie.  </p>

According to their record on 5th and 6th September XFC sent instructions to remit $15,000 to Standaert but the method of transfer was by payment into an XFC account at a bank in Brussels.  Those monies were transferred that way.  They are to be found in the MCD ledger no 2535 with the description “Frank Chungu” (this is XFC).  That money derived from GT traces 36 – 38.

This account was operated overseas so that in the event of internal conflict there would be an external account for use to fund operations in times of emergency. This account was also to be deployed for certain Defence and security spending of a highly classified nature.  I do not accept that this account was set up for the purposes of fraud.  I as the President of Zambia certainly did not authorise its use for anything else other than what it was created for.  This was an account entirely under the control of the intelligence service of Zambia within the operational ambit of the Director General who enjoys wide powers and discretion under Zambian law in matters concerning national security”.</span></p>

The Picture Payments allegation is simply answered on the basis that the Zamtrop account had private monies in it.  He asserts he had personal money and the Zamtrop account was administered for the purpose of disbursement of that personal money.  I note the following.  There is no evidence which shows FJT remitted any such sums (just under $200,000).  He adduces no evidence to show he had such wealth.  In that context his affidavit of means is illuminating.  Insofar as the payments can be identified as from 3rd party sources the receipt of such monies is and the failure to declare them is plainly a breach of the duties FJT owed to the Republic of Zambia.  I will deal with this further in the section dealing with the specific allegation against him.</p>

The inevitable conclusion is that they have not participated because they have no answer to these transactions.  That is important because the transactions themselves and the silence from the relevant Defendants that is strong evidence in support of AGZ’s claims.  In addition given the nature of his office and his professions of honesty and integrity FJT had to answer them.  His excuses are not acceptable and the people of Zambia should be aware of that.</p>

I have made clear to the parties that I must not allow evidence against other Defendants when there is nothing to suggest they participated in or were aware of the transactions in question, to be used against them.  It is essential that the role of all Defendants in the allegations is looked at individually and their actions assessed in the light of their knowledge.  I have been conscious of the need to be discriminating in that respect, especially bearing in mind the serious nature of the allegations.  This is a point that is particularly important for the participating Defendants.  </p>

The evidence led by AGZ has been subject to thorough testing both by the participating Defendants and me.  As a result of that as will be seen further in this judgment the participating Defendants have raised matters which might amount to a total Defence on the part of all Defendants to the claims brought by AGZ.  They have also raised matters which have reduced the amount of the claims AGZ seek to maintain.  Thus for example the case was opened on the basis that the Claimant was seeking all of the sums identified in the witness statement of the main witness Mr Hamunjele.  He identified as claims sums in excess of the sums that can be traced by GT back to MOF or other Governmental sources.  By the time of their closing AGZ accepted that the ceiling for any claim was those sums traced by GT.  If the liability is limited to the individual claims against individual Defendants the relevant sums are identified in volume H4 of the GT’s report (as varied in the light of the evidence of Ms Pincott given when she was recalled and the further calculation she provided after giving that evidence).</p>

They had every opportunity to do so it is submitted.  A Restriction Notice was lifted in Zambia to enable Serioes Farm to be sold by FK for the purpose of paying legal costs.  In addition there was the possibility of them obtaining public funding in the UK.  In this context AS had public funding for a significant period of time.  However they never made any such application.  Finally in this context I made special arrangements to sit as a Special Examiner to hear evidence to enable them to attend and to ensure a full access to all witnesses both in Lusaka and via video link.  I also ensured that their right to silence in respect to the criminal case was preserved.  </p>

The fact that they have not done so provides in my judgment corroborative evidence to support AGZ’s evidence as to the allegations against them.  It can of course only be corroborative; the burden still remains on AGZ to prove his case against all the Defendants.</p>

It is a question of degree.  In respect of the UK based Defendants who are all alleged to be assisters it will be necessary to view the evidence against them and their evidence and come to the appropriate conclusion after that review of the extent of their role in assisting the primary fraudsters or being fellow conspirators with them.</span>

Funding was sought on the basis that debts left behind by the former regime had to be met. In the letter XFC said “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">I wish to recommend that these debts be treated as part of the national debt.  The amounts involved are quite modest and can, therefore, be accommodated within the external debt service budget without drawing the attention of the IMF and the donor community.

This was achieved in two ways.  First anything concerned with ZSIS was simply not questioned.  Anyone who tried to question it met with vigorous challenges by SC.  No violence was perpetrated on anybody.  Although Mr Penza was murdered in 1998 no evidence has been adduced as to why and by whom he was murdered.  </p>

I am quite satisfied on the evidence that was deployed before me that it was simply not realistic to expect any public official to challenge XFC and SC when questions ought to have arisen.

Mr Wills has stated in an interview dated 3rd December 2003 in the presence of Assistant United States Attorney General Wingate Grant, FBI Special Agent Brad Gregor accompanied by Mr Mutembo Nchito (a Zambian Government lawyer) and Mr Hamunjele that the MOU was “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">deliberately inaccurate”.  </span>He said that SC was part of the transaction.  He bought her a bottle of champagne when the MOU was signed.  He said that XFC wanted Wills to buy a $50,000 gold Rolex for him and to cut money out for SC.  I should say that there is evidence to show that SC received $50,000 from Wilbain paid into a bank account (see below in respect of the allegations against her).  That payment was effected on 14th June 1995 into an account that was opened at ZANACO on the name of S Mumba (Ms Chibanda’s maiden name), as summarised in AGZ’s closing paragraph 495 fn 512.</p>

Thus Systems received $2,200,000 and Wilbain received $2,934,000.  By December 1995 therefore Systems had received $2,800,000 under its MOU and Wilbain had received $5,334,000 under its MOU.  Thus as at that date Systems and Wilbain were still owed $1,550,000 and $2,934,000 respectively.  These figures are significant when one looks at the subsequent payments made to Systems and Wilbain out of the Zamtrop account.

They thus follow the payments that have already been made and the setting up of the MOUs but are shortly before the substantial payment method which was created in December 1995.  I will consider whether meetings took place as alleged by AGZ when I deal with the claims against the individual Defendants under the conspiracy.  In addition it is noted by AGZ that Redcliffe was incorporated on 23rd June 1995.  IM acknowledges that there was a meeting between him and XFC and FK.  AS also acknowledges that there was a meeting between him and XFC.  BT denies he took part in any meetings.  </p>

FK asserted that he was encouraged by the Minister of Finance to venture into the business of finance (interview notes 19.3/214).  Its application for a licence was apparently made in July 1995 and ultimately granted towards the end of October 1995.  On 9th October 1995 BOZ wrote with notification that Mr Penza had authorised a Financial Services Licence to be granted with immediate effect.  Under the regulatory statute the Registrar, as defined, “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">in consultation with the Minister” </span>(section 10 BAFS Act 1994) grants the licence.  AGZ contends Mr Penza issued the licence without any proper evaluation by BOZ.  This seems to me to be correct.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AFSL was licensed as a non bank financial institution.  It was authorised to conduct financial but not banking services.  FK’s involvement it is contended with Meridien should have prohibited a licence being granted to AFSL without BOZ’s approval (section 31 (3) BAFS Act (CAP387)).  The evidence is not clear on this but again it is of use only of a secondary nature.  AFSL commenced operations in December 1995.  On 28th December 1995 FK wrote to his daughter stating that there was tremendous interest in from senior Government officials who can facilitate matters greatly and “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">even my Meridien past did not appear to be a handicap”</span> [19.3/44].

Mr Mandona’s (the then Finance Director of ZSIS) evidence was that he was not told about the account.  In his witness statement he stated that he was unaware of the new Zamtrop account until early October 2002 when the court ordered disclosure of statements of account in the criminal libel proceedings brought against the Post newspaper.  However after that evidence had been given I ordered AGZ to disclose interview statements that it had obtained from all relevant witnesses concerning the dispute in this action.  As a result of that a statement made by Mr Mandona in June 2002 was disclosed.  That statement referred to the fact that in 2000 he was requested to remit some money to Officers who had overstayed in London and he attempted to make the payment to the Zamtrop account i.e. the old account but he was told that the account number was changed.  It was put to him by Mr Head for IM that he therefore knew 2 years earlier that there was a new Zamtrop account with a new account number.  He was told that the number had been changed by Mr Zulu.  He acknowledged later in the cross examination that his witness statement was wrong in that he knew of the new Zamtrop account earlier than 2002.  He acknowledged that but said he received no statements.  His evidence was confusing which is hardly surprising because he gave evidence in November and was then recalled without warning at the end of February.  By agreement between the parties he was not told the purpose of the recall.  Ultimately it seems to me and this I find the true picture was that he was told that the old account was given a new account number but he was not told that in fact the new number was for a new account.  I accept his evidence that he did not know of the existence of the new Zamtrop account.  I should say in passing that he was recalled for other matters in respect of a payment of $400,000 made to CM out of another ZSIS account 677 but I will deal with that when I deal again with the individual claims against Defendants.</p>

On 22nd December 1995 Mr Penza approved that suggestion.  The letter was copied to the then Director of Loans and Investments Wally Musonda.  He passed the letter on to his Deputy (SC) suggesting that in view of the methodology of debt service being used it might be possible to channel payments through ZANACO and therefore she should explore the possibility.  She sent him a note on 8th January 1996 which followed his written instruction and a verbal discussion on 5th January 1995 (sic).  She stated that she issued payment instructions to BOZ and had provided a copy of XFC’s minute to Mr Penza and that she “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">drew the attention of the Deputy Governor to the classification of the correspondence”.  </span>By this she meant that it was expressly drawn to their attention that the matter was “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">secret”.   This put others on notice that investigation was not to be expected. </span>She stated this was the only way out.  Following this exchange a series of payments were made to System and Wilbain.  The first arranged payments were on 8th January 1996 in the sum of $798,000 paid to the Zamtrop account to cover payments of $498,000 to Wilbain and $300,000 to Systems.  That authorisation was signed by Mr Musonda and SC.  The classification of the attached minute (secret) was expressly drawn to the Deputy Governors attention as SC confirmed.

First there is the need for finance and the suggestion from XFC that the payments can be hidden from the IMF.  There are then large payments directly out of MOF after the MOU’s were signed.  There is then the closing of the Zamtrop account.  I was provided with no rational explanation as to why the Zamtrop account that had been in existence since 1965 needed to be closed. I find there was no legitimate purpose for this action.  If there was a genuine secrecy there was no reason that account could not have continued.  </p>

I have not been given any reason as to why he was not called.  The plain fact however is that Mr Siame was complicit in the opening of this account as was Mr Penza.  Both of them would know it was irregularly opened.  An indication of Mr Siame’s failure to act is the fact that he was unquestioningly involved in the closure of the account on 8th December 1995 and had the benefit of a letter dated 6th March 1999 from XFC to him certifying the destruction of the Zamtrop account documents dated up to 31st December 1998.  This was found by Mrs Chifungula.  This is an extraordinary document.  Mr Phiri told me that the file “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">DG Pers</span>” (the reference on the letter) was not found at the ZSIS premises.

He was cross examined extensively about his searches by the Defendants.  Having seen him give evidence I accept his evidence.  I do not believe that he has come to court and told lies about the existence of documents.  I do not have to decide the level of culpability of Mr Siame.  I am satisfied however that at the very least he failed properly to exercise his duties as Auditor General or alternatively chose not to exercise the duties required of him probably because of the intimidatory nature of XFC and Mr Siame’s unwillingness to challenge him and thus FJT.  I draw this conclusion from the fact that his actions in 1995 and the 6th March 1999 letter are so extraordinary that they cannot be explained on any other basis.  </p>

He did not refer to it in his Defence but it seemed to me plain that it was something that ought to have been considered by AGZ.  When the letter of 17th January 1996 was disclosed this consideration became a certainty.  This was contrary to AGZ’s opening and the way the case had been run before this revelation i.e. that no special procedures were alleged to apply to the Zamtrop account.  The letter completely changed that and it would not be possible either for the Defendants or myself for that matter to understand fully how the Zamtrop account operated without reference to this document.  I so intimated during the trial.  The response of AGZ’s representatives was somewhat surprising.  Production of the document was resisted.  An attempt to claim that it was a secret document and should not be produced was made.  I ordered production.  Instead of the document being produced a typed copy (with errors in it) was produced without certification.  It was then suggested that I alone should look at it (an impossible suggestion to a trial Judge).  It was then suggested that there might be one copy left in court.  Ultimately (bearing in mind the ring fencing provisions) genuine copies were made available to the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view there is nothing in the Finance Charter that justified this reluctance and none was seriously put forward. It is simply the case that it is the document which governs the financing of ZSIS.  The Director General is made responsible to the President or to a Minister or any other Officers specially designated by the President for the budget.  ZSIS is to have its own accounting unit and make its own bank reconciliations and the Director General is responsible for preparing internal audit estimates in a form prescribed for other Government departments for approval by the President or the Minister.  The estimates are to be classified as top secret and personal and will be accessible only by the President and the Minister.  The warrant authorising the budget allocation is to be signed by the President.  The classified document  will be accessible only to the Director General, the President and the Auditor General.  There are provisions for the issue of certificates to the Auditor General on a quarterly basis.  I observe that there were indications of audit approvals in the early 1990’s but none has been discovered for the period the subject matter of this action (doubtless destroyed as the result of the letter 6th March 1999).  The Director General is given power to allocate funds from the budget to officials in ZSIS and authorise them to approve and incur expenditure “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">in the same manner as is applicable to the handling of public funds generally”</span>.  He is not required to obtain certificates where it is against the interest of the service so to do but in each case he will obtain from the paying officer a certificate of payment which sets out the details of the payment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">What this document shows is that the Director General (i.e. XFC) is given wide ranging powers to expend money in ZSIS operations.  The powers however are not untrammelled.  There has to be a budget and there has to be a proper system of verification.  Those procedures are subject to review in effect by the Auditor General (Mr Siame throughout the period) and FJT.  It is not suggested by any of the Defendants that this gives the Director General a licence to steal.  Any powers he exercised must be exercised bona fide in the interest of the Republic.  I do not accept that it relieves the ZSIS accounts from the general requirements as identified in the evidence before me.  The overall analysis of the Finance Charter shows that not to be the case.  In my view the only significant difference is that the procedures are under the direct control of the Director General, the Auditor General and the President.  </p>

These actions consisted of the opening of the Zamtrop account (with no apparent purpose) the control of that account in effect by XFC (and thus the removal of scrutiny from anybody other than the Auditor General and/or FJT).  Third there is the reinforcing of the fact that all of these payments and contracts are under this secret regime and that therefore challenge or enquiry will not be tolerated.  Fourth there is the fact that the payments out of the Zamtrop account themselves are not to be monitored or queried for the same reason.  Fifth, there is the apparent wholesale destruction of documents arranged by XFC and notified to Mr Siame.  I cannot conceive of any lawful basis upon which the Auditor General would participate in the destruction of documents (for example) that came into existence as recently as 3 months earlier than the letter authorising destruction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence led by AGZ that there was a primary conspiracy created by the Zambian based Defendants to steal money from the Republic.  I am satisfied that the method was by fraudulent contracts in favour of Wilbain and Systems and fraudulent payments made from MOF under the approved budget in to the Zamtrop account for the purpose of stealing as much money as possible thereby paid in to the Zamtrop account.  The method of opening and operating of the Zamtrop account in my view admits of no other explanation of  a credible nature.  FJT, XFC and SC are all involved at that stage.  In this context I reject any criticism of AGZ’s witnesses of fact as regards the operation of the payments out of MOF into Zamtrop and a lack of challenge to any of those payments.  There are some legitimate criticisms of other aspects of AGZ’s evidence but in respect of the main thrust of the conspiracy I unhesitatingly accept all of the evidence of all of these witnesses.  The cloak of secrecy was maintained by the climate of fear created by the triumvirate within Government circles of FJT, XFC and their willing assistant SC who received large sums of money in a Zambian context.  I have already alluded to the $50,000 she received shortly after the MOU’s came into being.  In addition the GT Report attributes a further receipt of $37,103 by her (H4/13).  This includes payments to her under the name of PC Mumba and a $10,000 payment to her son by MCD.  There is a further traced payment to the name of PC Mumba of $50,000 on 14th March 1997 (GT7).  In addition AS’s Barclays Bank account shows payments to her or her family of some $33,120.80 (see AGZ’s closing para 526 – 538).</p>

No other purpose ever received an express or implied authorisation.  $30,586,521 was claimed from MOF and paid in to the Zamtrop account as payments to Systems of which only $14,170,500 was paid on to that company leaving a difference between the amount claimed and the amount paid of $13,416,021.  The amount claimed referable to Wilbain was $12,158,985 of which only $355,000 was paid on to that company leaving a claimed but unpaid balance of $11,783,985.</p>

Mr Wills in his statement in interview with the FBI and the US Justice Department said the total value of work done by Wilbain for ZSIS was between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.  This contrasts starkly with the MOU.  There is evidence also that Wilbain ceased trading in about June 1997 and ceased to exist in 1998 when its bank account was closed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Up until September 1998 the procedure by which monies were transferred from the MOF account was that MOF would send a letter of instruction to BOZ to effect the specified payment.  The letter would be signed by 2 people.  In practice Zambia’s payments to Systems and Wilbain were effectively left to SC to administer.  Subsequent to the opening of the Zamtrop account letters of instruction for payments to Systems and Wilbain were signed by SC as set out in the following table and associated footnotes.  These are the payments claimed from MOF and paid into the Zamtrop account.  They are <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">not</span> the payments actually made to Systems and Wilbain out of the Zamtrop account which were the figures set out in paragraph 157 above.</p>

For example the letter of instruction 28/06/1996 records this as the “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">final payment”</span> due to Wilbain.  The payment 6/11/1997 was described as the 9th and final instalment but thereafter two 10th instalments were made and 11th, 12th and 13th instalments.  The 10th instalment was actually paid four times and the 11th and 13th instalments were paid 3 times each.  All of this was easy to discern when the approval records went through.  None was effectively challenged.  </p>

It follows that millions were removed from MOF and paid into the Zamtrop account purportedly to satisfy contractual obligations to Systems and Wilbain far in excess of the sums which appeared due to those companies under such contractual documentation that exists and far in excess of the sums which were actually paid to them.  In this context I accept the evidence highlighted in the Claimants closing paragraphs 237 and following.  Ironically on the figures Wilbain was apparently paid less than it was entitled to under its MOU.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">On 15th January 2007 Mr Croxford QC on behalf of CM raised a point of law on whether there could actually be a conspiracy as alleged by AGZ if the Wilbain and Systems payments had been authorised by Parliament.  This is on the basis that those sums having been budgeted for and included in the Appropriation Acts approved by the Zambian Parliament “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">the court should not be invited to investigate the payments”.  </span>On 17th January 2007 an application for wide disclosure including the underlying budget documents was made.  I dealt with it on the 18th January 2007 by dismissing it.  The reason I dismissed it was the apparent acceptance by AGZ that the Systems and Wilbain claims were included in the budget.  That was on the basis of paragraph 7 and 9 of Mr Malambo’s witness statement where he said that under the budget heading “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">other” </span>were to be found (no doubt carefully hidden away in accordance with XFC’s letter of 14th April 1995) the Systems and Wilbain budgets.  There was also evidence to show that the IMF queries were evaded.  There might be two reasons for this.  First it is possible that the Government knew they were in budgetary difficulties and wished to hide this legitimate expenditure.  In fact in my view it was a device to hide <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">illegitimate expenditure </span>created pursuant to the conspiracy to defraud the Government.  The Republic could not have funded these large payments except by the use of overseas funding.  The conspiracy therefore perpetrated a deception on the IMF.  </p>

When pressed on this Mr Blair QC for AGZ accepted that the case was to be determined on the assumption that the System/Wilbain payments were included in the budget as set out in Mr Malambo’s witness statement.

It was not adverted to in their opening statement.  However in fairness it can be said that the issue of the budget was by no means clear at this stage.  This was one of the many instances when given the length of the trial I was unwilling to allow initial stances to be regarded as final stances so long as a change did not prejudice or affect any other party.  All parties benefited from this approach during the course of the trial.  It led to everybody being able (I hope) to accept that every conceivable argument within reason was deployed fully on behalf of their respective clients.  Thus Mr Croxford QC was allowed to deploy these arguments although they were raised late in the day in the trial.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AGZ’s case is that there was (to use Mr Croxford QC’s words) an over arching conspiracy to steal Government monies and that the medium used was the Zamtrop account.  That is to be contrasted with a possible conspiracy which involves monies being lawfully paid into the Zamtrop account and then unlawfully misappropriated.  Now this might be at first sight an argument about form rather than substance.  However it is important from the participating Defendants point of view because it is a platform that they can use for submitting that even if it is established that they are conspirators the conspiracy in question is one which involves unlawful removal from the Zamtrop account and not unlawful paying into the Zamtrop account.  The figures make a large difference to these Defendants’ liabilities.  In effect any conspiracy they would submit on this basis would be limited to the amount that they are alleged to have become involved in.  It would mean that there would be in effect a whole series of sub conspiracies involving the stealing of particular funds from the Zamtrop account.  As regards each Defendant therefore the liability would be limited to the role in respect of each such stolen item thus in effect the measure of damages under the conspiracy on that basis would be the same as the claim for dishonest assistance.</p>

The answer Lord Wilberforce gave (page 937 E) was that it was deprived of them directly by the act of sovereign states.  Consideration of those involves examination of a series of interstate transactions and further Occidental, if it were to succeed, it would be necessary for it to show that those actions were brought about by necessarily a finding of fraudulent conspiracy between Buttes and the Government of Sharjah and an enquiry into the motives of the then ruler of Sharjah making a decree and back dating it.

This rule reflects concepts of both private and public international law as to territorial sovereignty. As such, we think that the rule is founded primarily on a view as to the comity of nations, rather than on concern as to giving offence to the foreign sovereign or as to the absence of judicial standards: see Buck v Attorney General </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">, 770 per Diplock LJ. We say this because, if the sovereign purports to act outside his territory, or even if he acts within it in a penal or discriminatory way and a claimant then seeks to found his claim on that sovereign act, the English court arrogates to itself the right in the first case not to recognise and in the second case not to enforce it. This shows that embarrassment about sitting in judgment on the acts of a foreign sovereign is not per se the cause of judicial restraint in this context. Rather, each sovereign says to the other: "We will respect your territorial sovereignty. But there can be no offence if we do not recognise your extraterritorial or exorbitant acts."</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">319 The second insight, however, is that, whether the sovereign acts within his own territory or outside it, there is a certain class of sovereign act which calls for judicial restraint on the part of our municipal courts. This is the principle of non-justiciability. It is or leads to a form of immunity ratione materiae. It may not be easy to generalise about such acts, and the application of the principle may be fact sensitive. Guidance, however, is to be found in such considerations as whether there are "judicial or manageable standards" by which to resolve the dispute, whether the court would be in "a judicial no-man's land", or perhaps whether there would be embarrassment in our foreign relations, at any rate if that possibility was drawn to the court's attention by the executive. Sensitive issues involving diplomacy between states, or uncertain or controversial issues of international law, may be other examples of situations calling for judicial restraint. The distinction which has been developed in the analogous area of sovereign immunity between situations where the sovereign acts by way of sovereign authority (acta jure imperii) and where he acts in the commercial sphere (acta jure gestionis) may also be of some assistance, because with the development of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity there has come the realisation that it is not every impleading of a sovereign that requires judicial restraint or gives rise to a legitimate fear of giving offence. In essence, the principle of non-justiciability seeks to distinguish disputes involving sovereign authority which can only be resolved on a state to state level from disputes which can be resolved by judicial means.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">320 The third insight is that the rule whereby there is a principle of judicial restraint in so far as a sovereign acts within his own territory is only a prima facie rule. It is subject to certain exceptions. One exception we have already mentioned is that a penal or discriminatory act of a foreign sovereign cannot be made the basis of a claim in our courts. This is perhaps one aspect of a general exception to the effect that these courts will not recognise the act of a foreign sovereign which is contrary to English public policy. The existence of this exception is not in doubt. But how far does it extend, and what is meant by English public policy in this context? The width of the exception is uncertain both because the concept of public policy is itself not hard edged and also because it has to take into account the abhorrence of outrageous acts on the one hand and on the other hand the concerns which give rise to the first and second insights to which we have referred. This is the route by which it is possible to say that discriminatory breaches of fundamental human rights will not be recognised, even in a sphere which is as much a matter for individual sovereign choice as a person's nationality.</span>

In appropriate circumstances it is legitimate for an English court to have regard to the content of international law in deciding whether to recognise a foreign law. Lord Wilberforce himself accepted this in the Buttes case, at p 931D. Nor does the "non-justiciable" principle mean that the judiciary must shut their eyes to a breach of an established principle of international law committed by one state against another when the breach is plain and, indeed, acknowledged. In such a case the adjudication problems confronting the English court in the Buttes litigation do not arise.

I am not being asked to reconsider the decision of Parliament to approve the budget.  I am not being asked to consider the effectiveness of internal procedures of the High Court of Parliament or whether any of those procedures were effectively followed.  I am not being asked to strike down any law of Zambia.  The decision in the earlier <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hoani</span> case involved the attack upon the actual legislation itself.  I simply do not see that the claims brought by AGZ that authorisation was obtained from Parliament for the budget which included matters where the officers of the then Government fraudulently concealed within the budget monies which were subsequently to be stolen by them involves a challenge to the supremacy of the laws of Zambia or the procedure of the Zambian Parliament.  </p>

The major difference between the cases cited to me is the fact that by AGZ the Government in question is a party to the proceedings.  No case has been cited to me (and I am told Counsel could not find one) where this principle was applied to preclude a sovereign state which was bringing a claim.  Given the principles as to why the rule occurs I can well understand that to be the case.  There can be no problem of diplomacy or international sovereign embarrassment when the sovereign state whose law is in question is actually a party to the court proceedings in question and accepts the court can investigate it.  </p>

The list is not confined to the actual case adjudicated upon in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Kuwait</span> case.  It is a question in each case as to whether or not public policy would prevent the rigid application of this rule operating.  AGZ’s case is that its principal officers at the time have defrauded the Republic.  Part of that defrauding operation was their presentation of false budgets to Parliament and the procurement of the approval without Parliament discovering that fraud.  The Defendants’ arguments if correct would prevent AGZ on behalf of the Republic being able to bring proceedings in respect of this fraudulent conspiracy even in its own jurisdiction.  The <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hoani </span>and<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Pickin</span> cases show that.

I would be precluded from determining that there was a conspiracy based on a budget approved by Parliament even though that approval was obtained fraudulently.  However the budget approval merely enables MOF to draw down the funds.  Parliament approved those funds to be used for the Systems/Wilbain contract and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">no other purpose.</span>  If there is a subsequent appropriation of those funds fraudulently and dishonestly for private gain or for another purpose by the Zambian based Defendants that is a conspiracy to defraud by unlawful means.  The difference is that the conspiracy is to steal the money when it is wrongfully applied out of the Zamtrop account the Defendants would contend. I am not convinced that is the case.  The over arching conspiracy is the creation of the Zamtrop account <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">for the purposes of stealing the money</span>.  All the decision based on the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Buttes</span> case would do is make it not possible to challenge the allocation to MOF.

Against that it seems difficult for me to award a level of damages for conspiracy that includes an alleged misappropriation of monies which have been used by the Defendants to acquire assets or provide services which have accrued a benefit to the Republic.  The same point can be made as regards realisations.  AGZ concedes as a matter of principle that credit in some way should be given for realisations.  The most significant example of that is the Jarban aspect of the litigation where the recoveries substantially exceed the misappropriations.  </p>

The question for consideration is the extent to which a fraudulent fiduciary can claim the benefit of realisations and compensation for the time and trouble expended in acquiring or enhancing the benefit taken for himself but of which he has to account.  The law in this area when applied to fiduciaries and their duties to account is by no means clear see paragraphs 211 – 212 of the judgment.  I have not had a full argument on this (because of the deferral of the realisations issue).  It seems to me that I require further submissions on how the question of how realisations and improper acquisitions which achieved a benefit are dealt with.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">One thing is nevertheless clear to me.  The legal burden of proving that the money has been stolen and improperly applied lies firmly on AGZ throughout.  That legal burden never shifts and has to be proven taking into account the warnings in the cases referred to earlier in this judgment.  Nevertheless the evidential burden can shift.  There are two examples in my view to show how this operates.  First  where the AGZ has prima facie established that the payments made to the Zamtrop account save those that were paid to Systems and Wilbain have been dishonestly applied to non Government purposes.  The burden is then on the Defendants depending on their role to show what has become of those misappropriated payments.  If the claim is in conspiracy if a Defendant wishes to reduce that prima facie amount the evidential burden has shifted to that Defendant to show the payments have achieved a legitimate purpose (albeit not authorised) or have been used to acquire an asset which has been recovered by AGZ.  That would be applicable to all Defendants in so far as it established that they are joint and several participators in the conspiracy.  It would equally be the same as regards a Defendant who is found to have acted in breach of fiduciary duty.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In the case of a liability based on dishonest assistance in the context of this case AGZ’s claim is limited to the amount each relevant Defendant is shown to have assisted in the wrongful misappropriation.  AGZ has limited his claim to the amounts traceable to each Defendant under that head.  That means that each such receipt is traced back into the Zamtrop account and into MOF.  It follows therefore that in each of the amounts so limited AGZ has established by evidence that the relevant monies against the relevant Defendant have been stolen and misappropriated fraudulently.  If any such recipient Defendant therefore wishes to reduce that amount in my view the evidential burden has shifted to that Defendant and the burden will then be on that Defendant to show that monies which have been fraudulently removed from MOF by virtue of the use of the Zamtrop account have actually either been used for an unauthorised purpose which accrues a benefit for the Republic or has been used to acquire an asset which has been recovered for the benefit of the Republic.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The counterpart is also true.  A sum in excess of $4,000,000 has been traced out of the Zamtrop account into another ZSIS account the Permase General account.  That is of course a Government account.  It seems to me that the establishment of the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">return </span>of that sum in excess of $4,000,000 into a Government account shifts the evidential burden in respect of those payments back on AGZ to show nevertheless those sums in whole or in part were stolen or wrongfully misapplied.  In so far as he is unable to show that they have been misapplied then his claim is correspondingly reduced because the Defendants have established that the monies came back into the control of the Republic.  I cannot make inferences that the monies were subsequently stolen.  The inference is that the monies were back in the Government coffers.  I cannot assume a wrongful payment once AGZ concedes that some payments out of the Zamtrop account were for a legitimate purpose.  </p>

I have already referred to the $1,029,400 transferred to Basile and the figure of $287,236 transferred to Vittorio Lembo which is apparently a shop in Geneva.  In addition there are the jewellery payments to Fine Jewellers, the cash payments made to Nkumbula and $733,073 paid out to Mr Yotam Zulu one of ZSIS’s Executive Directors in charge of Administration and Finance.  This is another item in my view given the fact that Mr Zulu is alive and there is no reason why he cannot give evidence where AGZ must show that the money was then subsequently misapplied.  Finally there are the benefits made to FJT and his family, transfers to the Churches in the United States and Chief Justice Ngulube.  The next two items are $4,024,000 to the Permase account (see my comment above), and $2,591,989 in respect of cars and boats.  These too are areas where in my view AGZ is required to show they were illegitimate purchases.  I have the same observation in respect of the $1,150,000 transferred to Chanobi Resources Ltd.  Finally Bob Standaert and his family received $725,000 between 31st July 1996 and 30th March 2001.  No lawful purpose for these payments exists.  They were disbursed so far as I can see as set out above.  </p>

Questions then began to be asked about the discrepancy between payments that had been allegedly claimed on behalf of Systems as opposed to those passed on to it.  XFC wrote to Mr Mtonga on 23rd October 2001.  He revealed payments having been made through a special account but stated that he regretted that Mr Mtonga dealt with the matter on paper instead of verbally.  He reiterated that this account was a special account and it was sensitive and in the circumstances debate and disclosure “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">would unnecessarily open a Pandora’s box and the effect would be very difficult to deal with”.  </span>Mr Mtonga understood the reference to Pandora’s box to be an implicit threat to himself.  He nevertheless on 1st November 2001 commented on the conflict in the records in relation to payments to Systems and Wilbain.  XFC instructed CM to study the matter and investigate as XFC set out in correspondence to Systems.  BT opened a file in the name of the Office of the President on 5th November 2001 and he faxed a copy of CM’s retainer letter dated 20th October 2001 to XFC.  At the same time the Office of the President transferred a further sum of $399,995 direct to CM’s client account in London.  This was credited to the AFSL ledger.

In early 2002 Dipak Patel received some bank statements on one account (correcting paragraph 12 of his witness statement).  It was a ZANACO account.  He attempted to place these on 5th March 2002 in Parliament but was not permitted by the Speaker.  In May 2002 further statements of the same account (correcting paragraph 16 of his witness statement) were provided in the ubiquitous brown envelope.  There was some confusion as to the actual statements.  It transpired in cross examination of Mr Patel that he had not noticed (nor had the lawyers who assembled the exhibits) that two different sections of the bank statements had been put together.   The second part was dated 20th December 2002 and these plainly could not have been the actual statements Mr Patel was referring to as they are dated six months after he claimed to have seen them.  Part of them is dated 13th June 2002 and as I say this is really an error in compilation of the exhibit rather than a criticism of the veracity of Mr Patel’s evidence.  At about the same time the Post ran the article entitled <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Matrix of Plunder”.   </span>As a result of these revelations the state abandoned the criminal prosecution against the Defendants. </p>

It correctly identifies the Zamtrop account, the payments in, the payments out and the large number of unusual recipients.  It implicates FJT, XFC, and FK.  In addition MCD and CM are identified as recipients and disbursers of funds.  The only error was to attribute CM’s receipts as being transferred to Habib Bank in Geneva.

Failure to do that would give the Zambian based Defendants an opportunity in the event of an adverse finding against them to portray the position of one of inadequately presented evidence in a foreign tribunal.  An indication of this likely stance was shown by the article in the Guardian Weekly (December 16-22 2006) page 16 <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Judge Smith leaves Zambia without seeing FJT”.</span>  In the article it was pointed out correctly that FJT and the other Zambian Defendants had not attended the court in Zambia.  It set out also the erroneous arguments put up by those Defendants as to why they could not participate in the proceedings.  The article also complained that I came to Zambia but heard witnesses from Zambia in England.  The reason for that was the participating Defendants desire to cross examine certain witnesses face to face.  That was an essential process in my opinion.  In any event had the Zambian based Defendants participated they could have repeated the exercise in court with the witnesses live but they chose not to do so.  Finally the article pointed out that I did not have the benefit of the crucial document the Finance Charter.  The article once again erroneously gave the impression that it would <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“clarify for him the role that ZSIS played and gives guidelines on how intelligence funds are disbursed.  Since it is Government’s contention that former Intelligence Chief XFC misappropriated money from the OOP Smith would have been better informed if he had access to the Charter which would have given him an unbiased look at how ZSIS operated…”</span> Unknown to the author of the article steps were already in train to secure that document and it was secured and it is of no great significance as contended for by FJT or as hinted at in this article.</p>

That would only be true if there was any realistic possibility of the Zambian based Defendants providing any evidence that might negative AGZ’s claims.  The reality is that the Zambian Defendants have not participated not because of any flaw in the process but rather because in reality they have nothing to say against AGZ’s claim of any worth.  Their presence at the trial would therefore harden the conspiracy evidence in my view as against them and might actually have led to further evidence being available against the participating Defendants.  </p>

She was called late and the Defendants faced the unacceptable situation of evidence and documents being produced in Zambia only immediately before she was tendered as a witness. The Defendants were in the UK for this evidence not Zambia with the difficult video link as the method of cross examination.   I have no doubt that had she been properly led as a witness they would have required her to attend in the United Kingdom.

It transpired during her evidence that she was never asked to conduct a proper search in respect of the issues in this action.  She was seen by the Task Force in 2004 but was not asked to prepare a more general search until 1st December 2006.  Even then no computer searches were effected even though it was possible that there would be computer records.  When pressed on this after an adjournment of several days she revealed that the computers had been vandalised.  One is always sceptical in cases like this when a large number of computers appear to be vandalised or otherwise disappear.  AGZ’s claim involved these computers being damaged and the computer records of the Permase General accounts being corrupted and then the records affected by the usual <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“stock taking” </span>flood.</p>

One has to remember that even for this jurisdiction this case is a very complicated one.  The chase spreads over many many documents and many jurisdictions.  In my view it is plain that full searches were not effected by the time of the trial.  In this context further searches during the trial appeared to be inadequate.  I am not persuaded that Regis Phiri’s searches at ZSIS were effective.  He did not effect the search himself and there was no clear evidence of the subordinates who were asked to search their various departments.  I do not believe that the instructions to his subordinates clearly set out what and where they should search.  To do that requires an understanding of the claims which they might have.  I am always concerned when the lay people conduct searches because they are not necessarily fully aware of their overriding obligations on disclosure.  The most significant failing in this area is the lay person’s reluctance to disclose documents which harm the case.  In this context the Task Force and ZSIS officers are lay persons.  They cannot be expected to have a comprehensive understanding of the obligations of disclosure in the English courts.  </p>

He however displayed the traditional security secret obsessiveness of that displayed by XFC.  In the case of Mr Phiri I do not believe there was any dishonesty on his part.  Having seen him I thought he was an honest witness but he was obsessed with secrecy.  The obsession is well demonstrated by the performance over the production of the Finance Charter.  There was absolutely no reason as I have said for it not to be disclosed and the failure to disclose it would have fatally flawed AGZ’s claim under the Zamtrop conspiracy.  I would have been forced to rule that without that document being produced there would be no justified reason for finding the conspiracy.  It was the central tool for the conspiracy because it provided the cloak of secrecy to enable the conspirators to pretend to comply with the law whilst simultaneously stealing large amounts of money.  Given the case and its importance AGZ’s reluctance to produce it was bizarre.  </p>

First if AGZ has not made proper enquiries then his case will suffer a corresponding reduction in the level of claim.  Given the other documentary evidence which has been produced I do not see that the failings can lead to a conclusion that AGZ’s case as put forward against the Zambian based Defendants is faulty.  Second the failures appertain in reality to the methods by which the Zambian Defendants extracted their monies.  Most of it goes towards showing that a lot of people knew what was going on.  There is no doubt about that.  The reasons why nothing was done have been set out earlier in this judgment.

The stealing of the money and its processing is largely well documented and unchallenged.  Each Defendant knows the size of the claim against him and in each case given the current stance of AGZ limiting claims to traced claims (excluding the over arching conspiracy point) is traced through the Defendants hands and onward to transactions that took place at the instigation of the Zambian based Defendants.  </p>

However I do not believe there is one shred of evidence which shows that the Republic actually acquired the weapons.  There is significant evidence which shows that it did not.  The most significant of those is the fact that full payments were not made.  Even in the arms world it is unusual to deliver goods without payment.  Further as the case will show on the BK conspiracy none of the monies ever reached the supposed sellers.  It was diverted away.  Therefore Brigadier General Muchopa’s evidence was an illuminating insight into the workings of the military in secret matters and a classic exercise in evasion but did not have any significant impact on that part of AGZ’s claim.  He will establish the case on other material.  Brigadier General Muchopa contributed nothing to the case.  Nor does his evidence assist the Defendants in rebutting that conspiracy. Equally the failure to pursue Systems/Wilbain with any vigour does not affect the claims against the Participating Defendants. It is difficult to see how that avenue would do anything other than worsen the position of Defendants.</p>

There is a suggestion (but no elaboration) that he might have received £3,000 in cash.  His statements show him trying to distance himself from the affairs.  If he had given evidence what might it have shown?  It might have shown that he too was a dishonest participator in the conspiracy.  It might have shown that he was unaware of the documents and what was going on.  It might have shown (like many other of AGZ’s witnesses) that he knew what was going on but either for self interest or self preservation did nothing about it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AGZ in his closing (paragraph 163) criticised the attack on the Task Force against corruption from the non participating Defendants.  It is true there has been a sustained policy of denigration of the Task Force in the press.  It achieves nothing in respect of this litigation.  If the non participating Defendants had something to say they should have said so in these proceedings not the Press.  They chose not to do so. For reasons which will be self evident further in this judgment the failure of the Zambian based Defendants to attend the trial has counted against them <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">but has not counted against the participating Defendants</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AGZ in the same paragraph criticises the participating Defendants for taking a similar stance.  It suggested that the participating Defendants’ activities from first to last have done much to make the matters investigated deliberately impenetrable.  In my view this criticism is unjustified.  It is true that throughout the whole of the proceedings the participating Defendants lawyers have been vigorous on behalf of their clients.  Sometimes (particularly in the pre trial skirmishes) I formed a clear view that the activities were oppressive and unnecessary.  Too much time was spent in arguing things and taking untenable stances in correspondence.  I refer for example to the whole performance of CM and BT’s Part 24 application which to my mind was nothing more than a distraction and an unnecessary one. It was devoid of merit and was in my view designed to delay the trial (like some other stances taken).  Ultimately their bluff was called when they chose not to make a fresh application to me following their failure to obtain permission to appeal my decision in front of Sedley LJ.  It has certainly continued thereafter.  The correspondence approached blizzard like proportions on occasions. However ultimately the tactic failed; the trial took place.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">However one cannot avoid the fact that a lot of this was justified because of the way in which AGZ deployed his case with the obvious inadequacies which the Defendants sought to exploit.  The Re Re Re APOC is a huge document.  I ordered a summary.  That itself went to 91 pages.  The bundles for the trial were dauntingly huge.  I ordered the production of a Core Bundle (3 volumes as it appeared).  It rested unloved and unlooked at throughout the whole of the trial.  This is because AGZ chose to deploy his case through the vast array of documents.  This has led to an over concentration of minutiae and blind alleys.  Once the Claimant goes down that road all the other parties follow.  It is not unnatural for a Defendant to approach a case on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“ordo ab chao” </span>Defendants regularly hope to make as much trouble as possible in the hope of either persuading the Claimant to give up or create such confusion that the tribunal cannot really understand what has gone on.  There was a significant element of the Defendants’ approach to this.  The closing of CM &amp; BT for example takes up 30 pages (out of 160) on an attack of AGZ’s witnesses.  </p>

There is an issue as to whether CM was operated as a sole trader by BT or was a partnership between BT and BBT.  The most useful piece of evidence on that issue could have been CM’s accountants.  They did not give evidence nor were their working papers produced.  Equally BT’s evidence as to the writing up of the ledgers could have been assisted by the bookkeeper who wrote the ledgers being produced. Further the accountant who prepared some of the accounts was a relative of BT but he has not given evidence.  Neither explained the absence of such evidence.</p>

I cannot believe that the figures ($500,000,000) is reflecting any significant contribution by XFC.  My conclusion is either XFC did not have funds (and therefore that any injection would come through from Mr Tampiyappa in reality) or if he was going to inject funds these statements were designed to cover up the fact that any such funds would be misappropriated funds from the Zambian Government.  Also I do not see this evidence carrying any weight to enable the Defendants to submit that XFC had substantial private funds which were also injected into the Zamtrop account.  </p>

I have had no guidance as to how that figure should be calculated. I stress that is not intended as a criticism. My provisional view is that the amount against each Defendant should be increased pro rata as between the Defendants beyond the GT traced amount by the amounts referred to in paragraph 274 above.

There may be some legitimate expenses which can be shown to have achieved a benefit for the Government despite the fact that the funds were not claimed for that particular head of expenditure. I do not see how AGZ can claim the Republic has lost a particular sum of money and claim damages if the funds were used beneficially for it. However notwithstanding the fact that it may be possible to identify some such payments the Defendants are wrong to use them to elevate the Zamtrop account to a legitmate Government account.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">  I have already observed that AGZ does not challenge the large sums paid to Systems and Wilbain in excess of their apparent contractual entitlement.  The payments out are identified in annex 10 to the RRRAPOC.  Some of these have already featured in this judgment ($4,100,000 that went to the Permase General account 001).  Mr Regis Phiri the current DG of ZSIS himself received $61,000.  He received it into his private bank account and was extremely coy in his evidence about why he received it simply describing it as <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“an operational matter”.</span>  The Zambian High Commission/Embassy in South Africa received $340,000.  There are clearly payments at the other extreme (as CM and BT concede in their skeleton closings) such as payments to FJT’s children. Chanobie Resources Limited received $1,100,000.  Telecommunications Limited received $60,000 and $1,345,000 was paid to Daimler Benz AG.  The Defendants identify the various payments in their closings (paragraphs 194-203 MCD paragraph 139 CM &amp; BT).  AS has a similar point as regards his payments but I will deal with that when I deal with individual Defendant claims.  The total amount for vehicles appears to be around $2,500,000.  Some may be questionable.  I am not sure why Pilatus Engineering received $180,000.  Mr Huwiler’s statement does not make the position clear although on his evidence he appears to have been <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“minding”</span> the Honda and other motorcycles acquired by XFC from Bob Standaert.

Second I can conceive of no legitimate purpose for large cash withdrawals to be taken out and handed over to FJT (by definition his children) and XFC.  Absent an explanation the cash transactions are in my view plainly further instances of stealing of Government money.  The only possible flaw in this argument is the fact that other people received cash the former Chief Justice Ngulube, Mr Zulu, Mr Regis Phiri (who I accept had a legitimate reason for receiving those funds), and Mr James Mtonga the former Permanent Secretary in MOF who received about £5,000.  Some of these people had been interviewed but so far as I am aware no proceedings have been brought against them.

There was no evidence at the start of the trial as to what had become of it.  During the course of trial some bank statements were disclosed.  It emerged that there were 3 accounts <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Permase General Account 001”</span> at the Findeco Road branch, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Permase General Account 677 </span>and<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Permase Account 053”.</span>  Mrs Muyunda produced some incomplete documents.  The rest were apparently lost first because of a computer crash and second because of a flood where the documents were stored (it being suggested faintly that the flood was not an accident).  Some payments came out of those accounts to Defendants (CM received $200,015 on 6/7/01 and a further $400,015 on 2/11/01).  Both those came in from account number 677.  That had been fed by a sum of $710,000 which was transferred to account 001 and subsequently credited to 677 Account.  GT traced that.  Whilst GT traced $2,769,000 of the $3,314,000 credited to the 001 account that does not assist AGZ because I have determined that the monies returned to ZSIS’s control by the Permase General account puts the evidential burden back on AGZ to show that they were subsequently applied for an illegitimate purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AGZ accepts that due to the absence of records it is not possible to give a comprehensive explanation of the disbursements of the Zamtrop money paid into the Permase General accounts.  Nevertheless he submits that it was paid out for private purposes and or without proper authorisation and/or without being properly accounted for.  I am not persuaded that on the balance of probabilities AGZ has made that out.  It is true that it is somewhat odd that the money leaves MOF to go to Zamtrop in London and then back into the Permase General accounts where it is withdrawn in cash.  Given the inadequacy of the records and the fact that the TF has not in my view fully investigated these areas I am of the view that the monies taken out in cash in favour of third parties cannot be said to be misappropriated on a balance of probabilities.  It is possible that these were operational payments. It is possible they were payments to other fraudsters or to buy silence.  I do not know and I am not in a position to determine it.  Therefore AGZ has failed to establish this part of the claim applying the dictum in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Rhesa Shipping</span>.  I stress however I leave out of that determination payments that were made to XFC and payments that can be traced back to the other Defendants.</p>

The acceptance of deposits in the operation of current accounts from cheque deposits was expressly excluded.  Equally AFSL in my view had no entitlement to dispense cash and I accept AGZ’s contention that in the operations identified in this case by AFSL it acted outside the terms of its licence.  </p>

It is said however that that was at the instigation of XFC and was understood to be secret activities which it was not appropriate to question.  A fundamental error is in paragraph 13 where it is suggested that AFSL was established long after the contracts between Systems and Wilbain were entered into.  It is true that there was a contract in 1994 but the fraud in my judgment arises from the MOU which came into being in June 1995.  Meridien collapsed about that time and after transfers from MOF the substantial transfers to the Zamtrop account occurred from December 1995 at the same time that AFSL was set up.  This is not in my view coincidental.  </p>

FK acknowledges that monies were routed from the Zamtrop account to MCD in London and then transferred from MCD back to AFSL in Lusaka.  There is no dispute about this; the dispute is as to the extent of knowledge of what was going on on the part of FK and in this context IM.</p>

He details the unusual arrangements that took place concerning XFC and ledgers opened with a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“ZAM”</span> connotation.  Many withdrawals were in cash.  The relationship between AFSL and XFC and the OOP and the operation of the ZAM client accounts was not disclosed openly.

Taking these into account the total amount transferred by MCD to AFSL is $6,053,358.43 (see AGZ’s closing paragraph 335).  The remitter was invariably described as MCD despite the fact that this was purportedly AFSL money received by it from the Zamtrop Account and credited to an AFSL or FK ledger.  IM when he gave evidence could not explain the purpose of this arrangement; he was simply following FK’s instructions.  He in turn of course in his statements said everything that he did with the money was on the instruction of XFC.  It is suggested (faintly in my view) that the routing of the money like this was to help ZSIS in its security.  With the money coming from MCD with a remitter of MCD the money is no longer apparently Government money.  In my view this routing of the money through MCD is strong evidence of the conspiracy to defraud.  There is nothing in the AFSL ledgers to link these monies back to Zamtrop and MOF.  This combined with the secrecy referred to by Mr Mwale shows in my view operations of the conspiracy and not genuine secret service activities.  </p>

The examination of Mr Mwale established that he had not seen any documentation recording a loan from CM.  AGZ in his closing (paragraphs 1409 et seq) appears to accept that CM had no beneficial interest in the Epakor facility.  It appears to have been a facility provided by Francis K.  It may be that facility was disguised as coming from him possibly in breach of his fiduciary duties that he owed to AFSL.  FK expressed surprise that Francis K had interests in Epakor (interview 20th August 2002).  I am not in a position to come to any conclusion about that.  Nor is there anything significant in my view about this facility for the purpose of this action.  AGZ’s claim is not about breaches of fiduciary duties of directors owed to AFSL.  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">107. It is common ground that there are two types of actionable conspiracy, conspiracy to injure by lawful means and conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. The first is sometimes described simply as a conspiracy to injure and the second as a conspiracy to use unlawful means (see eg Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (17th edn, 1995) pp 1267–1268, paras 23–76). In our view they are both conspiracies to injure and their ingredients are the same, with one crucial difference. In both cases there must be conspiracy to injure the claimant, but in the first case (in which the means employed would otherwise be lawful) the predominant purpose of the conspiracy must be to injure the claimant whereas in the second case, although the defendant must intend to injure the claimant, injury to the claimant need not be his predominant purpose.</span>

For present purposes we would define them as follows. (1) A conspiracy to injure by lawful means is actionable where the claimant proves that he has suffered loss or damage as a result of action taken pursuant to a combination or agreement between the defendant and another person or persons to injure him, where the predominant purpose of the defendant is to injure the claimant. (2) A conspiracy to injure by unlawful means is actionable where the claimant proves that he has suffered loss or damage as a result of unlawful action taken pursuant to a combination or agreement between the defendant and another person or persons to injure him by unlawful means, whether or not it is the predominant purpose of the defendant to do so.

It is important to note that the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means is different in significant respects both from the crime of conspiracy and from the law of contract. A criminal conspiracy is in essence an agreement to commit a crime and, as such, is complete when the agreement is made, whether or not it is carried out. For this reason care must be taken in considering decisions in criminal cases where (as here) the question is whether the tort of conspiracy was committed. Lord Diplock put it in this way in the Shell Petroleum case:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">'Regarded as a civil tort, however, conspiracy is a highly anomalous cause of action. The gist of the cause of action is damage to the plaintiff; so long as it remains unexecuted, the agreement, which alone constitutes the crime of conspiracy, causes no damage; it is only acts done in execution of the agreement that are capable of doing that. So the tort, unlike the crime, consists not of agreement but of concerted action taken pursuant to agreement.' (See </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">In that passage Lord Diplock appears to have been referring to both types of conspiracy. The essence of the unlawful means conspiracy is injury to the claimant as a result of an unlawful act or acts where two or more people have combined to cause the injury. It is not necessary that every overt act is done by every conspirator, but the act must be done pursuant to the conspiracy or combination.</span>

A further feature of the tort of conspiracy, which is also found in criminal conspiracies, is that, as the judge pointed out (at p 124), it is not necessary to show that there is anything in the nature of an express agreement, whether formal or informal. It is sufficient if two or more persons combine with a common intention, or, in other words, that they deliberately combine, albeit tacitly, to achieve a common end. Although civil and criminal conspiracies have important differences, we agree with the judge that the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division delivered by O'Connor LJ in R v Siracusa (1990) 90 Cr App R 340 at 349 is of assistance in this context:</span>

The very existence of the agreement can only be inferred from overt acts. Participation in a conspiracy is infinitely variable: it can be active or passive. If the majority shareholder and director of a company consents to the company being used for drug smuggling carried out in the company's name by a fellow director and minority shareholder, he is guilty of conspiracy. Consent, that is agreement or adherence to the agreement, can be inferred if it is proved that he knew what was going on and the intention to participate in the furtherance of the criminal purpose is also established by his failure to stop the unlawful activity.'</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Thus it is not necessary for the conspirators all to join the conspiracy at the same time, but we agree with the judge that the parties to it must be sufficiently aware of the surrounding circumstances and share the same object for it properly to be said that they were acting in concert at the time of the acts complained of. In a criminal case juries are often asked to decide whether the alleged conspirators were 'in it together'. That may be a helpful question to ask, but we agree with Mr Brodie that it should not be used as a method of avoiding detailed consideration of the acts which are said to have been done in pursuance of the conspiracy.</span>

In most cases it will be necessary to scrutinise the acts relied upon in order to see what inferences can be drawn as to the existence or otherwise of the alleged conspiracy or combination. It will be the rare case in which there will be evidence of the agreement itself. Curiously this is such a case, although it appears to us that in crucial respects it is also necessary to draw inferences as to the extent of the agreement from what happened after it. Thus the essential nature of the agreement can be seen in part from the evidence of Mr Al Bader and Captain Stafford, although, especially in the case of Captain Stafford, the extent of the agreement will depend upon inferences to be drawn both from the surrounding circumstances and subsequent events.”</span>

He then asked himself whether each of the transactions which made up the four schemes was carried out pursuant to the conspiracy and concluded that the defendants were all parties to a single actionable conspiracy. He then considered whether Captain Stafford at any stage left the conspiracy. In our judgment that was the correct approach, although (as explained below) we have reached the conclusion that in one important respect the judge did not correctly identify the true nature of the conspiracy and that the question whether Captain Stafford left the conspiracy did not have to be considered. We do not consider that there was any unfairness in the way that the judge approached the case or, indeed, in the way in which it was advanced at the trial. The defendants had no doubt at each stage what case they had to meet.</span>

The evidence does not enable me to make a finding that he has done so, but equally, I am unable to go so far as to make a positive finding that he has not. The frauds based on falsified Brown &amp; Root invoices continued for a few months after his departure, but they were merely a continuation of a method which had already been in use for a year and did not involve any departure from the plan as it had by then developed. The main frauds which occurred after his absence involved the purchases of additional second-hand tankers and the four new buildings (scheme II) and the diversion of the war risk premium rebates to Clarksons (scheme III).

It is not necessary for Captain Stafford to have taken an active role in order for him to have remained a party to the conspiracy, much less for him to remain liable for the loss which the plaintiffs have suffered as a result of its continuing implementation by Mr Al Bader and Mr Qabazard. It is sufficient that he should have continued to play a part by keeping silent and later by helping to protect Mr Al Bader and Mr Qabazard when Mr Al Roumi's investigations began, despite the fact that he had the means to disclose both the existence of the conspiracy and much of what had been done pursuant to it. For these reasons I have reached the conclusion that Captain Stafford did not effectively withdraw from the conspiracy when he retired to Australia. His active participation between September 1986 and September 1989 together with his subsequent silence remained as one of the effective causes of the loss which the plaintiffs suffered as a result of its continued implementation by Mr Al Bader and Mr Qabazard.'</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">148. It is plain from that passage that the judge held that Captain Stafford was liable after he left Kuwait because he had not withdrawn from the conspiracy. It follows that his liability in this regard depended crucially upon the finding that the agreement or conspiracy was to defraud the claimants whenever the opportunity arose. Thus, however long into the future a particular defendant committed an act defrauding the claimants, all the defendants were liable for the loss sustained as a result because the act was committed pursuant to the conspiracy. We have reached the conclusion that this part of the judge's reasoning cannot be supported. In our judgment, neither the evidence of the agreement in September 1986 (or indeed in December 1985) nor the inferences which could properly be drawn from subsequent events justified the conclusion that Captain Stafford agreed that he would continue to take any part in the conspiracy after he had left Kuwait and the employment of KOTC.</span>

We do not think that silence or subsequent cover-up rendered him liable as a conspirator in the absence of evidence that he either played a part in, or received the proceeds of, any later acts of misappropriation on the part of Mr Al Bader or Mr Qabazard. The conclusions reached by the judge in the passage quoted in para 147 show that there was no such evidence.”</span>

It is plain that their knowledge of a large amount of the misappropriations is non existent.  There is no evidence to show that they had any knowledge beyond the transactions that they were involved in.  If I find that they are conspirators in the over arching conspiracy they will have a liability for all the losses.  The differences can be significant.  AS has a potential dishonest assistance liability of $3,339,089.  That figure reduces to $1,415,762 as a result of the GT exercise of identifying traces from MOF.  That itself further reduces in the light of Miss Pincott’s further evidence to $1,347,993.  In the case of CM the dishonest assistance claim is $3,247,548 reduced to GT traces to $2,127,822 and further reduced if limited to the correct proportion of MOF sources to $1,228,523.

Thus I am satisfied on the law for example that the participating Defendants can be found to be conspirators if they were not aware of the initial conspiracy but tacitly became conspirators.  They can become conspirators when they are aware of all of the surrounding circumstances and expressly or impliedly share the same object.  This is closely akin to the question of whether lawyers (and AS in my view) can be liable in dishonest assistance because they become aware of things that they ought to question but dishonestly fail to question them.

If his clients would not give him this, he would have refused to become involved. I do not on the material before me conclude that Mr Folchi became knowingly party to the scheme to injure GT or THL. But I do conclude that Mr Folchi received and complied with instructions which conflicted, on their face and in the most obvious way, with the most fundamental of fiduciary duties, to keep private and corporate affairs and monies separate. Despite any confidence Mr Folchi may have had in his clients and the distinction of the officers whose accounts were in question and despite the prevalence of complementary payments, I cannot view it as honest conduct for any lawyer to facilitate indirect payments from one's client company's accounts to unknown accounts in the names of the client company's directors, without any clear understanding why this should be necessary or appropriate. Any other conclusion would be an invitation to fraud. Directors of previously impeccable reputation can succumb to the temptations of their stewardship.

The measure of damages in my judgment as regards XFC and SC are the sums claimed in AGZ’s summary namely $25,754,316 plus $600,000 payments to CM from OOP (XFC) and $25,754,316 (SC).  At the moment the amount claimed against FJT is $2,995,369 being the amount transferred from the Zamtrop account and other sources attributable to FJT.  That sum itself might be reduced to $1,098,962 or $1,031,247 being the amounts traced by GT attributable to FJT and Basile.  At the moment I see no justification for such a low figure.  I do not see why he should not be liable for his breach of fiduciary duty to the same extent as XFC and SC.  At the end of the day he was the President and whatever the actions of XFC and SC and their respective breaches none of it could have happened had FJT himself not committed his own major breach of fiduciary duty.  He participated in the secret setting up of the Zamtrop account for the purposes of wrongfully removing the Republic’s Government funds.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“This is an objective standard. At first sight this may seem surprising. Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence. Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated. Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct. Carelessness is not dishonesty. Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety.”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances. The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not subjective. Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual. If a person knowingly appropriates another's property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he sees nothing wrong in such behaviour.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">In most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Nor does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless. However, in the situations now under consideration the position is not always so straightforward. This can best be illustrated by considering one particular area: the taking of risks.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in"> The test is clearly an objective test but the breach involves a subjective assessment of the person in question in the light of what he knew at the time as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated.  As the passage stresses carelessness is not dishonesty and dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety.  However self evidently a person is not allowed to set his own standard of honesty in particular circumstances.  I observe that if he were there would never be any liability because the cases only come to trial if the person denies he is dishonest and did not believe he was dishonest.  All that is said in my view is another way of posing the jury question.  Merely because a person says he did not believe what he did was dishonest does not mean the court has to accept that.  If the court is of the opinion that with his knowledge he consciously departed from the objective standards of propriety he is dishonest.  The text equally establishes that honest people do not deliberately close eyes and ears or deliberately do not ask questions lest he learns something he would rather not know and then proceed regardless.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The case concerned 2 solicitors.  The first was acting in connection with a purchase of land which required borrowings.  The prospective lender was only willing to make the loan if repayment was secured by a solicitor’s personal undertaking.  The first solicitor was unwilling to give such an undertaking so the client found a second solicitor who gave an undertaking to apply the proceeds solely in the acquisition of the property.  The second solicitor sought assurances from the client that the money would be so used and received them from the first solicitor.  Thereupon he released the money to the first solicitor who regarded the money as held upon account from the client and paid it out upon his client’s instructions.  He took no steps to ensure the money was only applied in the acquisition of the property and a substantial part was used for other purposes.  The second solicitor went bankrupt and the lender commenced proceedings against the first solicitor alleging that he dishonestly assisted in the second solicitor’s breach of trust.  The Judge at first instance found that the first solicitor had not been dishonest although he had deliberately shut his eyes to the implications to the undertaking.  The Court of Appeal reversed that finding giving judgment against the first solicitor for the proportion of the loan that had been misapplied.  On appeal the House of Lords (Lord Millett dissenting) in effect in my view refused to go behind the first instance Judge’s finding that the solicitor was not dishonest and therefore reinstated his dismissal of the claim.  The difficulty of the decision was the first instance Judge’s finding that whilst the solicitor had deliberately shut his eyes he was not dishonest see Lord Slynn’s judgment paragraphs 4-5.  The leading judgment was that of Lord Hutton.  He expressed the view that Lord Millett’s dissenting judgment involved a purely objective test (paragraph 30) and thus expressed the view that Lord Millett’s test on determining the liability of an accessory dishonesty was not necessary and that liability depended on knowledge.</p>

This arises because of a common judicial reluctance to make grave findings in particular against professional men.  In my view this reluctance is erroneous.   First there is no justification in applying a more strict principle against a Defendant merely because he is a professional.  It is no less grave for a non professional to be accused of dishonesty.  The courts have always been reluctant wrongly in my view to adopt that stance.  Second cases in the last decade have shown sadly that there are plenty of professional men who act dishonestly.  </p>

The reason for that was that the allegation against the Defendant was that he had participated in a fraudulent breach of trust.  It is plain that Mummery LJ considered dishonesty as being fraudulent.  I agree with that analysis.  Section 21 LA 1980 can have no application in this case against the dishonest assisters or the conspirators (save FJT, FK and SC who do not plead limitation) because they are not in a relationship of trust with the Republic.  At paragraph 120 it is clear that Mummery LJ has in mind that fraud is the equivalent of dishonesty in respect of Section 32 (1) (a) and in the case of deliberate concealment.  Thus he does not look at a cause of action in a general way (such as breach of trust) but looks at the cause of action as alleged.  His judgment was of the whole court.</p>

In my judgment the claims plainly fall within Section 32 LA 1980.  I conclude that for two reasons.  First I do not accept that the restricted wording as to be found in the cases under the earlier Act has any application.  I accept the equation of fraud and dishonesty as set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Gwembe</span> case.  In other words one looks at the allegation.  Not every breach of trust is fraudulent or dishonest.  Nor is every conspiracy necessarily fraudulent.  It seems to me that the word fraud in section 32 if equated to dishonest should look at the nature of the allegations against the person in question.  It is different in the case of dishonest assistance because that is an essential ingredient of the claim.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">There are sound reasons for this general approach.  I accept the primary purpose of the Limitation Act is to provide for a claim to be brought within a reasonable period.  The purpose of that is as IM says in his closing submissions to avoid people having stale actions brought against them.  When a party is aware of a claim it is not inappropriate that there should be a reasonable time limit within such a claim is brought.  </p>

It seem to me plain that the balancing exercise as against stale claims is that when someone is defrauded or is the subject of dishonest conduct they are not to be disadvantaged until they have an opportunity to discover the wrongful acts.  The reason for that is that it would be an unsatisfactory state of law if people who behaved dishonestly could escape liability by successfully hiding their wrongdoings for the period of the primary limitation period.  That would encourage fraudsters.</p>

It is suggested that the receipt into the CM accounts was <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“in circumstances where there had been a deliberate commission of a breach of duty by officers of the Government and where the misappropriated monies had been remitted via the Zamtrop account and, in some cases, then laundered through the client account of the First Defendant or through the Redcliffe account or the Shansonga B account, before being remitted to the client accounts of the Second Defendant.  The purpose of remitting such monies to and from the Cave Malik client accounts via the Zamtrop account (and other accounts as above) was to conceal from the Claimant and any person investigating the misappropriation of the Claimant’s monies the true destination of the monies and/or to conceal from the recipients of the monies their source.  Accordingly, receipt of the monies into the Cave Malik client accounts was necessarily in circumstances where the fraudulent and deliberate breach of trust was unlikely to be discovered for some time”.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The second question of deliberate concealment is more difficult.  I have no doubt that there has been deliberate concealment on the part of the Zambian based Defendants.  The whole scheme was set up by them deliberately to conceal their dishonest stealing of the Republic’s monies.  The first point to consider is whether that is enough to postpone time as against all other conspirators or dishonest assisters.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Cave v Robinson establishes that deliberate concealment includes a deliberate breach of duty either concealed or undisclosed and committed in circumstances such that it was unlikely to be discovered for some time.  </span>Active concealment is not necessary if the Defendant is accused of intentional wrongdoing in circumstances where he could <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“safely calculate on not being found out for many a long day”</span> (Lord Millett paragraph 22).  As Lord Millett points out the purpose of the deliberate concealment is to cover 2 matters.  First there is active concealment and second (Section 32 (2)) deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances which must make it unlikely that the breach of duty will be discovered for some time.  Therefore deliberate concealment means either an active concealment or passive concealment committed by deliberate breach of duty when the Defendant is aware that it is unlikely that the breach will be discovered for some time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims against the participating Defendants are in conspiracy and/or dishonest assistance for this purpose.  The difficulty is that the deliberate concealment by the Zambian Defendants affords a practical cloak for the protection of the participating Defendants.  AGZ cannot discover the claims he can bring against the participating Defendants because their role has been covered up by the Zambian based Defendants.  That offends sensibility.  Nevertheless in my view I have come to the reluctant conclusion that that is the law.  Section 32 talks about actions committed by the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Defendant</span>.  The only exception is when actions are done by agents.  I do not see (and AGZ does not contend) the Zambian based Defendants can be regarded as the participating Defendants’ agents for this purpose.  Any deliberate concealment must be by the relevant Defendant.  This is unfortunate because the participating Defendants will have the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“benefit” </span>of the deliberate concealment by the Zambian Defendants to conceal the fraud but time nevertheless runs against them in the normal way.  </p>

If exceptional measures show that the misconduct on the part of the Defendant could have been discovered that will count against the Claimant unless the Claimant shows it would be unreasonable for him to take such steps.  In other words the exceptional measures need not be taken if it is reasonable for him so to act.

The only effective way in which the matter could have been investigated outside the conspirators is via the Auditor General (Mr Siame).  I have already commented on his position.  I am quite satisfied (given his role in the affair) that nothing would have happened.  I have not determined that he was a party to the conspiracy but I am satisfied that he would have done nothing to stop the conspiracy carrying on.  What I unable to decide is why he would not have done anything.   However I am quite satisfied given the evidence set out earlier in this judgment that the one thing he would not have done is take any steps to stop the conspiracy continuing.  </p>

I have had extensive written submissions (mainly from AGZ) running to in excess of 1300 pages.  I do not propose to deal individually with every point made in all the submissions but rather will distil those submissions in the light of the evidence I have seen.  To do otherwise would mean a judgment of hugely disproportionate length.  My findings will be based primarily on documents and the evidence of witnesses especially in the light of cross examination.  All witnesses had failings; it is necessary for me to evaluate the failings in the light of their evidence as a whole and to conclude whether they were truthful or untruthful and why they were untruthful (see the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">EPI </span>case referred to above).  I also regard it as essential to evaluate the case against each Defendant in the light of their knowledge.  I have to be particularly cautious because AGZ has on occasions tended to blend all the evidence against all the Defendants.  I also have to be searching because the Zambian based Defendants did not give evidence.  However that searching is to be tempered by the fact that there is no good reason for them not to have participated.  As I have already said special arrangements which they ignored were made for them to have full access to lawyers, a full participation in the hearings both in Zambia and in London and a full opportunity to make representations and give evidence if they wished.  The reason they have not done so is as I have already said because in my view they were guilty of the conspiracy and breaches of fiduciary duty and dishonest assistance as alleged by AGZ against them.</p>

However the same premise applies namely that the recruitment of IM was a step taken by XFC and FK in the furtherance of the conspiracy.  The purpose was to wash money through MCD’s client account and hide its source.  This is reinforced by FK’s statement referred to above when he tried to blame all of it on XFC.

He also accepts he paid off credit cards held by AS on some cards when XFC had a card and was a charge holder.  At least £341,520 was paid to Barclays Premier card.  The expenditure shows huge amounts of personal expenditure shopping, restaurants and similar.  AS said all of these were paid on behalf of XFC.

XFC was one of the main conspirators.  By his control of the Zamtrop account he ensured the defrauding occurred.  His control could have stopped it.

I do not see how FJT can have any lesser liability for breach of fiduciary duty than them.  Indeed there are compelling reasons why he should have the same liability.  At the end of the day he was the President at the top of the control of Government finances.  He was uniquely positioned to prevent any corruption.  Instead of preventing corruption he actively participated in it and ensured it happened.  It is difficult to find an adjective that adequately describes the failure on the part of FJT.  He has defrauded the Republic.  He has deprived the people over whom he was exercising stewardship on their behalf of huge sums of money which was supposed to be spent for their benefit.

He has not taken advantage of that option and in so doing he has in my view further abused the people of Zambia.  They are entitled to an explanation from him as to what has happened to the large amounts of monies which were under his control by virtue of the Finance Charter and which came into and out of the Zamtrop account.

I am quite satisfied that he had an active role in the setting up of the Zamtrop account and its operation.  I am also satisfied that on occasions he actively participated in payments made to it and he received substantial personal benefits.  The first personal benefit occurred as early as 29th December 1995 when $20,000 was transferred to Basile.  That payment was authorised by XFC.  Significant sums were spent on benefits for his children in terms of cash, business class air tickets, expensive school fees or similar.  He did not have the resources to fund this.  The only slender possible justification put forward is that the Zamtrop account was fed by beneficial donors and this money was used.  I reject that as being incredible.  I cannot conceive as I have said earlier that an innocent person would mix donation monies with Government monies in a Government account if it was a genuine Government account.  Second no evidence has been adduced to show any such donations.  Third even if there were donations there is a procedure for declaring the donations; they are not supposed to be hidden away in a secret account which is monitored by FJT, XFC and the Auditor General.  In other words FJT is simply lying.</p>

This is the sole potential instance of third party monies.  They are however not available for his private use unless they are fully declared and accounted for.  FJT well knew about the payments.  On at least one occasion he discussed them with Beauty Kaluba the ZANACO Branch Manager in London (her statement to the TF 24/71).  Absent any explanation for these payments (and there is none) I conclude any third party payments were made dishonestly to repay or secure favours from FJT.</p>

FK in his Defence says that he and AFSL acted on instructions of XFC.  AC’s Defence is similar.  Their justification was that the purchase was for ZSIS purposes and they were not entitled to enquire further and had no need to.  This is a mantra repeated by the Defendants repeatedly.  It is not a sufficient answer when a transaction puts a person on enquiry as to its correctness.  However that does not apply to FK and AC because I am satisfied that they well knew what the purpose of the purchase was and this statement is merely a lie to justify their role in an attempt to legitimise it.  There can be no ZSIS purpose to justify this purchase.</p>

The total amount expended appears to be $145,000 purchase price and $297,500 for chattels.  FJT still lives in this property and there is (to put it mildly) an ambiguity as to whether or not he is supposed to be a tenant.  There is more detail on this transaction in respect of claims against BT but I am quite satisfied that the property was intended to be purchased for the benefit of FJT beneficially and that beneficial interest was deliberately obscured by the way in which it was acquired.  It belongs to the Republic as do the chattels. The faint suggestion that this was a government pension provision is untenable. If it was there would be no need to hide the acquisition through obscure nominees.</p>

No justification has been forward by FJT which shows he was entitled to these monies.  In his Defence he denied that it was Government property and that the transfers were illegal and he says that he did not authorise a transfer of Government money to CM and demands AGZ prove this.    FJT however provides no evidence as to the source of the funds other than misappropriated Government monies.  The preferable interpretation (which I accept) is that FJT knew that these payments were funded out of Government money which had been transferred under the direction of XFC from the OOP to CM between July – November 2001.  He knows this money is coming in because he received £30,000 in cash in November 2001 at the hands of BT personally and he asked for it in advance according to BT.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The significant point about these payments over and above the fact that they were made for the benefit of FJT and/or his children is that they were made after the huge publicity in Zambia about the corrupt activities.  This is an example of the conspirators carrying on in the same old way finally removing the last elements of stolen money from the CM client account.  It is done with the connivance of XFC because he authorised the original payments, with the connivance of FK because he directed CM to effect the payments and with the connivance of FJT because he received the benefit of the payments.  I remind myself that the figure of $74,730 paid in this short period represents 75% approximately of 10 years of FJT’s salary.  There is no realistic prospect of him establishing any legitimate entitlement to these monies.  BT’s role will be discussed further in this judgment.  </p>

Mr Wills in his statement (as I have said) said XFC wanted him to buy him a $50,000 gold Rolex for him and cut some money out for Stella.  He asked for $20,000 but he refused.  Despite that so called refusal Wilbain transferred $50,000 to SC’s personal bank account with ZANACO London on 5/6th June 1995.  This payment can only be on the basis that it was a bribe and she does not deal with this in her Defence simply denying she made any financial gains and did not receive any secret benefits.

I have also set out her role in ensuring the payments were made and that any questioning of the payments was discouraged.  I do not accept that she was merely carrying out matters under the veil of state secrecy acts.  She plainly had a far more significant role and knew more.  For this she was paid.  In addition to the $50,000 GT has attributed payments to her of $37,103.  GT in its original paragraph 4.4 had that figure but in its revised report H4 4.4 reduced it to $16,847.  However that was because at that stage BLG CM’s solicitors would not agree that PC Mumba the recipient of $20,256 on 12th March 1998 was either SC or a member of her family.

First AGZ has established there has been a disposal of assets in breach of fiduciary duty i.e. the traced funds from the MOF account into the Zamtrop account.  Second he has established as regards the items summarised above tracing of those monies into assets of Francis K or to third parties for his benefit.  Third he has established constructive knowledge on the part of Francis K that the assets are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty.  AGZ does not show express knowledge on the part of Francis K in my view.  However as I have said he has constructive knowledge because it is all to be found in the records (or non-records more appropriately) of AFSL.  Finally in this context Francis K’s failure to answer the charges in this court is evidence of that liability.  The other claims I dismiss because AGZ has not satisfied me to the requisite standard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the evidence of dishonesty is the receipt of a large amount of money with no explanation as to why he received it and its retention.  On that material I am prepared to infer that Basile received the excess dishonestly.  Whether he remitted it to back to FJT or XFC or kept it himself I do not know.  I do not believe for one minute however that he received it for the purposes of spending on genuine ZSIS purposes (rejecting IM’s submissions in that respect).  He has therefore in my view dishonestly assisted in the stealing of the monies via the Zamtrop account.  He has facilitated it in some way which is unexplained.  It is unexplained because he chooses not to tell.  In addition in my view the large unexplained excess shows that he knows there was dishonesty in respect of the acquisition of the clothes. There is clearly something far more to these transactions than the purchase of clothes. Whilst I appreciate the lifestyles of the extremely wealthy enables them to spend large sums of money on items like this I do not believe any honest person dealing with FJT and XFC would believe they would have legitimate access to such funds <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">in their own right.</span> The size of the expenditure should have excited suspicion. The receipt of further large sums is supportive of AGZ’s contention that the whole transactions are part of a conspiracy to defraud or that Basile has dishonestly assisted in the breaches of fiduciary duty made by FJT and XFC. I accept that submission. Basile in view of the large unexplained excess sums he received which he chooses not to explain cannot assert merely that he was an honest trader selling his wares to a customer and no more. I therefore conclude his actions were dishonest and further were part of a conspiracy to defraud the Republic of the monies he received in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">their entirety.</span> Either he chose not ask because he did not want to know the answer or he knew there was dishonesty and he knew it. There is no honest explanation for the excess receipts and that in my view taints the entirety of the transactions. There can of course be no benefit to the Republic in the acquisition of the specially designed and sized clothes and I do not know why it should have this expenditure foist on it. It can seek to sell them and if it does will have to give credit for the proceeds. This too should be explored when I hand down the judgment</p>

It led to the disbursement of $9,260,000 through MCD’s client account of which $7,021,020.17 have been traced by GT into the Zamtrop account from MOF.  This is actually no surprise for IM as he knew of the Zamtrop account and he knew that the monies coming from it were Government monies.  His case is that he was acting for ZSIS in this secret operation.  During the course of his evidence he attempted to put forward a case that he was acting for AFSL to justify disbursements made at the behest of FK.  However his primary case arising out of the Churchill Hotel Agreement was that the whole operation was for the benefit of ZSIS’s operations.</p>

In view of the serious allegations that were made it was important that every person on the receiving end of such allegations should be given a fair opportunity to confront those in cross examination.  I made it clear that I would not entertain a criticism of the truth of a witness in closing speeches based on matters which had not been put to that witness.  It is important because without such matters it unfairly deprives the witness of the opportunity to persuade me by his answers and demeanour that he is an honest person and is to be believed.  The converse is also equally applicable; it deprives me of an opportunity to assess a witness in that light.  It is fashionable to suggest that the live evidence of a witness has less importance nowadays.  If by that it is meant to assert it is often the situation that the result generally turns upon contemporaneous documents I would not dissent from it.  If it is intended to suggest that the importance of live evidence subject to vigorous cross examination is less important I would fundamentally disagree.  This case has demonstrated graphically the need for people to present their case and for that presentation to be tested.  The failure of the Zambian Defendants to attend has counted against them for that reason.  </p>

I accept the observations in IM’s closing that IM’s cross examination was an ordeal over some 6 days.  It was vigorous but I do not accept it was unreasonably aggressive.  Had I perceived it to be like that I would have intervened.  There were a number of occasions where it was clear to me that IM made a mistake when answering questions.  In making that mistake (for example) he appeared to be acknowledging dishonesty on his part.  I gave him an opportunity to reconsider his answer on those occasions.  IM never admitted dishonesty on his part during the whole of the 6 days of cross examination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The sad thing however is that there have been many cases in the courts where professionals have become embroiled in fraud for little or no personal benefit.  They often commit the fraud out of a desire to please clients whom they wish to impress.  They are sometimes flattered that famous or powerful people use them.  They often succumb to that flattery and fail to exercise their thought processes in a proper way.  Once ensnared they find it impossible to remove themselves from the wrong doing.  There is undoubtedly a state of affairs that occurs when people are dazzled by being associated with those in power.  There may not be an immediate benefit from the conspiracy but it is quite possible that the association with figures of power gives them kudos and indirect benefits.  In this context it is significant to note that from the FK statements to the TF he suggested that XFC had singled out IM because he was aware he had international contacts.  It is likely in my view that he perceived IM as being susceptible to flattery and might become malleable because of the prospect of being associated with further concentrations of power.</p>

A telling example which came up repeatedly in cross examination was the fact that he believed all the monies were ZSIS monies transferred from the Zamtrop account to be distributed for ZSIS purposes.  When it was pointed out to him that the disbursements were for some objects which were clearly personal benefits of FK he was then put on the horns of a dilemma.  During the course of his cross examination he developed another possibility namely that AFSL had an entitlement to some of the monies because of services that it had rendered to ZSIS.  </p>

IM (in contrast to BT) does not say that he did not review his bank statements.  Equally I reject his statement in paragraph 40 that he was not sure that the reference XFC (on the first remittance) was to Xavier Chungu.  It is plain it was and he would recall in the light of FK’s fax and letter that reference.

He says with extreme casualness in his witness statement <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“I probably should have opened a file and ledger in the name of AFSL at this stage since both XFC and FK had made quite clear that the party carrying out the services for ZSIS was AFSL and that AFSL was my client”.  </span>It took him nearly 3 years after the initial receipt to open a ledger in the name of AFSL which was opened on 26th February 1998 (ledger no 3556).  Over the next month some $175,000 of that credit was disbursed on the instructions of FK.  The first disbursement was a cash payment of £5,000 to FK himself on 7th December 1995.  That was effected by an instruction signed by IM and ND of the same date addressed to Nat West to transfer it from the client account to the office account.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The major difficulty that faces IM in my view is that right from the start he apparently credited Government monies to a ledger in the name of FK.  He accepted unquestioningly instructions from FK to disburse money from that account.  It is plain that all of the disbursements in respect of the very first payment in are plainly not for Government purposes.  An honest person would know that those payments are not being utilised for secret service commitments.  IM must have realised that; it is self evident from the nature of the disbursements.  It must be appreciated that on IM’s case FK had no beneficial entitlement to the monies.  Simply following FK’s instructions as to disbursement would lead to the possibility that IM must be alert to that FK might actually be defrauding the Government.  In fact IM asked nothing about the disbursements or why Paine Webber were sending monies which he credited to this particular FK ledger.  Equally in addition to the clearly questionable payments to FK’s wife IM really should question why monies coming from Zamtrop account allegedly for the benefit of AFSL are then partially remitted back to AFSL Zambia.  By 8th May 1996 virtually all of the monies had gone.  $50,000 was transmitted to Tokyo Overseas Corporation and AFSL, $20,000 to Rajani, $100,000 each to Grove International and Kudu Enterprises and $52,580 was remitted to Mitsui &amp; Co.  There were further cash payments to FK and IK.  None of these payments was explained.  IM did not know what the payments were for.</p>

It does not appear to me to be clear how anybody can accept any of these payments as being for the purpose of ZSIS activity on their face.  In some cases the remitter is identified as a complete stranger.  For example the $100,000 sent to Alnida has a remitter as being Aslan.  The remittance of $100,000 to Kudu Enterprises has a remitter Salim Patel.  In these cases FK tells IM to identify the remitter and IM simply implements it without question.  The only transaction that comes anywhere near a possible ZSIS acquisition is the Toyota vehicle purchase funded by the transfer of $52,580.28 to Mitsui above.  However I have no evidence to show that that was a purchase of a Government vehicle.  In any event such a purchase in that way is not the normal way for acquiring Government vehicles.  </p>

His evidence also was that the account had sums mixed in it allegedly from private activities of FK/AFSL or in respect of entitlement on the part of AFSL to receive Zamtrop monies for services rendered.  All of this mixing took place without any question by him.  It means that he could never be sure whether any payment was properly payable because on his own case he did not know the beneficial ownership of the funds he received.  He did not ask so he never knew on his evidence who owned the funds.</p>

There can be no question about Mr Folchi’s competence.  An honest lawyer in his position would, to safeguard himself and his clients, have insisted on obtaining a proper understanding and assurances regarding the situation (quite possibly in writing despite the supposed confidentiality of what was occurring).  If his clients would not give him this, he would have refused to become involved…… I conclude that Mr Folchi received and complied with instructions which conflicted, on their face and in the most obvious way, with the most fundamental of fiduciary duties, to keep private and corporate affairs and money separate.  Despite any confidence Mr Folchi may have had in his clients and the distinction of the officers whose accounts were in question and despite the prevalence of the complimentary payments, I cannot view it as honest conduct for any lawyer to facilitate indirect payments from ones clients company accounts to unknown accounts in the names of the clients company director without any clear understanding as to why this should be necessary or appropriate.  Any other conclusion would be an invitation to fraud.  Directors of previously impeccable reputation can succumb to the temptations of their stewardship.  Any lawyer in Mr Folchi’s position must be taken to be aware of this risk, and I have no doubt Mr Folchi was as aware of it”.</span></p>

He plainly believed that all the monies were to be received in respect of the Churchill Hotel Agreement and were to be disbursed under that regime.  If a disbursement was not to be under that regime it ought to have been clarified and justified.  IM should have requested that clarification and justification especially in respect of requests by FK to remit money (for example) to his wife and to make payments back to AFSL in Zambia.  In my view any honest and competent solicitor would have sought immediate clarification.  Given the nature of the supposed transactions IM was particularly vulnerable and he ought to have enquired if only to protect himself and the various potential clients.

His conduct therefore was dishonest as soon as he failed to question the very first instructions to disburse funds.  This grew and grew and of course it must be appreciated that he received at least $7,000,000 over the period of time.  Not one direction to dispose of these funds was ever questioned by him.  </p>

However this conclusion is supported by other evidence which I shall set out below.  He was not in my view a conspirator in the over arching conspiracy to defraud with XFC, FJT, FK and SC.  He was however in a sub conspiracy to steal the monies that were routed through his client account.  Once again I do not know whether he became actively a conspirator i.e. knew that there was a conspiracy and agreed to join it or whether he was aware of such material that if he participated in the activity he became a conspirator.  It is not necessary for me to decide that potential difference.  I am satisfied that he became at least a conspirator because he was aware that money was being improperly applied and chose not to question that activity.  Further he facilitated the theft.  To avoid becoming a conspirator he should have refused to act unless satisfied that the transactions had a genuine honest purpose.  He failed so to act and was accordingly dishonest.  </p>

With further explanation I suppose it is possible that some might have a ZSIS purpose but on the face of them none of them does.  It should be observed for example on 30th June 1999 ND implemented FK’s 21st June 1999 instruction to remit $100,000 to Vittorio Lembo and an identical amount to Basile on the same day.

He set up Harptree yet he failed to reveal who gave him instructions and has never revealed any of the documentation.  He stated that he believed that FK informed him that he would be the beneficial shareholder of the bearer shares in Harptree but that he would hold the shares as a nominee for ZSIS. That is inherently contradictory.  Nevertheless whilst all of his instructions re Harptree came from FK he did not consider the Zambian Government or ZSIS to be his client.  This was despite the fact that he knew it was funded from the Zamtrop account.  He considered Harptree to be his client and that he held Harptree’s monies subject to FK’s instructions.  He has never revealed how FK was in a position to exercise control over Harptree.

It is not FK on this evidence.  The Mandat had to be signed by the beneficial owners and the origin of the funds invested in the company had to be indicated.  For both of those to be truly answered by IM according to the evidence before me the ultimate beneficial owner should be ZSIS and the source of monies should be Government monies received from the Zamtrop account.  He sent the documents back on 13th May 1998.  The Mandat was signed by the beneficial owner.  Unfortunately that document has been lost.  IM gave evidence to the effect that he believed he would have identified FK as the beneficial owner.  He acknowledged (T29/76/20-25) that in identifying the beneficial owner as FK if that was correct his evidence before me was untrue.  The other alternative was that the evidence before me was true i.e. ZSIS was the beneficial owner but the answer he gave to the Luxemburg authorities was untrue.  Equally he told an untruth in respect of the source of the monies.  IM acknowledged (T29/75/4) that the requirement for the source of the monies was a money laundering check.  He did not identify the Zamtrop/ZSIS source.  He therefore provided 2 false statements to the Luxemburg authorities and misled them in respect of money laundering activities.  </p>

Further he had an opportunity to correct any errors in the transcript and the part in relation to Harptree was not challenged.  It should be noted that the interview was recorded.  The answers that he gave in relation to Harptree and AFSL were plainly deceptive.  First he stated that there was a loan between Harptree and AFSL when he knew there was no loan.  Second he failed to reveal who was behind Harptree.  Part of that failure arises out of the careless question asked by Mr Fletcher <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“who is behind Harptree then?

He was asked whether FK was the bearer shareholder of the BVI company and his answer was <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“I have no idea whether he is holding the bearer shares in his hands or whether somebody else is holding bearer shares”.  </span>That is a deceptive answer when looking at his evidence in paragraph 52 of his witness statement.</p>

He reported FK on the basis that he was <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“the ultimate beneficial majority shareholder” </span>in Harptree.  The reason for the disclosure was the fact that he then held $783,066.10 for the credit of Harptree Holdings Ltd <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">(“we are without instructions”).  </span>After setting out the transaction he then stated <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“the beneficial owner Mr Kabwe in Zambia was charged with theft of public funds in 2002, together with various other persons who are not our clients including the ex President of Zambia”.  </span>That was either a false statement to NCIS as to the beneficial ownership of Harptree or IM is lying now when he asserts that Harptree was beneficially owned by ZSIS.  It was put to him in cross examination (T29/60/1) that his Defence as put forward in this trial that the acquisition was for ZSIS was to legitimise the transaction belatedly.  IM denied that.  He was unable to explain why he did not tell what he now says to me to NCIS.  Once again either he lied to NCIS or he lied to me.  In my view he lied to me.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view it is obvious.  The Jarban purchase was FK’s pay off for his role in the conspiracy.  IM whilst he did not know the over arching conspiracy details took instructions from FK on behalf of Harptree because he believed it belonged to him beneficially.  Yet he knew that the purchase was funded by Government monies via the Zamtrop account but did not question FK’s entitlement to them.  That failure, (even if his case is to be believed, that it was a ZSIS purchase), and the failure to record that in any document are actions again which an honest solicitor would not do.  Such a large purchase of a block of flats and an apartment hotel cannot conceivably have been regarded as a purchase for ZSIS operations.  Equally the labyrinthine routing of the ownership of the properties via a BVI holding company with nominee directors and bearer shares and a Luxemburg company interposed show that the whole operation was to hide things.  I do not accept that the purpose was to hide ZSIS involvement; it was to hide the fact that Government monies were stolen and used to acquire assets which apparently belonged beneficially to FK and IM dishonestly knew it.  </p>

That legal burden remains on AGZ.  However once IM acknowledges he knows he is receiving Government money the evidential burden then goes on to him to show that it was being applied lawfully.  The only lawful use that he can pray in aid is a disbursement under the umbrella of the Churchill Hotel Agreement.  I have looked extensively at the disbursements.  Not one can be clearly identified as being for a ZSIS purpose under that agreement.  IM in his closing suggests there might possibly be some but in my view that is not enough given his failure to ask any questions whatsoever.  He has no idea at all what the funds which ran through his client account were being used for.  </p>

That left a balance of $7,161.45 on that account.  On 31st May 2002 MCD transferred $10,000 to CM.  At June 2002 the balance on account 2535 was $9,815.95.  On 1st November 2002 MCD paid $7,541.03 to Robert Simeza (FK’s lawyer).  At June 2002 the Harptree ledger was in credit in the sum of $871,311.99.  On 12th November 2002 MCD transferred a further $75,058.03 to CM on the written instructions of FK dated 15th October 2002.

One has to look at the situation in June 2002.  FK is accused of fraud.  IM asserts that FK/AFSL were his clients but in respect of Harptree FK though not the client gave the instructions.  IM knew that the money that came into the Harptree account came from the Zamtrop account and was Government money.  Yet he did not report the matter to NCIS for another 2 years and he never reported the matter to the authorities in Zambia.  Those are not the actions of an honest man in my view.  Further in my view his statement that he ceased to act for AFSL is a lie designed to give an impression of honesty when he was still making dishonest payments.  The very minimum an honest solicitor would have done in those circumstances in my view is to say to FK and the others that he could do nothing and would release no monies until the position was made absolutely clear.</p>

Simply accepting without further ado AC’s statement that FK continued to have authority is something that an honest solicitor in my view would not do.  They are all alleged to be involved in the conspiracy and being told by the conspirators to carry on in the same old way is simply not acceptable. Equally given the sourcing of the funds in Harptree and the fact that it was Government money and the fact that whilst FK might have had instructions those instructions were on behalf of the Government it is impossible for an honest solicitor to allow FK to direct $75,000 out of the Harptree account to CM without finding out fully what is going on.

The CJA 1993 broadened the scope of the offence to cover the proceeds of criminal conduct generally.  Various regulations culminating in 1993 Money Laundering Regulations were implemented to prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.

The purpose of these warnings is to ensure that solicitors are properly informed.  The need for vigilance is shown by this case and the case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Manolakaki v John Constantinides [2004] EWHC 749 Ch</span> where the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Yellow Card” </span>warning was sent out in respect of banking instrument fraud.

A failure to do so will expose a professional to allegations at the lowest of gross incompetence and at the highest that failure may be added to the evidence in deciding that the professional in question has been dishonest.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">In my judgment, these are powerful submissions. It seems to me that once Mr Faronbi suspected Trusty International’s directors of participating in money laundering, on the basis of the judge’s clear findings of what Mr Faronbi was aware of, the distinction which the judge then drew between Mr Faronbi’s suspicions of the business in general and his ignorance about the particular transactions in question in this case becomes a thin line whose value for the purposes of insulating Mr Faronbi and thus the Bank from the necessary complicity is highly uncertain. It is one thing to be negligent in failing to spot a possible money launderer, providing the negligence does not extend to shutting one’s eyes to the truth. It is another thing, however, to have good grounds for suspecting money laundering and then to proceed as though one did not. Money laundering is a serious crime, for the very reason that ex hypothesi its subject matter is the proceeds of crime. It is true that such proceeds are not necessarily those of a breach of trust – they could be the proceeds of drug dealing. But I am doubtful that that possibility provides any protection where there is a breach of trust. It is also true that the growing concern now experienced about money laundering and the international precautions now taken against it must be viewed in the context of public policy rather than on the level of an equitable tort designed to provide remedies in the civil law against knowing assistance in breach of trust. Nevertheless, I do not see why a bank which has, through its managers, a clear suspicion that a prospective client indulges in money laundering, can be said to lack that knowledge which is the first element in the tort”. </span>

In the context of the over arching conspiracy that is correct but it ignores the substantial part he had to play on a subsidiary basis.  The sums involved are still large.  It is no good IM submitting that he made little direct financial money out of the transactions.  That often occurs and I have no means of assessing whether he perceived he had indirect benefits from being associated with those in power in Zambia.  His conduct is clear in my view.  Nor is it particularly significant that his records (in stark contrast to that of BT’s see below) fully set out the transactions.  I have no doubt that he must have been reasonably confident that everything would be hidden within his client account in England and  the Zambian authorities would not have been as persistent as they have proven to be in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">As is acknowledged in paragraph 26 of his closing IM was an unsatisfactory witness.  The unsatisfactory nature was not in my view because he was eager to please and consequently rather suggestible.  There is a limit to the number of times that can be said on behalf of an experienced individual of the like of IM.  He has sought to explain the answers he gave to the OSS in a similar vein.  Of course allowances have to be made for the pressure of the case and the errors that are clearly made.  His answers were regularly confused and illogical.  However the reason for that was the fundamental implausibility of his case.  Time after time he was unable to explain whether a particular transaction was a ZSIS transaction (they were all supposed to be such). When a disbursement (for example to IK) was put to him his answer was that that was FK’s personal entitlement out of AFSL.  This falls apart for the reasons I have already set out in this judgment.  I reject the criticism that Mr Sullivan for AGZ cross examined in respect of each example.  This was necessary so that AGZ could show the enormity of the transactions and to demonstrate the patent inadequacy of IM’s performance as a solicitor because of the large number of transactions which were clearly questionable but were cases where IM made no enquiries whatsoever.  The cumulative effect of this demonstrates IM’s dishonesty.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Equally I reject the suggestion that IM should not have been suspicious of FK in 1995.  The Churchill Hotel Agreement is so unusual its implementation should be considered cautiously by a professional man.  The lack of documentation, the lack of informing of ND and the unusual disbursement requests that arrived almost immediately all required an honest solicitor to question what was going on.  IM was dishonest because he did not act as an honest solicitor; he never questioned anything.  He cannot have been under any illusions that the monies were Government monies.  There can be no commercial transactions that AFSL could have had with ZSIS that could have generated a fee income that ran to at least $7,400,000.  An honest solicitor would have questioned this.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">During cross examination IM acknowledged his fundamental difficulty.  Too much money had been paid away on clearly non ZSIS activities.  He justified this on the basis that it represented remuneration that was due to AFSL.  The major difficulty about this of course is that he was party to arrangements where on his case AFSL money and ZSIS money were freely mixed.  As I have said above it countered his initial justification by the opening of account 2535 in the first place.  In his closing (paragraph 69) it is suggested that his answers were after the event rationalisation or acceptance of suggestion rather than a recollection of his understanding at the time.  I do not see that any of those is the correct analysis.  It was simply put to him that his story that AFSL was not spending its own money because of the large amounts involved was impossible.  He fell in with that suggestion when he acknowledged that the amounts far exceeded any amount that reasonably could be attributed to AFSL remuneration.  The difficulty facing him however was his acknowledgement that he did not know when asked to carry out each FK directive whether or not it was a ZSIS operation, an AFSL operation or whether it was using money to which ZSIS was beneficially entitled or whether it was using monies to which AFSL had somehow become beneficially entitled. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The most graphic example of this is in fact the Jarban acquisition where all the paperwork showed that the properties ultimately belonged to FK beneficially.  Yet IM knew the monies came from the Zamtrop account and the bulk of them have been traced back to MOF.  I do not accept that there was any genuine confusion.  It is not after the event rationalisation in my judgment it is after the event justification.  The justification however is false.  There is no serious possibility that IM even on his own case could have seriously believed these large sums of money belonged beneficially to AFSL.  FK and XFC did not provide him with any such possibility at the Churchill Hotel Meeting and there was nothing in the communications between FK and IM which suggested that either.  As I have said above the nature of the requests for disbursements themselves called out to the need for an honest solicitor to make enquiries.  IM is merely trying to invent at the trial a legal justification for not enquiring further with FK.  He is attempting to mislead the court and in effect submit he did not need to make enquiries because it was all AFSL’s i.e. his client’s money.  This is plainly dishonest.  No honest solicitor in my view in IM’s position could allow this mixing.  I acknowledge he probably had no idea to whom the funds belonged but that was a question that he did not ask because he was simply implementing whatever FK told him.  He suggested he was satisfied that he could do that and mix but there is in my view no honest justification that could entitle him to treat monies as belonging to FK/AFSL/ZSIS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course there are possibilities that the monies might have had a legal purpose but no evidence has been adduced to suggest any of them had.  Certainly IM cannot put up any reason as he acknowledges in his closing submissions.  All of this is speculation and the court is being driven to speculate that there might be honest motives because IM chose to make no enquiries when an honest solicitor would have made enquiries.  If these were for ZSIS purposes it would have been the easiest thing in the world to speak to FK or XFC about it.  They have trusted him with the receipt of at least $7,000,000.  There is no basis for suggesting that if the operation was honest that they would not have explained to him in some way so he could be satisfied what the payments were for.  That was a necessity to discharge his obligations as a solicitor of the Supreme Court.  He has to apply an independent mind if only to be satisfied that dishonesty is not happening and that he is not being involved in it.  Although IM suggested that he had no reason to distinguish ZSIS funds from AFSL funds that is an incredible observation to make by a solicitor.  </p>

It is <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">essential </span>for a proper understanding of the beneficial entitlement of client account monies to exist that the ledgers which represent each client’s contribution to that global account figure is clearly identified.  IM whilst his accounts correctly recorded the incoming and outgoings failed utterly to identify the beneficial owner of the various incoming and outgoings.  Normally one would expect a relevant ledger with the name of the client and the funds credited to that to belong to that client.  IM fails this logical requirement from the first.  He opened account 2535 in the name of Faustin Kabwe.  This he did despite the fact that he understood that the remittances were to come from ZSIS via the Zamtrop account.  His evidence was that it ought to be monies which belonged to AFSL yet he allowed FK to disburse AFSL monies for clear non AFSL purposes.  For the account to be properly operated it should have been designated in the name of ZSIS and the monies attributed to it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">One sees the same in respect of the Harptree Holdings account where as I have set out above monies were at the instance of FK distributed for clear non Harptree purposes.  The Harptree account itself is ambiguous.  The monies that come into it come from Zamtrop or Zarkam (which has a connotation with XFC) in the main.  It is true that there are some credits which are stated to be from clients but that rather makes the point.  I have already observed the payments made to Vittorio Lembo and Basile (in excess of $200,000) out of this account together with the payments to Bob Standaert and the acquisition by Jarban.  There are other credits from Katumbi, Betti which are relevant to the BK conspiracy to which I shall refer at that part of the judgment.  These are serious failings.  They are in my view an attempt to disguise where the monies are coming from and where they are going to.  IM has a role in that because either he knows the dishonesty is going on or he suspects it and dishonestly failed to make any enquiries which would lead an honest solicitor to seek to understand the activities.  I agree it is not surprising that IM received $9,000,000 of Zamtrop funds and mixed them in the ledgers as he suggests in his closing (paragraph 74) but not for the reasons he gives.  In my view they are part of the cover up and he did it dishonestly and thereby facilitated the unlawful stealing of the monies that were run through his firm.   I do not accept having seen him in evidence and cross examination that there is any other credible honest explanation for the enormity of the failings on his part.</p>

In reality there was no real way in which the arrangement would support the secrecy of ZSIS.  Nor was any explanation of any credible nature put forward by IM as to why the transactions that he was asked to effect needed this cloak of secrecy.  Throughout all of this is his failure to question why his client account had to be used in this way as opposed to ZSIS or even AFSL opening bank accounts either in the UK or operating these transactions through AFSL’s existing banking facilities.  It is submitted that the assumptions that he made are perfectly understandable.  I do not accept that.  I am of the opinion that they are not understandable.  </p>

I have been provided with no explanation as to this glaring failure.  In my view it is another example of IM acting dishonestly.

I have not reached this conclusion without regret.  IM clearly has had a long and distinguished career but that should not deflect me from the conclusion that I ought to come to in the light of the evidence before me.  Taking into account all that evidence including the documents IM’s primary evidence and his cross examination I have come to the conclusion that I have.

One is particularly significant that of 18th September 2000 where FK asks IM to remit $50,000 from the Systems account and $6,000 from the Access No 2 account (total $56,000) to AFSL.  The fact that MCD had opened an account in the name of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Systems Innovations Inc” </span>(ledger 3762) from 27th May 1999 is something that plainly requires an explanation.  IM’s explanation is in paragraph 59 of his witness statement:-</p>

IM apparently missed the significance of this and attempts to put it down to FK’s difficulty with the English language (paragraph 62).  This account was reduced to zero (although further credits came in later) on 31st May 2000 as a result of an instruction from FK addressed to IM to pay £30,000 to AS.  The instruction is <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“please make the following payment on behalf of your clients SYSTEMS INNOVATIONS INC”.  </span>Both IM and ND authorise that on 1st June 2000.  The remitter is identified as MCD.  The remitter on IM’s evidence was actually AFSL if his evidence above is accepted.  According to the ledger the remitter ought to have been Systems.  IM could not satisfactorily in my view explain why an AFSL ledger account was given the name of Systems.  Nor was his explanation as to the misuse of language by FK satisfactory.  There has been no explanation to why Systems had a client account with MCD.  It is plain in my view that FK intended Systems to have a ledger account hence his instructions to make transfers on behalf of Systems.  IM unquestioningly accepted FK’s instructions to deal with the Systems ledger payments.  He was unable (T33/19) to explain why Systems was remitting £30,000 to AS save it was on the instructions of FK.</p>

Whether an act or omission was done in the ordinary course of a firm's business cannot be decided simply by considering whether the partner was authorised by his co-partners to do the very act he did. The reason for this lies in the legal policy underlying vicarious liability. The underlying legal policy is based on the recognition that carrying on a business enterprise necessarily involves risks to others. It involves the risk that others will be harmed by wrongful acts committed by the agents through whom the business is carried on. When those risks ripen into loss, it is just that the business should be responsible for compensating the person who has been wronged.</span>

Negligence can be expected to occur from time to time. Everyone makes mistakes at times.  Additionally, it is a fact of life, and therefore to be expected by those who carry on businesses, that sometimes their agents may exceed the bounds of their authority or even defy express instructions. It is fair to allocate risk of losses thus arising to the businesses rather than leave those wronged with the sole remedy, of doubtful value, against the individual employee who committed the wrong. To this end, the law has given the concept of 'ordinary course of employment' an extended scope.</span>

As it is, the only relevant plea in the particulars of claim is the compendious allegation that in doing what he did Mr Amhurst was acting in his capacity as a partner. In so far as this allegation is an allegation of fact, it is assumed to be correct.</span>

Drafting these particular agreements is to be regarded as an act done within the ordinary course of the firm's business even though they were drafted for a dishonest purpose.

He emphasised that vicarious liability can be established even if the employee is guilty of intentional wrongdoing relying upon <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Lloyd v Grace Smith &amp; Co [1912] AC 716</span>.  The vicarious liability of the employer (and likewise the partnership) does not depend upon the employee’s authority to do the particular act which constitutes the wrong.  It is sufficient if the employee is authorised to do acts of the kind in question.  He points out correctly in my view that to say a solicitor (for example) drafted an agreement negligently is to describe the way in which he drafted it.  It is equally when an agreement is drafted dishonestly or a sham agreement does not describe the way in which he drafted it or the nature of the document it describes the purpose for which he intended it to be used.  The question in those cases is whether it was within the ordinary course of business of the firm to draft documents.  The House of Lords held that it was.  How those documents were used, whether correctly, negligently or dishonestly is irrelevant to that issue.  </p>

The question under Section 10 is the liability of the firm for loss caused to outsiders by the acts of a partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the firm or with the approval of the co-partners.  ND knew that MCD was receiving money on behalf of AFSL and disbursing it according to the instructions of FK.  He did not know that the monies that were thus received were stolen as part of a conspiracy and that IM had dishonestly facilitated that by allowing the firm to be used for that purpose.  That knowledge however makes the transaction i.e. receipt of AFSL’s money and disbursal by the direction of FK the ordinary business of the firm.  It also means that the firm is aware of it because ND is aware of those facts and agrees to them.  </p>

It started with another action JJ Coughlan Ltd v (1) Minesh Ruparelia and (2) BT (formerly trading under the name Ruparelia Thaker (a firm) (HQ0007203).  The Claimant sought £300,000 from the partners.  After full pleadings, disclosure and witness statements there was a trial in July 2002 (a significant time in the chronology of this case) and Mackay J gave a judgment arising out of the trial on 30th July 2002.  BT was represented in the Coughlan action by RPC.  Mr Ruparelia was represented initially by BLG until they came off the record shortly before the trial.  BT referred to the Coughlan action in his witness statement in this action (3rd witness statement paragraph 33 et seq).  Despite that BLG refused to disclose the pleadings stating they were irrelevant.  It is unfortunate AGZ did not apply for disclosure because that stance in my view is completely untenable.  The witness statements (redacted) were disclosed.  There seems no basis for the redaction either.  </p>

The firm had an OSS investigation in March 1998.  This is significant because it shows that BT because of personal experiences must be aware of these warnings and the potential fraud of fellow partners.  The Judge found that the representations that Mr Ruparelia made were not in the ordinary course of the business of a firm of solicitors.  The action therefore failed against the firm and thus BT.</p>

Further unacceptability in my view occurred when the same firm of solicitors and Counsel appear for both the entity CM and BT.  I should say that although Mr Croxford QC who appeared for both BT and the firm declined to say who was instructing him on behalf of CM.  There was only one candidate namely BT.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">However as the evidence was deployed during the trial it transpired that BBT had been unable to manage his affairs (save apparently signing a set of partnership accounts as to which see below) since 2001.  CM and BT raised an issue over whether or not there had been acknowledgment on behalf of the firm.  In my view (and I so determined) there had been acknowledgement on behalf of the firm by BT (if a firm was found to exist).  However it was clear (and I so ruled) it would not be possible to levy execution abroad against the assets of BBT in the event that I determined he was liable as a partner.  Under RSC order 81 rule 5 (3) execution could not be levied against BBT for a judgment against the firm unless he had either acknowledged service of the Claim Form or been served within the jurisdiction or had been served out of the jurisdiction with permission.  </p>

In the alternative, my Lord, if your Lordship is against me on my primary case …. there is a firm consisting of two partners then we are satisfied that those instructing me and myself are satisfied that they are entitled to act on behalf of that firm and to take instructions on behalf of that firm on the advice the firm takes a point which is your Lordship will appreciate is largely a point of law”.  </span>Mr Croxford QC declined to tell me who was instructing him but as I have said it could only be BT. He was equally unwilling to tell me whether he had instructions from BBT (it is plain now that he did not).  It was pointed out to Mr Croxford QC that BT’s view was that what he did was within the business of a solicitor and that was his evidence as a proprietor of CM and (if it be the case) a partner.

He first lived in England in 1969 and after an education at Harrow High School continued with his education in England until 1978.  He returned to Zambia to spend summer holidays with his parents.  In 1979 he embarked on a 5 year articles program with a view to qualifying and practicing as a solicitor in Zambia.  He undertook his training with CM Ndola (“CMZ”).  At that stage it was a partnership between Mr Malik and a Mr Cave.  The latter emigrated to Australia in the mid 1980’s and Mr Malik practiced as a sole practitioner until his death in 1991.  </p>

BT joined the firm in 1991 as a non admitted solicitor pursuant to the provisions of the Legal Practitioners Act.  He also obtained limited rights of audience in the Zambian High Court.  BBT had been persuaded to carry on CMZ following Mr Malik’s death until one of his daughters was in a position to take over.  That never happened however and BBT continued to run the practice until he ceased practising in 2002/2003.  After that 2 of BBT’s assistants continued the practice until the office closed permanently in 2005.</p>

He asserts that his father was not a partner in Kehimkar &amp; Co.  From 1st June 1996 he changed the name of Kehimkar &amp; Co to CM.  He needed the permission of the Law Society under the Solicitors Practice Rules 1990 (“SPR 1990”) to practice in the name of CM because it was a name that did not consist with a name of a present or former partner.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">BBT therefore was on the notepaper because he was a partner or because he was held out as a partner right from the inception.  Of course although in the opening AGZ suggested its claim against CM and thus BBT was (inter alia) based on holding out there has been no representation addressed to AGZ which has been relied upon so as to found a holding out and/or estoppel which prevents these Defendants from denying that BBT was a partner.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course the designation of BBT as a partner might be a holding out and he is not actually a partner.  However it might also constitute the true state of affairs i.e. he was a partner.  The BT letter to Habib Bank makes it quite clear that he has decided that BBT would be a salaried partner.  What is certainly the case is that he was never designated merely as a consultant in the firm.  I will return to this aspect later when I consider the secondary liability if any of BBT and CM.  </p>

After a physical recovery it is stated that he was simply mentally incapable of assisting at all with any legal issues.  He provided a 2nd witness statement dated 5th February 2007.  In that he commented on the 2 copies of the CM accounts 1998 and 1999.  He states that he does not believe they are his father’s signature.  He attached a copy of his passport which includes a signature.  Paradoxically however he did not address the 2003 signature.  On instructions Mr Fenwick QC told me that it was acknowledged that that appeared to be BBT’s signature.

If the monies handed over by BBT were gifts they would simply go into BT’s pocket and would not need to be put into the account.  The plain fact is that for the entirety of the operation of CM BBT had a capital account.  He has been apparently advised that in law he was not a partner with BT.  I have not seen that advice. I do not know what material was put before the anonymous Leader. I have not seen what explanation was given for the accounts and other documents set out above and how the Leader dealt with them if at all.  However there is nothing wrong with the concept of a partnership whereby one partner takes all the profits to the exclusion of the other partner.  The other partner is content to have a share in the capital of the firm.  BBT by having capital in the firm however (contrary to BT’s assertion in paragraph 28 of his 3rd witness statement) will be exposed to losses on dissolution by Section 44 PA 1890.  It appears that trading losses (like profits) were attributable to BT.  That is not surprising given the fact that BT clearly ran CM and thus took the rewards but was exposed to the trading losses.  That is of course as between BT and BBT; it has nothing to do with the outside world or whether or not BBT was actually a partner.  </p>

A trading body has to keep its records for at least six years.  Accordingly it is plain that there must be other documentation that has been withheld from me which could throw light on this situation.  In my view absent any credible explanation as to the production of the working papers of CM and/or CM’s accountants or evidence from the accountants I conclude that they would not show what is now being suggested as a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“question of law” </span>that BT and BBT were not partners.  BT plainly thought he and BBT were partners until he received this advice in October 2005.  BT gave no initial evidence about the relationship with BBT.  Ultimately there was an exchange of letters which barely addressed the matters which BT ought to have dealt with but failed to do.</p>

It is simply impossible with any credibility for him to be unable to explain the accounts, his signature to the accounts and how the accounts came to bear a signature purporting to be the signature of his father.  The reason is self evident.  BBT became a partner in CM right from the start and was a partner throughout.  Any lack of clarification of the terms of the partnership arises simply over BT’s attempt to deceive the court by putting forward a bogus case asserting that BBT was not a partner.  There was and remains plenty of material which has been withheld as I have set out above. </p>

In my view that is the reality of the case and is the end of any argument as to whether or not BBT was a partner.  There may be arguments as to the terms of the partnership and the nature of the work carried on by the partnership but it is impossible in my view (whatever advice BT claims to have been given in 2005) to argue that BBT was not a partner.  He became a partner by consent and was always a partner.</p>

More significantly it shows in my view strongly that BBT was at the very least a partner in CM and furthermore was aware of what its activities were. However it is the only evidence which could support AGZ’s contention there was one firm. All other evidence in my view is contrary to that, the Zambian and UK notepaper, the UK accounts and the various transactions show BT sometimes having a role in CMZ but as a consultant not a partner in one firm. There is no evidence showing a connection with CMZ which appears to have been run independently. I reject AGZ’s case therefore that there was one firm with three offices in the UK and in Zambia. However this does not have any impact so far as I can see because of my finding that BBT <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">was</span> a partner in CM throughout its operations.</p>

BT suggests in his 3rd witness statement (paragraph 57) that this letter is wrongly dated.  It is true that a copy of the letter was apparently faxed on 6th November 2001 but I do not have the complete facts.  I have no evidence to show that any letter was actually faxed on that date.  Where the letter was apparently faxed does not appear from the fax transmission header.  And it does not accord with BT’s letter of 20th February 2002.  He refers to the letter as being 20th October 2000 and the retainer <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“[which] was renewed by you with a further copy of the said letter having been sent to you in November 2001 and you have resigned and returned the same to me under cover of your letter of 30 November”.  </span>That accords with the contents of that letter of 30th November 2001.  It is plain to me that the letter of 20th October 2000 was actually created on that date.  BT in my view is seeking to hide the period of his involvement with XFC.  I conclude that the letter was actually sent on that date and not a year later as BT now asserts in his witness statement.  It is also interesting that according to AS when he approached BT in 1995 he did it on the instructions of XFC.  That would show XFC having a knowledge of BT much earlier than the latter admits.  </p>

Although he says he is providing for the first time services there is no service provided beyond receiving money and then in a matter of days transferring it on elsewhere.  On 22nd February 1996 BT’s secretary sent a fax to Habib Bank enclosing an authority signed by BT to remit $150,000 to an account of a Mr O. M. Samantar with National Westminster Bank PLC Oxted Surrey (BT was in Zambia at that time).  He had no idea who Mr Samantar was.  There is evidence as set out in the FBI interview of Jim Wills of Systems that Samantar was Wills’ partner.  He was allegedly well connected politically in Somalia and knew XFC.  Wills said that Samantar introduced him to XFC and he was a door opener and Wills thought he knew FJT also.</p>

I do not believe an honest solicitor would on the oral say so of FK receive money from a US Stock Broker and pay it on to somebody else whose identity he did not know within a matter of days without taking steps to find out what was going on.  In my view BT failed to ask any questions because he did not want to know what the answers were.  This is classic blind eye dishonesty.  BT is therefore in my view dishonest in respect of the very first receipt.  All he understands is that there is some kind of commission payment but he does not know who precisely is entitled to it and on what basis.  It is a very large commission payment.  He then transmits the money on to an account in Oxted in favour of somebody whose identity he does not know.  He has no written instructions for any of these activities and he does not ask why this is happening and why it is necessary for these matters to be run through his client account as opposed to (for example) Paine Webber if it is a genuine transaction.  He simply remitted the funds direct in to Samantar’s dollar account.  The reality in my view is that the CM client account is interposed and the money washed through it to give an air of authenticity and to obscure where the money is coming from and where it is going.  That is compounded by CM’s ledgers which have no narrative about the transactions at all.  This is a classic money laundering operation in my view.  </p>

In cross examination BT could not explain why it was necessary for Redcliffe to transfer money to his client account and transfer it on to AS when he knew that Redcliffe was AS’s company.

There is no reason for his client account to be used for any genuine currency transactions.  This is as I have said a sum of money which has been traced back to MOF.  It is a classic example of washing money through CM’s client account to hide its origins and to clothe it with an aura of respectability.  BT is involved because he does not ask what any solicitor would ask.   Although BT denied that he knew that Africa Direct was owned beneficially by FK his undated attendance note before the receipt of the $186,000 records FK telling him that Africa Direct was FK’s bureau.  The more likely explanation rather than foreign currency is that the Zamtrop money was routed into Africa Direct via CM as I said to give it an aura of authenticity.  </p>

He was instructed to identify the sender as <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“John Howard (Overseas) Ltd”.</span>  BT acted on those instructions and revised instructions culminating in a transfer of $40,000 on 29th May 1996 and debited it to FK’s ledger.   BT apparently made no enquiry as to the reason for this transaction.  AGZ says it is significant because John Howard (Overseas) Ltd was at all material times the sole director of Zamdaell International Ltd an Isle of Man company which in turn held shares for a Zambian company Zamdaell Ltd.  I do not see how an honest solicitor would implement these instructions without making further enquiries.  FK and AC in their interviews with the TF said that Zamdaell Ltd was a company used as a vehicle for their secret arrangement with XFC but there is nothing to suggest BT was aware of this although equally there is no evidence to show that he asked.  There are no documents on his files showing anything about this transaction.  This again is another instance in my view of BT not doing what an honest solicitor would do namely ask why he is being requested to transfer money to Mr Daell’s bank account in Credit Suisse Zurich with a remitter who he doesn’t know.  </p>

He asserts that he believed they were AFSL’s monies which were properly transferred to his client account.  He supplements this in paragraph 75 where he sets out instructions to form various BVI companies including Hearnville Estates Ltd (“Hearnville”).  He states that he understood the companies were to be beneficially owned by AFSL having been told this by FK or AC except Hearnville was to be beneficially owned by FK.  FK he says instructed him to set up Hearnville to purchase a block of flats in Lusaka from Lonrho Properties Zambia Ltd (“Lonrho”) a subsidiary of Lonrho Africa Property &amp; Construction.  The file is missing.  He refers to Hearnville (mis-calling it Hearnfield) in correspondence with Caversham who then operated under the name Harris Crichton Bell as company formation agents.  He reiterated this when he wrote to Habib Bank on 15th October 1998 having been informed of the possession of the $799,995.  In that letter he confirmed <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“that the funds received are on behalf of established clients for the purposes of investment in Zambia”.  </span>Yet his evidence before me was that he did not make enquiries as to the source of funds and did not know that the funds emanated from Zamtrop.  </p>

As I have set out above this <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">necessarily</span> means that he did not look at his bank statements or ledger entries either.  I simply do not believe him.  BT submits in his closing (paragraph 277) that <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“preferences in respect to bank statements can surely vary”</span>.  Whilst that observation might be true for one’s personal banking arrangements it simply cannot be right for a client account where the solicitor needs to know which client has been paying in money and enter his ledgers accordingly.

BT it is submitted would have found nothing significant from the description <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Zamtrop”.  </span>I do not agree with that submission either.  BT ought to have asked FK what this was all about and what was the Zamtrop account which was apparently remitting these large sums of money into BT’s client account.  If FK had told him the true position then BT would have refused to act.  At the very least it would have questioned BT’s apparently poodle like acceptance of everything FK said or implied to him.  FK would have had to explain how it was that AFSL had acquired $800,000 of Government money.  He would also have to explain how that money could therefore be used by FK to buy properties in the name of a company incorporated by BT.  In this context he would also have to explain why he is using BT in London to act on the acquisition of properties in Zambia when he could easily have used Zambian lawyers.  Either BT knew that this was stolen money or he deliberately failed to ask questions because he thought that he would not like the answers.  This too is evidence of dishonesty in my view.  </p>

In addition to its shipping activities it also had a Land Rover franchise in Liverpool but BT apparently did not know that at the time.  He said he had no involvement in the contractual documents relating to the purchase of the vehicles but understood that AFSL was purchasing vehicles with the view to selling them on to the Zambian Government.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">On 18th December 1998 CM wrote to FK and AC referring to the two contracts of sale apparently dated 20th October 1998 (which have not been produced).  They are reminded that the balances have to be due 90 days after the date of the contracts namely 20th January 1999.  CMZ ask for the balance of the monies namely $700,000 and $200,000 respectively.  Thus at that stage $400,000 of the purchase price for the Hearnville properties had been provided and $100,000 of the Zamdaell property purchase had already been provided.  CMZ sent a reminder on 7th January 1999.  They received a reminder on 26th January 1999 from the sellers’ lawyers.  On 28th January 1999 CM then asked Habib Bank to transfer $500,000 to Lonrho’s account in Lusaka with Standard Chartered Bank.  They were told by Habib Bank that there was only $456,000 in the account and the client account could not go overdrawn.  On 1st February 1999 $399,995 was received from MCD.  That boosted the balance to $552,348.87.  On the same day $500,000 was sent out to Lonrho.  Therefore as at 1st February 1999 Lonrho had apparently received $500,000 for the Land Rovers and $500,000 for the property purchase.  The AFSL ledger which shows these transactions at this stage is obscure to put it mildly.  There are alterations which suggest a credit balance at the end of these transactions of $226,780.95.  I am unable to see how that figure has been arrived at.  On 8th March 1999 a further sum of $299,995 was received from MCD and on 10th March 1999 a further sum of $400,000 was paid out to Lonrho.  The total payments to Lonrho therefore are $1,400,000.  However according to the contractual documentation and assuming the Land Rovers were purchased the actual amount that ought to have been paid out to Lonrho should have been $1,900,000.  </p>

There is no evidence of a documentary nature to support such a statement.  There is evidence to the contrary.  On 25th February 1999 Mopani Chambers wrote to CMZ agreeing an extension to the date for completion and stating that the balance of the purchase price was $400,000.  That would reflect the balance of the two properties’ purchase price assuming the Land Rover payment and the January remittance of $500,000 had already been paid.  There is no reference in the letter to an agreed reduction of the purchase price by $500,000.  In particular it is the vendor who is giving notice to complete as opposed to the purchaser who according to BT had a claim for a reduction in the purchase price.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">BT’s evidence was that he did not know that the two payments came from MCD.  Once again this is dependent on my accepting that he neither read his client account bank statements nor his ledgers.  It is said on his behalf that this is likely because he was in Zambia at the time.  In my view the opposite is the case.  If he is not present in his office he is bound to check his ledgers and bank statements to review transactions that take place in his absence.  It is insufficient in my judgment to say that he does not need to question the matter because the money comes from a firm of solicitors.  Once again the question that ought to be asked is “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">why are funds coming from a different firm of solicitors in London to provide funding for him to complete a transaction in</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">respect of properties in Zambia ?”</span>.  These are the kinds of matters which (for example) in my view the Blue Card warning is designed to address.  Apart from the Blue Card warning the circularity of the transactions ought to raise questions in the mind of a solicitor.  A failure to question that might be negligent or reckless but it might be dishonest.  In my view in the present case BT was dishonest.  I do not believe him when he says he did not look at his documents.  He says that because that is the only way he can maintain his stance that as far as he was concerned he was acting for AFSL and the monies were AFSL monies.  A perusal of the sources of the monies would raise a question as to the nature of the transaction and its funding.  He might have been fobbed off with lies by FK but he did not ask.  In my view he did not ask because he did not want to know the answer.  This is blind eye dishonesty in my view.  Between 13th October 1998 and 10th March 1999 a total of just under $1,500,000 was received.  BT disbursed it without any enquiry as to the basis for FK claiming to be entitled to remit these monies and then direct them to be disbursed in respect of the Hearnville properties and the purchase of $500,000 of Land Rovers.<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>To this of course must be added the unquestioning receipts previously referred to.  There are in my view too many large receipts which are not apparently investigated for BT’s evidence to have any credibility.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus AGZ contends BT asserts he does not make the payment as opposed to AFSL bankers.  The Amended Defence was served after disclosure in January 2006 but no documents had been disclosed from Caversham relating to the transfer.  AGZ submits those documents ought to have been disclosed.  Following an application to the court by AGZ on 29th June 2006 BT produced a limited amount of documents in a schedule to his solicitor’s letter dated 21st July 2006.  In that schedule it was stated that he believed that the $500,000 transferred to Caversham in June 2000 was received by BBT on behalf of AFSL and that the account was operated pursuant to instructions by BBT.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“That account was operated pursuant to the instructions of BBT and the said transfer was made pursuant to such instructions.  BT does not know the name or the number or any details of the account from which the said sum was transferred, and did not know it was transferred to the Zamtrop account (if that be the case)”.  </span>AGZ asked BT in August 2006 (before witness statements were served) whether he accepted the transfer of $450,000 was made from the Barclays Bank account in Jersey.  His response was <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“No.  The Claimant is required to prove this fact”.  </span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">  </span>He was asked to explain the basis on which BT asserted the transfer was made on BBT’s instructions and which individual actually gave instructions.

He referred to the reference <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“O/O Cave Malik”</span> again and stated that he believed from what BBT told him the transfer was made from an account held by Caversham with Barclays Bank in Jersey held on behalf of BBT.  In paragraph 148 he stated he did not know that the $500,000 had been received from MCD.  He stated that he believed he was told the monies had been sent to BBT by AFSL through MCD instructed by FK in around December 2000. He conceded with the benefit of hindsight it might well have been prudent to ask why AFSL’s money was paid through MCD to BT’s account but he did not perceive that to be a problem.  I have observed above that Barclays did think it was a problem.  I cannot see why BT if he was acting honestly would not have thought these transactions were a problem unless fully explained to him.  </p>

BT stated that he did not recall speaking to Mr Whale and was not aware of any client.  I do not believe him.  Second he acknowledged that there was no underlying property transaction.  He must therefore have told a false story to Mr Whale.  Third I do not believe him when he says that he had forgotten the documents which showed he effected the transfer when he did his September 2006 witness statement.  His Defence that he was told the details by his father is plainly a lie also.  His father has been unable to give any instructions since mid 2001.  He cannot have given BT any recent instructions in relation to this matter.  In his witness statement of course he <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“recalled” </span>a non existent conversation with BBT.  Despite that recall he failed to recall his role in the transaction.  In my view he falsely invented a conversation with his father.  When the documents from Caversham arrived after the witness statement they were merely handed over at the start of the trial.  However as the trial progressed it became obvious that BT had to say something hence his January witness statement.  </p>

There is a restriction notice over the property subject to challenge in Zambia but AGZ will have to restore the company before it can proceed.

BT filled in the form.  He described himself as being an authorised signatory.  In respect of the individuals connected to the company prefaced <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“names of shareholders, beneficial owners, directors,….” </span>he only gave his own name and described himself as a shareholder.  In my view he dishonestly concealed who was the beneficial owner.  If paragraph 172 of his witness statement is to be believed he never knew who the beneficial owner was.  I disbelieve him in that regard.  The true position was as in his later evidence.  FK was expected to be the beneficial owner and this property was acquired using Office of the President monies to provide accommodation for FJT.

That is BT’s best position on the evidence.  I do not believe him.  It is plain that he knew the monies were Government monies and they were being used, amongst other things to acquire this property.  He misled Barclays.  He was evasive with Habib Bank as to the source of the monies.  In my judgment the monies were used dishonestly to acquire this property.  In my view and I so find BT knew the purpose and he knew that the source of the acquisitions were substantially Government monies.  He knew therefore that there was no legitimate purpose for the property being acquired in this way.  His initial stance was that the monies were AFSL monies but on discovering that they were Government monies he was unable to explain the basis on which AFSL claim to be entitled to these monies.</p>

It was filed in the High Court of Zambia on 2nd May 2003 and was purportedly on behalf of River Properties Mr Yao deposing he was the authorised agent and authorised to swear the affidavit.  The affidavit repeated the deception of failing to reveal the $150,000 cash injection used to acquire the property.  It made no reference to the $249,000 purchase of chattels also funded from Government funds.</p>

In my view the obscure way in which this property was purchased using stolen Government money was designed to hide the fact that FJT was occupying property which had been purchased using stolen Government monies.  BT knew all this at the latest by 12th November 2001 when FK told him that the monies were from OOP.  BT failed to react to that.  Such failure in my view was dishonest.  He does not want to enquire further.  Then after the Matrix of Plunder explosion he takes extraordinary steps namely the participation in an affidavit sworn and filed on behalf of the company by somebody who apparently did not have any authority and then cleared out the Barclays Bank account and finally to make things even more difficult arranged to have the company struck off and dissolved.  These are not the actions of an honest solicitor.  Further given his role namely acting in the acquisition with the knowledge that Government monies were being used or failing to enquire (with wilful blindness) that Government monies were being used and then concealing the transactions at a later stage he was a party to a conspiracy to defraud the Republic of the monies taken from OOP.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context it is important to appreciate that during the period of these extraordinary activities by BT he well knew that AFSL and FK were under investigation and that the Republic had attempted to seize this property.  An honest solicitor would have communicated with the Republic to tell them as much as he knew about the transactions.  BT did exactly the opposite; he attempted by the affidavits and the steps taken to dissolve the company to make the investigatory path that much more difficult to follow. I reject his assertion that he did this because he could not obtain instructions. He could have contacted the Government but he did not. This is further evidence of dishonesty on the part of BT in my view.  </p>

He met FJT with his daughters and after a few pleasantries he said it was his last trip to London and he was getting things organised for his retirement and he needed £30,000 in cash and asked BT to arrange for the payment to him from the funds held by AFSL.  BT telephoned FK on his car phone afterwards who authorised him to make the payment.  This might be the telephone conversation that is noted.

He persisted in his assertion that it was AFSL money but he did not so describe it when he wrote to Habib Bank on 13th November 2001.  I do not believe his evidence again.  In my view he knew the monies were Government monies.  That is to be seen from his ledgers and his bank statements.  It is also to be seen from what FK apparently told him around 12th November 2001.  Yet he made no enquiry as to how the President could simply take such a large amount of money.  An honest solicitor would not participate in such a transaction without a full understanding of its nature so that he could be satisfied it was lawful.  BT did not so satisfy himself because he was unwilling to ask the question because he was afraid of the answer.  That in my view is dishonesty.  He has also allowed his client account to be used to facilitate the wrongful stealing of Government monies.  He has therefore because he knows that it is Government monies and he fails to ask questions as to the legitimacy of the transaction become a party to that conspiracy. He has also dishonestly assisted in FJT’s breach of fiduciary duty.  The only explanation he could give for making payments for the benefit of FJT was that it was part of FJT’s retirement fund.  He asserted that he was ignorant of salary levels in Zambia (which I do not believe).  This is an incredible statement and I simply do not believe it.  It is impossible to believe that a lawful authorised pension fund for the President would be set up and administered in this circular and obscure way using CM as the conduit.  This is a lie by BT to deal with the payments not only for FJT but also for his children.  </p>

These too (because they were not questioned) are not the acts of an honest solicitor.  BT was dishonest again.  It is insufficient as BT says in his closing to conceive that it was spectacularly stupid.  Whatever his belief as to the honesty of FJT an honest solicitor would in my view not have released any further monies without having the matter cleared with the authorities.  I also am firmly of the view that an honest solicitor would have gone to the authorities at this time.  BT did neither.

In my view the amount should be the totality of the traced monies transferred to CM’s client account from the Zamtrop account ($2,127,822), a further sum in accordance with paragraph 274 above,  and the OOP payments ($599,990).  In addition the amount transferred from Redcliffe (£155,000) is claimable.  I do not limit it to the traced items for the reasons I have given earlier in this judgment.  In my view all monies coming from the Zamtrop account (save those disallowed in paragraph 274 above) are to be regarded as Government monies because I do not accept there is any legitimate basis for the view that any of the monies <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">might not be Government monies.</span></p>

For all of those reasons I am of the opinion that BT’s activities were carried out in the ordinary course of business and/or with the approval of BBT so that the firm CM and thus BBT are liable for BT’s acts under Section 10 PA 1890.</p>

He also asserted that XFC agreed her appointment although he knew nothing about her.  This is in stark contrast to the retainer of CM.  There XFC (according to AS) told him to use BT.  BT was unable to explain why XFC would use him.  AS could not explain it either, despite the higher status of BT (as opposed to Ms Edwards).

It is true that he trained as an accountant and it is also true that he had quite extensive financial experience (see the summary of his CV above).  By virtue of his training he is self evidently in my view aware of the need for transactions to be documented if only for fiscal and corporate purposes.  </p>

The following factors lead me to that conclusion.  First it is not alleged that AS had any knowledge of or any role in the organised payments from MOF to Zamtrop or from MOF to Systems or Wilbain or from Systems to Zamtrop.  Second AGZ accepts that AS had no knowledge of and did not participate in making payments from the Zamtrop account to MCD.  AS’s evidence is that he met IM once.  The latter could not recall meeting him at all.  Third there is no evidence to show that AS knew that the monies that were provided by MCD for the purpose of DGH Poly Products were stolen monies.  Fourth it is not alleged that AS participated in payments made directly to CM from the Zamtrop account rather that he knew Government monies were paid to CM.  AS acknowledges that he was aware of four payments to CM totalling £155,000 all from Redcliffe (which of course he controlled).  Fifth there is no evidence other than advancing money to enable payments made for spectacles of any arrangements that involved FJT and finally there is no evidence to show that AS played an active role in AFSL/ALL.</p>

Mr Bourne established in cross examination that AS received a total of $53,000 more than he spent.  He also established that if he had not received the amount he received from Zamtrop he would not have been able to spend an equivalent amount.  Miss Pincott accepted this.  The figures (which are not disputed) show that AS received $6,042,254 and disbursed directly or indirectly one way or another $5,989,023.   Mr Bourne submits that that analysis does not prove that he had insufficient funds from his own resources to fund his living expenses.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with that observation however is the plain fact that the figures show he received $53,000 more than he spent.  He has on his case no beneficial entitlement to any of these monies because they were supposed to be expended on ZSIS expenditure on the direction of XFC.  In the context of this case I accept $53,000 is modest but not for a Zambian.  During the course of his cross examination AS asserted he used other funds belonging to him to discharge liabilities on behalf of XFC and in effect personal receipts by him were reimbursement and/or set offs in respect of those sums.   However he has failed to produce any evidence of the existence of such funds let alone the disbursements on behalf of XFC.  To that extent the overpayment whilst modest is significant as it is another example of misappropriation which AS has failed to justify.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">AS sets out his case in paragraph 130 and following of his second witness statement dated 11th September 2006.  He claimed XFC had approached him outside a private house when he was going to a party and he was introduced to him by a Mr Nyangulu an Intelligence Officer at the Zambian High Commission in London.  AS said that he knew him to be the head of ZSIS and head of the OOP Special Division.  He thus knew he was an important man a high official and a close confidant of FJT.  Apparently XFC discussed with him investigations in to the activities of Dr Chiluba’s wife.  FJT as I have said was elected on an anti corruption ticket so that was a surprising request.  Nothing came of it as AS knew nothing about it and it remains an intriguing but irrelevant issue in this trial.  This took place apparently in 1993 or 1994 in London.  He said he next met XFC in London in 1995 when he came to his office and told him he wanted to set up a company to work for intelligence.  It is stated that he said something to the effect that ZSIS/OOP needed someone they could trust to do things for them in London and to disburse funds and account honestly and properly for such funds.  XFC asked AS to be a director of the company.  He could not rely upon the diplomats in the High Commission because they leaked information and he wanted to protect the interests of ZSIS.  AS offers the view that he had met the staff at the High Commission and was distinctly unimpressed by some of them.  </p>

What is even more surprising is that XFC agreed that she could be a front person.  Thus the entirety of the secrecy operation was revealed to a shop assistant from John Lewis.  It is difficult to believe that has any credibility at all.  I reject it. This was done to hide the involvement of XFC and AS.</p>

Beauty Kaluba gave him the money.  He took it in an attaché case to Heathrow.  The security scanner picked it up and the customs telephoned Mrs Kaluba who (unsurprisingly perhaps) confirmed that it was appropriate for him to carry on with the money.

He knows in my view that it is plainly Government money.  And he does not ask because he either does not want to know the answer or because he knows that XFC is in effect stealing the $250,000.

I refer to BT’s untruthful statement as to why Redcliffe used a client account with CM rather than operating an ordinary bank account.  There was no need for XFC to route monies to BT via Redcliffe unless there was dishonesty involved and the purpose was to hide the trail of the monies.  If AS was honest he would have questioned XFC as to why this was necessary.  Once again either he did not because he knew it was dishonest or he failed to ask the questions that an honest person with his background would do.  </p>

He confirmed that he knew of the requirements to file accounts at Companies House and that the failure to file the accounts might lead to the company being struck off.  He was aware of the notice yet no accounts were filed by Redcliffe from its incorporation to the receipt of the notice.  This in my view is further evidence of dishonesty.  It makes the tracing of matters through Redcliffe even more difficult.  Despite the urgency by August 1997 AS took no steps to file accounts on behalf of Redcliffe.  </p>

Further as his actions in this regard were further explored in cross examination it demonstrated that he was lying.  First on being questioned that giving the papers to Orla at ZAL would undermine the secrecy of Redcliffe he asserted that she was employed by MISSL but retracted that.  Second he said that Orla was only temporary and he was unsure as to the extent of her qualifications.  Third he was entirely unable to explain how the accounts would be prepared and audited by Orla in time to be filed by 7th August 1997.  Fourth he attempted to rely upon the receipt of VAT notices that he believed the company had not been struck off.  I do not accept that evidence in the light of his earlier answers.  He could not recall when he gave Orla the documents whether it was in 1997 or 1998.  He received no communication from Orla and lost communication with her until March 1999.  AS produced a letter purportedly coming from Orla dated 2nd March 1999.  I observe that if this letter is genuine it is more than 2 years after Redcliffe was struck off and dissolved.

AS has produced patchy records only.  His excuse is that the documents were all saved on his computer in Washington and that when he returned from Washington it was withheld.  He alleged that he asked the Task Force to search for his computer.  In fact the evidence shows that the computer was released to his wife in London.  This is confirmed by the letter dated 28th August 2002 from the Charges D’Affairs in Washington to the Permanent Secretary and the inventory.  That shows that the computer was released and transported to London to Mrs Shansonga.  The documentation shows that AS’s goods arrived in Lusaka in October 2002.  There is no reason to suppose that the London goods did not arrive about the same time.  It was AS’s evidence (for the first time) in cross examination that he found some items had been stolen from the consignment of goods which arrived in Lusaka.  Surprisingly he did not immediately contact his wife to check that all the goods (including the computer) had arrived.  Once again it is significant because the computer was transported after the Matrix of Plunder article where he was named.  To prove his innocence he would need his computer.  </p>

He asserted in evidence (T40/136) having been shown Mr Hamunjele’s notes that he did not become aware his computer was missing until after the present proceedings had been commenced.  He then said that that was the first time that he complained about it but said that he first missed the computer when he was looking for documents in 2004.

He has not (for example) satisfied me with any credibility as to his paucity of documents.  This obscures the case but it is an obscurity designed to hide the true position in my view.  The major issue is AS’s honesty or dishonesty.  The actual flow of monies is not seriously disputed.

It is true that AS had a significant period when he was a litigant in person.  However the reason for that was because he chose initially to obtain public funding rather than spend his own money.  It had always been open to him to seek to realise his shares right from the word go.  That would have released more than sufficient funds for him to conduct his case.  In any event he had the benefit of legal advice up until the door of the court which extended to the preparation of his witness statements.

There is no evidence to show that AGZ, TF or any other Government official had possession of the computer.  To do so would require a false statement on the inventory on 28th August 2002.  This is extremely unlikely because it would be easily exposed when the goods were received.  One would have expected the goods to be examined by no later than October 2002.

That involves looking at his witness statement as his primary case.  It must not be forgotten that the witness statement replaces a witness’ evidence in chief.  It is not an “autobiography” (AS closing paragraph 17 (3)).  However it is supposed to represent a person’s evidence on the relevant issues in the case.  If the witness departs from that or the statement omits to deal with significant facts it is perfectly legitimate to cross examine a witness on those.  Indeed in reality it is essential because the confrontation of those inconsistencies is an essential tool for the Judge to evaluate the credibility of that witness.  I accept that a person might lie; the real point of finding as to lies is to ascertain why a person lied.  Equally I accept that it is quite possible (and probably more normal than not) for a recollection to be incomplete or faulty.

A good example is the cash payment of $250,000.  AS in his closing (paragraph 20-26) submits <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“that it simply cannot be said that a reasonable English person would regard a request by the Head of the Security Services to take $250,000 as a courier to Switzerland as posing a commercially unacceptable risk, or be said to be turning a blind eye to dishonest conduct.  Such a request is neither outlandish nor surprising.  It is not, prima facie, unlawful.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">I have on a number of occasions in this judgment cross checked the expenditure or the monies in question by reference to the standard of living in Zambia.  I reject AS’s submission that this is an illegitimate exercise.  It is not to be applied mechanistically for obvious reasons.  When a Zambian public servant is deployed on duties abroad it is inevitable that he will incur expenditure which will in all probability far exceed his salary.  For example a public servant deployed abroad needs accommodation and subsistence allowances.  FJT for example earning approximately $10,000 a year could not conceivably when discharging his functions cover the expense of staying in accommodation in London or any other of the capitals of the world.  All such expenditure is going to be reimbursable.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Equally when a Government official is deployed abroad he would take his family.  If the children cannot be accommodated in a relevant state school then the Government would naturally make provision for the expenditure that ought to be incurred if necessary for example in a private school.  AS knows this because he had a dispute over private fees he incurred for his own children in Washington.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">What is difficult to explain (and also fatally flaws AS’s case) is why this kind of expenditure (and a large amount of the disbursements cover this) cannot be done in the usual way.  By that I mean the relevant official claims his expenditure or is awarded allowances and that is provided for in his salary and the budget of the relevant department.  Once again AS knows this because that operated for him when he was the Ambassador in the US.</p>

As will be seen from an analysis of the payments there can be no secrecy in paying for XFC’s children to be privately educated or live in London, nor buying jewellery, nor paying for a beauty treatment course in London for a lady who worked in the Permodzi Hotel in Lusaka (Rita Parkinson).  The payment to her to attend on a beauty therapist course in London exceeded FJT’s salary for a year.</p>

In his witness statement he said he never made any payments to her except those XFC told him to make.  Even then he did not identify the payments expressly.  He had apparently forgotten that he knew SC well from having been at university with her and meeting her socially in Zambia.  This only emerged in cross examination.

AS in his evidence (T41/46) accepted that he did not believe SC was entitled to $40,000 but paid it because he was told to do so.

For example he could have shown the provenance of the BMW currently being driven by Mr Regis Phiri.  He chose not to do so.  Second he could have explored the question as to whether or not within Government offices existed some 10 or so Mercedes.  In this context AS somewhat surprisingly (given his loss of other documents) produced a copy of The Post dated 15th September 1995.  That refers to the importing of 4 second hand Mercedes Benz under the name of OOP and it is said that they were parked secretly in Zambia under an armed guard.  FJT’s Presidential aid Richard Sakala is recorded as giving a statement <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“it is highly unlikely such a purchase could have been made on behalf of State House as State House does not have that kind of money”.  </span>The 4 Mercedes cars were associated with Redcliffe because it was expressly referred to and it was said that the coordination was done under the hand of its director Ms V Edwards.  I suspect that was not the case and that she has merely signed the relevant transportation documentation. Alternatively it is possible her name was discovered from documents lodged at Companies house. AS’s connection would not of course be revealed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">I am gravely suspicious about all of this.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the Mercedes cars were simply doled out to people at the behest of XFC/FJT.  Equally the purchase of the prestigious motor vehicle on behalf of XFC can be explained on that basis.  However I bear in mind the following.  These are serious allegations and require them to be clearly and distinctly proven by evidence.  Second suspicions are not evidence and AS is not to be condemned because of suspicions.  Hindsight is particularly to be avoided in a case like this.  Third the legal burden remains on AGZ.  It is for him to prove on the balance of probabilities that the purchase of these motor vehicles was part of a dishonest conspiracy or breach of fiduciary duty on the part of XFC to misappropriate Government monies.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">On balance I conclude that AGZ has not satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that these purchases were a breach of fiduciary duty or conspiracy to defraud the Republic.  They were hidden but in my view they were hidden so that the extravagance of Government officials would not go in the public domain i.e. in the official budgets.  That is not actionable in this case although it is a fraud perpetrated on the people of Zambia.

It should be born in mind that it is very odd that AS kept the press cutting and very little else a point that he was not able to deal with satisfactorily.  In addition it should also be observed that he carried out further imports after this revelation.  That was despite the fact that Mr Sakala in public said that this was not a Government purchase.  In my view he carried on despite the press but he knew that the purchase was effected through Redcliffe to hide the involvement of Government monies in these luxurious purchases.</p>

It is not credible that anyone familiar with Zambia as AS was would believe that Zambian civil servants working in Zambia would be entitled to have English private school fees.  Once again in the Zambian context £45,000 per annum (about $72,000) is 10 times the annual salary of a senior civil servant.  AS knows all about this because of his own personal situation.  In paragraph 39 of his witness statement he stated <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“similarly when I was appointed Zambian Ambassador in the United States my own terms of employment provided for an allowance for the education of my children.”  </span>AS failed to disclose that he received only $675 per month and the request that Government funds pay for the entire cost of his children’s private schools was refused.  The Foreign Service rules provide for limited reimbursement for fees.  AS cannot honestly have believed that XFC who was not based abroad would be entitled to this huge amount of money via a ZSIS account.  It shows that AS knows that the money was not being used for a legitimate ZSIS purpose.  Yet this is the whole justification for Redcliffe.  It therefore shows that AS knew that XFC was not entitled to spend the money this way and despite that knowledge he assisted in its expenditure.  Moreover by channelling it through Redcliffe he assisted in its concealment.  Thus AS does not behave in the way in which an honest person would.  This again is very strong evidence of AS’s dishonest assistance or participation in a conspiracy to defraud the Republic by XFC and FJT</p>

His belief that the former Chief Justice had his children educated in this way does not help him because the Chief Justice in question  obtained the money dishonestly.  I do not believe he had any grounds at all.  He was after all the Ambassador to the United States which is quite a senior post in the Government.

The expensive restaurants extend to Langans, Bluebird, La Porte Des Inns and Tante Claire.   Five star hotels are occupied around the world.  Finally it is difficult to understand what ZSIS purpose might have been served by spending £770.74 on Berketex Brides.  I simply do not accept that any of these were legitimate purchases on behalf of ZSIS.  I do not accept that any honest person would unquestioningly accept such expenditure.  When asked about expenditure such as Legoland [T42/62] AS said that it is very difficult to understand the nature of the work of the intelligence and it is difficult for many people to understand.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">Equally I reject the suggestion that this enormous expenditure was for gifts to smooth the way in some secret service activity.  The reality is that it funded a lifestyle for XFC which only somebody who had access to great wealth could maintain.  XFC had no such access to funds and Redcliffe/AS/Nebraska were simply the conduit whereby monies were stolen by him dishonestly and misapplied by him dishonestly.  AS knew this and participated in it.  An honest man would simply not without question accept all of these matters.  He either did not ask because he knew the reason or he did not ask because he did not want to know the reason.  On either count he is dishonest.  Equally I do not accept that AS (save in respect of the motor vehicles) has established that any of the payments set out in Table 1 to the Closing Submissions was on the balance of probabilities expenditure for a legitimate government purpose.  That is not to say the payments were not made; it is a rejection of AS’s contention that the payments were for a legitimate purpose.  As I have said before I can conceive of no legitimate reason for organising even ZSIS payments through the untrained AS and Redcliffe.  I accept AGZ’s submission to that effect.  Equally I accordingly give no credit for £56,543.31 remitted to Permase General by Redcliffe on 2nd October 1997 for the same reason.</p>

Equally whilst it is now clear both to me  and AGZ where the AFSL funding came from it does not follow that the same can be said of AS at the time of the transaction.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">My conclusion is that AS provided dishonest assistance to XFC to steal Government money in breach of his fiduciary duties.  The vehicle was Redcliffe and AS.  He is therefore liable on this basis for both the personal receipts and the Redcliffe receipts. The amounts are set out in paragraph 893 and are (1) the GT traced receipts of $1,347,993, (2) the amount traced into the AS account ($725,754), (3) the traced cash ($53,496.60) and the traced Redcliffe receipts ($811,457.98. In addition there should be a further sum under paragraph 274.  He has also been a party to a conspiracy to steal those monies through that medium.  That is not pleaded as I have already said.  I leave it to AGZ to consider what if anything he wants to do about that.  In the light of my findings set out above AS’s counterclaim is dismissed.</p>

In that context I assume that figure does not include the motorcycle purchases.  If it does then I do not accept those are properly deductible.  As I have said above the disallowance as regards to the cars is on the basis that they were acquired in a way to deceive the Zambian people but not as part of the conspiracy to defraud or breach of fiduciary duty.  </p>

Mr Soriano has taken no part in the proceedings since November 2005 although he could have represented himself if he wished.  He was represented at recent hearings in the Belgian Court concerning disclosure of bank statements by KBC Bank.  He has not offered any explanation in respect of the claims against him nor has he explained why he has not participated in the proceedings.  BT and CM sought to strike out this claim.

There are no documents evidencing it see paragraph 104 of Mr Mtonga’s witness statement. I am satisfied there was such a purported variation but its purpose was simply to increase the amount of money being wrongly misappropriated.  The Republic was to pay $25,000,000 by March 2001 (Mr Soriano’s letter of 16th March 2001 to Mr Mtonga).  This was clearly the platform for extracting upto $20,000,000.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">It was suggested to Mr Mtonga by Mr Soriano that the purchase of the arms related to a need to defend Zambia from threats from Angola and the Congo.  Mr Mtonga said he felt compelled to sign the documents even though the Facility Agreement was not beneficial to the Government and the manner in which the agreement had been brought to him was not in accordance with proper procedures.  This is of course a familiar story.  There were suggestions put to Brigadier General Muchopa in cross examination that in fact the weapons were purchased and that they were secretly operating on Zambia’s North West border to deal with incursions from the Congo or Angola.  I have already commented on Brigadier Muchopa’s evidence.  It was unsatisfactory in the manner in which it was delivered.  Nevertheless I am satisfied that there is no evidence which shows any such weapons were delivered.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">I base that primarily on two factors.  First the monies were paid into the ABN-AMRO and KBC accounts and were dissipated away.  There is no evidence to show that any monies found their way to Teraton.  Second if this was a genuine transaction and Mr Soriano had effected payment as the documents suggest  he undoubtedly would have come to Court to say so.  The fact that he chose not to appear in Court is in my view a factor which shows that no transaction was ever concluded.  Third Teraton denied the contract was ever fulfilled.  In this context there is no evidence showing any of the preconditions referred to in clause 16 were satisfied.  </p>

I refer to the evidence of Ms Valtcheva (of DLA Sofia) and the attempts she made to obtain a witness statement from the President Director of Teraton Mr Peter Petrov.  He has declined to give a formal statement but wrote on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2006 to confirm that the contract was never finalised that Teraton never shipped any goods to Zambia and it has never received any payment from Zambia.  The Bulgarian Ministry of Economy and Energy (Ms Vachevanova) confirmed that. Brigadier Muchopa confirmed that no defence equipment was ever received (I am sceptical about his preliminary investigation in August 2002 in conjunction with PWC and in November 2006 but it is difficult to see how equipment of this size could be delivered and not be readily discoverable).</p>

The documents themselves plainly are so unusual as to their terms that no-one would consider them to represent genuine commercial arrangements. I summarise the effect.  Mr Soriano was appointed consultant for Zambia which gave him unusually wide powers.  Using those powers he negotiated a sale contract and committed Zambia to a significant expenditure.  He obtained the Facility Agreement which had an upfront payment of $10,000,000 before he advanced any monies to Zambia.  It was plainly a fraudulent instrument to provide an umbrella for the removal of the monies from Zambia.  Finally he procured the payment of $20,200,917 over the next three years from MOF monies which were paid into the two accounts that he controlled and were dissipated by him.  The clear abuse of this is shown by the payments summarised in paragraph 1598 of AGZ’s closing.  He put up no Defence but the nearest to a Defence are the explanations that he gave to Price Waterhouse Cooper in an interview on 16th August 2002.  These are entirely bogus.  In particular there is no evidence to show he paid Teraton $15,000,000 of his own money along with the $20,000,000 paid by the Republic.  Once again if he had he would clearly have come to Court to explain that and produce the evidence.</p>

Given that rejection the inevitable conclusion again in my view is that AGZ’s claim is made out in respect of his failure to question the monies that were remitted to him and their disbursement.  This extends of course to the acquisition of Game Trackers when the source of the monies was not investigated by him. His actions or inactions are just as dishonest as in the Zamtrop conspiracy with the same conclusion as against him. </p>
