The major part of the conservation area consists of two triangular open spaces known as Grosvenor Gardens, lined with grandly-scaled mid-Victorian terraces, and GGH defines the north-east side of the lower, southern, triangle.   </p>

When an opportunity arose to buy the freehold, Mr Mark Holyoake (the First Claimant in this action), who had some experience of developing property in the area, was attracted to the idea of buying it with a view to converting it back into high-class residential use, and on 18 July 2011 caused Hotblack Holdings Ltd (the Second Claimant, <span style="font-weight:bold">“Hotblack”</span>), a Jersey company ultimately owned by him, to contract to buy the freehold for £42m. </p>

Mr Nicholas Candy passed Mr Holyoake’s request to his brother, and a loan was duly negotiated over the course of the day and completed on 13 October.  It took the form of a loan from CPC Group Ltd (the Sixth Defendant, <span style="font-weight:bold">“CPC”</span>) to Mr Holyoake personally, initially unsecured but to be secured if not repaid within 5 months, with interest of 20% per annum, compounded quarterly, and carrying an entitlement to 30% of net profits with a minimum of £10m.  CPC is a Guernsey company wholly owned, at least ostensibly, by Mr Christian Candy.  The loan enabled Hotblack to complete the purchase of GGH on 13 October. </p>

He was disconcerted therefore to find that instead of devoting their energies to supporting the project, the Candy brothers seemed more intent on securing CPC’s position in relation to its loan.  CPC queried the sufficiency and accuracy of a net asset statement Mr Holyoake had provided as part of the terms of the loan; threatened, in Mr Holyoake’s view unjustifiably, to disclose the loan to the senior lender into the project; and then on 29 November 2011 formally confirmed that in its opinion Mr Holyoake was in default under the loan for failing to provide an acceptable net asset statement.  CPC then attempted to get Mr Holyoake either to repay the loan or provide security for it, and a long series of supplemental agreements between Mr Holyoake and CPC, rescheduling the loan on terms, were negotiated and entered into, some against the background of actual or threatened proceedings. </p>

Mr Holyoake also claims that he is entitled to damages, and an injunction, for misuse of his personal misinformation; and has a further claim to reopen the terms of the loan agreements under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (<span style="font-weight:bold">“CCA”</span>).   This is only a brief summary of the claims but is enough to give a general idea; I give the detail below.

According to the Particulars of Claim, the companies’ liabilities at the time of going into administration were said to be then in excess of £250m, owed to a large number of bank lenders, against assets in the shape of non-related party trade debts and realisable stock of some £15.6m.  The Particulars of Claim alleged that Mr Holyoake, together with Mr David Wells, the companies’ Finance Director, had conspired to commit a large-scale fraud on the companies.  The essential allegation was that the two of them, who were said to have had complete managerial control over the companies, had caused the claimant companies to obtain, and then borrow large sums under, bank facilities for the purpose of funding specific purchases of fish products; that they had caused these sums to be remitted to suppliers in Hong Kong on the basis that the companies were purchasing such products; and that many such payments were not made in respect of any genuine legitimate business transaction, being paid to ostensible suppliers in Hong Kong that were not genuinely supplying such product and that were ultimately beneficially owned by Mr Holyoake.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The upshot of all this was at the time when he was trying to acquire GGH (that is in the middle of 2011), he had not entirely put the British Seafood episode behind him.  He still owed substantial sums (of the order of £10m in October 2011) to 3i under the Overarching Agreement, and had charged his properties to them, which meant that he had little collateral to offer lenders.  He also had reputational issues, which made raising finance more difficult.  For example  in July 2011 he tried to obtain a loan for the purchase of GGH from Investec, a bank of which he was a long-standing customer (an Investec company had a subsisting mortgage for about £9m on a property he owned at 42-44 Grosvenor Gardens).  Mr Daniel Austin of Investec, who was in general supportive of Mr Holyoake’s application, told him on 6 July that he had been asked by others at Investec not to lend him funds, and it was <span style="font-style:italic">“causing him issues internally”</span>; Mr Holyoake said in evidence, when asked if his role in the collapse of British Seafood was causing these issues, <span style="font-style:italic">“Yes, there were issues wherever I went in that respect.”</span>  In August 2011 Mr William Pym (a close associate of Mr Holyoake’s who I refer to in more detail below) approached Deutsche Bank on his behalf and received a response that compliance colleagues had carried out preliminary checks on Mr Holyoake and the bank would like to discuss their findings, which Mr Pym forwarded to Mr Holyoake with the comment <span style="font-style:italic">“You continue to be a naughty boy”</span>.  Indeed at the end of April 2011 a Google search of his name threw up 7 negative results in the first 10, and Mr Holyoake engaged a business called Digitalis Media to seek to improve this.   </p>

Nos 42 to 48 Grosvenor Gardens are four adjacent buildings forming part of the terrace on the west side of the lower triangle of Grosvenor Gardens and so are directly opposite GGH; the mews properties are behind them.  Mr Holyoake had acquired 46-48 in January 2007, and 42-44 in March 2007, and both had been redeveloped in 2009/10 for offices (including offices he used himself which overlooked Grosvenor Gardens and from which you could see GGH), the mews properties being redeveloped for residential use.  The Overarching Agreement also disclosed another property acquired for development, a freehold at 2 Westbourne Grove Mews W11, held through Hazelend LLP, which Mr Holyoake had acquired in 2007 as a car repair garage and which he had plans to redevelop for mixed commercial and residential use.  None of these projects however was on anything like the same scale as GGH, and Mr Holyoake confirmed in evidence that GGH was the biggest project that he had done.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is convenient at this stage to deal briefly with my assessment of Mr Holyoake as a witness.  I have already said that the evidence shows that he was willing to lie when his commercial interests justified it.  The evidence reveals some striking examples of this.  In April 2012 he and Mr Wells created a loan agreement between Mr Holyoake and Hotblack, and in July 2012 board minutes of Hotblack, both of which were backdated.  In plain language these were forgeries, designed to conceal from CPC the fact that Hotblack had also borrowed money from Oscarone.  In April 2013, he and Mr Lovering colluded to put forward to CPC a contract for a sale of GGH to Sherbourne Properties Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Sherbourne”</span>) as if it were a Qualifying Contract for the purposes of one of the agreements with CPC.  This was despite the fact that a Qualifying Contract required the purchaser to be an arm’s length third party, and as Mr Holyoake and Mr Lovering knew, Sherbourne was not, being wholly owned by </p>

In evidence Mr Holyoake sought to justify such acts on the basis that CPC had behaved so badly towards him, starting on 8 November 2011, that he considered himself absolved from any duty to be honest towards them.  That is in itself a novel and somewhat surprising proposition, but in any event it cannot explain a series of lies that he can be shown to have made before the loan from CPC was concluded, such as a lie to the vendor of GGH that he had finance available, and a lie to 3i that he had not acquired GGH.   </p>

As appears in more detail below Mr Holyoake completed the purchase using not only a senior loan of £24m (at that stage from Investec) and CPC’s loan of £12m but also a mezzanine loan from Oscarone of £7.5m.  Oscarone’s loan was made to Hotblack in October 2011 and there is no doubt that Hotblack needed to, and did, use it in order to complete the purchase.  The Candys knew nothing of this at the time and indeed Mr Holyoake never disclosed the Oscarone loan to them during the entirety of the time he was dealing with them.   </p>

That enabled them to plead that Mr Holyoake had deliberately omitted reference to the loan in net asset statements that he provided to CPC in October and November 2011 (paragraph 65.9 of the Defence), and that a confirmation given by Mr Holyoake to Mr Christian Candy on 18 March 2012 that he only used his equity and CPC’s loan to acquire GGH and no other third party equity was a knowing lie as he had used funds from Oscarone (paragraph 147).  In his Reply (served on 8 December 2015 and containing a statement of truth signed by Mr Holyoake personally) Mr Holyoake pleaded in response to paragraph 65.9 that the net asset statements only required Mr Holyoake to show assets of £120m at the time immediately prior to the making of CPC’s loan and:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Both these statements were flatly untrue, and the second one in particular, which contained a clear denial that the Oscarone facility was obtained in order to purchase GGH, is not something that can easily be explained away as a mere lapse of memory.  Mr Holyoake asserted in oral evidence that this was rather something that he simply did not pick up, but I do not accept this evidence; the allegation that was being responded to was that he had told a knowing lie and that obviously meant not only that instructions on this point could only realistically have come from him, but also that care would be taken to obtain those instructions accurately.  Quite apart from this, the Defendants’ solicitors (formerly called Wragge Lawrence Graham &amp; Co, later called Gowling WLG) continued to pursue the point: on 15 December 2015 they served a Request for Further Information which expressly asked for all matters relied on in support of the contention that the funds obtained from Oscarone were to help fund the next stage of the project and details of what funds were obtained, when, and how they were applied; the Request was answered on 27 January 2016 (again supported by a statement of truth signed by Mr Holyoake personally), the response to this question being that the Claimants’ case was perfectly clear and no clarification was necessary.  If the original pleading in the Reply had been an honest mistake which had crept in by oversight, it is very difficult to believe that an explanation to that effect would not have been given.  Then on 24 May 2016 Gowlings sent a letter to the Claimants’ solicitors, gunnercooke, referring to the completion statement for the purchase of GGH, which they had by then obtained and which showed that the Oscarone monies were used for the purchase, and inviting Mr Holyoake to explain the true position on affidavit.  That letter, and several chasing letters, were simply ignored.  If it had been an honest oversight, one would again have expected that to be said promptly. </p>

I found his evidence on this very unimpressive; a witness who is not a party to an action will normally have no financial interest in the outcome and if, unusually, he does, it is appropriate that he disclose it fully and fairly so that the Court can assess his evidence in the light of that fact.  To leave it to be inferred from some vague words (which to my mind do not justify the inference in any event) is not good enough. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Candy brothers have a very high profile in the media and are well known for being highly successful in the field of high-end property development.  Mr Nicholas Candy estimated that from 1995, when they bought their first property, to about 2005, when he left the UK to live in Monaco for tax reasons, they had probably done some 50 developments together, and he had made <span style="font-style:italic">“tens and tens and tens of millions of pounds”</span>.  They used a number of corporate vehicles for their developments and in 2001 also established together Candy &amp; Candy Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“C&amp;C”</span>); C&amp;C was an Englishregistered company that specialised in luxury interior design.  The ostensible position is that they subsequently split their interests, Mr Christian Candy resigning as director of C&amp;C in March 2011 and selling his shares to Mr Nicholas Candy, and concentrating on CPC, which operates principally in the field of property development, leaving Mr Nicholas Candy to own and run C&amp;C which deals with interior design, project management and marketing.  The position of both brothers is that Mr Christian Candy is the sole beneficial owner of CPC (a company which he personally had established in Guernsey in 2003, the company name representing his initials), and that Mr Nicholas Candy has no interest in it.  That this was the true position was supported by each of the witnesses who were or had been directors of CPC (Messrs Williams, Smith, Dean and David) when they gave evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Claimants however have alleged that this ostensible position is a façade.   It is common ground that the brothers have different roles suited to their somewhat different skills.  Mr Pym, who had been friends with both of them, put it like this: Mr Nicholas Candy covered the public representation and promotion side of the business, being the <span style="font-style:italic">“front of shop”</span> with all the sales talk, and his brother covered the operations and financials, being the <span style="font-style:italic">“brains in the back office”</span>.  Mr Christian Candy accepted as fair the way it was put to him by Mr Stewart in cross-examination: <span style="font-style:italic">“you are the number and details man and he is the salesman and showman”</span>, Mr Candy agreeing that he was more numerate and his brother more marketing based.  But the Claimants say that the reality is that despite their different roles, they are in truth joint beneficial owners of CPC, an assertion that the Claimants have advanced vigorously and persistently in the face of the brothers’ denials.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This case was based on a number of strands.  First, there was the evidence of witnesses who said that Mr Nicholas Candy routinely held himself out as a co-owner of everything.  Mr Holyoake’s evidence was that Mr Nicholas Candy told him on innumerable occasions that he and his brother jointly owned all their business interests together; that they had been advised to restructure their businesses for tax reasons, which would mean one of the two brothers would have to live offshore and the company used for their property development would also have to be based offshore; that it was for this reason that his brother Chris had moved offshore while he remained in the UK to have a presence on the ground, CPC being set up in Guernsey with Chris as the only shareholder; and that he trusted his brother completely and was comfortable that he would get his 50% share of the profits.  Mr Holyoake also said that he had hundreds of conversations with Mr Nicholas Candy about his business interests and they were always about CPC projects, not about C&amp;C.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mrs Holyoake gave evidence that Mr Nicholas Candy (whom she had known through her husband for many years and seen on numerous occasions socially) used to tell her that he and his brother were 50/50 partners and owned everything jointly, although his brother held the properties and projects for tax reasons abroad.  She also became good friends with Holly Valance (formerly Mr Nicholas Candy’s girlfriend and now his wife), and recounted an incident at a party at a friend’s house in Ibiza in June 2012 when Ms Valance told her that Mr Nicholas Candy was upset because his brother was not giving him his 50 per cent of the money.  Despite submissions from Mr Lord that Mrs Holyoake’s evidence should be rejected on the grounds that she was simply parroting untrue explanations given by her husband, I found her a credible witness.  She was obviously fiercely loyal to her husband and deeply supportive of him, but did not strike me as a woman who was simply repeating untruths at his behest, but as one who was giving her own independent evidence to the best of her recollection. </p>

No objection was made to his giving evidence although none of it directly concerned GGH or the events on which the action is based.  Mr Hyman is a chartered accountant.  He was formerly a partner at KPMG, who left KPMG in 2004 and set up his own consultancy under the name Hyman Capital in 2005.   For a number of months in 2005 he acted as interim CEO of C&amp;C.

He understood that this proposal was driven by tax considerations and had been drawn up some 6 months before his engagement by Mr Kevin Cubitt, who was the Tax Strategy manager for C&amp;C.  Mr Hyman said that the brothers used to joke that no-one would ever understand their tax affairs, not least because nothing was written down.  The understanding was that they were brothers and would share everything equally; although Mr Christian Candy was the sole shareholder of CPC, it was Mr Hyman’s clear understanding that he would <span style="font-style:italic">“look after”</span> his brother’s financial interests, this being common knowledge among at any rate the senior management team.  This was a purely verbal agreement between brothers, not recorded anywhere.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Hyman had come forward to give evidence voluntarily.  There was an unusual aspect of his evidence which is that after giving his first witness statement (dated 5 November 2016) he made a second witness statement (dated 23 February 2017), which detailed some approaches he said he had received since his first statement.  I need not refer to the first such approach, but the others were telephone calls from a business contact of his, Mr Bradley Annis.  According to Mr Hyman Mr Annis claimed to have an (unnamed) contact who worked for Mr Christian Candy.  On one call, around early February, Mr Annis said that his contact had told him that the Candy brothers were unhappy with certain aspects of Mr Hyman’s evidence and would go for him very heavily at trial; on another call, on 20 February, Mr Annis said that his contact had told him that the Candy brothers had let it be known that should their defence of this action be successful, they would pursue anyone who had given evidence for the Claimants, through the Courts.  Mr Hyman took this last approach sufficiently seriously to report it to the police.  Mr Hyman was naturally crossexamined about this, but stuck to his evidence; he gave it convincingly and I am disposed to accept that he was telling the truth about the calls from Mr Annis.  It was suggested that he had an axe to grind against the Candys but I was not persuaded that his evidence could be explained away on that basis. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">None of that of course establishes that what Mr Annis said to him, let alone what Mr Annis’s unnamed contact is supposed to have said to Mr Annis, is true and the episode as a whole illustrates the undesirability of relying on untested multiple hearsay evidence.  However much I am disposed to accept Mr Hyman’s evidence about it, it would I think be wrong to base any findings against the Defendants on it.  There was however an interesting sequel: Mr Christian Candy was asked if he had let it be known that he would be pursuing any witnesses who came to give evidence for Mr Holyoake, and gave what I consider to be a rather surprising series of answers.  Instead of simply saying that he had not considered, and would never consider, such a thing, his answers were: </p>

There is other evidence that Mr Candy does not like to be crossed, and I think there may be some truth in the suggestion that he was angered by Mr Hyman’s evidence.

But it seems to me quite natural for Mr Christian Candy as the owner of CPC to refer to his company as <span style="font-style:italic">“we”</span>; indeed Mr Christian Candy said that he used <span style="font-style:italic">“we”</span> to refer to himself and CPC without any distinction between them, an explanation that I accept.  Similarly Mr Stewart placed considerable emphasis on an e-mail from Mr Christian Candy to Mr Holyoake on 14 December 2011 in which he referred to his brother as <span style="font-style:italic">“my lifetime business partner”</span>.  But he was not here giving an account of any financial arrangements that he had with his brother, but explaining why he felt able to trust him.  On any view, they had built their fortunes together.  They also continued to have a close working relationship: where CPC carried out a development, C&amp;C would be engaged to provide a number of services for the development such as development management, interior design, planning and marketing.  They also spoke regularly on the telephone and Mr Christian Candy routinely consulted his brother on business propositions, and used him as a sounding board for ideas.  Indeed as well as the board meetings of CPC at which <span style="font-style:italic">“actual operational decisions”</span> (to use Mr David’s words) were taken on behalf of CPC by its properly appointed directors (and which Mr Nicholas Candy never attended), there were regular strategy meetings which he did attend and which discussed matters at a more high level; I do not think it matters if he was there as representing C&amp;C which might have an interest in CPC’s projects, or simply as someone whom his brother trusted and whose advice he valued.  In those circumstances I do not find Mr Christian Candy’s reference to his brother as his <span style="font-style:italic">“lifetime business partner”</span> to be any indication of the true ownership of CPC. </p>

At the very inception of the loan on 12 October 2011, having spoken to his brother, he e-mailed Mr Holyoake and referred to Mr Smith and Mr Williams as <span style="font-style:italic">“my directors”</span> when what he meant was the directors of CPC; in e-mails to his brother on 13 and 24 January 2012 he referred to <span style="font-style:italic">“we”</span> making £10m from a 4 month investment and <span style="font-style:italic">“our </span></p>

All of these were in respect of the loan made by CPC in which on the face of it he had no financial interest at all.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Then there are instances where Mr Nicholas Candy can be shown to have been consulted in decisions that were properly decisions for CPC.  Again I will give only a few examples.  In August 2011 an opportunity arose to acquire the London Heliport; on 10 August Mr Nicholas Candy, having just told the vendor’s agent that the potential purchaser would be CPC, e-mailed his brother, Mr Smith and Mr Ben David </p>

On 23 January 2012, there was an e-mail exchange where Mr Holyoake was suggesting that each side bear their own costs of a particular transaction in relation to the loan, to which Mr Nicholas Candy’s reaction was that surely he should be covering all costs; Mr Smith replied <span style="font-style:italic">“Your call”.  </span>Strictly speaking it was no business of his at all what arrangement as to costs CPC came to with Mr Holyoake.  Again in December 2013 Mr Christian Candy e-mailed him referring to a bonus for Mr Dean (to be paid by CPC), and saying that <span style="font-style:italic">“We can discuss his bonus once MH repays”</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Stewart also referred to a promotional video which had been made for One Hyde Park, and comments on the video by Mr Smith (who had been CPC’s Head of Tax until August 2014) to the effect that it contained numerous statements which were unhelpful from a tax perspective, such as that <span style="font-style:italic">“the Candys” </span>are property developers, and that <span style="font-style:italic">“the Candy</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">brothers”</span> needed a return on their money.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In fact I think the video, and Mr Smith’s comments on it, are of no real assistance.  Mr Smith, as Mr Stewart accepted, was very careful in his evidence, with an impressive recall of detail.  He gave evidence that he had always had strong views about tax avoidance.  Tax avoidance might be legal (as opposed to tax evasion which was illegal) but he personally had a strong aversion to artificial and highly technical tax avoidance schemes.  He therefore took the view that it was necessary that the substance or reality of the transaction had to be such as to mitigate tax.  I accept this evidence, and viewed against this background, it is not difficult to see why he should be concerned that loose and imprecise statements in the video such as that the Candys needed a return on their money did not accurately reflect the real position.  In fact his main concerns seem to have been statements by Mr Christian Candy implying that he made all the decisions on One Hyde Park, whereas the true position was that the developer was a company called Project Grande Guernsey Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“PGGL”</span>), a joint venture between CPC and the former Prime Minister of Qatar in which CPC had a minority interest; and a statement by Mr Christian Candy that he had been on site every single week for 5 years, which Mr Smith described as very unhelpful (no doubt because Mr Candy was non-resident and there were limits on how much time he could spend in the UK without losing that status).  Neither of these points would appear to have had anything to do with the true ownership of CPC. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The final strand in the Claimants’ case is that Mr Nicholas Candy is admittedly very wealthy but the source of this wealth is unclear.  It is apparent from C&amp;C’s accounts that although over the years it has generated enough money to pay Mr Nicholas Candy a reasonable salary, it has made little profit, and certainly not enough to sustain his lifestyle.  His brother has made a number of substantial loans to him and in recent years three substantial gifts to him, one in July 2013 of £10m, and two in 2014 of a property called Gordon House and a penthouse at One Hyde Park, both properties being very valuable.  Mr Christian Candy explained in evidence that he made these gifts as a result of a request that his late father had made to him, shortly before he died in September 2013, to share his wealth with his brother.  Mr Stewart’s submission was that in reality they represented his brother’s share in the profit of CPC.  Again I find this point of no real assistance.  It is not disputed that the gifts took place.  For a very wealthy man to share some of his wealth in this way with a brother to whom he is very close is not so extraordinary a thing as to suggest that the ostensible motivation must be rejected and some different explanation sought.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have set out the material on which Mr Stewart relies at length because he put this point at the forefront of his submissions.  Some of it seems to me of limited value as I have said, but some of the material is certainly quite striking.  It is true that the focus of the trial was on the loan to Mr Holyoake, and that Mr Nicholas Candy both had a much closer relationship with him than his brother did, and had introduced the opportunity to CPC and felt he bore a responsibility for it; it is not surprising therefore that he was closely involved in this particular loan, and the fact that he was does not tell one very much about his involvement in CPC’s business generally.  But that still does not explain how he came to refer to the £10m <span style="font-style:italic">“we will make”</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">“our 30%”</span>, which on any natural reading would indicate that he had a financial interest in the loan, not just a concern that he had been responsible for introducing his brother to it.  And the evidence of Mrs Holyoake, who I have already said I found to be a credible witness, does suggest that Mr Nicholas Candy held himself out as a joint owner with </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Nevertheless I am not persuaded that it is either necessary or appropriate for me to seek to resolve this question.  Mr Stewart submitted that there were three reasons why the issue was important.  The first was that it vindicated Mr Holyoake’s belief that he considered the transaction to be one with friends.  But the true ownership of CPC does not seem to me logically relevant to what Mr Holyoake believed.  That depends on what he thought, not what the true position was.  For reasons given below I am quite prepared to assume that he may have thought he was in effect dealing with both of them.  That does not require me to decide whether Mr Nicholas Candy in fact had any ownership interest in CPC or not. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second reason put forward by Mr Stewart was that it demonstrated that Mr Nicholas Candy had a motive for entering into the conspiracy which the Claimants allege.  Again this seems to me quite unnecessary.  The evidence demonstrates that Mr Nicholas Candy took a close interest in the loan, and was as keen to see that it was repaid as CPC itself.  Whether that was because he had a direct financial interest in the loan being repaid, or because he felt responsible for introducing CPC to the loan in the first place, or was simply because he wanted his brother not to lose out, does not matter; nor do I think it really assists in resolving whether he became party to a conspiracy to use unlawful means as alleged by the Claimants. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The third reason put forward by Mr Stewart (and said by him to be the most important) was that it demonstrated that there was a lie at the heart of CPC, which on the Claimants’ case was set up as a fraudulent scheme to evade very large amounts of tax for the benefit of both Candy brothers, thereby demonstrating the nature of their characters.  On analysis that has nothing, or at any rate very little, to do with the issues in the case.  In civil proceedings similar fact evidence is admissible in principle if it is logically probative of the issues (<span style="font-style:italic">O’Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police</span> [2005] 2 AC 53) but even if it were proved beyond doubt that the Candy brothers had committed a tax fraud, I do not see that this would provide any meaningful assistance in resolving the quite different allegations (conspiracy, intimidation and the like) on which these proceedings are based.  No doubt as a very general statement a person who is shown to have committed fraud might be thought more likely to have committed other wrongdoing than an upstanding citizen, but that seems to me a long way removed from the sort of logically probative evidence that can be relied on as similar fact evidence.  Proved or admitted dishonesty by a witness may also be relevant to credit, that is to whether their evidence is to be believed, but as I understand the law that does not allow a party to call evidence that goes merely to credit, and I do not think it permits a party to seek to prove a hotly contested allegation of dishonesty that has nothing to do with the facts of the case simply in order to discredit a witness.   </p>

The disclosure in these proceedings has been focused on CPC’s conduct in respect of GGH, and the Court does not have before it disclosure in relation to the hundreds of other transactions CPC has transacted.  Any challenge to the evidence of the Defendants would require investigation of all of CPC’s business dealings.  I accept this submission.  Even in a case where similar fact evidence is relied on, the Court retains case management powers which may lead to such evidence being excluded: the Court’s overriding purpose is to promote justice but that requires that the trial process be fair to all parties, and it is necessary to weigh the potential probative value of the evidence against its potential for causing unfairness: </p>

In the same way it seems to me that the Court should be reluctant to reach a conclusion on an issue which is of no, or very limited, potential probative value but which has the potential (if decided one way) of causing significant unfairness.  I remain of the view that I expressed at an interlocutory stage that the purpose of this trial is to determine the allegations in the action, not the tax affairs of the Candys, and that it would be wrong, on necessarily limited evidence, to reach a conclusion on a matter that I do not need to reach a conclusion on.  </p>

Mr Roberts feels very strongly that Mr Candy acted in an underhand manner in engineering the collapse of the business with a view to taking control of it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There was one other curious feature of Mr Nicholas Candy’s evidence which Mr Stewart placed some reliance on.  On Day 23 (Friday 10 March) Mr Stewart asked him if he knew someone called Dominic Cooper-Smith.  Mr Candy said more than once that he did not and that he had never heard of him, despite Mr Stewart prompting him that Mr Cooper-Smith was asking for payment for flights for guests travelling to Mr Candy’s wedding in Los Angeles.  On Day 24 (Monday 13 March) Mr Stewart asked him again, by which time he had remembered that Mr Cooper-Smith was connected with an issue over flights to his wedding that his wife’s family had paid for but not received.  Mr Stewart asked if he had threatened to send the boys round to Mr Cooper-Smith’s house, which Mr Candy denied; and later that day put to Mr Nicholas Candy an e-mail from Mr Cooper-Smith to Mr Candy dating from September 2012, which Mr Candy accepted he received, in which Mr Cooper-Smith said: </p>

One would have thought that to be accused of a threat like that would be very memorable.  Either Mr Candy did in fact remember his name (in which case he lied to the Court when he said he could not); or if he did not, it suggested that he is so regularly accused of such behaviour that he cannot remember all his accusers’ names.  I do not know, and do not intend to speculate, on the truth of the matter, but I accept that Mr Candy’s evidence on this left something to be desired, and I was left with the suspicion that I was not being told the whole story to the best of his recollection. </p>

That is not confirmed by anything in the documentary evidence, but he had certainly become interested by 8 March 2011 when an e-mail exchange between him and Mr Pym referred to a possible deal on GGH, Mr Holyoake saying that he had just had it confirmed that Mr David Pearl was the majority owner of GGH, with a Mr Alaa Ghanis (actually Ghani) also having an interest.  By 10 April 2011, a financial appraisal had been prepared for Mr Holyoake based on a mixed use development of GGH (retail on the ground floor, residential above) and a purchase price of £38m: this projected total costs of some £92m and a developed value of some £169m, delivering a profit of over £77m.   </p>

Mr Christian Candy’s own initial view was that he quite liked the proposal and he spent some time looking at it, having his own appraisals prepared internally.  He made encouraging noises to Mr Holyoake, for example on 24 May asking <span style="font-style:italic">“Does he </span>[Mr Pearl]<span style="font-style:italic"> know CPC is your partner?”</span>, and on 26 May <span style="font-style:italic">“What law firm are we going to use?”</span> but nothing was formally agreed, and by 7 June he was expressing the view internally that he was against participating.  On 16 June he e-mailed Mr Holyoake to the effect that he had spoken to his brother and CPC was unfortunately not interested, the upside not being large enough and the biggest risk being English Heritage.  Mr Holyoake said in oral evidence that he was surprised by this as previous conversations were exceptionally positive, but he accepted that they had a right to say Yes or No.  </p>

That seems to me to overstate the position: they had done some preliminary work, as a result of which they concluded that it might make money but there were risks, and it was not an attractive enough proposition to wish to invest in.  Mr Stewart also asked me to find that Mr Nicholas Candy knew that Mr Holyoake was not a man of straw, and it is wrong to say that the loan was made without any due diligence on him.  I do not make that finding.  Mr Nicholas Candy as Mr Holyoake’s friend may have had a general impression of his wealth (or at any rate his standing of living, which is not necessarily the same thing), but at the time of the loan, neither he nor anyone else on the Defendants’ side had investigated it at all.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">These statements were not true.  The true position was that Mr Holyoake at that stage had approached Investec and that on 7 June Mr Jonathan Arnst of Investec had sent him an e-mail referring to a proposed funding structure under which Investec would lend £26m for a term of 3 years at 4.5% over LIBOR.  The e-mail however made it clear that it was for discussion only and did not constitute a formal offer of funding.  At 08.00 on the morning of 13 June (that is shortly before his e-mail to Mr Doffman) Mr Holyoake told Mr Christian Candy that he would be speaking to the bank at 3pm, and at 14.30 he e-mailed Mr Arnst with some further information (a planning letter) and asked him if he thought credit approval would be forthcoming at the end of the week.  This to my mind establishes that Mr Holyoake was fully aware that the proposed facility had not yet been approved by the bank’s relevant credit committee, and could not be said to be <span style="font-style:italic">“in place”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“ready to go”</span>.  Nor for that matter was it accurate to say that the loan was 70% loan to value: Investec was at that stage considering a proposal to lend £26m on a purchase price of £40m, which is 65%.  Mr Holyoake was asked about this in cross-examination and said that he had been given a clear steer that they were good to go with Investec but accepted that he had not received credit approval at that stage and that he was exaggerating the position.     </p>

At a purchase price of £40m, there would be a further £14m needed to complete the purchase (plus costs and stamp duty), and Mr Holyoake did not have that kind of money to hand.  He was in fact in the middle of seeking to persuade a Mr Ranjan, who had connections with the Petchey Group, that the Petchey Group should contribute mezzanine funding to the project.  The proposal was that they should provide funding, to rank after the bank debt but before equity, in return for interest and a share of profits.  Mr Holyoake’s initial suggestion was that the Petchey Group contribute £20m, to rank after a bank facility of £25m; by 11 June this had become a proposal that they provide £15m of funding to rank after debt of up to £27.5m, in return for interest of 15% per annum and 25% of profits.  Mr Ranjan had invited Mr Holyoake to progress this proposal, but it had not been agreed and on the afternoon of 13 June Mr Holyoake was e-mailing Mr Pym to the effect that if Mr Pym did not hear from Mr Ranjan, they should maybe have a call with him that evening <span style="font-style:italic">“because I </span></p>

The credit process was evidently not going to be a formality as Investec had continued to ask Mr Holyoake some quite difficult questions: on 13 June Mr Arnst had e-mailed Mr Holyoake saying that they needed to understand where the cash equity requirement was coming from, that it was not clearly evident from the net asset position he had disclosed and that it would <span style="font-style:italic">“no doubt be a key focus of the credit process”</span> given the size of the transaction and the personal recourse that had been proposed; by 22 June Investec had asked Mr Holyoake for the last 3 years’ accounts for ISI and Mr Holyoake was sufficiently concerned to ask Mr Wells to think about how they could show them as it was very important that it was very profitable, following that up with a suggestion that maybe the previous owner had taken a big salary or dividend or a big management charge; and on the morning of 27 June (at 10.15, that is about 6 hours before Mr Holyoake forwarded Mr Pym’s letter of 27 June) Mr Simon Brooks of Investec had told Mr Holyoake that they were hoping to run through the deal with a couple of the credit guys ahead of the formal credit committee meeting so that they did not see it cold, so </p>

Nor was it correct to say that Mr Holyoake had a further £15m <span style="font-style:italic">“immediately available”</span>, being provided substantially via TPO.  Mr Pym had suggested to Mr Holyoake that TPO might circulate its clients and contacts with an opportunity to participate in a syndicated loan note in the sum of £15m, but there is nothing to suggest that this sum or anything like it had in fact been raised.  Mr Pym in evidence said that TPO had set up a so-called SICAV fund in Malta, and had had verbal commitments to fund it to the tune of £15m.  That does not seem to me to justify a statement that Mr Holyoake had £15m immediately available to him, and the £15m was not in fact available at completion when he needed it.  </p>

Mr Holyoake sought to explain this away by suggesting that he had not told Mr Saunders that global approval had been declined, and that they were confident that the global approval would be forthcoming.  I reject that as an explanation: Mr Saunders is referring to a specific confirmation received that morning and Mr Saunders is unlikely to have said this without being told that such a confirmation had been given.  The obvious source of such information was Mr Holyoake and I conclude that it is likely that he told Mr Saunders that, despite knowing that it was untrue.

I regard that as a disingenuous answer.  The article did not say, or suggest, that he had paid in cash, and it is clear that Mr Dunn was not asking if he had.  That would no doubt have been a most unusual way to purchase a £42m property and if Mr Dunn was really asking if Mr Holyoake had done so, he would have said so in terms; in any event his third question expressly asked for the source of Mr Holyoake’s funding.  Mr Holyoake’s e-mail to Mr Dunn was plainly intended to suggest that the article was inaccurate, to deny that he had bought GGH for £42m, and to convey the message that his only role in the proposed development was to act for a fee in overseeing a development by someone else.

Mr Allen claimed to be very wealthy and to be interested in participating in GGH, and at various stages promised to produce large sums, but he never did provide any funds and turned out to have a serious criminal record: see <span style="font-style:italic">Allen v Matthews </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 216 at [6] where Lawrence Collins LJ refers to his serving two periods of imprisonment for fraud and assault.  Mr Lord spent some time in cross-examination exploring the issue of the proposed participation of Mr Allen, which had not been referred to at all in the Claimants’ witness statements.  In particular, on 2 September 2011, at a stage when Mr Holyoake was expecting Mr Allen to participate, he had e-mailed Mr Pym to the effect that he didn’t want to mention Mr Allen’s participation to the bank (that is, Investec) as if they had to do KYC (know your customer checks) on him they would never get a loan, to which Mr Pym replied <span style="font-style:italic">“True enough”</span>; on the basis of this it was suggested to them that they had both known of Mr Allen’s dubious past.  Mr Holyoake denied it, asserting that all that he knew was that Mr Allen had had considerable difficulties passing KYC checks when a client of Mr Pym’s at Crédit Suisse, although he did accept that he had decided not to make any reference to Mr Allen in his witness statement, despite referring to a fair number of potential funders, and that he had done so because he felt embarrassed once he discovered the truth about him.  Mr Pym accepted that he had introduced Mr Allen to Mr Holyoake, and said that he too did not know about his criminal record, but said that Mr Holyoake was wrong to think that Mr Allen had ever been a client of his or gone through KYC.  On this evidence I am left quite unsure what the truth of the matter is.  I am prepared however to give Mr Holyoake and Mr Pym the benefit of the doubt and I therefore do not find it proved that they actually knew of Mr Allen’s criminal record; but on any view they were willing to arrange Mr Allen’s anticipated participation in the project in such a way as to deliberately conceal it from Investec.     </p>

There are a large number of e-mails in evidence; it has not been entirely straightforward to disentangle the precise chronology because although all the e-mails have time-stamps, the times are not internally consistent.  This is partly because different participants were in different time-zones (Mr Holyoake in Ibiza, Mr Nicholas Candy, the lawyers on both sides and Mr Williams (initially) in London, Mr Christian Candy in Los Angeles, Mr David (and Mr Williams later) in Guernsey, and Mr Wells in Switzerland), but partly because of some technical issue with the time-stamps which meant that the same e-mail has different times in different iterations.  I heard no technical evidence and this issue was never fully explained, but, with the help of some detailed analysis by counsel, it is I think possible to reconstruct the order of events with some confidence.  In the account which follows the times which I give are those which I believe represent the time in London, which was British Summer Time (that is GMT + 1 hour); Guernsey was then on the same time, Ibiza and Switzerland 1 hour ahead, and Los Angeles 8 hours behind. </p>

Since what Mr Holyoake was suggesting was a loan to himself, the reference to a guarantee was not technically accurate but he (and others) used this as a shorthand for his personal liability for the loan.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Holyoake did not tell Mr Candy that they were his last resort, instead presenting it as a <span style="font-style:italic">“contingency plan”</span> should his existing lender fail to come through (<span style="font-style:italic">“as they were supposed to be in funds today”</span>); he later added plausibility to this by offering to arrange something meaningful as a thank you if <span style="font-style:italic">“the transfer from mezz comes in”</span>, subsequently quantified as £1m if he did not need to use CPC’s moneys but used <span style="font-style:italic">“the Saudis”</span> instead.  That indicates that what he told the Candys was that he was expecting mezzanine finance from a Saudi source, that he still hoped they would deliver and that the CPC loan was merely a back-up plan.  In February 2012 he told Mr Pym that he had been thinking of the Al-Rajhi family, and he confirmed this in oral evidence.  The Al-Rajhi family had indeed been approached by Mr Lovering and had shown some interest in investing in GGH.  But I have seen nothing to suggest that by 12 October Mr Holyoake had been actually expecting funds from them to complete: Mr Lovering was still trying to push them to conclude an agreement on 16 October (and was described by Mr Pym on 18 October as getting frustrated with their speed of reaction), and Mr Holyoake accepted that they never in the event committed any funding.  Mr Lovering’s own evidence was that their decisions were normally made very quickly, but this took longer and nothing came of it, and that although a proposition was put to them, for various reasons it didn’t happen.  I conclude that the suggestion that funds were expected from them and that the CPC loan was needed as a back-up was another stretching of the facts by Mr Holyoake, no doubt to avoid looking too desperate. </p>

This illustrates something that was not disputed, namely that Mr Holyoake did not tell the Candys about the Oscarone loan on 12 October, or subsequently.  Indeed as already referred to Mr Holyoake did not reveal the Oscarone loan to the Candys during the almost 2½ years the loan was outstanding, at one point taking active steps to fabricate documents so as to conceal Oscarone’s participation from them, and continuing to lie about Oscarone even after the proceedings were brought.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The same e-mail also made it clear that the loan would be coming from CPC, not from either of the Candys personally.  Again there is no dispute that Mr Holyoake understood this – for example at 11.53, at a stage when he envisaged that the loan would be made initially on the basis of binding heads of terms (with full documentation to follow), he asked Mr Nicholas Candy for <span style="font-style:italic">“CPC full address for heads”</span>, and Mr David, who was tasked with progressing the loan in Guernsey, duly provided him with both a correspondence address and the registered address, both in St Peter Port, Guernsey.  Again when Mr Saunders provided a letter addressed to Mr Nicholas Candy, referring to him sending £12m as a loan and undertaking to hold the monies <span style="font-style:italic">“to your order”</span>, Mr Williams picked up that the letter was wrong as it was CPC not Mr Nicholas Candy that was making the loan; Mr Nicholas Candy then sent an e-mail to Mr Saunders’ secretary, copied to Mr Holyoake, asking for the letter to be rewritten and addressed to CPC, emphasising <span style="font-style:italic">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">It is not me sending the money</span><span style="font-style:italic">…I am NOT personally involved other than in an advisory capacity”</span>; the revised letter was duly sent, addressed to CPC, and then a further revised version giving CPC’s registered address, and marked for the attention of Mr Williams and Mr David.  That enabled the funds to be transferred and at 13.02 they were sent to Saunders Bearman to be held to CPC’s order pending finalisation of the terms (although perhaps characteristically Mr Holyoake had texted Mr Brooks of Investec as early as 12.43 confirming that they were already with Mr Saunders); Mr Saunders sent the funds on to the vendors’ solicitors (DLA) where they had arrived by 14.48 at the latest.  (Mr Saunders did not regard this as in breach of his agreement to hold them to CPC’s order, as DLA were themselves holding the funds to his order pending completion; I do not intend to resolve if he was right about that or not).   </p>

He had therefore hoped that the loan could be made on the basis of some quite short but binding heads of terms.  But CPC instructed their solicitors, then called Wragge &amp; Co LLP (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Wragges”</span>), and by 13.15 Mr Christian Candy was telling Mr Holyoake that Wragges wanted different documentation; and it was then agreed that Wragges would draft loan documentation, and Saunders Bearman would draft declarations of trust in respect of the profit share, and in due course it became apparent that the 3pm deadline could not be met.    </p>

This e-mail is revealing about the practical effect of Mr Holyoake not telling the Candys about the Oscarone loan.  If they had known of that, CPC would have seen that the total borrowed for the project was not £37m but £44.5m, and that CPC would have been <span style="font-style:italic">“under water”</span> and reliant on either GGH increasing in value or Mr Holyoake’s personal liability right from the outset.  What is more, as Mr Christian Candy explained in evidence, CPC was in effect, although it did not know it, providing 100% of the equity but only receiving 30% of the profits.  He said in evidence that if he had known of the Oscarone loan, he would not have done the deal, evidence which in the light of these considerations seems to me entirely believable and which I accept.     </p>

He confirmed that the information would stay confidential to CPC group, and even be kept from Mr Nicholas Candy if Mr Holyoake requested.  He followed this up at 14.01 with a request for a second charge on one of Mr Holyoake’s assets with enough equity in it to cover the loan and 2 years’ interest, his Ibiza house being CPC’s preferred choice; he described this as <span style="font-style:italic">“a big issue to CPC, and I think fundamental to the loan.”</span>  Mr Holyoake said in evidence that he regarded this as Mr Christian Candy <span style="font-style:italic">“pushing the envelope”</span>, that is attempting to improve the terms of the deal.

Mr David replied to him (at 19.37) that they had 5 days with no confirmation of net wealth or validity of profit share and that if Mr Holyoake failed to provide these, they were into default and would go after his guarantee; the 6 months had been suggested by Mr Holyoake as he needed time to get a dividend out of one of his businesses; they were at risk and reliant on his guarantee until they got the second charge, but this position was reflected in the pricing/profit upside.  The key call was whether Mr Candy trusted him and he was a man of substance.  Mr Candy replied (at 20.30) that he was fine but asked Mr David to squeeze the 6 months to 4.  </p>

It is not however necessary to detail the process: eventually by 01.56 on the morning of 13 October Mr Holyoake had sent everything through, and at 02.14 Mr Gayle acknowledged that he now had the loan agreement signed by Mr Holyoake and the two declarations signed by all parties and witnessed.

The former seems to have been a simple error.  As to the latter, Mr Holyoake accepted in cross-examination that he did not disclose the existence of Dorry to CPC, and that it was in fact a mistake to say that he was the owner of the shares in Greenlander, but did not accept that it was of any potential significance to CPC.  Although it was suggested to him that it might undermine CPC’s rights under the declarations of trust, he did not appear to me to understand the point and I am not persuaded that this this was his intention; I find that this too was just an error, not a deliberate attempt to mislead or prejudice CPC. </p>

This is impossible to reconcile with the e-mails, and an attempt by Mr Holyoake to suggest that all he had meant to convey was that it had not been raised at the outset is unconvincing because of the reference to it being deliberately raised at the last minute.  Having studied the e-mails however Mr Holyoake gave a rather lengthier account in his fourth witness statement (dated 17 January 2017, shortly before the trial) which respected what they show; he now placed the call with Mr Williams somewhere between the telephone call at 21.10 and his e-mail of 22.23 at which he said he was happy to sign.  In closing Mr Stewart placed the call slightly later, between Mr Gayle’s circulation of the final form of the loan agreement at 22.13 and Mr Holyoake’s e-mail of 22.54 asking if there were any further comments. </p>

On the contrary he expressed himself to be happy with the drafting on several occasions, namely (i) with Mr Gayle’s third draft, circulated at 19.51, which Mr Holyoake said at 20.07 he was happy to execute with certain changes; </p>

In particular Mr Stewart’s position in closing, placing the call between 22.13 and 22.54, suffers from the difficulty that at 22.26 Mr Holyoake said he was happy to execute the loan agreement if Mr David and Mr Williams were happy it was in final form, and at 22.54 he asked if there were any comments or if it was ok to sign.  Not only do these e-mails not refer to any telephone call; they suggest very strongly that Mr Holyoake had <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> spoken to Mr Williams between 22.13 and 22.54 as if he had, the obvious thing to have done would have been to ask him, when he spoke to him, if he and Mr David were happy with the agreement, rather than asking him in an e-mail before the supposed call, and then again in another one shortly after it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">As appears below, Mr Holyoake did provide a net asset statement which CPC almost immediately challenged, which led in due course to CPC sending a formal letter claiming that Mr Holyoake was in default for failing to comply with the net asset statement provision.  Mr Holyoake disputed that he was in breach; but it is striking that there is no written complaint by Mr Holyoake, either when he was being pressed to comply, or when a claim was made that he was in default for not having complied, that this was contrary to the assurance he had received from Mr Williams.  He gave an explanation in his fourth witness statement to the effect that he did raise it orally with Mr Christian Candy in November 2011 who told him that <span style="font-style:italic">“we are where we are”</span> and that it was too late to raise the issue, so he dropped it.  This explanation was denied by Mr Candy and is difficult to accept: it would mean that despite being threatened with an immediate demand for the £17.74m and despite Mr Holyoake having, on his case, an answer to the allegation of default, he did not deploy it, a surprisingly meek reaction from a man who has otherwise not been shy to fight his corner.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">On 23 December 2014 Mr Holyoake’s then solicitors, Jones Day, sent a letter before action to CPC, enclosing draft Particulars of Claim settled by his then leading counsel, the proposed parties being Mr Holyoake and CPC.  The relief sought was the setting aside of the Settlement Deed for duress, and repayment of some £20m (that is the sums paid to CPC of £37m, less the £17.74m, plus some costs) under the CCA.  The draft Particulars referred to Mr Holyoake’s obligation under the loan agreement to provide a net asset statement, and to the later dispute whether Mr Holyoake had complied with it, without alleging anywhere that Mr Holyoake had been assured that it would not be relied on.  Again that seems a surprising omission from a claim that otherwise relies on many of the same complaints as are made in this action and had evidently been drafted with considerable care (and at some expense).  Mr Holyoake gave an explanation that this was only the first claim and there was potentially a second, but this was not explored further (no doubt because Mr Holyoake had not waived privilege in the advice he was receiving).  Jones Day’s letter does indeed reserve the position in respect of a future claim to loss of profits, but this does not seem an adequate explanation why the allegation now relied on was nowhere mentioned.  One would have thought that it would have supported the case that was being advanced in the Particulars of Claim, even if a second action for loss of profits was genuinely being kept in reserve.  </p>

As he pointed out, Mr Christian Candy had first (at 13.50) asked Mr Holyoake for a net asset statement, and then (in the telephone call at 14.15) agreed that he need not provide one; it was Mr Williams (who was in London on other business and in and out of meetings, and not on that call) who had, he said, been unhappy with the terms when he saw them and sought to renegotiate them, which was done in the telephone call after 16.58; having thus, as he put it, <span style="font-style:italic">“stuck my neck out to overrule my boss”</span>, he was not going to turn round to Mr Holyoake and say that he was only doing it to annoy Mr Christian Candy and CPC would never rely on it.  That evidence seemed to me inherently credible, as did his evidence that even though Mr Holyoake was Mr Nicholas Candy’s best friend, the loan was actually coming from CPC of which he was a director, and £12m was an awful lot of money, and that was why he insisted on putting in place the necessary protections for CPC, in case what they were being told by Mr Holyoake was not true.   </p>

He had first said he was willing to execute it subject to one or two points at 20.07, and repeated this thereafter.  If the call had taken place at all and Mr Holyoake had expressed some unease at being asked to give the net asset statement, one would have thought that Mr Williams would have been far more likely to tell him that it had been agreed some time back and that it was too late to change it rather than give him an assurance that it was only there for some marketing reason, and would not be relied on. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">It is correct that CPC had recently launched a lending business called Omni Capital Partners Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Omni”</span>) which was aimed at lending to high net worth individuals, that Mr Christian Candy was at the time concerned that it was not doing as much business as he had hoped, and that it can be shown that at around this time CPC was taking steps to publicise Omni’s business, with a press release on 18 October 2011 announcing a significant expansion of its funding capabilities.  But the suggestion that Mr Holyoake’s net asset statement might assist in promoting Omni’s business makes little sense.  Omni was in the business of secured lending, which was rather different from the unsecured loan to Mr Holyoake; but even leaving that point aside, it is difficult to see how CPC could use Mr Holyoake’s net asset statement in any meaningful way.  CPC had agreed to confidentiality provisions which prevented them actually publicising his net asset statement, so the most they could do is refer to it in anonymous terms, at which point the exercise becomes rather pointless.  CPC did not need a net asset statement to say that it had made a loan of £12m to an anonymous borrower whose net worth was £120m.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">The main point made by Mr Holyoake in oral evidence was that he would scarcely have agreed to give a net asset statement at £120m, a figure that he thought he could stretch to but was at the top end of possible values, without seeking to negotiate the figure down to a more reasonable 2 or 3 times the loan, if he had thought it was actually going to be used against him.  This point was advanced tenaciously not only by him but by Mr Wells, but the force of it is somewhat blunted by the chronology.  It is apparent that the figure of 10 times the loan had appeared in the documentation as early as Mr Gayle’s second draft (at 16.01), and the evidence is that it came out of the telephone call at 14.15, where Mr Holyoake’s main concern was to avoid having to give security and he was seeking to make the point that he had more than enough assets to repay the loan.  He also successfully resisted giving a net asset statement on that call, and the upshot was that Mr Christian Candy agreed to accept a minimum net asset covenant instead, using the figure of 10 times the loan.  Having put that figure forward, or agreed it, for the minimum net asset covenant, one can understand that Mr Holyoake might have had some difficulty in trying to row back from it when it was agreed (in the call after 16.58) that a net asset covenant would be given after all.  If he had tried at that stage to reduce the figure it would have cast doubt on what he had already said about the scale of his wealth, at a time when that was really all that the directors of CPC (Mr Williams and Mr David, neither of whom knew him personally) had to rely on.  In any event, Mr Holyoake’s own evidence was that he thought that if he found it difficult to meet £120m he could always reduce the figure by repaying a small part of the loan, believing that he only had to show 10 times the outstanding amount of the loan (which was not how the loan agreement ended up being drafted but had at one stage been the case).  He also gave evidence that he thought that for some assets, such as his interest in ISI, there was such a wide range of possible values that it would be possible to have a lengthy argument about the value if it ever became necessary (<span style="font-style:italic">“you could have a ding dong match about 120 or not 120 for two years”</span>) so the net asset statement was unlikely to prove fatal.  In all the circumstances the fact that he did not try and argue down the £120m figure is not I think a strong indicator that he ultimately accepted it because of an assurance from Mr Williams. </p>

I also accept that the fact that he thought he was dealing with friends may have made him less careful than he would have been in a purely commercial relationship.  But I do not find this of any real assistance in deciding whether Mr Williams gave him the specific assurance he alleges.  Indeed, immediately after the deal had been done (at 03.04 on 13 October) he sent an e-mail to both Candy brothers in which he said that they had a very good team around them and <span style="font-style:italic">“Richard in particular I thought was excellent”</span>.

He was particularly exercised about the requirement that the net asset statement be certified, something which became a bone of contention later on.  I deal with this point in more detail below, but I will say here that I am not persuaded that the requirement for certification was slipped in as a trap for Mr Holyoake to fall into, or that the net asset statement obligation was put into the agreement in the expectation or hope that Mr Holyoake would be unable to comply with it.  Mr Stewart made it clear in closing that he only relied on this point in support of the allegation of the fraudulent misrepresentation by Mr Williams, and again on this point I do not find it of any real assistance.   </p>

The letter did not confirm that the requisite Authorisations (including from Investec) had been obtained; instead it confirmed (as permitted by cl 10.1(e)(2)) that the Declarations of Trust were not in breach of, or in conflict with, and did not constitute a default or termination event under, any agreement or instrument binding on Mr Holyoake, Hotblack or Greenlander.  It is very doubtful if Saunders Bearman should have given such a confirmation, but I do not propose to go into this issue here: Mr Holyoake’s obligation was to deliver a letter from Saunders Bearman in acceptable form, which he did.   </p>

Neither the Oscarone loan of £7.5m nor the loan which Mr Holyoake had taken from CPC of £12m was shown as a liability.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That led to a protracted dialogue.  Mr Wells (and Mr Holyoake who got involved) disputed that the word <span style="font-style:italic">“certify”</span> meant that Gerard Edelman had to assume personal liability, saying that it would be unrealistic to expect this to be done in 5 days, and challenging Mr Williams to produce an example of a net asset statement certified in such terms.  (As already noted, one thing that noticeably does not appear in their e-mails was any contention that Mr Williams had assured Mr Holyoake that the net asset statement was a formality and would not be relied on).  Mr Williams for his part reiterated that the key point was that CPC wanted to rely on a third party professional, and so their PI cover, because the loan was arranged without there being time for any due diligence.  On 8 November Mr Wells sent Mr Burns a package of material (valuations and the like) and asked him to provide more colour around the statement, and on 10 November Mr Burns duly signed off a second letter enclosing an amended net asset statement.

The reservation of rights letter relied on two matters: the failure to provide a net asset statement certified pursuant to cl 10.1(e)(1) of the Loan Agreement in form and substance acceptable to CPC, and the failure to maintain the Minimum Net Asset Cover.  It did not call for any particular action, but cross-referred to without prejudice discussions which CPC hoped would result in a positive resolution.  At the same time CPC sent a without prejudice letter which took issue with the property values and enclosed a further revision to the net asset statement, showing a net position of some £90m; it suggested a way forward under which professional valuations of the properties (other than GGH) would be carried out at Mr Holyoake’s cost by Mr Sharpe-Neal of Savills plc (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Savills”</span>), cautions would be placed on the properties at the Land Registry, and in the event that the valuations confirmed CPC’s concerns over the values, charges would then be given to secure a minimum of £15m.  Savills was one of the firms that CPC used regularly for high-end valuations, and was one of the two agents instructed on the One Hyde Park development, and Mr Sharpe-Neal was very well-known to both Candy brothers and had been for a long time.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Two issues were canvassed at the trial on this: whether the requirement for the net asset statement to be certified required Gerard Edelman not only to confirm the net asset statement, but to accept personal liability for it; and whether the net asset statements were accurate statements of Mr Holyoake’s net worth.  The latter was investigated at some length but in the course of cross-examination Mr Holyoake accepted that various liabilities were omitted from the net asset statements (although he said that various assets were also omitted); and when asked what he was worth at the time that the net asset statements were put forward said he would be comfortable with the figure in the La Caixa statement, that is approximately £82m as a broadbrush figure.  He qualified this somewhat by saying that he drew a distinction between what he actually felt he was worth if he had to choose a figure (about £82m), and what he could put forward as a figure that could be justified (the £120m) since the value of his interest in ISI in particular was one where there was a wide range of potential values.  But in closing Mr Stewart expressly accepted that Mr Holyoake did not have net assets of £120m at the material times, and put forward as the Claimants’ case the contention that he had a net worth in the range of £60m to £100m as at 12 October 2011 and at all material times thereafter, and that this was best reflected by the La Caixa net asset statement, that is of the order of £80-£85m.   </p>

But in the light of Mr Stewart’s position it does not seem to me that I need to reach any final conclusions on this, and it is sufficient to say that whatever Mr Holyoake’s true net worth, it was some way short of £120m.  Since I have rejected his case that the Loan Agreement was induced by a fraudulent misrepresentation, the consequence is, as Mr Stewart expressly accepted, that Mr Holyoake was in breach of the terms of the Loan Agreement.    </p>

Mr Holyoake accepted that this should have been included, and Mr Wells accepted that it was a deliberate omission in the sense that they had not forgotten about it.  Mr Holyoake denied however that it had been deliberately omitted so as not to reveal it to CPC, saying that they had simply put in the gross position between the purchase price and senior debt; they had omitted certain of the debt but also certain of the upside, what he referred to as overage, that is the potential future profits from the development of GGH.  I found this a very lame explanation.  What was presented to CPC was that Mr Holyoake owned the equity in GGH after allowing for a debt secured on it of £21.8m. The true position was that his equity was (at most) what was available after allowing for debts secured on it totalling £31.5m.  Not to disclose that was misleading, and it does not cease to be misleading because it might have been possible to place a higher value on GGH.  The obvious inference is, and I find, that Mr Holyoake deliberately said nothing about the Oscarone debt because he had not disclosed it to the Candy brothers when taking the loan, and to do so now would provoke very difficult questions.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">Nor, as Mr Williams pointed out, was there any reference to Mr Holyoake’s liability to CPC of £12m.  Mr Holyoake’s evidence was that the £120m was intended to be a statement of his assets including GGH, but without taking into account the £12m loan as it was intended to be a statement of his assets prior to the taking on of that liability.  I have great difficulty understanding this.  Before CPC lent him the money, Mr Holyoake did not own GGH.  He did have, through Hotblack, a contractual right to acquire it, but he could only do so by completing the contract and since he did not have the cash that meant borrowing the £12m, either from CPC or from someone else.  In these circumstances I do not see how he could claim to have a valuable interest in GGH without a corresponding liability under the loan.  If he had not taken a loan he would not have been able to complete and would have lost all interest in GGH; once he had taken the loan he did have an interest in GGH but also a liability under the loan.  Any statement of his net worth that included GGH should logically therefore also have included the liability under the loan without which it would never have been acquired.  Moreover the obligation under the Minimum Net Asset covenant was one that undoubtedly continued through the term of the loan, so even if Mr Holyoake’s net worth was initially to be looked at before the loan was taken, he had covenanted that he would continue to have £120m of net assets after taking on the loan. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Williams also took the point that 30% of the net equity in GGH was held for CPC.  Again I think he was justified in doing so: under the Declarations of Trust Hotblack and Mr Holyoake had declared themselves trustees of 30% of their respective interests for CPC.  These Declarations were not well thought out, in particular in regard to how the two of them fitted together, but it seems clear that the intended effect was that CPC should have a 30% interest in Mr Holyoake’s stake in GGH, and it is difficult to see how, consistently with that, Mr Holyoake could claim that he owned 100% of the net equity.  Indeed when Mr Wells and Mr Holyoake were initially considering how to put the net asset statement together Mr Wells had sent an e-mail to Mr Holyoake (on 18 October) asking him how he wanted to show GGH and which said <span style="font-style:italic">“your 70% is 14.7”</span>.  The inference I draw is that Mr Wells understood Mr Holyoake to be left with 70% of the net equity (thus omitting Oscarone’s 15%, although that could admittedly be bought out), calculated at £21m (probably by taking a value of £45m and debt of £24m), but that Mr Holyoake decided that he should be shown as owning 100% of the net equity, calculated at £23.703m.    </p>

This was a particularly misleading omission as 3i had security over his properties, which meant that the ostensible equity shown as owned by Mr Holyoake was not in fact available to provide the Additional Property Charge which CPC would be entitled to if the loan were not repaid by March.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Two points can however be made briefly about the value placed on Mr Holyoake’s interest in ISI in the net asset statements which do not turn on any expert evidence.  First it is apparent from both the October and November net asset statements that Mr Holyoake’s interest in ISI was calculated at exactly 60% of the value of the whole (£49.2m, being 60% of £82m (Oct); £51,697,835, being 60% of £86,163,058 (Nov)).  In fact Mr Holyoake did not own 60% of ISI.  The evidence is that he owned (or rather had agreed to buy – he confirmed to his father in February 2012 that he did not have the equity and that it was in escrow pending the final payment due, and he did not make the final payment until after GGH was sold in 2014), a 55% interest in ISH.  Indeed when Mr Wells was putting together a presentation for him in July 2011, Mr Wells had initially referred to Mr Holyoake as having a 55% interest.  Mr Holyoake had however told him to use 60% <span style="font-style:italic">“as that’s what companies house says”</span> and thereafter Mr Wells used the figure of 60% for the presentation, and later for the net asset statements.  Mr Holyoake accepted that by July 2011 his (beneficial) shareholding was only in fact 55% (confirmed by the Overarching Agreement, which said that 5% of the shares held by his company Oakvest Holdings were held on trust for someone else); but he gave an explanation that because he had disposed of 5% of the equity in return for income, there was a dilemma as to how to value that.  I did not understand this: on the face of it, Mr Holyoake’s assets only amounted to 55% of ISI.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, the value of ISI was derived by taking a multiple of its forecast profits (that is earnings before interest, tax and depreciation or EBITDA).  For the October net asset statement it appears that the multiple used was 8.3 and the forecast EBITDA £9.96m.  For the November net asset statement, as the property values had been reduced, Mr Holyoake asked Mr Wells to boost the ISI figures slightly by increasing the forecast EBITDA to get over the £120m, which Mr Wells did.  On 14 November however, after the November net asset statement had been sent, Mr Wells sent an e-mail to Mr Holyoake in which he said:  </p>

In cross-examination Mr Wells attempted to explain this away but I could not follow, and do not accept, his explanation. It really follows from this that the values for the ISI shares were not based on genuine attempts by Mr Holyoake and Mr Wells to predict the likely level of EBITDA; rather the forecasts were manipulated to produce the result they wanted.  This is only the simplest and clearest example of a whole series of criticisms of the forecasts, which were explored at some length, but which I do not need to go into.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I find therefore that Mr Holyoake did not have net assets of £120m at the time of the Loan Agreement, or at the time the net asset statements were given in October and November.  I also find that the net asset statements were not acceptable to CPC, in that, among other things, they did not show liability for CPC’s loan and they included the value of 100% of the equity in GGH without allowing for CPC’s 30% interest.  In those circumstances Mr Holyoake was in breach of the Loan Agreement, both in not delivering a net asset statement that was in substance acceptable to CPC, and in not maintaining the Minimum Net Asset cover, and CPC was therefore justified in asserting, as it did, that there had been an Event of Default.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That makes it strictly unnecessary to resolve whether Mr Holyoake was also in breach of the requirement that the net asset statement be <span style="font-style:italic">“certified”</span> by a firm of accountants on the ground that Gerard Edelman had excluded any personal liability.  I will however briefly give my views.  As a matter of normal language the requirement that a firm certify the net asset statement requires it to say something along the lines of: “We hereby certify that Mr Holyoake’s net assets are as shown on the attached statement”.  I do not see in the wording of the contract any express requirement that the firm go further and also accept a personal liability to CPC.  So in order for the requirement to exist it is necessary to imply a term to that effect.  The tests for implication of contractual terms are well-known and strict, and in my judgment they are not satisfied here: to require that a firm of accountants not only certifies Mr Holyoake’s net wealth but puts its own liability and professional indemnity insurance on the line, is not, it seems to me, implicit in the express terms, or so obvious as to go without saying, nor do I see that it is needed for business efficacy or to make the contract work.  One can well understand Mr Williams’ point that in the absence of due diligence before making the loan, CPC wanted to have a professional firm and its insurance cover to look to, but that does not mean that without this extra protection the clause is robbed of all utility.  It should be some reassurance to a recipient of a net asset statement that a reputable professional firm is prepared to certify it even if it is not prepared to accept liability for it, as one would not expect a reputable firm to do that without having satisfied themselves that there was some basis for it, and whether a term should be implied into the contract or not cannot of course be affected by the fact that Mr Burns was in the event content to send out the net asset statements as he was asked to without any very detailed investigation.  I therefore find that Mr Holyoake was not in breach of the net asset statement obligation in failing to provide one which Gerard Edelman was prepared to accept liability for. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Wells in his evidence made much of the contention that the net asset statement provision in the Loan Agreement was a <span style="font-style:italic">“Trojan horse” </span>clause that was impossible to comply with, such that Mr Holyoake would inevitably be in breach and that he was being set up to fail.  This was primarily based on the word <span style="font-style:italic">“certifying”</span> and Mr Williams’ contention that this required the certifier to accept a direct liability to CPC.  I have already said that I do not accept this contention.  I accept that it was perhaps unlikely that a firm of accountants – or a firm of lawyers or a bank – would agree to accept direct liability to CPC, and even more unlikely that they would be prepared to do so within 5 days.  It is noticeable that when Mr Wells asked Mr Williams for an example of a certified net asset statement he did not provide one, and in fact he confirmed in evidence that he had never seen one, although he had seen a certified statement of affairs for a company.  But I am not persuaded that this was something that was deliberately designed as a trap, nor do I accept, as Mr Stewart asked me to, that this construction was being advanced improperly in the knowledge that it was impossible for Mr Holyoake to comply.  What the documents show is that it was agreed on the telephone call which Mr Holyoake joined after 16.58 that he provide a net asset statement signed by a reputable auditor/lawyer/bank, and Mr Gayle then circulated a third draft of the loan agreement at 19.51 which contained such a provision, including the word <span style="font-style:italic">“certifying”</span>.  Mr Williams’ evidence was that it was he who wanted the net asset statement backed up by somebody else and he wanted that person to be a professional and for it to be certified, and that he did not think it would be difficult to get a professional sign-off from someone who knew his affairs intimately.  I accept this evidence, which seems to be both consistent with the documents and inherently credible. </p>

Mr Christian Candy’s evidence was that he thought at the time of the loan that Mr Holyoake was worth some £200m, that he knew he was an immensely wealthy man through British Seafoods and had taken a substantial hit after British Seafoods, and that the source of his information was his brother.  Mr Nicholas Candy said he thought Mr Holyoake had told him that he was worth about that, but was very vague about it.  Mr Williams too said he was under the impression that Mr Holyoake was worth £200m, but was unclear whether this was something Mr Holyoake had told them or not.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I am sceptical of this rather vague evidence, which is not supported by any contemporary documents.  What can be demonstrated from the documents is that on 7 November 2011 Mr Christian Candy e-mailed both his brother and Mr Williams to pass on what Mr Pym had told him over the weekend when they were having a drink at a hotel in Paris, probably in the early evening of Saturday 5 November, Mr Candy having taken Mr Pym and various other guests to Paris for the weekend to celebrate his wife’s birthday.  What Mr Candy said in his e-mail was that Mr Pym had told him that Mr Holyoake was worth £400m pre British Seafoods, and <span style="font-style:italic">“is worth £200m now”</span> and that he had put assets in trust in Hong Kong.  That is not quite how Mr Pym reported the same conversation to Mr Holyoake the previous day, which was that he had said that <span style="font-style:italic">“I had full oversight on your assets which were in excess of £250MM, of which the majority were held in Trust!  He took it on board!”</span>.  (The reference to a </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">trust in this conversation, attested to by both accounts, was unexplained: there are various other references to a trust scattered through the documents, but neither side explored them in evidence.)  Mr Pym’s evidence about this conversation was in general very unimpressive and unconvincing, he being unable to explain either how he came to claim full oversight over Mr Holyoake’s assets, or what the £250m figure was based on, or what he meant by his explanation marks, which on at least one interpretation suggest he knew he was pulling the wool over Mr Candy’s eyes.  Nevertheless this conversation, as reported by Mr Candy, is I think likely to be the source of the idea that Mr Holyoake was worth £200m, and I am very doubtful if Mr Candy or his brother or Mr Williams really thought on 12 October that Mr Holyoake was worth £200m.  Mr Williams also said that Mr Holyoake gave the impression that the £120m figure was not a hurdle; that I think is more likely to be an accurate recollection.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I think it likely that none of them really knew what he was worth or quite what his wealth consisted of: there is an e-mail of Mr Christian Candy to his brother of 20 October in which he says that Mr Holyoake was due to send them his net asset statement that day and adds <span style="font-style:italic">“Will make an interesting read”</span>, to which his brother replied <span style="font-style:italic">“Very”</span>.  And despite Mr Pym’s belief that Mr Christian Candy had taken on board what he told him, by 7 November neither brother thought he was worth anything like £200m – Mr Nicholas Candy’s reaction to his brother’s account of what Mr Pym had said was that he did not think Mr Holyoake was worth £100m, to which Mr Christian Candy replied that he thought he was worth a maximum of £75m.  That was said after they had seen his net asset statement at just over £120m, but there is no hint that they had very recently believed he was worth nearly twice that.      </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not therefore accept that Mr Christian Candy or CPC believed at the time of the loan that Mr Holyoake was worth £200m.  However that does not mean that he or they expected or intended him to fail the £120m covenant.  By the early afternoon of 12 October (UK time) Mr Candy had calculated the interest payable over 2 years at £5.28m, equivalent to an annual interest rate of 22%, and circulated the figures, saying to Mr Tim Dean of CPC, who was with him in LA, that he would talk him through this at breakfast.  He later queried why Mr Holyoake was being given 6 months before CPC obtained security, and was told by Mr David that the 6 months was driven by Mr Holyoake taking a dividend out of one of his companies and that Mr Holyoake had suggested 6 months so as to resolve this.  On 13 October, after completion of the loan, Mr Christian Candy sent his brother an e-mail to the effect that Mr Holyoake intended to repay the loan in full in February 2012, which would be a £5.28m profit, saying <span style="font-style:italic">“If this happens it is an off the scale deal”</span>.  On 26 October, he circulated an internal e-mail passing on the information (which he had probably got from Mr Pym whom he had seen the previous evening) that Mr Holyoake thought he had paid over the odds for the loan, to which he added the comment <span style="font-style:italic">“No shit Sherlock!!!”</span>.  I conclude from all this that Mr Candy at the time of the loan thought that the returns Mr Holyoake was offering, simply in terms of interest and even without taking into account the profit share, were very attractive, even if the interest was paid at the end of 2 years, and very much more so if the loan was repaid in full in the spring of 2012.  That sufficiently explains why he was keen on CPC doing the loan, and it is not necessary to assume that he went into the loan intending Mr </p>

I have already referred to his response to Mr Smith on 18 October that if Mr Holyoake did not comply with his obligations in relation to the deliverables he would enforce the loan and take him to court.  Mr Wells in his oral evidence said that he thought the deal was between friends, and that was not how friends behave: what friends would do is have a conversation and agree that the net asset requirement was too high and reduce it to say £90m.  I think it is a fair comment that Mr Christian Candy did not treat Mr Holyoake in any way like a friend.  Mr Candy was well aware that in strictly enforcing CPC’s contractual rights, Mr Holyoake might think he was being anything but friendly – he sent an e-mail to his brother on 2 November, forwarding one of Mr Williams’ e-mails where he was pressing Mr Wells on what the certification requirement meant, with the comment <span style="font-style:italic">“At some point, MH will piss in your ear about us pressurising him”</span>, a phrase that he explained as meaning bleating or complaining without any foundation.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"> Mr Candy said in evidence that what he meant by that was using pressure to obtain a compliant net asset statement, and that by pressure, he meant legal, contractual legitimate pressure.  He denied that what he meant was seeking to use the net asset statement to assert that Mr Holyoake was in breach.   But I think that was exactly what he was thinking of.  He would get Mr Williams to press for a compliant net asset statement, but by this stage I think Mr Candy believed that Mr Holyoake would be unlikely to be able to show net assets of £120m, and thought he could then use that to his advantage.   I have already referred to the fact that he did not believe Mr Pym’s assertion that he was worth £250m or £200m, and told his brother on 7 November that he thought Mr Holyoake was worth £75m at a maximum; on 10 November CPC had had Mr Holyoake’s second attempt at a compliant net asset statement (the November statement) which Mr Williams was still not happy with; then on 11 November there had been a telephone call to discuss it between Mr Williams, Mr Christian Candy, Mr Wells and Mr Holyoake in which Mr Wells and Mr Holyoake agreed to provide further information on Mr Holyoake’s properties and on ISI, a call that Mr Candy described in an e-mail sent to his brother that evening as <span style="font-style:italic">“uncomfortable”</span>.  I infer that Mr Candy was not reassured and that by 18 November he was very doubtful if Mr Holyoake would be able to provide a net asset statement that he and Mr Williams would regard as compliant.  When therefore he referred to applying pressure on the net asset statement, I consider he was not referring so much to getting a compliant net asset statement but to taking advantage of the fact that Mr Holyoake would be unable to comply, and that he was already contemplating calling default on the loan.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">None of this however establishes, and I am not prepared to infer, that when the Loan Agreement was drafted and agreed Mr Candy was expecting Mr Holyoake to fail the net asset covenant provision and setting him up to fail.  Rather what it illustrates is Mr Candy’s readiness to exploit the provisions of a contract.  His own description of himself was that he was a <span style="font-style:italic">“candid and tough”</span> businessman; and his brother gave evidence that he was a <span style="font-style:italic">“very firm”</span> businessman, very candid, to the point, a bit too much so even for him, and that <span style="font-style:italic">“if you sign a contract with my brother, he expects it to be obeyed”</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Candy was asked about his e-mails.   He was initially asked on Day 17 (2 March 2017) before the late disclosure about the heliport.  He accepted that he knew that his brother’s suggestion at 08.30 that <span style="font-style:italic">“we need to tell Investec this week”</span> was a lie, and that his own e-mail at 09.50 that <span style="font-style:italic">“we need to provide them our net asset statement before Thursday”</span> was a lie and one that he made deliberately to put pressure on Mr Holyoake, but maintained persistently that the lie was simply that he shortened the period when the net asset statement would have to be provided from two weeks to two days.  He refused to accept that there was anything wrong with the statements (at 07.22) that <span style="font-style:italic">“Investec will want the CPC Group net asset statement…they will find out one way or another in the next couple of weeks”</span> and (at 08.25) that <span style="font-style:italic">“I can tell you now that we have to provide CPC’s net asset statement”</span>, although he sought to justify them by saying repeatedly that Investec would have seen CPC’s balance sheet <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> CPC were to progress the transaction, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> they were to proceed with the heliport, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> the transaction was to proceed, <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>there were going to be further discussions regarding the heliport.

Mr Candy refused to accept that he had fabricated anything other than shortening the period from two weeks to two days; and reiterated that if CPC were looking to acquire the heliport, something which was under consideration, then they would have asked Investec for finance.  In fact it was clear from Mr Currie’s evidence that although Investec might well have been willing to lend to CPC if CPC had wished to acquire the heliport, they were not in a position to match the rates which CPC could borrow at elsewhere, and it is highly unlikely that CPC would have financed the acquisition through Investec. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I was very unimpressed with Mr Candy’s evidence on this aspect of this case.  There is a significant difference between what he was telling Mr Holyoake – namely that CPC were actually intending to do a substantial deal with Investec which would involve disclosing its assets and liabilities – and what he suggested in the witness box – that they were still considering it and would have sought finance from Investec if they had gone ahead; and an even greater difference between what he was telling Mr Holyoake and the reality, which was that on 8 November CPC had no plans to acquire the heliport, there was no question of seeking finance from Investec, and there was no imminent likelihood of having to disclose financial information to them.  I am entirely satisfied that Mr Candy’s statements were a pretence designed to put pressure on Mr Holyoake.  Mr Candy took advantage of the coincidence that Mr Currie had approached his brother about the heliport, and that there was a meeting between Investec and his brother fixed for 10 November, to put forward, and then embellish, this concocted story.  He did so because he thought that Mr Holyoake was hiding something from him.  He was right about that as Mr Holyoake was concealing the Oscarone loan from him, but this does not justify the series of lies.  And when he came to give evidence, despite his protestation that if he had lied he would stand up and admit it, he was only in fact willing to admit to shortening the timescale, and tried to gloss over the wider pretence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Nicholas Candy was also asked about these e-mails.  He too refused to accept that his brother had lied in any respect other than shortening the time period from two weeks to two days.  I found his evidence on this part of the case very weak.  It was he who suggested at 08.30 that his brother tell Mr Holyoake they were working on a big deal with Investec, and I find this was untrue and known by him to be untrue.  In oral evidence he attempted to justify it by reference to other matters he discussed with Mr Kantor (Omni, and Investec’s relationship with CPC and C&amp;C generally); but leaving aside the fact that he had not had his meeting with Mr Kantor by 8 November, it was in any event only an exploratory meeting to discuss business generally (Mr Currie confirming that Investec had not to date done any business with the Candys) and the difficulty with this explanation is that Mr Nicholas Candy’s e-mail quite clearly refers to a specific transaction, not to the sort of business that Investec could do with the Candys generally.  Mr Nicholas Candy also said in evidence that at the meeting with Mr Kantor they would have discussed the heliport briefly.  That I can accept, and Mr Currie said in evidence that he would have taken the opportunity to mention the heliport in front of Mr Kantor, and Mr Nicholas Candy was still quite keen on the heliport – indeed he said in the witness box that he thought to this day that they had missed out on the deal.  But that is not the same as CPC having decided to acquire it, and for reasons already given I am satisfied they had not.  Yet Mr Nicholas Candy participated in a telephone discussion with his brother and Mr Williams the result of which was Mr Christian Candy’s e-mail of 09.50 in which the story was that Investec were <span style="font-style:italic">“selling a large asset that CPC is looking to acquire and also finance through Investec”</span>, which could only be a reference to the heliport; and it is very likely (and I find) that it was agreed on that telephone call to put this story forward even though it was not true. </p>

That naturally undermines the extent to which I can have confidence in their evidence, and as a result I have approached the remainder of their evidence with some caution.   </p>

And the content of his very first e-mail (at 06.01) suggests that Mr Holyoake had indeed told him that Investec did not know about the CPC loan and thought he was doing the equity himself, as Mr Candy could only have got that information from Mr Holyoake.     </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I conclude that it is probable that when Mr Holyoake approached the Candy brothers for a loan, he did explain that he was buying GGH with a loan from Investec of £24m and did tell them that Investec did not know of this approach and thought he was doing the equity himself.  That accords with what Mr Holyoake said in his first response at 07.13 (that he was <span style="font-style:italic">“very clear prior to taking the loan that Investec were NOT aware”</span>), and in his e-mail of 08.49 (<span style="font-style:italic">“as we discussed prior to the loan I had not informed them”</span>).  It follows, and I also find, that Mr Candy knew when he sent his e-mail of 06.01 that Mr Holyoake had not told Investec about the CPC loan, and that he was being somewhat disingenuous in asking it as a question (<span style="font-style:italic">“Am I correct in saying…?”</span>).  He suggested in evidence that it was the fact that Mr Holyoake had not put the £12m loan on his net asset statement for CPC that had made him think he had not told Investec about the £12m loan either, as he was aware that Mr Holyoake had also provided a net asset statement to Investec.  That was an unconvincing explanation, firstly because Mr Holyoake would be likely to have provided his net asset statement to Investec some time before he had approached the Candys for a loan, and secondly because leaving the £12m loan off the net asset statement provided to CPC could not be said to be a concealment of anything (as CPC of course knew about the loan) and the inference that he had concealed it from Investec does not follow.  I do not accept this explanation, or Mr Candy’s evidence that this was the genesis of his e-mail and that he was genuinely unsure whether Mr Holyoake had or had not told Investec.  I find that he knew that Mr Holyoake had not.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I am in left in considerably more doubt whether Mr Holyoake specifically asked the Candys not to tell Investec.  Mr Holyoake undoubtedly had very good reason to want to keep the CPC loan a private matter between himself and the Candys.  First, there was a serious and obvious risk that if CPC talked to Investec, they would discover the existence of the Oscarone loan; Investec knew all about the Oscarone loan, and indeed had entered into a lengthy Intercreditor Deed with Oscarone containing detailed provisions regulating priorities between them.  That is no doubt what Mr Holyoake was referring to by <span style="font-style:italic">“ran/yaser issues”</span> in his e-mail of 08.13 to Mr Pym.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, just as Mr Holyoake had led CPC to believe that they were in effect the mezzanine piece in his deal (and he was providing the rest of the equity himself), he had also led Investec to believe that the only lenders were Investec and Oscarone, and </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">he was providing the balance himself, as indeed Mr Candy had referred to in his e-mail of 06.01.  Back in June, Mr Arnst of Investec had asked him where the cash equity requirement was coming from, and he had replied suggesting that he was contemplating a combination of a dividend from ISI and some equity release from one of his properties, although he did say that he might sell down a minority percentage of the deal (less than 25%).  That would have led Investec to think he was proposing to fund at least the greater part of the equity himself.  Then on the afternoon of 11 October, once it had become apparent, despite Mr Holyoake’s assurances about transfer of funds, that completion was not going to take place that day, Mr Brooks of Investec asked Mr Holyoake and Mr Saunders to confirm that it was Mr Holyoake’s intention to fund the acquisition of GGH with the £24m senior facility and Oscarone and no other lenders, and Mr Saunders replied that it was indeed Mr Holyoake’s and Hotblack’s intention to fund the acquisition of GGH with the £24m senior debt facility and the Oscarone junior facility and that <span style="font-style:italic">“There is no other lender”</span>.   That may have been strictly true on the afternoon of 11 October, but there is nothing to suggest it was ever corrected.  The likelihood is therefore that Investec continued to believe that Mr Holyoake had completed the acquisition of GGH without borrowing money, and had financed the amount needed over and above the Investec and Oscarone loans himself.  That, rather than (as he suggested in his e-mail of 12.56) the generous returns he had offered, is no doubt why he was so concerned about Mr Candy’s threat to approach Investec and why he referred to it in his e-mails to Mr Pym as something that would <span style="font-style:italic">“ruin my relationship”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“screw me big time”</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">So Mr Holyoake had powerful motives for wanting CPC to keep the loan confidential.  But he did ask for the terms of the loan to be confidential (in his e-mail of 12 October at 20.07), and a confidentiality clause was negotiated in some detail and agreed, and the Loan Agreement as executed was marked <span style="font-style:italic">“Private &amp; Confidential”</span> on its title page.  That was sufficient for his purposes: he did not need to go on and get CPC to agree specifically not to tell Investec.  There is some force in Mr Candy’s point that if Mr Holyoake had specifically said he did not want CPC disclosing the loan to Investec, it would have been a red flag to him.  Mr Williams said much the same.  In all the circumstances I am not persuaded that Mr Holyoake did say this; what I find he said, and secured agreement to, was that the Loan Agreement should be private and confidential to the parties, subject to the terms of the confidentiality clause. </p>

Mr Lord said that the loan cannot have been intended to be confidential from Investec, as it was entirely standard for lenders in the same capital stack to talk to each other; but I do not think that can displace the agreement that the Loan Agreement be private and confidential.  Mr Lord referred to cl 10.1(e)(2) under which Saunders Bearman were to confirm that all requisite Authorisations, including from Investec, had been obtained to enable the Declarations of Trust to be granted; but this clause permitted Saunders Bearman in the alternative to confirm that the Declarations of Trust would not be in conflict with any existing agreements (which is what Saunders Bearman did) so this clause did not make it inevitable that Investec would be approached for their consent.

That could only be displaced if the circumstances could be brought within the terms of the confidentiality clause, which was clause 20.

Mr Williams’ evidence (which was not challenged, and which I accept) was that Mr Holyoake had claimed in the telephone call that the charges were old and defunct, and that the debt to 3i had been discharged.

Mr Christian Candy told his colleagues that he was confident Mr Holyoake would repay, and Mr Nicholas Candy also thought he would repay.  Others in CPC were more doubtful – indeed Mr Smith had been very sceptical about the loan from the outset, and Mr Christian Candy bet him £10,000 that Mr Holyoake would repay £17m by the end of March at the latest.  Mr Holyoake however, as he accepted in oral evidence, had no intention of paying £22.74m by the end of January; he thought that Mr Candy was greedy and that for CPC to almost double their money in three months was farcical.  He decided to play along with it in order to buy himself time, his strategy being to offer them something between £12m and £15m (in the event £13.5m, which he regarded as giving them a generous return, £1.5m in 3 months on a loan of £12m being the equivalent of a 40% return per annum) and then negotiate anything else.  He was reluctant in oral evidence to accept that he was deceiving CPC, preferring to describe it as playing them at their own game, but he did accept that he was telling them that he would repay £22.74m by the end of January when the reality was that it was not going to happen.

I do not find these allegations proved.  The e-mails in January show Mr Candy repeatedly asking Mr Holyoake to confirm that he would repay the loan by the end of January, but since this was what Mr Holyoake was himself promising, I do not think it is right to characterise them as insistent and aggressive demands.  They also show that Mr Candy made it clear, for example in an e-mail of 11 January and again in e-mails on the morning of 31 January, that if repayment were not made CPC would be seeking to put charges on </p>

Mr Holyoake was very resistant to the idea of granting security, and this exchange was no doubt a threat, and designed to put pressure on Mr Holyoake to ensure that he did make the repayment he had promised (Mr Candy himself said in an internal e-mail with reference to this exchange <span style="font-style:italic">“Things are hotting up.  We need to be careful [we means I] that we do not push him too far.  Just enough pressure is what is required.”</span>) but I do not see that it was unduly aggressive or insistent.</p>

It took less than half an hour as it was over by 18.54.

Mr Candy explained, and I accept, that having been confident that Mr Holyoake would repay at the end of January, he was now seriously worried about not being repaid at all and losing the entire £12m.

If payment was not made by 4pm on 6 February, CPC reserved the right to take enforcement action including issuing proceedings for a money judgment, petitioning for Mr Holyoake’s bankruptcy, seeking to enter a restriction on GGH at the Land Registry to protect CPC’s interest under the Hotblack Declaration of Trust, and seeking a transfer and then sale of the shares held in trust under the Holyoake Declaration of Trust.</p>

As to the first, the Declarations of Trust are admittedly not well thought out or drafted because it makes no sense for CPC to be entitled to a beneficial interest in 30% of “the Property” (that is the freehold of GGH, implicitly in the original Declaration and expressly by the Deed of Amendment) and in addition 30% of the shareholding in Hotblack (which if taken literally would mean CPC would be entitled to 30% of GGH and 30% of the value of Hotblack’s remaining 70% of GGH).  It is tolerably clear however from reading the two together that the intention was that CPC should receive its share (30% of the net profits with a minimum of £10m) either under the Hotblack Declaration of Trust if there were a sale of GGH, or under the Holyoake Declaration of Trust if the shares in Hotblack (as distinct from GGH) were sold, but not both; or in other words that the two Declarations of Trust were intended to provide money for CPC in the alternative not cumulatively.  And if there were any doubt about that, the e-mails of 12 October make it clear that CPC was intended to have one minimum sum of £10m not two, and if necessary the Declarations of Trust could doubtless have been rectified accordingly.  So I accept that the claim to a minimum of £20m was not well-founded and would never have succeeded.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Candy was asked about this.  He accepted that the claim for £20m was a mistake and it should have been £10m, although he suggested that he did not know that at the time, and said that Wragges had advised that on one interpretation the minimum sum payable could have been £20m.  Mr Williams was also asked about it.  He accepted that his personal understanding of the deal was that CPC would be entitled to a minimum not of £20m but £10m, but said they were advised that the declarations of trust worked that way, and if you are making a claim you put your best foot forward and if there is a legal construct that says <span style="font-style:italic">“Actually that is 20 not 10” </span>you go <span style="font-style:italic">“Great”</span>.  I find on this material that both Mr Candy and Mr Williams knew at the time that what had been agreed on 12 October with Mr Holyoake was a minimum of £10m (I do not think Mr Candy would have forgotten this), but that Wragges advised that a legally tenable argument could be put forward that the minimum sum was £20m, and they were happy for such an argument to be advanced.  That might be thought a bit sharp – opportunistic was Mr Stewart’s word – but however commercially questionable, I doubt if advancing a claim that you have been advised is legally sustainable is by itself an unlawful thing to do.  In any event there was no question of the minimum sum, be it £10m or £20m, being then payable, and Wragges were not demanding payment of the £20m but reserving CPC’s rights to it; Mr Holyoake was advised to seek (and did seek) legal advice; and Mr Holyoake made no mention in his witness statement of this assertion being something that concerned him.  The contention does not appear to have been raised again, and I do not think it had any significant impact at all.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Stewart submitted that CPC knew very well that its debt was disputed and hence that it would have been an abuse of process to serve a statutory demand in these circumstances.  I am not sure about that.  The question is not whether Mr Holyoake disputed the breaches, but whether there was anything of substance in the dispute.  I accept that the question whether Mr Holyoake was in breach of the net asset provisions (the Minimum Net Asset covenant and the provision of a sufficient net asset statement) would have been the subject of a substantial dispute.  But Wragges also relied on the granting of the Aeriance charges as being a breach of the negative pledge in cl 10.1(f).  Here there was no dispute of fact, as there is no doubt that charges had been granted over the relevant properties.  The only defence Mr Holyoake had was an argument that the clause did not bite as Additional Property was defined to mean one or more properties chosen by CPC from the Additional Property List (being the list of properties included in Mr Holyoake’s net asset statement), and CPC had not actually made such a choice.  That was an argument that was identified by Collyer Bristow when Mr Holyoake consulted them after receiving the letter (as appears from Mr Holyoake’s e-mail exchange with them on 13 February 2012 which records advice to that effect from Mr Stephen Gawne of Collyer Bristow).  I can see that that is a possible interpretation of the Loan Agreement based on the literal wording, but I have serious doubts whether it is the correct construction as it would seem to lead to a commercially nonsensical result, the purpose of the negative pledge provision being fairly self-evidently to protect CPC against any further erosion of the equity in the properties which made up the Additional Property List.  But I do not propose to resolve this question of construction: for present purposes, what is significant is that there is nothing to suggest that this point had been articulated before Wragges wrote their letter of 2 February or that they knew that this point was going to be raised.  I am therefore not persuaded that Wragges threatened bankruptcy proceedings in the knowledge that there was a genuine and substantial dispute that there had been an Event of Default and the loan was due.  In any event one of the purposes of a letter before action such as this one is to give the proposed defendant an opportunity to explain why he is not liable, and if Wragges had received a reasoned argument why the loan was not due, they would no doubt have considered with CPC whether bankruptcy was in fact appropriate.   </p>

Under the Insolvency Rules (then rule 4.11 of the 1986 Rules) a petitioner is obliged, unless the Court otherwise directs, to advertise the petition in the Gazette, but the advertisement cannot appear less than 7 business days after service of the petition.  That period of 7 days has been said to be to allow the company to consider its position generally with regard to the petition, thereby giving it an opportunity to either discharge the debt if it is not disputed, or apply to restrain advertisement of the petition if it is disputed, and to consider, for example, applying for relief under s. 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986: see <span style="font-style:italic">re Bill Hennessy Associates Ltd</span> [1992] BCC 386 per HHJ Bromley QC (sitting as a High Court Judge), referring to what Slade J had said in <span style="font-style:italic">re Signland Ltd</span> [1982] 2 AER 609.

Neither answer seems to me at all surprising and I accept this evidence.  I do not consider that they are shown to have done anything other than leave it to Wragges to identify the steps that might be taken, and I find they had no reason to think that Wragges were suggesting anything improper.  The threat does not appear to have ever been repeated, and indeed when CPC did resort to litigation (as it did on four occasions, detailed below), it did not serve a statutory demand or seek to make Mr Holyoake bankrupt, but issued claim forms. </p>

Mr Candy did make some reference to Mrs Holyoake at the meeting.  I accept that this was in the context of saying how stressful the situation was for everyone – for Mr Candy, for Mr Holyoake and for his wife.  Mr Candy also said something along the lines that he would not want anything to happen to her.  I am not persuaded that he made specific reference to her being pregnant, as I accept Mr Williams’ evidence that he got the impression Mr Candy and Mr Holyoake knew something he did not.  But Mr Candy knew that she was pregnant, and knew that she had had a miscarriage the year before, and in the context that could only be, and was understood to be, a reference to her condition.  On the other hand, I am not persuaded that he said it in a threatening or menacing way, or was threatening to do anything in particular.  He had been pointing out that unless Mr Holyoake and CPC could reach agreement on a way forward, the alternative would be disastrous for him as CPC would have to take steps to enforce the loan, taking a wrecking ball to his assets, and leave him with nothing, and in that context I find that he was referring to the fact that it would inevitably be immensely stressful for him and his wife.  He may indeed, as Mr Williams said, have said it in an empathetic or compassionate tone.  Nevertheless it was I think an illjudged and insensitive thing to say.  </p>

According to his e-mail no 4 of 16 April to Collyer Bristow he had already told his wife about the Wragges letter because of the threat it contained to inform the media and because he did not want her finding out about the dispute from some third party; that had upset her and she had worried about the impact of stress on the baby.  So the idea that fighting CPC might be stressful for her in her condition was something that he was already well aware of.  That I think is why he did not mention it specifically to Mr Gould on 13 February, and I accept that the fact that he himself referred to his wife’s pregnancy in the e-mail of 14 March suggests that he did not regard that as crossing an impermissible line.     </p>

One is that Mr Candy said that if Mr Holyoake did not sign the Supplemental Loan Agreement, CPC would <span style="font-style:italic">“nuclear bomb him”</span>, a phrase which Mr Candy denied.  But it was not in dispute that both sides talked about the <span style="font-style:italic">“nuclear option”</span> which meant CPC enforcing its demands by litigation.

Mr Christian Candy explained what was meant by it – if CPC had to litigate it would cause both parties, both Mr Holyoake and CPC, to lose money so it would be mutually destructive.  I think it probable that in the period between the meeting and the signing of the Supplemental Loan Agreement CPC (that is Mr Candy or Mr Williams) reiterated what had been said at the meeting, namely that the choice facing Mr Holyoake was to sign the agreement as drafted or face the nuclear option of litigation.   </p>

Mr Williams remembered mention of Investec at the Guernsey meeting, and Mr Christian Candy accepted that he may have said that he would call Investec.  In fact it is clear from internal e-mails that CPC were at that stage considering contacting Investec, not in order to persuade Investec to call default under its loan, but so that CPC could take over Investec’s position, either by taking an assignment of its loan and security, or by paying off Investec.  Mr Smith in particular was keen to pursue this, saying in an e-mail of 9 February (to both Candy brothers and Mr Williams): </p>

Mr Candy said in oral evidence that Ibiza was not on any view sufficient security for the £17.74m, and it would be a difficult asset to sell, so you would need further security other than just Ibiza; he also explained that GGH was the only meaningful asset on the net asset statement as CPC did not want the Icelandic Seafood business, and Mr Holyoake had refinanced a lot of his assets through Aeriance.  </p>

Mr Nicholas Candy had had lunch with Mr Sharpe-Neal of Savills on 9 February who told him that they had valued it for Citibank at circa €16m (for both the house and the additional land), and that Mr Holyoake did not go with the Savills valuation and got another valuer (Jones Lang LaSalle or <span style="font-weight:bold">“JLL”</span>) to do it who came in at €25m.  Mr Sharpe-Neal agreed to provide a copy of the valuation to Mr Candy, and later did so.  Mr Christian Candy, Mr Nicholas Candy, Mr Williams and Mr Smith all accepted that it was improper and wrong for CPC to have obtained the valuation in breach of confidence.  I should make it clear that I have not heard any explanation from Mr Sharpe-Neal or Savills, and they are of course not parties to these proceedings and I am not to be taken as deciding anything that affects them, but it follows that it is common ground between the parties to these proceedings that Mr Sharpe-Neal should not have disclosed the valuation to CPC.

First, that Mr Holyoake was coerced into it by threats directed at his and his family’s welfare (duress to the person).  If one puts on one side the remark about his wife, I do not see that anything said at or after the Guernsey meeting was directed in any way at Mr Holyoake’s or his family’s physical safety.  The references to ruining his life and the like are all directed at his economic wellbeing.  No doubt if he ended up being made bankrupt or losing all his assets that would have a profound effect on his family’s way of life and comfort, but I do not see that that can be equated with a physical threat.  Nor do I think that what Mr Candy said about his wife amounted to duress to the person.  It was not a threat to do anything to her.  It was a reference, however ill-judged and insensitive, to what the consequences might be if agreement could not be reached and litigation ensued.  I conclude that the agreement was not voidable for duress to the person. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, Mr Stewart relied on threats and pressure against Mr Holyoake’s economic and financial position, which he said amounted to economic duress.  Mr Holyoake was indeed threatened with financial ruin if he did not agree.  But one needs to retain a sense of reality.  The alternative facing Mr Holyoake if he did not agree to the terms CPC wanted was that CPC, who had no security for the loan and no reason to believe that he would repay voluntarily, would be left with no real alternative but to commence proceedings against him, either seeking to bankrupt him or to obtain judgment on the loan.  Mr Holyoake had advice from Collyer Bristow, on the basis of which he might have been able to resist any immediate move to make him bankrupt; but that would mean that he would become embroiled in litigation under the Loan Agreement.  As he himself explained, once proceedings are issued in relation to a property transaction, the property and the funding for the project are normally ruined – litigation creates a <span style="font-style:italic">“smell”</span> around the property which puts off buyers.

So what he was concerned about was that litigation might destroy any value in GGH, which would make it impossible for him to raise money on it; but he would still have a personal liability (for both the loan and the £10m minimum profit share) to CPC.  He was very clear in his oral evidence that it was this risk of both losing his largest asset and still being personally liable to CPC that made him agree to CPC’s terms rather than face litigation, which he regarded as potentially ruinous for him.   </p>

Because I couldn't guarantee I could protect the asset but I could guarantee that if I failed to protect the asset they would come after me nonetheless for the money and therefore I would have lost my largest asset, the asset that was going to repay them and I would have lost therefore a lot of the other assets, including my home potentially, that were on my personal liabilities – as a result of my personal liability to them.”  </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Signing the Supplemental Loan Agreement meant Mr Holyoake giving up the argument that he was not in breach, and accepting that £17.74m was due, as well as agreeing to give security over the Ibiza property.  Those were undoubtedly things he was reluctant to do.  But he did so in return for obtaining more time to raise money on GGH to pay off CPC rather than facing the immediate prospect of litigation.  I find that the critical factor in his decision to sign the Supplemental Loan Agreement was the threat of litigation and the consequences which he saw that as entailing.  That means the substantive question is whether CPC were justified in threatening to bring proceedings against him.  The essence of economic duress is the use of illegitimate pressure: I do not see that it can amount to economic duress for a creditor who believes that he has an accrued cause of action against a debtor to threaten to bring proceedings, even if the result is likely to be disastrous for the debtor, and even if the creditor spells out in strong language why it will be disastrous.  In fact in the present case I have already concluded that Mr Holyoake was in default under the Loan Agreement, and it must follow that CPC were entitled to bring proceedings.  If they were entitled to bring them, they were entitled to threaten to bring them.   </p>

Matters such as whether CPC would ring up his lenders and try and ruin him, or the threat in Wragges’ letter to advertise a statutory demand did not in my judgment make any significant difference: the effective cause of Mr Holyoake’s decision was the threat of litigation.  Proceedings of course cannot usually be kept secret, and it is noticeable that Mr Holyoake himself anticipated that if proceedings had been brought that would have become common knowledge in the property world: that seems entirely probable given the evidence I heard, which was to the effect that the London property market is very gossipy.  That means that any proceedings would be likely to come to the attention of Investec.  Since it was an event of default under the Investec facility for any litigation to be brought against any Obligor (which included Mr Holyoake) that would have entitled Investec to call a default under that facility and sell GGH under its powers as chargee.  That is no doubt what Mr Holyoake had in mind when he referred to the backstop position being that the bank would probably have enough of two parties fighting and to his not being able to protect the asset.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The third matter relied on by Mr Stewart was CPC’s threatened approach to Investec on 8 November 2011, the effect of which was to make Mr Holyoake concerned to remove CPC from the project as soon as he could.  I accept that Mr Holyoake’s reaction to the threats on 8 November was to realise that CPC were not his friends, and that as a result he decided to try and repay them; but this was all past history by the time of the Supplemental Loan Agreement.  By then CPC had discovered the Aeriance charges, as a result of which it had caused Wragges to send the letter of claim and threaten proceedings.  And for the reasons I have just given, that would have been likely to lead to Investec discovering the position.  The threats made on 8 November did not in my view play any continuing part in Mr Holyoake’s decision to enter into the Supplemental Loan Agreement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">But Mr Holyoake was undoubtedly telling CPC that he would repay.  He had told Mr Nicholas Candy on 1 February that he was getting money from the Bank of China and HSBC, with the result that one of the items of information that Mr Williams asked him for in preparation for the meeting was evidence of <span style="font-style:italic">“the facility being arranged to repay the CPC loan (HSBC/Bank of China?)”</span>.  That caused him no little difficulty, but he did provide a copy of a revolving line of credit facility from Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd (albeit dating from September 2010, for €630m, and in favour of a borrower whose name he redacted).  On the face of it that had nothing to do with a facility to repay CPC, but Mr Holyoake described it as an existing facility which provided for the drawdown of funds, his requirements being only a very small part of the general funding available to others, and said he could discuss it further at the meeting.  After the Supplemental Loan Agreement had been signed, Mr Holyoake made a number of references to the imminent prospect of refinancing: on 14 February, in response to a question from Mr Williams whether there was any news from <span style="font-style:italic">“the East”</span>, he said that they would be proceeding that week, referring to a first tranche of £13.5m and a second tranche to follow; on 16 February he said that <span style="font-style:italic">“BofC”</span> (that is the Bank of China) had confirmed that they were meeting the next afternoon to finalise matters and the first £13.5m would be made early the next week; and on 20 February that it would now appear that they were going to receive the £13.5m tranche that month but not the £9.25m tranche.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I infer from this that what Mr Holyoake had told CPC at the meeting in Guernsey was that he was proposing to obtain the funds to repay CPC from some source associated with the Bank of China facility, and that it would come in two tranches, a first tranche of £13.5m and a second of £9.25m (together making up £22.75m).  That gets partial support from an undated manuscript note made by Mr Williams, which seems very likely to be a note made at the meeting in Guernsey, and which refers to a £22.5m facility to repay, described as <span style="font-style:italic">“Makmeti”</span> and with reference to a drawdown date of 31 January.  Mr Holyoake was in fact hoping to raise funds from a Mr Dmitry Chernyshev, whose corporate vehicle was Mekmetal, and it seems therefore that Mr Holyoake made some reference to this at the meeting. </p>

Since he also said (according to Mr Williams’ note) that he had liquidity of £4.5m, that would have been more than enough to repay not just the £17.74m but the £22.74m by 28 February.</p>

The Supplemental Loan Agreement required Mr Holyoake to procure charges over the shares (a first charge in the case of Blue Valley and a second charge in the case of Hollywell) by 13 February, and mortgages over the land (again a first mortgage in the case of the Blue Valley land and a second mortgage in the case of the Hollywell land) by 17 February.   </p>

That means it was a lie to say that the funds transfer had been activated or that Mr Holyoake was incurring two lots of interest. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Holyoake’s pleaded case is that Mr Candy spoke to him on the telephone on 1 March and told him (i) that CPC was not satisfied with security over the Ibiza property and wanted security over GGH as well; (ii) that he and CPC wanted to take over the Investec facility so that they could obtain full security over GGH; and (iii) that if Mr Holyoake executed the security over his home in Ibiza, Mr Candy would take possession of it and then take GGH too.  These are pleaded as threats.  Mr Lord in his closing submissions accepted that there was a call on that day (although this is not reflected in the e-mail traffic).  The content of the call was not however explored in evidence with Mr Candy.  That makes it difficult to assess whether any of these things were said at all.  I am rather doubtful about it – in an e-mail of 9 March, Mr Holyoake refers to having just had <span style="font-style:italic">“the proposal” </span>dropped on him in a call that morning, which I take to be the proposal to approach Investec to take over their position – but even if they were, I see nothing wrong with (i) or (ii) at all.  If they were said, they were no more than the truth, which was that CPC did regard the Ibiza property (over which it did not yet have security in any event) as inadequate, and did wish to obtain security over GGH by taking over the Investec position.  I do not see them as threats, but as an explanation of CPC’s position.  I think it highly unlikely that (iii) was said, as Mr Candy was at this stage still hoping to obtain security over the Ibiza villa, and to say this would only be likely to dissuade Mr Holyoake from giving it.   </p>

This is not an inference that can in my judgment be drawn.  All that can be demonstrated from the documentary record is as follows.  Mr Parsons was Chief Financial Officer of C&amp;C.  He was not, and never had been, a director of CPC, although he was a director of Omni.  On 8 March he invited a Mr Gilchrist to join him in a box at Cheltenham; Mr Gilchrist replied that he had been at an Investec lunch the previous day and was speaking with Mr Dobson, and had mentioned that <span style="font-style:italic">“you”</span> (that is Mr Parsons, or C&amp;C, or possibly Omni) might be interested in participating in some of their transactions, to which Mr Dobson had said that they were considering putting together a pool of preferred partners for such transactions and would welcome the chance to meet or discuss this with Mr Parsons.  On 9 March, when Mr Candy was planning to contact Investec, he wanted the name of someone appropriate to contact, and circulated an e-mail asking for the name of either Mr Holyoake’s contact, or someone senior.  Mr Parsons, who was one of those circulated, replied that the person he had been introduced to was Mr Dobson.  That was the context in which Mr Candy sent his e-mail to Mr Dobson at 14.08 referring to Mr Parsons having spoken to him.  As can be seen, there is no reason to suppose that Mr Parsons had been speaking to Mr Dobson about the CPC loan – he had been introduced to Mr Parsons so as to speak about participating in Investec’s transactions generally, and there is no trace in the documentary record of his being involved in the CPC loan at all.     </p>

In closing submissions Mr Stewart referred to this call as one where various threats were made against Mr Holyoake.  This appears to be an unpleaded allegation, and is also unparticularised, but one can see what Mr Candy actually said from Mr Wells’ note.  Four points in particular can be noted.  First, Mr Candy made it very clear that CPC intended to go to Investec to buy Investec’s debt.  He expected to get it by Friday (16 March); he said that in 5 days CPC would be their (senior) lender.  Mr Holyoake would not then hear from them, and he would have a breathing space until October.  Second, Mr Holyoake tried to interest him in a potential buyer that he said he had, but Mr Candy was not interested, saying that would take 3 weeks.  Mr Candy also said more than once that CPC did not itself want GGH.  Third, Mr Holyoake said that if he got the £13.5m to CPC, it was unfair for CPC to still go after his house as Mr Candy would have had his money back and still have his personal guarantee.  Mr Candy however said the issue was that CPC did not trust him, and he would still owe another £4m interest and the £10m profit share and they would want the house as well as the £13.5m.  Mr Holyoake said he did not want to wake up one night to find Mr Williams had taken the house; Mr Candy said they would not kick him out, and that he was safe in Ibiza.  Mr Candy thought Mr Holyoake would be able to sell GGH in October for between £45m and £80m with planning if he could not refinance.  As long as he sold for more than £52m there would not be a problem (the £52m presumably being made up of the £24m senior loan, the £17.74m and the £10m profit) but if he sold for less than £52m, then there would be an issue with the Ibiza property.  Fourth, there is an incomplete note of a statement by Mr Candy which reads: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not see in this any threats by Mr Candy to do anything unlawful.  What was suggested to him in cross-examination was that he was still using Investec as a threat to Mr Holyoake.  But what Mr Candy was actually telling Mr Holyoake he was going to do was to approach Investec to buy Investec’s debt.  That is not in itself unlawful and would not by itself necessarily involve the disclosure of CPC’s loan to Mr Holyoake.  It is possible that Mr Candy did say he would also do this (there is a note of Mr Candy referring to going to Investec <span style="font-style:italic">“with £12m tell with PG”</span>, which is incoherent as it stands but may refer to Mr Candy disclosing CPC’s £12m loan to Mr Holyoake personally); but this was not suggested to Mr Candy in cross-examination.  I am not going to find that he made a threat which is unpleaded, unparticularised and was never suggested to him, and was probably not unlawful anyway (see below).  Mr Candy also made it clear that CPC did want security over the Ibiza property, but this was something Mr Holyoake had agreed to give in the Supplemental Loan Agreement.  He also said that if CPC did not get what it wanted, it would resort to litigation and enforcement.  That may be a threat but is not unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Holyoake however did not want CPC talking to Investec.  This was no doubt out of a fear that Investec might disclose the Oscarone loan – indeed Mr Pym had on the night of 9/10 March sent him an e-mail in which he said that the concern was still Oscarone and that it was imperative to delay the call with Investec or somehow get agreement from them not to release the loan details.  On the morning of 12 March, after Mr Pym had sent his e-mail of 10.28 confirming that the funds were held to Mr Holyoake’s order, Mr Holyoake said he would cancel the Investec call.  Mr Candy replied that it would not be cancelled and if necessary CPC would go ahead on its own; until the monies were with Wragges CPC intended to proceed with the process of buying the Investec debt.  Mr Holyoake then sent an e-mail to Mr Austin at Investec effectively postponing the call.  He and Mr Candy spoke at about 12.45, after which Mr Candy e-mailed Mr Dobson apologising that the call had been postponed.  He said that the purpose of the call was to discuss GGH, that CPC was interested in acquiring the Investec and Topland debt of £24m and had been in discussions with Mr Holyoake about it, and that CPC’s preferred route was an assignment (with the alternative a loan repayment); and asked Investec to consider and revert to CPC.  Mr Dobson replied that Mr Arnst would pick this up.  Mr Candy then telephoned Mr Arnst and spoke to him briefly (the call lasted less than 10 minutes as Mr Arnst sent Mr Candy his telephone number at 14.51, and Mr Candy reported on the conversation to his brother, Mr Smith and Mr Williams at 15.00).  What Mr Candy reported was that Investec were keen to sell at full value and preferred the assignment route, and would revert by Wednesday (14 March).  He added: </p>

As to this, the e-mails from Mr Candy to Investec make no reference to CPC’s loan, but only to CPC wishing to take over the Investec facility.  There is no reason to doubt that Mr Candy only had the one telephone call, with Mr Arnst.  That call was very short, and Mr Candy’s account of it in his contemporaneous e-mail deals only with the question of CPC taking over the Investec facility and expressly says that he mentioned nothing about the issues CPC were having with Mr Holyoake.  It was not I think suggested to him in cross-examination that that was untrue.  It also receives confirmation from Mr Arnst.  Mr Arnst is now resident in Australia and was not called as a witness but the Claimants put in a statement from him under the Civil Evidence Act.  In that he says he recalled speaking with Mr Candy on around 13 March, that the purpose of the call was to talk about the Investec loan to Hotblack, that Mr Candy was told that the loan </p>

I am not sure he is right about CPC being told he could not discuss the loan – shortly afterwards Mr Candy got his PA to send Mr Arnst his telephone number and Mr Arnst said he would revert that week as soon as possible, which seems unlikely if he had declined to talk to CPC at all – but there is no reason to doubt what he says about there being no discussion about Mr Holyoake’s arrangements with CPC.

I think this may have been an uncharacteristic slip, and am rather doubtful if I am bound to accept a concession which is contrary to all the evidence, but I will assume that I am.  Even so, I do not think there would have been any, or any significant, breach of the Loan Agreement.  First, under cl 20(b)(iv), CPC was entitled to disclose any information relating to Mr Holyoake if it needed to disclose it for the protection of its rights under the agreement.  It seems to me that if Mr Candy had disclosed the existence of CPC’s loan to Investec, it could only have been because he thought he needed to do this in order to explain to Investec why CPC wanted to take over the Investec position; and CPC undoubtedly wanted to take over the Investec position in order to protect its rights to repayment under the Loan Agreement.  Second, quite apart from this, under cl 10.1(c) CPC was entitled to seek security by way of the Additional Property Charge if the £17.74m had not been paid by 12 March.  That would entitle CPC to seek a second charge on GGH (being one of the properties on the net asset statement), for which purpose it would have had to speak to Investec, and, as Mr Holyoake accepted in cross-examination, Investec would necessarily have learnt of the CPC loan and there would have been nothing unlawful in CPC speaking to Investec in that way at that stage.  Mr Holyoake may well be right that cl 10.1(c) only permitted CPC to approach Investec once there had been a failure to repay on 12 March; but on this footing, it was by the time Mr Candy spoke to Mr Arnst inevitable that Mr Holyoake would not pay the £17.74m that day – he was trying to negotiate terms for payment of £13.5m – and if Mr Candy did reveal the CPC loan to Mr Arnst, he at most anticipated by less than a day what he would have been entitled to do the next day.   </p>

Mr Pym’s oral evidence was that he was taken aback by how aggressive Mr Candy was; he had known Mr Candy a long time and Mr Candy had never been anything other than kind, generous and a good friend to him, whereas on this call Mr Candy made it clear that Mr Pym had to take sides and decide whether to side with Mr Holyoake or Mr Candy; that shocked Mr Pym as he was suddenly now being portrayed as the bad person in the scenario.  That evidence I found credible, not least because Mr Candy, as he himself said, was frustrated and disappointed that one of his best friends was fundamentally and categorically lying to him.  He had evidently come to the conclusion a long time before that he could not trust a word Mr Holyoake said, but I think it came as an unpleasant surprise that Mr Pym was prepared to back Mr </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">But in the end I do not think it ultimately matters whether what was said was in an aggressive tone or not.  What is significant is whether Mr Candy was threatening to do anything improper or unlawful.  Threats to sue Mr Holyoake, pursue him as vigorously as possible, make him bankrupt and thereby ruin him, however unpleasantly expressed, in whatever tone of voice and with whatever colourful language, are not in my judgment threats to do anything more than any creditor is entitled to do.  Nor do I think that vague expressions such as <span style="font-style:italic">“doing whatever it takes”</span> to get his money back, or preparing for the <span style="font-style:italic">“full weight of CPC to come down on him”</span> or destroying Mr Holyoake’s world and wiping him out are to be taken as threats to do anything unlawful: Mr Holyoake was in fact at one stage advised by his own solicitors that phrases such as <span style="font-style:italic">“we will take a nuclear bomb to you”</span> are relatively common hyperbole in litigation.  It was put to Mr Pym, who was after all the person to whom such statements were made, that he did not understand that Mr Candy was threatening to do anything unlawful, to which he said that he did not know what Mr Candy was planning to do; all he remembered was that the call was extremely aggressive.      </p>

That depends on proving that the intention of CPC and its directors, at the time the loan was made, was to use unlawful means to acquire GGH for CPC.  The unlawful means relied on by Mr Stewart were that CPC set up the agreement to fail, and that CPC assured Mr Holyoake that the loan would not be disclosed to Investec and assured him that the net asset provisions would not be relied on, but planned to renege on those assurances.  I have no hesitation in rejecting this case.  I have already found that CPC did not set up the agreement to fail, were not asked to, and did not, give explicit assurances about keeping the loan confidential from Investec, and did not give the assurance about the net asset provisions relied on.  There is therefore no question of CPC planning at the outset to renege on the assurances.  But quite apart from that, I find that at the time of the loan CPC had no intention or desire or plan to try to acquire GGH for itself.  There is not the slightest trace of this being any part of their thinking at the time.  Mr Christian Candy, as already referred to, was attracted by the prospect of large returns (see paragraph 166 above).   </p>

I accept that that is evidence of a combination between at least those two to tell lies; and I will assume that an agreement to tell lies is a sufficient agreement to use unlawful means, even if, as in this case, the lies do not deceive as they are not believed.  But I can see nothing in the events of 8 November which suggests that what Mr Candy or CPC were trying to do was to put themselves in a position to get hold of GGH.  Mr Candy’s explanation in evidence of what he was trying to do was to find out what Mr Holyoake was concealing from them.  That is supported by the contemporary internal e-mails and I accept it.  In fact of course Mr Holyoake did not reveal what he was concealing from CPC (the Oscarone loan), and these lies, which Mr Holyoake did not believe, did not cause him (or Hotblack) any loss.   </p>

The Defendants did put pressure on Mr Holyoake to enter into the Supplemental Loan Agreement by threatening litigation.  But leaving aside the question whether there was anything unlawful in doing so (which I have considered above), I do not accept that they were doing so so as to obtain GGH.  I have already said I accept Mr Christian Candy’s evidence that what he wanted, at the time of the telephone call of 31 January and at the Guernsey meeting, was repayment or security, not the asset; and what the Supplemental Loan Agreement delivered to CPC was an acknowledgment that Mr Holyoake was in default, amendments to the Loan Agreement, an agreement to provide security over the Ibiza property, and an acknowledgment that CPC could take enforcement action if payment of £17.74m was not made.

Of these Mr Smith had been in his own words a sceptic from the very beginning, and had from the outset been concerned about the fact that CPC had no security.  He had expressed the view as early as 9 February that <span style="font-style:italic">“Investec is the only way out”</span> and that once they had obtained the Supplemental Loan Agreement they should tell Mr Holyoake that.  On 10 February his reaction to being told that Mr Holyoake had signed was to say that they needed to decide the timing on Investec.  When Mr Christian Candy raised the question on 20 February what CPC should do if Mr Holyoake actually did want to repay £13.5m, Mr Smith’s response was that it would be a nice problem to have, and that if Mr Holyoake did pay them back, they should still seek to take out the Investec loan; as late as 14 March, by which time Mr Candy had come to the conclusion that the £13.5m did not exist, Mr Smith was saying that if it was real they should take it.  There is nothing to suggest that he ever thought they should refuse it so as to get closer to the asset.  As to the <span style="font-style:italic">“interesting problem”</span>, on 21 February he said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Then on 28 February he sent two e-mails on 28 February, the first saying that <span style="font-style:italic">“The fun begins if the money arrives!!”</span> and the second referring to the <span style="font-style:italic">“interesting problem”</span> if the money comes in.  In those circumstances, although it is not entirely clear what he was referring to, I think the most likely explanation is that he was expecting Mr Holyoake to put forward a revised deal as the price of paying £13.5m (which was exactly what Mr Holyoake tried to do in the event), and the <span style="font-style:italic">“interesting problem”</span> was what the terms would be and whether they would be acceptable.  I do not think that he was referring to the problem of how to justify continuing to pursue Investec if £13.5m had been paid off.  CPC would still be entitled in that event to the balance of the interest (a further £4.24m) and a minimum of £10m for the profit share, and Mr Smith had long been of the view that the best way for CPC to protect itself was to take over the Investec facility.  As he explained in evidence, that would not give them security as such for these amounts, but it would put CPC in the position of first secured chargee which would give CPC control over the realisation of GGH in the event of an insolvency.  Taking over the Investec position did not depend on the operation of cl 10.1(c) of the Loan Agreement, but was something that CPC could try and do whatever the amount of the loan still outstanding.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">So far as Mr Candy is concerned, I can equally detect nothing to suggest that he refused the £13.5m because he thought it would make it more difficult to get hold of GGH.  What the e-mails show is that Mr Candy was very sceptical that the £13.5m existed at all.  That was what he told Mr Pym on 12 March, which is why Mr Pym reported to Mr Holyoake on 13 March that CPC did not believe the money was there, and why he was insistent on the money being sent to Wragges, or, as he suggested to Mr Holyoake on 14 March, to Collyer Bristow.  By that stage, as he had told Mr Smith, Mr Williams and his brother earlier that morning, he had come to the conclusion that the £13.5m was not real but an illusion.  He told Mr Holyoake that a sensible discussion could be had once Collyer Bristow confirmed they had £13.5m, but no-one at CPC believed he had it.  If and when Collyer Bristow confirmed the £13.5m, he was sure CPC would be softer in its position, but until then CPC had no options but to commence legal proceedings.  They would no longer chase the £13.5m.     </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is no reason to reject that explanation.  Mr Holyoake was very indignant that Mr Candy would not accept the £13.5m, but he was trying to persuade CPC to restructure the loan on the basis that he paid them the £13.5m, that he would remain personally liable for the balance of the interest and profit share, but that they would go forward without any default and a much lower net asset covenant and no further security, and Mr Candy, as this e-mail makes clear, was not willing to negotiate until he could be assured the £13.5m existed.  Mr Holyoake said in evidence that he did not think there was anything in the Loan Agreement preventing him making an early repayment or partial repayment.  I need not consider if he was right about that as he never put it to the test by offering an unconditional partial repayment.  Indeed, as already referred to, he was not willing to draw down the money from Mr Chernyshev without having reached agreement with CPC.  That was because the £13.5m was not the full £17.74m so unless they had reached agreement with CPC as to what it could do after receipt of the funds, Mr Holyoake would still be exposed to action to enforce the balance.  Mr Holyoake would therefore never have completed the transaction until there was a deal on both sides.   </p>

On the call that evening Mr Candy rejected this proposal saying he did not want the asset.  His thinking at the time is revealed in an e-mail he sent to his brother later that evening.

The calculation of the IRR assumes that CPC would recover this by 24 December 2012, which I think was probably based on an assumption that CPC would be able to default the loan in October, and then sell it as first chargee.  The calculation also shows that CPC assumed that Mr Holyoake had contributed £9m equity himself.   </p>

He said that he doubted if the CPC loan in itself put the Investec loan in default, but that the Declaration of Trust did.  I think he was right about that, as one of the Events of Default under the Investec facility was a failure by the Borrower (Hotblack) to comply with the undertakings in clause 21; and cl 21.7 contained a negative pledge provision under which Hotblack was not to dispose of any of its assets.  By the Hotblack Declaration of Trust Hotblack declared that it held GGH in trust for CPC as to 30% of the equity, which seems to me to amount to a disposal in breach of cl 21.7.

As can be seen, what he was thinking about at the time was acquiring the Investec loan, and then calling default on it.  That would not give CPC GGH, but it would enable them to have GGH sold.  Both Mr Candy and Mr Smith were asked about this.  Mr Candy said that if they could buy the Investec debt, he would be in for £36m, he could then call default, appoint a receiver and the receiver could sell it, and the reference to stealing was to acquiring the site for £36m as opposed to the £42m Mr Holyoake had paid, the <span style="font-style:italic">“steal”</span> referring to getting it at a better price.  Mr Smith said that what would happen if they got into the Investec position and there was a default and they called in an administrator would be that the administrator would appoint a sales agent and the site would be sold at market value.  If CPC were interested at that value they could make a bid, but if not they wouldn’t.  He never saw it as a way of acquiring the site but as a way of protecting the position. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Neither of these explanations seems to me a complete explanation.  Neither explains why Mr Candy appears in his e-mail to link the comment about stealing to the <span style="font-style:italic">“Bad Boy penalties”</span>.  This was a reference, as Mr Candy explained, to payments that CPC had to make to their joint venture partner at One Hyde Park as a result of cost overruns (the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“HE” </span>being a reference to His Excellency the former Prime Minister of Qatar).  In the context of the CPC loan, Mr Candy said he was thinking of charging extension fees to Mr Holyoake for his breaches, and in due course, although not for some months, this is what CPC started doing.  In these circumstances I consider the most likely explanation of what Mr Candy meant by stealing the site was taking all the value from the site.  If CPC could acquire the Investec position and call default, they could then, as both Mr Candy and Mr Smith recognised, put in a receiver or administrator to sell the site.  Mr Candy had already calculated that a sale at a high enough price could produce total recoveries of £53.8m for CPC, and was I think now considering using the imposition of further charges to Mr Holyoake to ensure that even if it sold for more, CPC could take the extra, thereby squeezing Mr Holyoake out of any remaining equity.   </p>

The same would no doubt be true if CPC took over the Investec position and called default.  In practice therefore Mr Candy thought that Mr Holyoake was already in a position where he stood to lose the £9m Mr Candy believed he had put in, and this suggestion was intended to put CPC in a better position, and Mr Holyoake in no worse a one, then they already were.  In effect it would mean that CPC would obtain GGH, not so as to develop it but so as to give it the best chance of selling it and recovering the returns which CPC was contractually entitled to.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I find therefore that Mr Candy was planning ways of effectively acquiring control of GGH so as to recover for CPC all the monies that it was entitled to and leave nothing for Mr Holyoake.  But it does not follow that there was any combination to do that by unlawful means, and I find that there was not.  The plan was to take over Investec’s position and use the rights given to Investec in the Investec facility to put CPC in the best position to recover what was due to it.  There was nothing unlawful in taking an assignment of Investec’s debt.  Mr Stewart also referred to the Defendants being willing to use allegations of contractual breach (whether or not legally sustainable) to achieve their objectives; but I find that the Defendants did think they would be entitled to default the Investec facility once they had it (as a result of Hotblack granting the Declaration of Trust); and although at this stage Mr Candy was thinking of using extension fees to squeeze Mr Holyoake out of any remaining equity, this plan was not then put into action.  I consider below whether there was anything wrong in the extension fees that were later charged.   </p>

On 14 March he e-mailed Mr Tim Simpson of C&amp;C about the prospects of obtaining planning permission on GGH asking him to review the position <span style="font-style:italic">“as CPC may end up taking over this site in the near future, confidentially”</span>.  That is I think likely to have been a reference to the plan to acquire the Investec loan and call default (in which case the prospects of obtaining planning would affect the price that a receiver or administrator could expect to realise); although given that the e-mail was at 11.58, just before his e-mail of 12.10   with the proposal of suggesting to Mr Holyoake that he give CPC GGH and walk away with a loss of £9m, he may also have been thinking about that.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">But by 15 March Mr Holyoake had spoken to Investec and persuaded them not to agree to an assignment of the facility.  He told Mr Candy that on a telephone call (and Mr Currie later confirmed it to Mr Smith).  That led to a different proposal, discussed on the telephone call on 15 March, under which CPC would lend Mr Holyoake the money to pay off the Investec facility, Mr Holyoake would by 26 March pay the £13.5m and give security over the Ibiza property and, in default of doing so, ownership of GGH would be transferred to CPC in full and final settlement of Mr Holyoake’s obligations.  That was effectively similar to the suggestion in Mr Candy’s e-mail of 12 March at 12.10 with the addition of the opportunity for Mr Holyoake to provide both the £13.5m and the security over the Ibiza property.  Since Mr Candy thought that the £13.5m did not exist, it is perhaps not surprising that he e-mailed Mr Simpson on 16 March to the effect that <span style="font-style:italic">“It is probable, confidentially, that CPC will take possession of this site next week, and will own 100% of it”</span>: if Mr Holyoake did agree to this proposal, Mr Candy expected the outcome to be that CPC would acquire GGH.   </p>

The claim was for the £17.74m, on the basis that Mr Holyoake had failed to comply with the terms of the Supplemental Loan Agreement (having neither provided security over the Ibiza property nor paid £17.74m by 28 February) with the result that CPC could enforce the Loan Agreement on the basis of the breaches identified in Wragges’ letter of 2 February.   </p>

But this episode was only very briefly explored in evidence; I was not told what basis Mr Holyoake had for thinking that CPC had sought to dissuade Mr Ronson, and when he suggested this to Mr Christian Candy on 26 March it was immediately and strenuously denied; Mr Nicholas Candy’s actual e-mail to his brother is consistent with his either having tried to persuade Mr Ronson to buy it or put him off; and in the end I am not persuaded that Mr Nicholas Candy had any good reason to try and frustrate a purchase.  All the evidence to date indicates that what CPC was looking for was a way of getting repaid.  In the circumstances, despite my doubts, I do not find this allegation proved.   </p>

The facts are as follows.  On 30 March Mr Nicholas Candy circulated an e-mail in which he said that the more he heard about Mr Holyoake, the more he thought he was a serial fraudster, and said he would not be surprised if he had been in prison.  I should say that I have heard nothing to suggest that there was any basis for this – it was just speculation by Mr Nicholas Candy.  He also said that Mr Wells needed to be brought into the proceedings as well.  Mr Dean, who had recently (on 27 March) been asked by Mr Christian Candy to take over responsibility for the litigation, replied that he was checking with Wragges and they were securing a quote from a private investigator to see if Mr Holyoake or Mr Wells had been in prison.  I have not seen any response from Wragges, which would no doubt be privileged, but on 2 April Mr Smith responded to a redacted e-mail with the subject line <span style="font-style:italic">“Re: Fees Quotation” </span>by saying that Cliff might be able to do this, Cliff being a reference to Mr Knuckey, who was then the Chief Executive of a private investigations company he had set up in about 2009 called Hermes Forensic Solutions Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“Hermes”</span>).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are a number of difficulties with this submission.  First and foremost, a similar argument has already been rejected in previous litigation between the parties: see <span style="font-style:italic">Holyoake v Candy</span> [2017] EWHC 52 (QB).  Mr Holyoake had made a subject access request under s. 7 of the DPA against Mr Nicholas Candy and CPC.  That sought data under a number of headings, including communications containing Mr Holyoake’s personal data between Mr Candy and USG Security Ltd.  Mr Candy’s response to the request accepted that some data existed in this category, but claimed litigation privilege in relation to it.  It is well established that litigation privilege cannot be maintained in respect of documents that are evidence of criminal conduct, and Mr Holyoake contended that the privilege was lost through breach of s. 55 of the DPA, which makes it an offence to obtain personal data unlawfully.  For this purpose Mr Holyoake relied on the Knuckey e-mails as demonstrating the commission of an offence under s. 55 of the DPA, and specifically that Mr Knuckey must at least have gained access to the PNC.  Warby J held that whatever the Knuckey e-mails revealed, they did not assist in showing that the separate USG data might contain evidence of criminality.  That was sufficient to dispose of the point, but he went on to say that he would in any event have decided the issue against Mr Holyoake on the additional footing that there was no real basis for believing that the events evidenced by the Knuckey e-mails involved a s. 55 offence: see at [79].  Mr Knuckey expressly told Mr Smith that he could not get details of spent convictions, but Warby J found that it was inherently unlikely that the PNC was confined to unspent convictions; this was confirmed by reference to authority, and was consistent with his own experience in criminal cases.  In those circumstances his conclusion (at [83]) was that: </p>

Of the Defendants to the present action only Mr Nicholas Candy and CPC itself were parties to the previous action, and only Mr Nicholas Candy was relying on the point on legal privilege and hence directly affected by Warby J’s decision on this point.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The principle of abuse of process however is a wider one which prevents a party from making a collateral attack on an earlier decision even if the parties are not identical and they are not strictly bound by it.  The relevant principles are set out by Morritt V-C in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bairstow</span> case at [38].  Not every collateral attack is an abuse of process; if the earlier decision is that of a civil court and the parties to the later proceedings are not bound by the earlier decision it will only be an abuse if it is manifestly unfair to a party that the issues should be relitigated, or if to permit this would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  In my judgment both tests are here satisfied.  Although the issue in the earlier proceedings only directly affected Mr Nicholas Candy, it would be artificial to regard the other Defendants to this action as if they were mere bystanders to whom the outcome of the DPA proceedings was irrelevant.  By the time the DPA proceedings were brought, the present proceedings were already on foot, and the parties had been divided into two hostile camps, with Mr Holyoake and Hotblack on one side, and the Defendants on the other.  There has never been any suggestion that the interests of the Defendants diverge: they served a single Defence, and have at all times been represented by the same solicitors and counsel.  Warby J found that one of the purposes of the DPA proceedings, and a significant one, was to obtain disclosures which might be deployed in these proceedings: see his judgment at [47].  In effect therefore, although brought as separate proceedings in a different division of the High Court, the DPA proceedings were, at least in part, a preliminary skirmish in the present litigation, and indeed they might have been capable of being brought by way of an interlocutory application in these proceedings.  In those circumstances all the Defendants had exactly the same interest as Mr Nicholas Candy in seeing off Mr Holyoake’s attack on his claim to privilege.  Even if strictly speaking they were not privies to the earlier decision, it would in my judgment be manifestly unfair to them if Mr Holyoake, having lost on this point before Warby J, were now able to run the same point before me: cf the comments of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Hall v Simons </span>at [2001] 1 AC 701D on <span style="font-style:italic">Reichel v Magrath </span>(1889) 14 App Cas 665: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In those circumstances it is not strictly necessary for me to express my own view.  But I will say that I see no reason to reach a different conclusion from Warby J in any event.  Warby J gave reasons for concluding that the PNC contains details of spent convictions.  No attempt was made before me to adduce evidence suggesting that that conclusion was wrong (and for what it is worth, it is consistent with my own experience of sitting in criminal cases, the antecedents of the defendant being regularly placed before the Court whether spent or not).  That seems to me to make it very unlikely that Mr Knuckey accessed the PNC as the one thing that is clear is that he told Mr Smith that he could not get details of spent convictions.  I have not understood why he should have told Mr Smith that if the reality was that he could, and had.  In those circumstances I do not think any safe inference can be drawn from the fact that Mr Knuckey charged CPC £200 (which Mr Smith at any rate thought was cheap, rather than expensive, perhaps by contrast with what Wragges were suggesting), or as to what Mr Knuckey meant by calling in a favour.  Other than accessing the PNC there was no suggestion as to what he might actually have done (unlike Warby J, I was not given any evidence as to the means by which information about criminal records can be obtained legitimately from public sources), and once the suggestion that Mr Knuckey had accessed the PNC has been rejected, I do not think I can find he behaved in some other unspecified improper way, far less that CPC instructed him to.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A number of allegations about Mr Knuckey’s conduct were ventilated in the course of the trial, but Mr Knuckey was neither a party to these proceedings, nor gave evidence, and, as Mr Stewart recognised, that means that I should be cautious about making any findings about his conduct unless it is necessary.  Thus for example Mr Knuckey was arrested, with considerable publicity, in May 2012 (that is subsequently to the Knuckey e-mails) after allegations had been made that he and RISC had been involved in passing defence information to the police and bribing police officers; Mr Knuckey was in the event charged with one offence and acquitted.  I do not propose to decide, nor do I have the material to do so, whether there was any basis for suspecting Mr Knuckey of such behaviour; all that is material is whether it is shown that Mr Smith knew of such matters in April 2012 and there is nothing to suggest that he did.  The same applies to allegations against Mr Knuckey aired much more recently in press articles dating from October last year; although the underlying allegations date back to 2007, it is not shown that Mr Smith knew anything about them.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The one thing that can be said is that Mr Logue made allegations in the Logue proceedings that Mr Knuckey had sought to elicit information from him by dishonest and underhand means, including at one stage impersonating a representative of the Saudi royal family and at another claiming to be a representative of Vodafone, and that in July 2010 Roth J, who heard an application by Mr Logue to discharge a freezing order that had been granted against him, in part on the basis of Mr Knuckey’s evidence that he was evading service, was of the provisional view that it was highly unlikely that Mr Logue had invented his account: see <span style="font-style:italic">The Complete Retreats Liquidating Trust v Logue </span>[2010] EWHC 1864 (Ch) at [39].  Mr Smith accepted in evidence that he had read Roth J’s judgment at the time; that having discussed it with Mr Knuckey, he had proceeded on the basis that he accepted the judgment; and that there were no excuses for Mr Knuckey’s behaviour (albeit Mr Smith understood that he was seeking to serve proceedings on Mr Logue).  He also accepted, albeit with hindsight, that he should not have used an investigator who to his knowledge had behaved improperly in the past, but said that he probably did so out of laziness, it being easier to pick up the phone to him than start from scratch.     </p>

If, therefore, contrary to the view I have expressed, this point is open to Mr Holyoake in these proceedings at all, I find that it has neither been established that Mr Knuckey obtained the information from the PNC or some other illegitimate source, nor that the Defendants asked him to.  </p>

It is then pleaded that Mr Holyoake was extremely alarmed by this conversation, which he took to be, and which amounted to, a direct threat of direct physical violence against himself and his wife and children, and that he immediately hired private security guards at home for his wife and children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I will start with what the contemporaneous e-mails show.  On 3 April CPC sent a letter to Mr Holyoake formally requiring him to procure the grant by Hotblack of a second charge over GGH by 11 April in accordance with cl 10.1(c) of the Loan Agreement (which required Mr Holyoake, if he had not repaid the £17.74m by 12 March 2012, to procure the grant of the Additional Property Charge within 30 days).  It also sought extensive financial information under cl 10.1(d)(4) including confirmation of the source of funds used to purchase GGH.  That reflected the fact that on 18 March Mr Christian Candy had asked Mr Holyoake to confirm that he had used <span style="font-style:italic">“only your own equity, and CPCs £12mn equity, and no other third party equity was used”</span> to which Mr Holyoake had replied <span style="font-style:italic">“That’s correct”</span>, but that Mr Nicholas Candy had heard on the grapevine that there was other equity in the deal, and when Wragges asked Mr Saunders to confirm whether any other source of funds was used for the acquisition, there was no answer.  After repeated stalling by Mr Holyoake, Mr Gould of Collyer Bristow did on 30 March repeat to Wragges Mr Holyoake’s confirmation that there was no other equity provider to Hotblack, but Collyer Bristow were not of course involved in the purchase, and it is apparent that CPC continued to be sceptical.  Also on 3 April Wragges sent a letter to Collyer Bristow requiring Mr Holyoake to sign an undertaking by 11 April to complete the charges over the Ibiza property.  </p>

They alleged that Mr Candy had said that Mr Holyoake had defaulted on the Loan Agreement and now needed to do everything that Christian Candy told him to do because otherwise he would not stop and would ruin Mr Holyoake, and that Mr Candy told Mr Holyoake that Christian Candy would sell the debt should Mr Holyoake not do exactly as Christian Candy wanted, that they had strong links to Russian buyers and that these people can be <span style="font-style:italic">“very, very nasty”</span> and Mr Holyoake should not put himself <span style="font-style:italic">“in that danger”</span>.  </p>

Mrs Holyoake gave an explanation of these e-mails in her oral evidence which was that as her husband was frequently travelling, and the villa is isolated, she wanted someone to help around the house, but that it would also give her some peace of mind to have a man living in when her husband was away; that she had become friends with Mr Bilton who also lived on Ibiza and he recommended hiring a Gurkha which he told her would cost about £200 a week; that Mr Pym had suggested instead getting someone who used to be in the army; that the quotes that Mr Cooke (an old friend of hers who worked with her husband) had obtained from Mr Hunt and Mr Hill were for much more extensive (and expensive) security than she had envisaged and not at all what she had in mind; and that that was why she did not take it forward at that time.

Mr Lovering who visited the Ibiza property twice, once in 2010 and once in the summer of 2013, contrasted the safe and open atmosphere when he first visited when there was no security – something that was confirmed by Mr Nicholas Candy who said that whenever he went to stay with Mr Holyoake, which he had done many times, Mr Holyoake had lots of staff but no security – with the Fort Knox like atmosphere of his second visit with cameras and people checking you in.  Mrs Holyoake said that she still had security at the estate, and again I accept this evidence. </p>

Wragges’ answer to that was that Mr Nicholas Candy had no recollection of the call but that it was desperate to suggest that the mere mention of Russians was menacing.  By the time of the Defence in these proceedings, the Defendants’ position was that Mr Nicholas Candy <span style="font-style:italic">“may have”</span> referred to Saudi Arabians or Russian buyers.  When he came to give oral evidence he said that he had indeed referred to the Saudis who Mr Holyoake had originally been planning to borrow from, or the Russian that he was going to borrow £13.5m from, and said: </p>

Leaving aside the way that his recollection has apparently improved since the allegation was first made, Mr Nicholas Candy was by his own account closely following Mr Dean’s script.  The script said nothing about <span style="font-style:italic">Mr Holyoake</span> finding someone else to buy the debt – it was designed to persuade Mr Holyoake to agree to put charges in place by 11 April or face the consequences.  There had been no reference to Saudis as potential investors since the inception of the loan in October; and Mr Holyoake had been promising the £13.5m from Mr Chernyshev for 2 months without any sign that it would actually happen.  I think it very unlikely that Mr Nicholas Candy said this at all.  But if he did not, that raises the question why he gave this evidence, and whether the explanation might not be that there was indeed a reference to Russian buyers after all, and he was seeking to explain this away.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Then there is the whole question why the script mentions debt collectors at all.  The purpose of these points was to reinforce the message that it would be better for Mr Holyoake to agree to give the charges than to face the alternative.  Point 2 of the points for Mr Nicholas Candy to <span style="font-style:italic">“perhaps mention”</span> referred to CPC seeking freezing orders, summary judgment and bankruptcy.  It is not clear what the suggestion of selling the debt to someone else was intended to add to that.  It was perhaps unlikely that a bank or other legitimate buyer would buy a debt that was disputed, as they would simply be buying litigation; but even if they could be persuaded to, they could scarcely do any more than CPC were itself threatening to do.  If the reference were instead to obtaining summary judgment and then selling the judgment, there was no reason to think that CPC would be at all hesitant to collect on a judgment it had obtained.  Its hesitation in pursuing Mr Holyoake more vigorously to date was because it could see that litigation was a risky course for it to pursue. </p>

I have no difficulty in accepting that Mr Nicholas Candy’s tone was friendly enough.  Mr Holyoake himself said that Mr Nicholas Candy was <span style="font-style:italic">“trying to pretend he’s my friend” </span> and that he did not know whether Mr Nicholas Candy was being a good friend to him, nobly trying to help him, or was involved in it and being conspiratorial.  (It is in fact clear from CPC’s internal e-mails that Mr Nicholas Candy had long since lost faith in Mr Holyoake’s integrity (indeed since the end of January 2012 when the Aeriance charges were discovered), felt guilty for having got his brother into the position where he stood to lose his money, and was fully behind doing what was necessary to recover it.)  Nor is it suggested that Mr Nicholas Candy made any threats to do anything himself: the message he was asked to convey, and did, was that his brother was angry and that Mr Holyoake had to do what was proposed or else his brother would take various steps.   What I have found more difficult to resolve is whether he crossed the line to suggest that one of the steps his brother might take was to sell the debt to those who might resort to violence.  </p>

Instead he twice said (admittedly in slightly different contexts) that he was worried that it might <span style="font-style:italic">escalate</span> to threats of physical violence or personal threats.  That is obviously and starkly inconsistent with his having understood that such a threat had already been made, especially as his most recent evidence is that Mr Nicholas Candy had been graphically explicit, not just hinting at it.  Nor is it likely that he would have said that the threats had stopped since proceedings had been issued, nor that he could not really comment on Mr Nicholas Candy as he had been kept out of it.  And there is the curiosity that although he referred to one of Mr Christian Candy’s threats being that they could sell the debt down to some very unpleasant people (an allegation that was neither pleaded nor put to Mr Christian Candy in terms), he does not link that to the call with Mr Nicholas Candy that had taken place so recently.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The period from 4 April to 14 June 2012 was taken up with negotiations for alternative solutions, while the time for Mr Holyoake to serve a Defence in the Commercial Court proceedings was repeatedly extended.  A number of possibilities were taken forward in turn, but since none of them were completed it is not necessary to consider them in any great detail.  The first suggestion was to make use of the fact that Mr Holyoake had paid the £12m lent to him by CPC into Hotblack by way of loan, the suggestion being that he <span style="font-style:italic">“novate”</span> this loan to CPC (in fact I think better described as an assignment than a novation).  Mr Lord submitted that the initiative for this idea came from Mr Holyoake, whereas an e-mail from Mr Dean of 11 April suggests that it had emanated from Wragges, but I do not think this is significant.  What matters is that Mr Holyoake was willing to take this forward.  That incidentally involved Mr Wells falsifying a number of documents.  On 16 April Mr Holyoake forwarded to Mr Dean a form of loan agreement between Hotblack and himself.  Mr Wells had adapted this from a loan agreement which had been duly entered into in October 2011 (it is dated 7 October 2011 although probably executed rather later).  The original 2-page agreement on page 1 recited (at recital B.) Hotblack’s intention to finance the purchase of GGH using a combination of facilities including the Investec loan of £24m and the Oscarone loan of £7.5m, and provided in clause 1 for Mr Holyoake to lend £14m to Hotblack; on page 2 it was signed by Helen Crichton as director of Hotblack. Mr Wells adapted this by replacing page 1 with a new page that recited (at recital B.) Hotblack’s intention to finance the purchase by a combination of facilities including the Investec loan of £24m and a loan from Mr Holyoake of £20,750,000; and provided in clause 1 for Mr Holyoake to lend £20,750,000.  What Mr Holyoake forwarded to Mr Dean was a pdf of the new page 1 (dated 12 October 2011) and two versions of the original page 2, one signed by Ms Crichton and the </p>

Mr Holyoake accepted in evidence that he had asked Mr Wells to remove Oscarone’s name from the documents.  He sought to justify this on the basis that CPC had behaved so badly that he did not owe them any duties, but they were clearly deceptive documents, and the loan agreement was a straightforward forgery.  So too was a version of board minutes for Hotblack dated 10 October 2011 which Mr Holyoake later forwarded to Mr Dean on 22 June 2012.  These were adapted by Mr Wells from genuine board minutes which had scheduled to them a list of Finance Documents, including a reference to an intercreditor deed which referred to Oscarone, and a loan agreement between Hotblack and Mr Holyoake which referred to a loan of <span style="font-style:italic">“up to £14m”</span>; Mr Wells adapted this schedule by removing the reference to the intercreditor deed, and altering the amount of the loan from Mr Holyoake to <span style="font-style:italic">“up to £20.75m”</span>.   </p>

Mr Holyoake appeared to be willing to progress this transaction.  It required Investec to co-operate and on 25 April Mr Holyoake told Mr Dean that he spoken to Investec and they were happy with the proposal provided their position was not prejudiced; he confirmed this in an e-mail the next day.  I accept Mr Lord’s submission however that Mr Holyoake cannot have been sincere as the proposal would necessarily involve Investec and an intercreditor deed, and would inevitably have led to Oscarone coming to light, which would have prevented it working, and I am very doubtful if he spoke to Investec about it at all.  In effect, Mr Holyoake was simply pretending to go along with this proposal to obtain more time. </p>

There was considerable negotiation of the terms for the sale, which took the form of a sale and purchase agreement (<span style="font-weight:bold">“SPA”</span>) whereby Greenlander was to sell the shares in Hotblack to a new CPC company, GGH (Guernsey) Ltd, and for some time it looked as if the transaction would complete; on 9 June however Mr Holyoake told Mr Dean that he was expecting to refinance imminently which would enable him to repay CPC.  That initially led to a proposal that the SPA be entered into but with an option for Greenlander to repurchase the Hotblack shares from GGH (Guernsey); but on 11 June it was agreed that instead the SPA would be signed but put into escrow, Mr Holyoake being given 6 weeks to repay the loan.  On 14 June 2012 the parties duly signed an Escrow Deed to allow him the opportunity to do that.   </p>

In closing submissions Mr Stewart submitted that the SPA was the means by which the Defendants were seeking to obtain ownership of GGH, that Mr Holyoake was able to stave off the SPA for short periods of time by putting it in escrow, that he was required to make substantial payments to prevent CPC from exercising its rights and that if Mr Holyoake was unable to repay, CPC would be able to take steps to put into effect the SPA and purchase Hotblack.   </p>

Mr Dean explained in oral evidence that that was his understanding of the arrangements.  I agree with him.  Indeed, Mr Holyoake’s pleaded case in fact appears to accept this, as it pleads (at paragraph 130(iii) of the Particulars of Claim) that under the escrow agreements it was agreed that if Mr Holyoake failed to repay the total amount by the relevant deadline and various other conditions were satisfied the parties <span style="font-style:italic">“would be at liberty to agree to sign” </span>the SPA.     </p>

The practical effect was that he obtained another 6 weeks in which to complete his refinancing if he could.  On the view I take of the Escrow Deed, he could not be forced to complete the SPA if he failed to refinance.  The only consequence would be that he would be liable for the £17.74m.  But on the findings I have made above Mr Holyoake was already bound by the Supplemental Loan Agreement.  That had admitted the breaches relied on by CPC, entitled CPC to enforce its rights at any time after 28 February 2012, and amended the Loan Agreement to make it clear that on an Event of Default the whole £17.74m would be payable.  CPC had indeed proceeded to enforce its rights by issuing and serving the claim form on 19 March.  It seems to me to follow that Mr Holyoake was already liable to pay the £17.74m, and had been since at least 19 March, and that for the Escrow Deed to provide that in place of that liability he would be liable for a new debt of £17.74m on 4 August 2012 did not materially worsen his position.  Mr Holyoake also obtained the benefit of the current proceedings being dropped, which was clearly a benefit to him, not least in not having to spend any more money on defending them.     </p>

For the subsequent extensions, CPC required Mr Holyoake to make a cash payment in part repayment of the £17.74m.  Thus for example the Second New Escrow and Guarantee Deed, dated 24 August 2012, granted an extension for a further two weeks until 6 September in return for a payment of £1,250,000 made by Mr Holyoake on 22 August, the effect being to reduce the outstanding debt from the £17.74m to £16,493,578.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">These demands for cash no doubt put pressure on Mr Holyoake’s cashflow, but I do not see that he was in any sense forced into these successive agreements.  He was the one who in each case wanted further time to complete his refinancing.  CPC were not obliged to give him any further time and could at any stage have refused an extension and proceeded to enforce the claim for £17.74m.  One can take as an example the position he found himself in as the deadline of 23 August set by the New Escrow Deed approached.  If he failed to refinance and repay CPC by 6 pm on 23 August, then he would either have had to complete the SPA or the £17.74m would have become payable by 5 pm on 28 August.  For reasons given below I do not think Mr Holyoake ever had any intention of completing the SPA.  So the practical alternative to agreeing terms for an extension beyond 24 August was to face the prospect of crystallising the debt on 28 August and putting himself in a position where CPC could sue him for it.  Given that he had agreed in the New Escrow Deed that a new debt of £17.74m would become due by 5 pm on 28 August, he would obviously be in some difficulty in defending such proceedings.  No doubt Mr Holyoake wished to avoid the prospect of being sued, but for a debtor to obtain further time to pay by making partpayments of his debt does not seem to me at all out of the ordinary or highly disadvantageous to him.  And although Mr Holyoake’s position was not enviable, CPC’s position was not that enviable either.  In an e-mail of 27 July 2012 Mr Dean told Mr Christian Candy and Mr Smith that <span style="font-style:italic">“He knows he has us by the balls – the joy of unsecured debt”</span>; that reflects the fact that CPC had no security over GGH and its only real option if Mr Holyoake would not complete the SPA was to proceed with litigation.  But litigation would not be guaranteed to work: Mr Dean’s evidence was that from his first involvement at the end of March 2012 onwards, there was an overriding concern that public litigation would lead to Mr Holyoake’s other creditors stepping in and Mr Holyoake’s property ventures collapsing and that there was a real danger of CPC not being able to recover.  In these circumstances CPC did not hold all the cards, and I accept Mr Lord’s submission that Mr Dean’s e-mail of 27 July accurately reflects the fact that the parties’ respective commercial strategies were finely balanced.  </p>

In fact I do not think Mr Holyoake would ever have completed any of the SPAs, and I accept Mr Lord’s submission that the arrangements would not have worked because of the existence of the Oscarone loan.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are two specific matters relied on Mr Stewart in this period which I should deal with.  The first concerns a further approach to Mr Knuckey by CPC (as already referred to (paragraph 317 above)).  The facts are as follows.  On 18 June 2012 Mr Christian Candy e-mailed Mr Dean and his brother to report that he was <span style="font-style:italic">“sourcing debt collectors now as a back-up”</span>.  This was shortly after the first Escrow Deed had been entered into (on 14 June).  Then on 2 July he sent them and Mr Smith a further e-mail, the subject of which was <span style="font-style:italic">“Cliff Knuckey re Mark Holyoake post summary judgment”</span>, reporting that he had just spoken to Mr Knuckey and that he had some people who could do debt collection at the size they were discussing.  On the basis of these e-mails, Mr Stewart submitted that what Mr Candy was discussing with Mr Knuckey was not legitimate debt collection but illegitimate debt collectors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This allegation is not pleaded; it is not suggested that Mr Holyoake knew of Mr Candy’s approach to Mr Knuckey at the time (Mr Holyoake only discovered it as a result of disclosure) and it is not suggested that anything came of it – there was no actual attempt at debt collection, legitimate or otherwise, and no suggestion that there were threats of debt collection after the call on 4 April.  In those circumstances I do not think it is in fact necessary for me to make any findings about the matter one way or the other.  It is certainly a bit odd that Mr Candy thought of turning to Mr Knuckey.  His explanation in evidence is that he was thinking ahead, modelling ahead, as to what they would do if Mr Holyoake did not repay them – they had an unsecured debt, Mr Holyoake was in the Balearics, Hotblack in Jersey, Greenlander in the BVI, and he was thinking about how, if they got a summary judgment, they could actually recover it.  He asked Mr Knuckey because he knew that he had been involved in antimoney laundering and thought he might know someone who could deal with crossborder recovery.  As Mr Stewart submitted, that raises a number of questions.  An ex-policeman who is in the business of private investigation might well be very helpful to trace assets, but is far from being an obvious source of advice on crossborder recovery.  If Mr Candy wanted to know what the legal options for recovery were, one would have thought the first thing to have done would be to ask Wragges, a large commercial law firm.  If he wanted to find someone to sell the judgment to once they had one, Mr Smith’s evidence was that he received regular inquiries from people wishing to buy debts.   Moreover, Mr Knuckey had by then been arrested on serious charges, which had received a measure of publicity.  Mr Candy said that he was not aware of this at the time, but Mr Smith certainly was, and one might have thought that it would be natural for Mr Candy to ask Mr Smith if it was worth talking to Mr Knuckey before doing so, both because Mr Knuckey was primarily a contact of Mr </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Smith’s, and because Mr Smith was likely to have a better understanding of Mr Knuckey’s business.  Overall, I am not satisfied that I have had a full explanation of this unorthodox approach to Mr Knuckey, and I am left in some doubt as to why it was done and what was actually discussed.  But for reasons already given I do not think I need try and resolve the doubts – it did not in the event affect Mr Holyoake and nothing came of it.    </p>

Mr Christian Candy’s evidence was that Mr Whitmey is now, and he thought was then, a senior director in the sites and land division of Savills; that he had experience in sites; that there were not many people who dealt with site sales in London and that he was very, very good.  Neither Mr Candy could recall what the outcome of this approach was.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">Then on 23 May 2012 Mr Christian Candy contacted Mr Whitmey again, asking for his views on what GGH would sell for with planning, asking for a fire sale value, an expected sales price and a maximum sales price each with a 4 month window; Mr Whitmey ran an appraisal and came up with values of £41.5m, £59m and £84m (based on assumed sales prices for the completed flats of £2000, £2250 and £2750 per square foot).  Mr Candy accepted that the 4 months was a restricted sales period, and it was submitted by Mr Stewart that the implication was that the valuation would be lower which would be to the Defendants’ advantage.  I have not understood this submission.  At the time the proposal was that GGH be sold to CPC, and Mr Candy would obviously wish to know what the asset might fetch.  I see nothing sinister in him adopting a cautious view.   </p>

It was suggested to Mr Candy that he was “papering the file”.  Mr Candy accepted that he sent the e-mail (which was an unusually long one for him) as a record of the call in case there was ever a claim from Mr Holyoake, but I see no reason to doubt that it was an accurate record.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That is the background to the allegation that the Defendants interfered with a valuation by Savills.  Mr Holyoake was attempting to refinance.  On 24 July 2012 Mr Holyoake told Mr Dean in a telephone call that the only outstanding condition precedent to the refinancing was a valuation, that Savills had delayed providing the valuation, and that he had therefore agreed with the funder to use a new valuer who would report in 10 working days from Friday 20 July (the implication being that the new valuer had only been instructed on 20 July).  Mr Holyoake also alluded to the connection between Savills and CPC being the reason they had not delivered.  There is in evidence an appraisal by Savills dated 14 June 2012 at a sales price of £3,000 per square foot which led to a value of some £93m, and Mr Stewart suggested to Mr Candy that he specifically did not want Savills providing a valuation in accordance with that appraisal, which he denied.  Mr Dean sent Mr Holyoake an e-mail on 25 July summarising the conversation, and asking him to confirm that he had no objection to CPC speaking to Savills to establish their view of his allegation.  Mr Holyoake’s response was that he did not wish to get into the Savills matter – he simply wanted to explain why there was a delay in the valuation.  Further correspondence ensued in which Mr Dean made it clear that no-one at CPC had interfered with the valuation process. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On this material I do not find the allegation that CPC interfered with the Savills valuation proved.  The fact that Mr Holyoake did not want to pursue it with Savills when Mr Dean offered to do so casts doubt on whether he had any real basis for making the allegation; although he continued to assert the allegation in oral evidence, he did not explain what the basis for it was; I do not regard the matters relied on by Mr Stewart as sufficient to infer that there had been such interference; nor do I accept that CPC had any real motive for doing so.  The whole purpose of the repeated escrow agreements was to give Mr Holyoake the time to complete a refinancing which would enable him to pay CPC the £17.74m, and to frustrate that process would simply make it less likely that they would recover the full £17.74m.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Moreover the suggestion that Mr Holyoake had instructed JLL on 20 July in response to delays in Savills providing their valuation is demonstrably untrue.  Mr Holyoake had already been in contact with JLL by 4 July, and they had been formally instructed by 6 July.  When Mr Dean later asked for a copy of the valuation, Mr Holyoake told Mr Wells that the date of JLL’s letter confirming instructions on 6 July, which was included as Appendix 1 to the report, was a <span style="font-style:italic">“big problem”</span> and asked him to remove it or blank it, and the report was sent without appendices.  It seems probable that Mr Holyoake was simply using the suggestion that Savills had delayed as a way of justifying a further extension of time for the refinancing to complete. </p>

If the Extension Fees were paid on time they would reduce the principal amount of the debt.

The effect under the terms of the Extension Agreement was (i) that the unpaid £1m of the first Extension Fee was added to the debt (ii) the total amount then outstanding was therefore increased to £14.85m (being £14.65m less £0.8m plus £1m) and (iii) the whole amount became immediately due.

The structure of the JMA requires one to be able to answer the question whether a contract is a Qualifying Contract at the date it is entered into (or at the latest on 30 April which in the circumstances comes to the same thing), because the question whether the Long Stop Date has been extended to October or not (and hence whether CPC’s step-in rights have arisen or not) depends on the answer to that question.  If the question had been asked on 30 April “Is the contract with Sherbourne one where the buyer has provided a 5% deposit?” the only answer that could be given to that is No.  I am not suggesting that Mr O’Connor was deliberately misleading Wragges – he seemed to me to have genuinely persuaded himself that there was a point of some difficulty there and that he could properly conclude that the fact that the 5% deposit had not yet been paid did not prevent it being a Qualifying Contract – but I have no hesitation in concluding that he was wrong, although in the light of the acceptance that Sherbourne was not an arm’s length purchaser, it does not in fact make any difference.  </p>

It started with Mr Lovering instructing a firm of solicitors, HowardKennedyFsi (<span style="font-weight:bold">“HKfsi”</span>), and Collyer Bristow and HKfsi, both of whom thought they were acting for independent parties, then negotiating the contracts, while Mr Lovering and Mr Holyoake were exchanging e-mails discussing what to say to their respective solicitors to keep up the pretence of negotiation.  Mr O’Connor said in oral evidence that he asked Mr Holyoake if the purchaser was an arm’s length third party, and he said that it was; I accept this evidence which means Mr Holyoake had on this point deceived his own solicitor.    </p>

Wragges advised CPC that it was not a Qualifying Contract because of the deposit provisions, and on 17 May Mr Dean spoke to Mr Holyoake and told him that Mr Christian Candy was concerned that the low deposit must mean the buyer was not real and asked for the name of the buyer so CPC could get comfortable, the call being followed by a formal letter from Wragges to the same effect, requiring concrete and corroborated evidence that the buyer was a bona fide arm’s length buyer.  Mr Holyoake did not provide this and on 20 May CPC issued its third claim, in the Chancery Division, asserting that the contract was not a Qualifying Contract and claiming the outstanding sum of £13.6m.    </p>

Mr Stewart submitted that the deception was justifiable in the circumstances.  That is not a view that I can take: having agreed to a contract under which CPC could sell the property unless a Qualifying Contract had been entered into, it cannot be a justification for resorting to deception that if CPC did step in and sell the property as they were contractually entitled to do, the consequences would be unattractive to Mr Holyoake. </p>

Mr Holyoake’s pleaded case is that Mr Dean told him that even if his CCA position was correct, it would make no difference as Mr Holyoake had a choice either to accept a complete <span style="font-style:italic">“cleansing”</span> such that he would be unable to sue CPC and Mr Christian Candy or they would take GGH and <span style="font-style:italic">“ruin”</span> him.  Mr Dean accepted that there was some reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“cleansing”</span> on the call, and that it might have been by him; he said that in this context all it meant was making a clean start, that is by entering into an agreement whereby any potential claims on both sides would be surrendered.  He denied saying that the alternative was that CPC would <span style="font-style:italic">“ruin”</span> him, but accepted in his witness statement that if Mr Holyoake declined to enter into such an agreement then the only alternative would be litigation.  There was little further exploration of the point in oral evidence, and I am left unsure quite what was said.  I am not persuaded that Mr Dean referred to ruining Mr Holyoake, although he no doubt did make it clear that the alternative to an agreement which involved dropping the CCA claims would be litigation.  Since Mr Holyoake had consistently taken the view that litigation would be disastrous, he no doubt did regard this as a threat to ruin him, but it does not follow that Mr Dean used the word.

That led to a letter before action from Wragges on 2 September denying that CPC had caused any delay (Wragges being willing to give an undertaking to lift the restriction once Mr Holyoake had agreed the figure payable to CPC), and threatening proceedings unless CPC were repaid that day.  On 3 September CPC duly issued its fourth claim, again in the Chancery Division, claiming £13.3m and interest, on the basis that the Sherbourne contract was not a Qualifying Contract, or alternatively that if it was, instalments due under the Second Extension Agreement had not been paid (the £13.3m was the amount of £13.6m due under the Second Extension Agreement less two payments of £100,000 and £200,000 made in August).  </p>

Mr Candy accepted that he used the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">“pick a lane”</span>, meaning that Mr Holyoake had a choice between two options, lane A or lane B.  One option was to press on with the litigation.  The other was for Mr Holyoake to proceed with his proposed refinancing, but in order to do that there needed to be a clean start for both parties, that is that their respective claims should be settled.  Mr Candy accepted that the word <span style="font-style:italic">“cleansing”</span> might have been used, possibly by Mr Dean or by Mr Holyoake.

By the time of the Extension Agreement on 26 October 2012, the parties had agreed indicative terms for the JMA which were set out in schedule 1 to the Extension Agreement, and these included (at para 9) an agreement that CPC would be protected by a restriction on title preventing any disposal of GGH without CPC’s consent.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This duly found its way into the JMA executed on 23 November 2012 as cl 4: by cl 4.1 CPC was to apply to the Land Registry to register a restriction preventing a disposition being registered without CPC’s consent; and by cl 4.5, CPC covenanted to release the restriction on the sums referred to in cll 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 being paid in full.  These clauses referred respectively to the proceeds of sale being used to pay (1) the senior lender (Capital A), (2) CPC in respect of the debt and (3) CPC in respect of the sums to which it was entitled under the Declarations of Trust.    Since the JMA was designed to lead to a sale, either by Mr Holyoake, or in default by CPC, and since a sale of GGH would trigger the liability under the Hotblack Declaration of Trust, that no doubt made sense.  The practical effect however was to give CPC a considerable degree of comfort in relation to the £10m minimum due under the Declaration of Trust.  The restriction did not give them formal security as such, but the ability to block a disposition unless all sums were duly paid undoubtedly gave them a significant protection – Mr Dean referred to it in oral evidence as a <span style="font-style:italic">“passive security”</span> that was <span style="font-style:italic">“potent”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“had teeth”</span>.  </p>

CPC made it clear that they were not interested in his personal guarantee.  That was the background to the discussion at the Bulgari Hotel meeting.  Mr Dean’s evidence was that at the meeting it was agreed that CPC’s restriction be lifted to allow the refinancing to take place and then put back on to protect CPC’s remaining interests.  That appears to be borne out by the e-mails: on 9 September Mr Dean told Mr Holyoake that Wragges had given advice as to how the restriction could be <span style="font-style:italic">“removed and replaced seamlessly”</span>, to the effect that they would need to speak to the lender’s solicitor.  Mr Holyoake resisted this suggesting that the lender would not agree, and proposing instead that he agree to put the restriction back on without telling the lender; but by 17 September Mr Holyoake was telling Mr Pym and Mr Lovering that support had been secured from Tuvi (a reference to Mr Tuvi Keinan, Arlington’s solicitor) for the restriction, and at that stage completion of the refinancing seemed imminent. </p>

Mr CoplestoneCrow, a solicitor at The Wilkes Partnership LLP, acted for Hotblack on the proposed refinance.  He gave evidence that negotiations continued through October 2013, and that the form of documentation was basically agreed by the end of October.  He did not know why after such difficult negotiations and drafting, having agreed the paperwork, engrossments were never issued; and in oral evidence confirmed that his role was to negotiate the documentation for the release of the existing restriction and the imposition of a new restriction which ranked behind that of Arlington.  He was not however privy to commercial negotiations between the parties; and accepted that he did not see e-mails from 29 October which appeared to show that there were commercial issues still being debated.  The precise issue which caused the negotiations to collapse was not explored in any detail in the evidence, but I was shown nothing which suggests that the problem in the end was anything to do with CPC retaining a restriction.  Instead it appears (although I was not I think addressed on any of this) that Arlington was proposing to lend a total of some £53m (enough to repay not only Capital A and CPC but also Oscarone), but that CPC thought they were going to lend no more than £40m.  When CPC discovered the true position, Mr Dean concluded that not only did that weaken CPC’s position by pushing them significantly higher up the capital stack, but that Arlington had been <span style="font-style:italic">“greedy at the very last minute”</span>, had been <span style="font-style:italic">“playing games”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“mischievous”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“underhand”</span>, and CPC decided they were not prepared to sit behind them following their actions.  I have a strong suspicion that Arlington were not to blame in this but that the real cause of the problem was that Mr Holyoake had been intending to borrow £53m from Arlington but had told CPC he was only borrowing £40m; but it is unnecessary to make any findings to this effect.  It is sufficient to say that I find that it was not CPC’s insistence on retaining its restriction which caused the refinancing with Arlington to fail.   </p>

After various fees and costs that left about £11.8m for Hotblack, most of which was in fact paid to Oakvest Ltd (one of Mr Holyoake’s companies that he had used to make payments on the GGH project).  The precise sum paid to CPC was £29,049,149, together with interest on that sum of £159.17 (being one day’s interest at the rate of 0.2%).  It is not entirely clear how the £29,049,149 was calculated but it seems to me to have been likely to be made up as follows: (i) the £18,780.948 debt as restated in the Final Supplemental Extension Agreement; (ii) interest under that agreement of £254,701 (being interest at 15% for 33 days); (iii) the £10m minimum due under the Declarations of Trust; and (iv) £13,500 for Wragges’ costs.   </p>

A spreadsheet prepared by Mr Wells in November 2013 lists these loans as they then stood.

Mr Holyoake accepted in evidence that he probably had lied to third parties; Mr Pym said he realised it was all going horribly wrong from March 2012 but was still telling people it was a fantastic transaction when from his standpoint it obviously wasn’t; and Mr Lovering in an e-mail of 30 December 2013 confessed that he was worried <span style="font-style:italic">“about the fraud we have committed”</span>.

His estimate was that about £7m or £8m had not been repaid, but Mr Wells said that it was more like £10m.  I was not given any detail of how Mr Holyoake decided who should be repaid and who should not.

What does seem clear however, as accepted by Mr Wells, is that £500,000 of the proceeds of sale was used to make a new investment in a mining company, Kincora Copper Ltd; Mr Lovering said that that was Mr Holyoake’s decision and a matter for him.  I have not understood on what basis he felt entitled in the circumstances to do that rather than repay other investors, but he was not specifically asked that question and I have therefore not heard whether he has any explanation.       </p>

Mr Candy did not dispute that he said Mr Holyoake would not get a penny back, or that he used expletives: he did not accept having made the <span style="font-style:italic">“deep dark hole”</span> remark, but he did accept that he told Mr Holyoake to <span style="font-style:italic">“fuck off and die”</span>, something that Mr Dean also remembered.

See also the concurring judgment of Lord Toulson at [71] where he makes the point that Mr Hayward’s deceitful conduct was intended to influence the minds of the insurers, not necessarily by causing them to believe him, but by causing them to value his litigation claim more highly than it was worth if the true facts had been disclosed, because the value of a claim for insurers’ purposes is that which the Court is likely to put on it.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That seems to me a very different type of case from the present.  What caused Zurich to settle the claim was not its own belief in the truth or otherwise of the fraudulent claim but the effect that the fraudulent claim might have on a third party (namely the Court); in other words it was a case where A lies to B and B is induced to act in a particular way because of the risk that A might tell the same lie to C and the effect that that might have on C.  It is difficult to see that that principle can have any application where there is no third party or C involved.  Where all that happens, as in the present case, is that A tells a lie to B, it is difficult to envisage the circumstances in which that can induce B to act in a particular way unless B is taken in and believes that what A says is true, or at least might be true.  In the present case Mr Candy told Mr Holyoake that CPC were doing a deal with Investec and would need to disclose the £12m loan to Investec; he was obviously not going to tell the same lies to Investec, and it is difficult if not impossible to see how those lies could have induced Mr Holyoake to do anything in circumstances where he knew that they were lies.    </p>

But as this formulation shows, what Mr Stewart was really relying on was not the lies, but the threat to go to Investec.  As I have already said (paragraph 238 above), the fact that Mr Candy was prepared to make these threats made Mr Holyoake realise that CPC were not his friends, and as a result he decided to try and repay them; and no doubt the fact that Mr Candy was prepared to resort to lies to seek to justify the threats reinforced the point.  The suggestion of early repayment was raised at the dinner at Le Petit Bistro on 1 December 2011 and Mr Holyoake had agreed to do so by 13 December (paragraph 191 above).  But I do not see that this caused Mr Holyoake any quantifiable loss: he did not in fact repay by the end of January, nor indeed in the event did he repay anything until August 2012 by which time the whole sum was due under the terms of the Supplemental Loan Agreement in any event. </p>

The fact that the threat was accompanied by lies which Mr Holyoake never believed cannot make any difference.  He was not in my judgment induced to enter into the Supplemental Loan Agreement by the lies told on 8 November.   </p>

Duress to the person is where a threat of physical violence is directed against the claimant or a close relation or associate of the claimant.  In the present case two specific threats to the person are relied on: what was said by Mr Christian Candy about Mrs Holyoake at the meeting in Guernsey on 6 February 2012, and what was alleged to have been said by Mr Nicholas Candy on the telephone call of 4 April 2012.  I have found that the first did not amount to a threat of violence or constitute duress to the person (paragraph 233 above); and that the second allegation is not established (paragraphs 321-322 above).  Apart from these two specific matters, I do not think that any of the other matters relied on, such as threats to ruin Mr Holyoake’s life, to take a wrecking ball to his assets, and to leave him with nothing, can be equated with physical threats (see paragraph 233 above).  I find that none of the agreements entered into by Mr Holyoake are voidable for physical duress.  </p>

Steyn LJ accepted that the fact that the defendants had used lawful means did not by itself remove the case from the scope of the doctrine of economic duress (see at 718e).  But he said that in a purely commercial context it might be a relatively rare case in which “lawful act duress” could be established; and that it might be particularly difficult to establish duress if the defendant bona fide considered that his demand would be valid, although <span style="font-style:italic">“I deliberately refrain from saying never”</span>.  Farquharson LJ and Sir Donald Nicholls VC agreed, although the latter made it clear that he did not think very much of the defendant’s conduct.

The effective commercial pressure that CPC could bring to bear was that it could at any stage have refused him further time and proceeded to enforce the claim for the £17.74m.  Mr Holyoake had by that stage repeatedly agreed that the amount due was £17.74m, and under the terms of the agreements he had signed it had become due; and for a creditor with an acknowledged debt to insist on part-payment of the debt as a price for granting an extension in respect of the balance does not seem to me to be capable of being characterised as illegitimate pressure. </p>

As set out above (paragraph 342), on Mr Holyoake’s failure to refinance by the expiry date of the Tenth New Escrow Deed, the balance of the debt fell due.  It was Mr Holyoake who wanted further time and who put forward the mechanism of the JMA which would lead to a sale or refinancing.  CPC required payment of Extension Fees as the price for these agreements, and this set the pattern for the remaining life of the loan with a total of £7.5m being payable by way of Extension Fees.  These significantly increased Mr Holyoake’s overall repayment.  But if one asks what practical pressure CPC had that enabled them to demand these sums, the answer is effectively the threat of litigation: the Extension Agreement was executed against the background of Wragges’ demand for £14.85m, and the Second Extension Agreement against the issue of a claim form for that sum (paragraphs 342-345 above).

I have already said (paragraph 362 above) that the effective threats CPC had if Mr Holyoake did not agree to the settlement were to press on with the litigation that had been issued, and to sell GGH under its step-in rights, which were no doubt potent threats but not unlawful.  I do not think they can be characterised as illegitimate pressure either – particularly since it is now clear that CPC were right that the Sherbourne contract was not a Qualifying Contract with the result that CPC had in fact had the right to sell GGH since the end of April 2013. </p>

It was that threat of litigation which I have found was the effective cause of his agreeing to the terms of the Supplemental Loan Agreement, and it remained that threat which at every stage persuaded him to agree to the terms required by CPC for the successive extensions of time and other agreements that he wanted.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Nevertheless I accept that the doctrine is not confined to what might be called abuse of relationship cases.  The leading case on the doctrine of undue influence is that of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v Etridge (No 2) </span>[2001] UKHL 44.  At [7] Lord Nicholls said that the law would not permit a transaction to stand if the means used to persuade a person to enter into it were unacceptable; that the means used were regarded as an exercise of improper or “undue” influence and hence unacceptable whenever the consent thus procured ought not fairly to be treated as the expression of a free person’s will; and that it was impossible to be more precise or definitive as the circumstances in which one person acquired influence over another, and the manner in which influence might be exercised, varied too widely to permit of any more specific criterion.  At [8] he continued: </p>

CPC did make two threats which I have held to be unjustified: the threat on 8 November 2011 to reveal the loan to Investec, and the threat in Wragges’ letter of 2 February 2012 to advertise a statutory demand.  But neither in my judgment had any substantive consequences.  The threat to go to Investec did not cause Mr Holyoake to do anything (other than promise to repay the loan early); the threat of advertising a statutory demand was not the effective cause of Mr Holyoake signing up to the Supplemental Loan Agreement.

The proposed amendment alleged that litigation had been threatened when the person threatening the proceedings had known the litigation to be groundless.  Walker J held that that was a sufficient plea of unlawful conduct as the bringing of litigation in those circumstances would be an abuse of process (see at [181]-[182]).  That was not disputed before him but I have no difficulty with it: it is well established that it is an abuse of process for a claimant to issue proceedings where he knows of no facts to support the claim, and it must be even more abusive to bring litigation which is actually known to be groundless.  But that has no bearing on the present case: at all times from when litigation was first threatened CPC did have a bona fide belief that it was entitled to bring a claim (and in fact given my findings it did have a good claim).  I consider below the slightly different question whether the litigation was being pursued for a collateral object, but I am satisfied that there is no question of CPC threatening litigation that it knew to be groundless. </p>

That was at a stage when (i) Mr Holyoake had neither provided security over the Ibiza property nor repaid £22.74m by 28 February as envisaged by the Supplemental Loan Agreement, and the loan had therefore become due; (ii) CPC however had no other security for the loan (except for a charge over the Blue Valley shares, of little value in itself); and (iii) CPC had approached Investec to take over the Investec facility, but had been rebuffed.  In those circumstances the only real courses of action open to CPC to recover the loan were either to sue Mr Holyoake or to negotiate an agreement with him which would be likely to lead to repayment.  What CPC actually did was issue the proceedings and then negotiate with Mr Holyoake, which led to a number of successive proposals (the novation of the loan, the distribution in specie, the SPA) and ultimately the Escrow Deed (paragraphs 324-326 above).  Each of these was designed to lead to CPC being repaid without having to take the proceedings to trial.  </p>

He later referred to the <span style="font-style:italic">“four corners” </span>strategy, a set of guiding principles that he had discussed with Mr Christian Candy as to how best to handle Mr Holyoake, the fourth of which was to try to avoid litigation.

There the defendant firm of solicitors had brought judicial review proceedings challenging the grant of planning permission to the claimant on one site on the basis of a novel resolution allowing the claimant “credit” for affordable housing, not because they had any interest in that development as such but because their offices were very close to a second development site belonging to the claimant which could benefit from the affordable housing resolution, the alleged aim being to persuade the claimant to assist the firm in relocating.  The Court of Appeal upheld a decision granting summary judgment to the defendants, Etherton LJ (with whom Mummery LJ agreed) doing so among other grounds on the basis (at [73]) that the deputy judge: </p>

That was at a stage when Mr Holyoake had defaulted in paying the first instalment due under the Extension Agreement.  Mr Dean said in an e-mail to him of 7 November that that was particularly concerning because the agreement was predicated on a repayment profile that he had supplied; and in another on 8 November that there came a point when repeated failure to follow through with contractual terms he had agreed to undermined any value in new agreements.  But the issue of proceedings did lead to the negotiation and agreement of the Second Extension Agreement and JMA (paragraph 345 above), and I infer that CPC’s purpose in issuing them was indeed to make it more likely that Mr Holyoake would agree to sign new terms which would be to CPC’s benefit.  The Second Extension Agreement and JMA were to CPC’s benefit not only because the JMA obliged Mr Holyoake to try and sell the property and gave CPC the restriction and step-in rights, but also because there was a cost to Mr Holyoake in terms of an Extension Fee of £2m.  </p>

The claim in the proceedings (which was in fact well-founded) was that Mr Holyoake’s failure to pay the first instalment under the Extension Agreement meant that the whole sum was due.  What Mr Holyoake wanted, and in the event secured by the Second Extension Agreement, was more time to sell GGH (or refinance).  That was valuable to him because he wanted to sell GGH with the benefit of planning rather than as it stood without it.  It was evident that if agreement could not be reached then </p>

So whether CPC had issued proceedings or not, the reality is that Mr Holyoake would have had to decide whether the price being demanded by CPC for an extension was too high or not.  That is no doubt an example of CPC exercising its commercial muscle.  But the agreement that was in fact reached, being an agreement to extend time for repayment of the loan on terms, seems to me well within the ambit of the proceedings. </p>

Mr Lord disputes that the tort of abuse of process can be committed where proceedings are threatened but not in fact issued, but even on the assumption that it can, CPC’s purpose in threatening them was in general terms to persuade Mr Holyoake to enter into agreements which would be more likely to lead to repayment of the monies due to it, and this purpose was within the ambit of the threatened proceedings. </p>

In particular the very narrow identification in such cases of what constitutes a collateral advantage is not in my judgment relevant to the tort, where the test of whether the proceedings are being abused in such a way as to be tortious remains that identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Crawford v Sagicor</span> of being used for some wholly extraneous benefit, pursuing an ulterior purpose unrelated to the subjectmatter of the litigation, and a stalking-horse to coerce the defendant entirely outside the ambit of the legal claim.  Mr Stewart relies on Wragges’ letter as seeking, under the threat of bankruptcy proceedings, two collateral benefits in the shape of (i) costs which he said went beyond those properly claimable under the Loan Agreement and (ii) a minimum of £20m under the Declarations of Trust.  So far as the second is concerned, Wragges were not demanding payment of the £20m but reserving CPC’s rights to it (paragraph 206 above) and I do not think it is a relevant collateral benefit at all; so far as the first is concerned, I do not propose to consider whether the claim for costs was justified or not – it was not in my judgment unrelated to the subjectmatter of the litigation, or entirely outside the ambit of the legal claim.

Thus the classic cases which exemplify the tort are where A uses unlawful acts to dissuade B from dealing with C: see the cases referred to by Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">OBG</span> at [6] of <span style="font-style:italic">Garret v Taylor </span>(1620) Cro Jac 567 (driving away customers of a quarry by unlawful threats) and <span style="font-style:italic">Tarleton v M’Gawley </span>(1794) Peake 270 (using cannon to drive away a canoe from approaching a rival trader’s ship).    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Lord had a number of submissions in answer to this claim.  One was that the wrongful acts relied on (which were the same threats, intimidation and coercion of Mr Holyoake which were relied on as constituting the tort of intimidation, together with the same extortion under colour of due process which was relied on as constituting the tort of abuse of process) were all said to have been directed against Mr Holyoake rather than Hotblack, so that Mr Holyoake cannot in any event have any claim for this tort.  That seems to me to be right: Mr Holyoake is in the position of B, not C.  The effective question therefore is whether Hotblack can bring a claim for unlawful acts committed against Mr Holyoake.  </p>

The unlawful acts relied on by Mr Stewart are those that I have already considered for the purposes of the claims in intimidation and abuse of process, and for the reasons already given, I have found that none of these claims is made out; if they are not made out for the purpose of the two-party torts, I do not see on the facts of this case how they could establish the three-party tort of causing loss by unlawful means.  As Lord Hoffmann explained in <span style="font-style:italic">OBG </span>at [49], there are cases, such as where A dissuades B from dealing with C by unlawful acts, where B suffers no loss but C does, so the fact that B has no claim does not prevent C having one.  But the present does not seem to me a case like that: the effective question is whether Mr Holyoake was coerced by unlawful threats or intimidation or abuse of process, and if (as I have found) he was not, then Hotblack cannot have a claim either.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That makes it unnecessary to consider a further submission by Mr Lord that since Hotblack was effectively under the control of Mr Holyoake (and to all intents and purposes his alter ego) it makes no sense to say that anything done by the Defendants interfered with his and Hotblack’s liberty to deal with each other, it being essential that the unlawful means <span style="font-style:italic">“must affect the freedom of [B] to deal with [C]”</span>: see paragraph 432(4) above.  In those circumstances Mr Lord submitted that Mr Holyoake and Hotblack were not third parties in respect of each other for the purposes of this tort, but co-claimants, and that it would be a nonsense for the tort to be available to them in this way.  That raises quite a difficult issue, and I am not sure it is right.  One of the features of this case is that the Claimants alleged a number of wrongs directed against Mr Holyoake, but wished to claim damages for Hotblack’s loss of profits, which on the face of it was a loss suffered by Hotblack, and I suspect that one of the reasons for introducing this tort into the pleadings was an attempt to overcome that potential difficulty.  Had the facts been made out, I think there is much to be said for the view that Hotblack would indeed have had a claim on this basis.  As it is, the point does not arise and I do not propose to resolve the issue.</p>

Their intention was no doubt to benefit CPC, but it was to benefit CPC at the expense of Mr Holyoake and I will assume, without deciding, that this is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that their intention was to injure Mr Holyoake: compare the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">OBG </span>of the similar mental element in the tort of causing loss by unlawful means (namely an intention to cause loss to the claimant) at [62]-[63] per Lord Hoffmann and at [167] per Lord Nicholls, particularly the latter’s reference to the case where <span style="font-style:italic">“loss to the claimant is the obverse side of the coin from gain to the defendant”</span>.

I have not found any unlawful threats to have been made in the relevant period: the effective threat, deployed for example by Mr Dean on his telephone call of 22 August 2013 and at the Bulgari Hotel meeting on 6 September 2013, was to refuse any further time and enforce the existing agreement by litigation, which would be ruinous for Mr Holyoake, but which I have found not to be an unlawful threat.  And I have also found that the Defendants did not commit the tort of abuse of process.  CPC was not obliged to give Mr Holyoake any further time at all.  Leaving aside for the moment the impact of the CCA, it could stipulate for whatever terms it wanted as the price of granting a further extension: as I have already said, that was no doubt an example of CPC using its commercial muscle, but I do not see that it was unlawful.  In my judgment therefore this second conspiracy claim is not made out either. </p>

By s. 21 of the Theft Act, a person is guilty of blackmail if, with a view to gain for himself or with intent to cause loss to another, he makes any unwarranted demand with menaces; and for this purpose a demand with menaces is unwarranted unless the person making it does so in the belief (a) that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand and (b) that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.

I was not however addressed on what counts as “menaces” for the crime of blackmail, or whether it includes every threat.  “Menaces” is no doubt an ordinary English word and in ordinary use it has overtones of something more sinister than a simple threat – for a creditor to tell a debtor that unless he agree to X the creditor will sue him is undoubtedly a threat but I rather doubt it would be ordinarily be regarded as menacing, even if the litigation were likely to be ruinous.   </p>

So for example, I have concluded that it was inappropriate for Wragges to threaten to advertise a statutory demand (paragraph 214 above).  Even if however that were to be correctly characterised as “menaces”, the Defendants would not be guilty of blackmail if they believed that they had reasonable grounds for making the demands in the letter, and that the threat to advertise was proper (which I have found that they did believe (paragraph 215 above)); and in criminal proceedings the onus would be on the prosecution to negative this if the issue were raised.

That was a threat, and may or may not have amounted to “menaces”, but no attempt was made to establish that Mr Candy either did not believe that he had reasonable grounds for making the demands, or that he did not believe that the threat was proper.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Lord submitted that all that was disclosed was that Mr Holyoake had entered into a loan with CPC and there was no explanation as to why that was personal data.  As I have said, there is no doubt that if that information was data, it was personal data, but I agree that the Claimants have not explained on what basis it was <span style="font-style:italic">“data”</span>.  Mr Stewart simply submitted that the information was data, but without explaining how that fitted with the elaborate definition in s. 1(1).  I received I think no submissions at all on this aspect of the case, but it is apparent from that definition that not all information held by one person about another is personal data, but only information that falls within one of the five sub-paragraphs (a) to (e).  Of these (d) can be ignored (accessible record being defined by s. 68 in terms that plainly do not apply to CPC as it refers to health, educational, housing and social security records), as can (e), as CPC is not a public authority.  Of the others I have not entirely understood what the precise scope of (a) and (b) is intended to be, but (a) would seem to be effective to catch computerised records of all sorts, as <span style="font-style:italic">“processing”</span> information expressly includes <span style="font-style:italic">“holding” </span>it, so a computerised record seems to me to be information which is being held, and hence which is being processed, by means of equipment operating automatically.  I am not entirely clear what the precise purpose and effect of the remaining words is, but if a computerised record is created, that would I think be an example of information being processed by the computer in response to instructions given to it for that purpose; (b) would then include manual records of information which was intended to be entered into a computer, and (c) manual records but only if they constituted a <span style="font-style:italic">“relevant filing system”</span> which requires that the information be structured in such a way that specific information in relation to a particular individual is readily accessible. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">No attempt was I think made to explore in evidence what records CPC kept of the loan to Mr Holyoake or in what form.  But there must have been some record somewhere, and I am prepared to assume that information about the loan would either have been recorded in a computerised record or in a manual record structured in such a way as to enable CPC and its directors to retrieve information about Mr Holyoake specifically.  If nothing else, CPC no doubt had a copy of the Loan Agreement, which would have been either stored on a computer or in hard copy, and if the latter in such a way as to enable CPC to find it.  It seems to me therefore that CPC must have held information about the loan to Mr Holyoake that was recorded in such a way as to be <span style="font-style:italic">“data”</span> and hence <span style="font-style:italic">“personal data”</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">What I have found much less straightforward is whether that means that CPC were processing that information when Mr Candy disclosed the existence of the loan to Mr Holyoake.  By 12 March 2012 Mr Candy cannot have needed to look at CPC’s records (computerised or manual) to discover that CPC had made a loan to Mr Holyoake: that was something that he was by then very well aware of as he was living with it every day.  There is no doubt that disclosing data is processing it, and that data includes the information held in a relevant record, and in a straightforward case a person who looks something up on a computer, or in a manual filing system, obtains information from the record, and then discloses it, is processing that data.  (There is in fact a provision in s. 1(2)(b) which provides that disclosing personal data includes disclosing the information contained in the data, although I have not understood why this is necessary or what it adds as data is itself defined as information, not as the record in which it is held).  But Mr Candy did not do this: what he did is disclose information which was in fact the same information as was recorded in CPC’s records but without taking the information from the record.  That raises what, to my mind at any rate, is not a simple question which is whether he thereby disclosed the information in the record.   </p>

What in my judgment he disclosed was the information in his head, not the information in CPC’s records, and the fact that the same information could in fact be found in CPC’s records does not mean that what he was disclosing was <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> information.  I should say that I can see arguments to the contrary and in the absence of any submissions, I am far from confident that I have reached the right conclusion; but I have to decide the point, and it seems to me that the purpose of the Act is to regulate what a data controller does with information stored in a relevant record, and it does not seem consonant with that for the Act also to regulate what a person does with information in his own head that has not been derived from the records. </p>

I will however briefly say that if I am wrong (i) Mr Candy, as well as CPC, was in my view a <span style="font-style:italic">“data controller”</span> as he in practice was the person who decided whether to tell Investec about the loan and so was <span style="font-style:italic">“a person who … determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed”</span>; but (ii) the disclosure would have fallen within para 6(1) of sch 2 as being necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller: see paragraph 261 above where I concluded that if Mr Candy had disclosed the existence of the loan to Investec it could only have been because he thought he needed to do this to explain why CPC wanted to take over Investec’s position, and that this would not have been in breach of the Loan Agreement.  I also accept Mr Lord’s submission that Mr Holyoake was not in fact prejudiced in any way by the disclosure: Investec were not interested in selling their position to CPC.  I accept that damages for contravention of the Act are not limited to damages for pecuniary loss and can be awarded for distress: see <span style="font-style:italic">Vidal-Hall v Google Inc </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 311 where the Court of Appeal held that s. 13(2), which confines damages for distress to certain specific situations, should be disapplied on the grounds that it conflicted with rights granted by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  But I would have taken some persuading that Mr Holyoake in fact suffered any distress requiring compensation: he was in fact very shortly afterwards buoyed up by the fact that Investec had supported him, describing it in oral evidence as having given him a spring in his step and a feeling of confidence.  </p>

For these purposes, the relevant data is the information recorded in the PNC and the relevant data controller is the police authority with responsibility for the records held on the PNC.  Mr Knuckey is said to have committed an offence under s. 55 of the DPA (which makes it an offence for a person knowingly or recklessly to obtain or disclose personal data without the consent of the data controller) and the Defendants to have been guilty both of offences under s. 44 or s. 45 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 (which make it offences to encourage or assist someone else to commit an offence), and of s. 55 of the DPA themselves (on the basis that they had knowingly or recklessly obtained data without the consent of the relevant police authority, and disclosed it to each other).  This claim fails because I have held that it is not open to the Defendants in this action to go behind the decision of Warby J that Mr Knuckey did not unlawfully access the PNC, and that even if it were, the allegation is not established (paragraphs 299-300 above).  I proceed on the basis that Mr Knuckey obtained the information properly from some publicly available source, although no attempt was made to explain to me what that might be.       </p>

That was the information that he had no unspent criminal convictions: that was clearly recorded somewhere, and I accept that that information was therefore his personal data.  It is then said that in obtaining that information, the Defendants were engaged in processing the data, <span style="font-style:italic">“processing”</span> being expressly defined to include <span style="font-style:italic">“obtaining” </span>data or information; and that by receiving and sharing the data they became data controllers. </p>

Mr Lord relies again on para 6(1) of sch 2, submitting that CPC had a legitimate interest in knowing if Mr Holyoake (or indeed Mr Wells) had a criminal record as that information could obviously have been material to the approach taken to the recovery of the loan.  I accept this submission, and it is not clear to me whether the claim for breach of s. 4(4) was dependent on the allegation that Mr Knuckey had accessed the PNC unlawfully (in which case the data would not have been obtained fairly and lawfully) or whether it was intended to be independent of that allegation.  If the latter, then on the assumption that Mr Knuckey obtained the information properly from some public source, I do not see anything unfair or unlawful (or prejudicial to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of Mr Holyoake for the purposes of the exception to para 6(1) of sch 2) in CPC discovering that Mr Holyoake had no unspent convictions.  Nor can this have caused him any damage, and it is difficult to see that it could have caused him any distress at the time when he did not know about it.  Now that he does know about it, it is no doubt galling to discover that the Defendants thought he might have spent time in prison and wanted to find out if he had, but the discovery by Mr Smith that he had not, and his sharing that with the other Defendants, does not seem to me to be something that can itself have caused distress. </p>

As set out above (paragraph 132(5)) cl 8.3 simply provided that Mr Holyoake should pay the Redemption Amount at the same time as making payment under cl 8.2; and cl 8.2 gave Mr Holyoake an option to repay the Loan at any time (with an obligation on him to repay early on a sale before the end of the 2 year period).  The short answer to this contention is that cl 8.3 is not a provision expressed to operate on breach.  It is expressed to operate on repayment of the loan early.  In effect the terms on which the loan was made were that if Mr Holyoake borrowed £12m, he would repay £17.74m, whether he repaid at the end of 2 years or chose to repay it earlier.  In my judgment cl 8.3 was part of the primary obligations, both as a matter of form and as a matter of substance.  It was not an imposition of a punishment for breach of contract.  It is therefore not within the scope of the penalty rule.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is a longer answer.   This is that the £5.74m was not in the event paid under cl 8.3 at all.  In terms cl 8.3 applied if the loan was repaid early.  In December 2011 Mr Holyoake did indeed say that he intended to repay the loan early (paragraph 191 above) but he did not in fact do so.  What happened instead is that he signed the Supplemental Loan Agreement on 10 February 2012 which, among other things, amended cl 11.1 to make it clear that in the event of a default the Redemption Amount became payable, something which was not clear before (paragraph 219(2) above).  When Mr Holyoake defaulted in complying with the Supplemental Loan Agreement, the effect was that the £17.74m became payable under cl 11.1 as amended.  That provision was indeed a provision which operated on breach, and so was within the scope of the penalty rule, but there are I think nevertheless three reasons why that does not entitle Mr Holyoake to relief.   </p>

I see nothing extravagant in CPC stipulating that if he defaulted and the loan became due, CPC should be entitled to the same sum of £17.74m that would otherwise have been due from him; it would be surprising if by defaulting on his obligations, he could be liable for a lesser sum than if he simply wished to repay early.  In my judgment therefore the express provision in cl 11.1 as amended by the Supplemental Loan Agreement that in the event of default he became liable to pay the Redemption Amount was not a penalty.     </p>

Instead he agreed in the Escrow Deed of 14 June 2012 that if he did not repay the debt and did not complete the SPA a new debt of £17.74m would arise (paragraph 328(4) above).  On the face of it that was a new obligation, and since under the terms of the Escrow Deed he was not obliged either to complete the refinancing and repay the debt, or to complete the SPA, this new obligation was itself not one that operated on breach, but on failure of a condition.  That may be an example of clever drafting, but it seems to me that the effect is that Mr Holyoake agreed to pay the £17.74m not as a penalty for breach of contract but as a consequence of neither refinancing nor completing the SPA, and that that obligation was therefore not within the penalty rule.  The debt was thereafter restated regularly, but if I am right that Mr Holyoake agreed to pay the £17.74m in the Escrow Deed in circumstances that it was not a penalty, nothing that thereafter happened made it one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The next set of provisions that are said to be penalties are those charging the Extension Fees.  The first Extension Fees were charged under the Extension Agreement of 26 October 2012 (paragraph 343 above).  Under this agreement, two Extension Fees of £1.8m and £1.7m were payable, with provision for them to be credited against the debt if paid on time.  In the event £1m of the first Extension Fee was not paid and was added to the debt (paragraph 344 above).  The remaining Extension Fees were payable under successive agreements as follows: the Second Extension Agreement of 23 November 2012 (£2m), the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement of 15 October 2013 (£2m), the Fourth Supplemental Extension Agreement of 20 December 2013 (£1m) and the Final Supplemental Extension Agreement of 15 January 2014 (£1.5m) (paragraphs 345, 370, 375 and 376 above).

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I will start with the latter four agreements, taking as an example the Second Extension Agreement.  Here the position seems to me very simple.  Mr Holyoake was in default under the previous agreement (the Extension Agreement) with the result that in accordance with its terms the whole debt had become due and indeed CPC had issued proceedings for it (paragraph 344 above).  CPC agreed instead to give him more time for repaying in return for the Extension Fee of £2m.  That is as I have already said the price that CPC demanded for the extension (paragraph 423 above).  Mr Holyoake agreed to that price because he needed the extension.  He therefore entered into the Second Extension Agreement under which payment of the Extension Fee was a primary obligation, payable in any event, not simply on default.  As a matter of form therefore this provision did not operate on breach and did not engage the penalty rule.  Nor in my judgment did it do so in substance either.  It is true that the occasion which gave rise to the charging of the Extension Fee was the fact that Mr Holyoake was in breach of the previous agreement (the Extension Agreement), and in this loose sense the £2m can be regarded as the charge payable by him for his default – indeed it can be regarded as an example of the <span style="font-style:italic">“Bad Boy penalties”</span> Mr Christian Candy had referred to (paragraph 280 above).  If the Extension Agreement itself had provided that on any breach a fee of £2m would be payable, the penalty rule would no doubt have been engaged.  But it did not, and the £2m was not payable under the terms of the Extension Agreement: Mr Holyoake was not on 22 November 2012 under any obligation to pay it at all.  What made it payable was not a provision of the Extension Agreement but Mr Holyoake’s entry into the Second Extension Agreement under which he received an extension of time.  That illustrates that in a real and substantive, and not just a formal, sense, this was a payment in return for consideration rather than a payment due under an obligation arising on breach.  If that is so, the penalty rule is not engaged and the question of whether the price was an extravagant or exorbitant one does not arise.  The penalty rule is not available to regulate the price payable </p>

But the same effect could have been achieved by providing that Mr Holyoake should make interim payments in respect of the debt with provision for the payments to be added to the debt if not paid in time.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have come to the conclusion that it is not.  The point does not seem to me entirely straightforward (and I have had no assistance on this question by way of submissions) as I can see the force of the argument that there is no real difference in substance between a provision which says “<span style="font-style:italic">you will pay me £x in reduction of your debt but if you do not pay on time, the debt will increase by £x”</span> and a provision which says <span style="font-style:italic">“you will pay me £x, and if you pay me on time, the debt will reduce by £x”</span>, and if the penalty rule is to have practical value, it should not be too easy to circumvent it by drafting.  But the deciding factor is I think that the Extension Fee is expressly made payable in return for the extension of time.  In general parties are I think free to decide what sums payable under a contract are payable for, at any rate as between themselves.  That means that just as in the later Extension Agreements it was the price CPC demanded for the extension.  If cl 3.2 had not contained the proviso for reduction of debt (in other words if it had stopped after <span style="font-style:italic">“30</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> November 2012”</span>) I would have held it to be valid for the same reasons as the later Extension Fees.  In those circumstances, I do not see that the addition of the proviso (which was for Mr Holyoake’s benefit) can turn the provision into one which is really a punishment for breach of contract.  I therefore conclude, admittedly with some hesitation, that cl 3.2 is not in substance a provision operating on breach of contract and does not engage the penalty rule. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">The next agreement was the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement of 15 October 2013.  The background to this was that Mr Holyoake had paid the instalments due up to 3 April 2013 in accordance with the Second Extension Agreement, thereby reducing the outstanding debt to £13.6m, but had not paid anything on 30 April 2013.  CPC had asserted that Hotblack had not by then entered into a Qualifying Contract with the result that the entire £13.6m became due as a New Debt on the next business day, namely 1 May 2013.  At the time Mr Holyoake disputed that (although it is now accepted that CPC were right), but since an instalment of £750,000 was due on 30 April 2013 even if Hotblack had entered into a Qualifying Contract, and that was not paid, it did not make any difference as the £13.6m would have become due on 1 May 2013 in any event (as indeed pleaded by CPC in its fourth claim issued on 3 September 2013).  The Second Supplemental Extension Agreement gave Mr Holyoake an extension to pay until 24 January 2014 (with an obligation to make two interim payments).  By that stage the £13.6m had been reduced to £13.3m, but the Debt was restated not as £13.3m but as £13.3m together with all interest that had accrued on the debt under the Second Extension Agreement.  That was, or should have been, interest on £13.6m (reducing to £13.3m) from 1 May 2013 at 15% compounded monthly: the figure which it is agreed was in fact charged was £970,299, and no attempt has been made to challenge that as a matter of calculation.  By cl 4.4 interest was payable on the Debt at 15% per annum from the Effective Date, which was 18 October 2013.  The effect of that was interest started to accrue both on the £13.3m and the £970,299 from 18 October.         </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Were these interest charges payable under contractual provisions operating on a breach of contract?  I will start with the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement.  This provided for an extension of time to repay the Debt as defined until the Final Repayment Date of 24 January 2014 (or earlier sale), subject to the payment of interim repayments, with a provision in cl 4.4 that interest would run in the meantime from 18 October 2013, that is from 3 days after the agreement.  That was not dependent on there being a breach of the agreement: even if Mr Holyoake had kept scrupulously to the timetable for repayment laid down in the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement, he would have had to pay interest at 15% per annum (simple, not compounded) from 18 October under cl 4.4.  In fact Mr Holyoake defaulted in making the interim repayments required by the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement, but he was not charged any more interest under cl 4.4 than if he had not defaulted.  It seems to me, consistent with the analysis I have adopted in relation to the Extension Fees, that in those circumstances cl 4.4 was neither in form nor in substance a provision that operated on breach of contract.  It was simply part of the price of CPC agreeing to the new repayment profile set out in the agreement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The same analysis applies to the Third, Fourth and Final Supplemental Extension Agreements.  In each case the fact that Mr Holyoake had defaulted in complying with the previous agreement gave CPC the opportunity to demand a new price for a further extension which in practice consisted of not only charging an Extension Fee but of restating the Debt to include the interest accrued under the previous agreement.  Each new agreement then provided that interest should accrue from the date of the agreement.  Again that was not dependent on breach, and Mr Holyoake would have been liable for it whether or not he had complied with the new timetable laid down.  Those provisions were not, it seems to me, either in form or in substance, provisions that operated on breach of contract, and they did not engage the penalty rule.  </p>

Instead the Debt (at that stage £16.85m) could be repaid in accordance with one or other of the repayment schedules (either by 30 April 2013 if no Qualifying Contract had been entered into, or by 1 October 2013 if one had).  Those repayment schedules were each calculated to lead to the repayment of precisely £16.85m and if Mr Holyoake had adhered to them, he would not have been charged any further interest.

By the time of the Second Extension Agreement on 23 November 2012 CPC were entitled to payment of the £17.74m – indeed they had had a good claim to the £17.74m since 28 February 2012 under the terms of the Supplemental Loan Agreement, but had repeatedly given Mr Holyoake more time in the series of Escrow Deeds and then the Extension Agreement.  In the Second Extension Agreement, CPC again gave more time for repayment in accordance with a repayment schedule while stipulating that if there were a default, the balance of the debt would all become due and interest would thereafter be payable.  It is not suggested that it was penal to stipulate for the balance to become due on default, and I do not see how it could have been: such provisions are standard in agreements for payment of liabilities by agreed instalments, and CPC were already entitled to payment of the whole sum in any event: see <span style="font-style:italic">The Angelic Star</span> [1988] 1 Ll Rep 122 at 125 col 2 per Lord Donaldson MR (<span style="font-style:italic">“the mere fact that the capital sum becomes immediately repayable upon a failure to comply with the conditions upon </span></p>

So the only question is whether, if the balance became due, it would be penal to stipulate for interest in addition.  That too seems to me to be a standard provision in commercial loan agreements: once the debtor is in default, the creditor is not only being kept out of his money but running an enhanced credit risk: see the approval in <span style="font-style:italic">Cavendish Square Holding BV v Makdessi</span> of the decision of Colman J in <span style="font-style:italic">Lordsvale Finance plc v Bank of Zambia</span> [1996] QB 752.  I have already said that no challenge was made to the rate as such, but only to the principle; but once the £17.74m (or the balance of it) was due, I do not see that it was penal to require the defaulting debtor to pay interest if it was not paid, however the £17.74m had originally been made up. </p>

So far as the settlement of claims by Mr Holyoake was concerned, it provided at cl 4.1(a) for a full and final settlement of <span style="font-style:italic">“all actual or potential claims and causes of action, past, present and future, whether known or unknown” </span>which he might have against CPC, and that seems to me wide enough to include a claim that the interest charged under cl 4.1 of the Second Extension Agreement was a penalty.

That rather tortuous definition seems to me to be satisfied here: the Settlement Deed was an agreement entered into by Holyoake with CPC; it was initiated by CPC (Mr Dean and Mr Christian Candy having told Mr Holyoake the agreements had to be cleansed); and Mr Holyoake entered into it for a purpose related to the principal agreement, namely to obtain CPC’s agreement to the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement (which was itself a credit agreement).

The plaintiff had sued the defendant on a number of loans, the defendant defending the action on the grounds that the plaintiff was an unregistered moneylender.  The action was compromised shortly before trial, the defendant agreeing to abandon the contention that the plaintiff was a moneylender and to pay the plaintiff various sums.  When he defaulted and the plaintiff sued him on the compromise agreement, the defendant contended that it was not binding, again relying on the Moneylenders Acts.  The Court of Appeal held that he was bound by the agreement.  Lord Denning MR said that the Moneylenders Acts were for the protection of borrowers and the judges would not therefore allow a moneylender to use a compromise as a means of getting round the Act; but it was important that the courts should enforce compromises agreed in good faith between lender and borrower (at 158A-B, D-F): </p>

I am satisfied that there was something to be said on both sides.  On the one hand, it is not obviously fair on the face of it that in return for a loan of £12m in October 2011, CPC should be entitled on default not only to 2 years’ interest immediately, making the total repayable £17.74m, but in addition further interest on the both the £12m and the £5.74m from May 2013 when they have already had (or at any rate become entitled to) interest up to October 2013.  And although I have held that the pressure exerted by CPC was not unlawful, I accept that that the combination of the risks of litigation and the personal liability of Mr Holyoake did put pressure on him to agree to CPC’s demands.    </p>

That put him under pressure to agree CPC’s terms for the loan, including the term in cl 8.3 that the entire interest should be payable if the loan were repaid early.  He approached the Candys on the basis that he needed their loan as a back-up for other financing that had fallen through, and allowed them to proceed in the belief that they were his mezzanine funders, not telling them about the Oscarone loan and successfully deceiving them about it throughout the period of the loan.  If Mr Christian Candy had known about Oscarone he would not have lent at all.  He told the Candys he had £120m in net assets when he knew that that was, even on the most generous view, a stretch, and did so because he thought he could if necessary talk his way out of any allegation of breach, without reckoning on the tenacity and persistence of Mr Christian Candy and CPC in pursuing the point.  He charged properties to Aeriance and lied about that to CPC as well.  From December 2011 onwards he repeatedly promised repayment of the full £17.74m when he in fact had no intention of repaying, and he then got Mr Pym to lie about the £13.5m having been drawn down when it had not been.  He allowed CPC to enter into a whole series of Escrow Deeds in the belief that he was genuinely considering completing the SPAs when he had no such intention.  He lied about Sherbourne being an arm’s length third party to his own solicitor, and to CPC about the Sherbourne contract being a Qualifying Contract.  These matters would all be likely to go both to the question whether the relationship was unfair and to the question whether relief should be granted to him under the CCA.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the Settlement Deed was a bona fide compromise.  In my view it should be given effect to and not disturbed.  Taking the matters I have referred to above from <span style="font-style:italic">Binder</span>: there was indeed a genuine dispute whether Mr Holyoake had any viable CCA claims, there was a fair arguable case on each side, the compromise was bona fide and its terms were not colourable, and Mr Holyoake entered into it after receiving legal advice.  Lord Denning MR also refers to whether the agreement reached was fair and reasonable, but this cannot require the Court to undertake a detailed examination of the underlying merits of the claims, as the whole purpose of the compromise is to avoid the necessity for that.  That is why Roskill LJ referred to taking a broad view, and, taking a broad view, I consider that the terms were fair and reasonable.  In return for giving up his CCA claims, Mr Holyoake not only obtained CCA’s release of its claims under the existing contracts, but also the withdrawal of the proceedings (in which, as Mr Lord submitted, the Qualifying Contract deception would have come to light) and a significant extension of time to sell GGH.   </p>

That therefore covers not only the fact that the £17.74m became payable on default, but also the Extension Fees charged up to and including the Second Supplemental Extension Deed (totalling £5m), the interest charged under the Second Extension Agreement (of £970,299) and the obligation in the Second JMA to market GGH.  I do not think it matters whether technically I find that the relationship was not unfair because the parties had agreed to compromise that issue; or whether I say that even if unfair, I decline to make any order in these respects under s. 140B.

Of the five matters pleaded (paragraph 506 above), the first is the threats, intimidation and coercion, but there are none relied on which took place after that date.  The second is the acceleration of the debt and interest but this had already taken place under the Supplemental Loan Agreement, and was accepted by Mr Holyoake in the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement.  The fourth is the obligation to pay interest not only on the principal amount of the debt but also on the accelerated interest; this too was accepted by Mr Holyoake in the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement which provided for interest on the entirety of the Debt (hence including the accelerated interest) from 18 October 2013.  The fifth was the obligation to market and sell GGH under the JMAs; this was accepted by Mr Holyoake in the Second JMA.  As I have already said the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement and Second JMA were themselves part of the compromise embodied in the Settlement Deed, and I do not think these features of the relationship can be regarded as unfair for the remainder of the period of the loan; or if they are, I decline to make any order under s. 140B in respect of them.   </p>

Only two Extension Fees were thereafter charged: £1m in the Fourth Supplemental Extension Agreement, and £1.5m in the Final Supplemental Extension Agreement.  The Fourth Supplemental Extension Agreement was entered into on 20 December 2013 when Mr Holyoake was unable to pay an instalment of £750,000 due on that day under the Third Supplemental Extension Agreement, and by its terms he was given until 10 January 2014 to pay it and until 20 January 2014 to repay the Debt (paragraph 375 above).  At the time he was in the process of attempting a sale of GGH to a purchaser called City Developments Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“CDL”</span>).  The Final Supplemental Extension Agreement was entered into on 15 January 2014 after Mr Holyoake only paid £333,000 of the £750,000 on 10 January, and by its terms he was given until 14 February to pay both it and the balance of the Debt, provided contracts for the sale of GGH were exchanged by 22 January 2014 (paragraph 376 above).  That was to enable him to sell GGH to the ultimate purchaser (Key Platinum).  In each case, if he had not agreed the terms of the extension, the whole Debt would have become due on the next Business Day after his default (23 December 2013 and 13 January 2014 respectively), and under the terms of the relevant JMA CPC would also have been entitled to exercise step-in rights.   </p>

It was no doubt in his commercial interest to do so.  What however this analysis does not establish is whether the actual fees demanded were fair or not. </p>

Indeed s. 140B(1)(a) and (c) expressly confer powers on the Court to require the creditor to repay part of a sum paid by the debtor or to reduce any sum payable by the debtor, and the obvious circumstances in which that would be appropriate would be if the Court thought that a particular charge that had been paid or was payable (a fee, or a rate of interest) was unfairly high.

That is a reference to the fact that Arlington was proposing to charge total fees of £3.5m (£1.5m initial fees and £2m exit fees) on a facility of £53.5m for 9 months.  I do not think that Mr Dean was seeking to justify the fee by comparison with that charged by Arlington, and if he had been, it is apparent that there is little comparison with fees charged for a loan of £53.5m for a 9 month facility and fees charged for an extension of a month for a debt of what was then some £17m or so.  (Interestingly, although no reliance was placed on this by either side, the Arlington facility contained provision for extension of the facility for 3 months in return for an extension fee of 100 basis points of the loan, which I take to mean 1% or £535,000).  Rather, I think Mr Dean was referring back to something he had said earlier when asked about the £2m Extension Fee charged by the Second Supplemental Extension Agreement, as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">But that is not the statutory question.  The statutory question under s. 140A(1) is whether the Court determines that the relationship is unfair, and in assessing that the Court can have regard to anything it considers relevant under s. 140A(2).  The matters that seem to me most relevant are as follows.  Mr Holyoake was not a naïve consumer who did not understand what he was doing, but was a sophisticated borrower who had borrowed money for commercial purposes in order to try and make a profit from a business venture.  He understood exactly what sums CPC were stipulating as the price for the extensions.  He was only in the position of having to ask for extensions because of his defaults, which were the latest in a very long line of broken promises.  Although he protested at the sums demanded, he agreed to them: as Mr Lord submitted, he was obviously willing to pay the price, and if he thought the price was too high, he could have refused.  What he was buying was not so much credit for a few more days, but the opportunity to continue to try and achieve a sale, first to CDL, and then at a significantly higher cash price to Key Platinum (CDL’s final position had been a sale for £78m cash, with a retention of £11m until a rights of light issue had been resolved, and apartments worth £7m, whereas the sale to Key Platinum was a straight sale at £90m).  That was a price that Mr Holyoake considered worth paying, and Mr Holyoake was no doubt right, as if he had not paid the price CPC required, it is doubtful if either of those sales could have been completed and there was a real risk that if CPC had sued him or exercised its step-in rights, a sale would have been much less advantageous.  In effect therefore what CPC was doing, as Mr Candy effectively admitted, was taking advantage of the fact that Mr Holyoake, having failed to keep to the timetable he had agreed to, needed extensions to sell GGH, and putting a price on that which they judged, correctly, Mr Holyoake would find it commercially worth his while to pay.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In those circumstances I am persuaded, accepting that the onus is on CPC, that even though the extension fees may have been steep, the relationship between the parties was not unfair.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether I would have exercised my discretion under s. 140B(1) had I determined that the relationship between the parties was unfair.  Mr Lord submitted that in that event the Court should refuse relief because of Mr Holyoake’s repeated dishonesty: cf <span style="font-style:italic">Ketley v Scott </span>[1981] ICR 241, a decision on the previous provisions in ss. 137-140 CCA where Foster J, having found that the interest charged was not extortionate, said he would have refused to reopen the transaction in any event in view of four deceitful acts of the borrower.  Although the point does not now arise, I think it very likely that I would have taken the same view in the present case.  In particular, if Mr Holyoake had not pretended that the Sherbourne contract was a Qualifying Contract, the debt would have fallen due on 1 May 2013 and CPC would have acquired step-in rights to sell GGH.  It is impossible to know precisely what would have happened, but I think it is probable that CPC would have stepped in and sold GGH.  That would be likely to have realised less than the ultimate sale to Key Platinum, and there would be no question of the Extension Fees of £1m and £1.5m.  In those circumstances I do not think it would have been appropriate to reopen the payment of Extension Fees which Mr Holyoake would probably not have paid if he had not been deceitful about the Sherbourne contract, and which probably enabled him to realise more on a sale of GGH than would then have been the case.  </p>
