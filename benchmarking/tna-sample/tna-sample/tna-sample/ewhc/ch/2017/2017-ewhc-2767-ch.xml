This is one of several difficult factual questions that will have to be resolved in the course of this Judgment, and I will not anticipate the point, save to observe that Mr. Belokon, if no-one else, was under the impression that there was at least a “gentleman’s agreement” between himself and Mr. Owen Oyston along the lines that, in return for the total of £4.5 million that he had paid over (i.e., £1.8m pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, £1m pursuant to the First Vlada Loan Agreement and £1.7m pursuant to the Second Vlada Loan Agreement), he would, in due course, receive a shareholding on a par with that of Segesta and that, in the meantime, Blackpool FC would be run jointly. I shall refer to this supplement to the written agreements as the “gentleman’s agreement”. This sub-paragraph is intended to do no more than identify the fact that Mr. Belokon considered such an agreement to exist: this is important in terms of understanding the sequence of events. I stress that this sub-paragraph says <span style="text-decoration:underline">nothing</span> about whether there in fact was a gentleman’s agreement or, if there was such an agreement, what its terms were.

This, again, is a matter that is controversial between the parties, on which specific factual findings will have to be made. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Mr. Belokon considered that Mr. Owen Oyston was reneging on the gentleman’s agreement. Mr. Owen Oyston, of course, denies the existence of any such agreement and accordingly denies the “breach” even of a non-legally binding agreement. Again, this sub-paragraph says nothing about what agreement (if any) was, or was not, reached between Mr. Owen Oyston and Mr. Belokon and whether it was or was not breached. What is important is that the mismatch between the respective understandings of Mr. Owen Oyston and Mr. Belokon effectively brought the previously good relationship between them to a more-or-less abrupt end. </p>

Belokon 1 was given in Russian – Mr. Belokon’s first language – and translated into English – Mr. Belokon’s second language. Mr. Belokon gave evidence over three days, on 13, 14 and 15 June 2017 (Days 2, 3 and 4 of the trial). Mr. Belokon was an affable witness, who gave his evidence with the assistance of an interpreter. Although Mr. Belokon’s English was undoubtedly good – indeed, outstanding for conversational purposes – it rapidly became clear when he came to give evidence that Mr. Belokon’s original plan of giving evidence in English, with occasional interpreter support, lost a great deal of the nuance that Mr. Belokon was trying to convey. With my active encouragement, and certainly for the second and third days of his evidence, Mr. Belokon essentially gave his evidence in Russian, which was translated for him into English. Although this inevitably slowed the proceedings down, it was in my judgment necessary in the interests of receiving Mr. Belokon’s evidence properly. </p>

He was very clear when he could not remember something; and equally clear when – a document, for example – might have passed under his nose with only the broadest of explanations as to what was going on. Mr. Belokon was, as I accept, a busy businessman, with multiple interests, who delegated the detail and outlined what he wanted his staff to achieve. Because Mr. Belokon was clear in demarcating what he knew as opposed to what his staff knew, I consider that I can place considerable reliance on what, strategically, Mr. Belokon thought he was achieving in his dealings with the Oystons. Of course, whether his subjective intentions were in fact realised in the communications crossing the line between the Belokon Side and the Oyston Side is an altogether different matter, which goes to the heart of the issues that were before me. </p>

He gave evidence on 16 June 2017 (Day 5). Mr. Malnacs’ first language was Latvian, his second English. Both Mr. Belokon and he agreed that his Russian came a poor third. His witness statement and his oral evidence were both given in English, and his English was formidable. He had no need of – and did not have – a Latvian interpreter. He was an impressive witness, who gave his evidence clearly and honestly. He was in no sense in awe of his boss, although Mr. Malnacs obviously respected Mr. Belokon. I consider that Mr. Malnacs’ evidence was entirely independent of Mr. Belokon’s: Mr. Malnacs was his own man. This was particularly clear in his assessment of the Oyston Side and in his view of Mr. Belokon’s relationship with the Oyston Side. Mr. Malnacs considered Mr. Belokon too trusting of the Oyston Side, and too dismissive of Mr. Malnacs’ own reports of the state of play at Blackpool FC.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="11">

Varpins 1 was in English and Mr. Varpins gave his evidence in English. Mr. Varpins’ English was not of the same standard as Mr. Malnacs’, and Mr. Varpins’ answers in cross-examination tended to be short and to the point. It would be idle to speculate whether Mr. Varpins’ answers would have been materially any different had he given his evidence in Latvian. He gave his evidence honestly. I am unsure, however, to what extent his evidence actually was of assistance to the Court. That is no criticism of Mr. Varpins. Mr. Varpins came on the scene when the relationship between Mr. Belokon and the Oyston Side had fractured. Throughout Mr. Varpins’ tenure as a director, the relationship between the Belokon Side and the Oyston Side was not a fruitful one and there was a good deal of mutual antipathy and mistrust – and so, lack of co-operation – on both sides. Although Mr. Varpins was cross-examined in detail on the events that occurred during his tenure as director, my sense was that – particularly after the commencement of these proceedings, but even </p>

I found him generally incapable of answering a question straightforwardly. He had a marked tendency, not to give evidence, but to advocate. This was not aided by the fact that his actual recollection of events was extremely poor. Although, therefore, I consider that he sought to tell the truth as he saw it, he was an unimpressive witness, and I cannot place very much weight on his evidence. As a person, Mr. Karl Oyston seemed to me to be a forceful character, capable of firm and probably harsh leadership. When crossed, he could react badly and be quite rude, as his documentary exchanges with Mr. Malnacs show. Fundamentally, however, it was not he, but his father, who set the strategic direction for Blackpool FC (and, indeed, for the Oyston Group as a whole), with Mr. Karl Oyston implementing the strategy determined upon by Mr. Owen Oyston.

Like Mr. Karl Oyston, his evidence to me contained substantial elements of advocacy, and many of his answers to Mr. Green Q.C.’s questions were long and basically unresponsive to the question being posed. Mr. Oyston also showed a capacity for embellishing his evidence with detail which appeared nowhere in his witness statement. I am quite sceptical as to the evidential worth of such embellishment. As with Mr. Karl Oyston, I am prepared to accept that Mr. Owen Oyston was doing his best to assist the court.

It was not possible, in the course of the trial, to traverse the detail of this chronology – in particular, the costs it is said by the Respondents were incurred. On the other hand, it was not disputed by VB Football Assets that the Oyston Side had, over time, spent money on the stadium. Indeed, an “undisputed” but necessarily less populated chronology, setting out what was agreed by VB Football Assets, was helpfully produced by VB Football Assets. Nevertheless, because of its greater detail, I use the chronology at Annex 2 as a broad guide to the stadium’s development, without making any express findings as to the accuracy of the detail, and fully recognising that its content is not agreed by VB Football Assets.  </p>

To attempt to do so would be costly and ultimately, we are advised by the Football League’s lawyers, unsuccessful. Secondly we do have a serious problem where we may not be able to exploit the very substantial tax losses that currently exist within Blackpool FC. We believe we have a very good chance of using these tax losses if we do our venture within the Football Club.

I have agreed to this because I really believe that you and your team and Karl and I can work together and create an exciting outcome and if we were successful in reaching the Premier League, the sums would be so substantial that I would not be concerned about the extent of my past investment. I was able to confirm with Karl and advise your colleagues over the weekend that on joining the Premier League each club receives approximately £37m from television rights alone. This includes two parachute payments in the event that the club is relegated after one season. This figure of £37m does not take into account the increase in sponsorship, ticket sales and other associated revenues which would increase dramatically. It is my view in these great circumstances that Blackpool Football Club would be worth not less than £100m and probably a great deal more. I stress this is my opinion. I have never mentioned this potential before because I am sure, like me, you are aware of it and also aware of what our relatively modest investments could produce if we are successful.” </span>

That debt had been paid by Segesta in the form of shares in Blackpool FC. The letter then stated that “[a]s a result of a legal technicality, that has now come to light, the share issue to Zabaxe was invalid.” Accordingly, the shares returned to Segesta and the debt owed by Blackpool FC revived. Mr. Owen Oyston proposed that a deed be entered into, whereby Zabaxe would release Blackpool FC from the debt in exchange for Segesta agreeing to pay the debt. The letter concluded that “I thought that I should set out the situation and its background fully so that you and [Mr. Malnacs] are fully aware of the situation when the matter is brought up at the Club’s Board Meeting”. </p>

Owen Oyston reassured me that he would discuss with his tax advisors the possibility of formally making me an equal shareholder.  As [Blackpool FC] would not accumulate further losses due to Premier League money, I thought it likely that we could now arrange for formal parity. At the celebrations Owen also raised the possibility of taking a minimum of £5 million out of the Club to pay litigation costs, potential future litigation costs, and other personal “things” regarding which I was not given any further detail. He said that I should do the same. I dismissed the discussion at the time and I had no interest in the proposal. My view was that the new cash available in the Club should be used to invest in the squad and consolidate our position in the Premier League. At no point did I agree that Owen should take any money from the Club for his or his family’s personal use.” </span>

Owen and Karl Oyston were very excited by the prospect of the large sums of money that would flow into the Club from the Premier League. For the purposes of providing this witness statement I have reviewed what appear to be Owen Oyston’s notes of that meeting. As far as I can recall these notes reflect the topics discussed. They show Karl’s and Owen’s desire to benefit personally from the Club’s new found riches. At point 4 of these notes, Owen suggested that he and Mr. Belokon should be able to take personal loans from the Club of between £3-5 million. The note records that myself and Mr. Belokon did not agree. We were not happy with the suggestion that millions of pounds should be flowing out of the Club. Mr. Belokon and I wanted the Premier League money to be invested in the Club. It was likely that the Club would need to purchase players during the summer transfer window and we considered that any funds the Club had should be used for that purpose, not for loans to directors. </span>

It, in my judgment, corroborates the existence of the gentleman’s agreement. Had there been no gentleman’s agreement, Mr. Owen Oyston’s reaction would have been very different: it would have been along the lines of “I don’t want to sell any more shares in Blackpool FC” or “How much are you prepared to pay for additional shares?”.

At that event, Karl Oyston proposed that the East Stand in the Stadium needed to be re-developed to increase capacity and maximise the revenue that [Blackpool FC] would earn from ticket sales, as a result of the higher attendances that were expected during the Premier League season. The Oystons also explained that it was necessary to build a media centre before the Premier League season began in August, in order to comply with Premier League requirements. The East Stand was owned by Segesta and outside of the scope of the [Second South Stand Agreement]. However, as a major shareholder in the Club, we expected VBFA to be presented with financial information by Segesta on plans, like these, to develop the Stadium and we expected to agree the details before any work began. This was required by Clause 8 of the Shareholders Agreement. Mr. Belokon and I listened to the proposals at Claridge’s, which were of a general nature. </span>

I took the conversation with the Oystons at face value: that they were informing us of their intention to develop the East Stand. While there had been some discussion about how to use the additional funds available to [Blackpool FC] this did not include business plans or budgets for using this money to finance the East Stand redevelopment.

However, there is no evidence as to when the “aide memoire” was composed. It is entirely possible that it was written significantly after the event, with the aim of persuading the Belokon Side, in conjunction with the 22 September 2010 email, that significant disbursements out of Blackpool FC had been agreed. Certainly, the “aide memoire” stands in significant contradistinction with the witness statements of Mr. Belokon and Mr. Malnacs, which recall a discussion with regard to the spending of Blackpool FC’s money, but without the degree of firmness of conclusion expressed in the “aide memoire”. With that in mind, I turn to the cross-examination of the various witnesses. </p>

With that caution in mind, my reading of the first quoted line is that the references to repayments of “850”, “1000” and “4750” to “VB” are references to the repayments of the debts of £850,000, £1,000,000 and £4,750,000 owed by Segesta to VB Football Assets pursuant to the Second Vlada Loan Agreement, the First Vlada Loan Agreement and the Second South Stand Agreement respectively. Similarly, I consider that the second quoted line is likely to relate to the repayment of debts owed to Protoplan (for which the amount of £4,200,000 is specified), Mr. Owen Oyston and Zabaxe, which are, of course, the repayments contemplated in the email correspondence and letters of demand set out above. The numbers in brackets (“1” and “2”), which are circled in the handwritten note, may be an indication of the order in which the repayments were going to be made. </p>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">The loan agreement provided that no monies outstanding between BFC and Segesta should be repaid other than out of the proceeds of the rental income from the PCT. The mechanism was that the rental income belonged to Segesta but Segesta assigned the right to BFC which then used the money to repay the loan account between BFC and Segesta then use the monies to pay Protoplan. Unfortunately Protoplan was not party to the agreement and had always expected that Segesta would obtain bank borrowing to repay the cost of building the stadium. This proved difficult for Segesta and Protoplan was forced to take a long-deferred repayment of its debt. At May of this year Protoplan was still owed around £4.2 million. </span>

Due to the outstanding debt with Protoplan it was felt that it would be difficult if not impossible to find a firm willing to undertake this work if the previous construction work was not fully settled. The decision was made therefore to loan monies from BFC to Segesta to repay the Protoplan debt and fund the construction and upgrade of the stadium. </span>

It is up to BFC and Segesta to decide how the loan should be repaid and whether or not interest should be payable by Segesta. However I would point out that BFC are the main beneficiary of the work done initially by Protoplan and then later to complete the stadium as without this work they would not be able to play in the Premier league and qualify for the substantial broadcasting payments and prize monies of around £100,000,000 which will follow. As such the funding of the construction works and repayment of an outstanding trader debt to Protoplan seems a small price to pay. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">The three payments you listed (4,2 to Protoplan, 562K to [Mr. Owen Oyston], 944 to Zabaxe) as “investments”, all incurred before Valeri’s involvement and are not mentioned in the signed agreements, hence they should not be repaid by the [Blackpool FC] football revenues. I understand your dad’s desire to cover all pre-Valeri football losses, but then it should be explicitly agreed with Valeri. Thus, at the moment, from Valeri’s point of view 4,2m [Blackpool FC] transfer to Segesta is a loan whose status and terms should be clarified. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">From discussions with Valeri, I understand that he is ready for certain concessions. Prior to his involvement, [Blackpool FC] had accumulated transferable loss of 10,8m (in accordance to Rod) which could be considered your dad’s benefit. At 28% corporate income tax this would have brought 3,024m in tax savings to Segesta. Then it is no secret that [Blackpool FC]’s financial success is down to Valeri’s beliefs and readiness to risk money and your ability to fight players wages and agents. I think your dad and Valeri agreed to pay you a bonus of 1m. the two components together would constitute slightly over 4m. maybe with some bargaining Valeri would agree to declassify 4,2m as expense for [Blackpool FC]? This expense would also help us reduce your profit for the year, with no corporate tax payable assuming we stay up and pay bonuses. </span>

[Mr. Owen Oyston] insists that the stand should be the property of Segesta who owns the land and planning permission. In this case, from accounting point of view, this 1,9 million is considered [Blackpool FC] loan to Segesta. Since [Blackpool FC] is the only beneficiary, it would make sense that [Blackpool FC] “writes off” the debt. It could be done by Segesta invoicing [Blackpool FC] for management services in the amount of construction costs spread over say 5 years (roughly 400,000 a year). New agreement for this should be drafted. All income from East stand would be property of [Blackpool FC] (initial agreement Article 8(ii) and annex 6). </span>

He emphasised that Segesta owns 80% and technically could do whatever they want. We agreed to pay back players trust fund asap – will do the calculations make payment on Wednesday.

Thereafter [Belokon Holdings] will be left with a 20% stake in [Blackpool FC] which has cost some £1.8 million. That shareholding would be worth considerably more than this cost in todays value. For example Blackburn Rovers FC recently sold for £50 million. The group as a whole would have no external debt. After the accumulated losses of £13.85 million have been wiped out [Blackpool FC] is free to declare a dividend which will accrue 20% to [Belokon Holdings]. At the current rate of profitability the club should make circa £20 million in 2012. Even if half of this amount is retained it will still leave [Belokon Holdings] with a potential dividend of £2 million in 2012. In addition [Belokon Holdings] benefits from the use of the stadium and all football related revenues even though it has not paid anything towards the construction of the stadium. By any reckoning this is a fair division of revenues. Furthermore Segesta will be responsible for the repayment of any loans advanced from [Blackpool FC] (subject to agreement on the East Stand). [Belokon Holdings] will continue to accrue the right to future dividends.” </span>

We would then only pay the interest to the third party hedging fund which, this quarter, would be £25/27,000.

At the time we had been promoted to the Premier League. [Mr. Belokon] appeared agitated and resentful. I could sense there was something wrong. Suddenly, he expressed the view that he wanted me to make up his shares to 50% in [Blackpool FC]. I said “how much are you prepared to pay?”.

And then he said: “And Karl will be dead within two years!” [Mr. Belokon] had more to drink and became more argumentative and aggressive, saying “I want half the shares”. At first I wondered whether this was some kind of macabre joke. But it was not said with any humour at all and did not appear to be a joke. He repeated the statement more than once, stressing that he felt he deserved 50% because of what he had done for the club. As the night progressed he drank more and became visibly disturbed and I tried to ameliorate the situation., I recall thinking that the problems of Kyrgyzstan with his bank were troubling so I did not react to his aggression. </span>

I simply had refused to be bullied into giving shares away for nothing to satisfy [Mr. Belokon’s] share demands. No one travelled to Latvia again for meetings and even when we had planned meetings in the UK, security was always a priority. When [Mr. Belokon] came to Quernmore Hall to meet with me there was security in place. I did tell [Mr. Malnacs] about it, and that we were concerned. We discussed it and he said “You’ve got to find a solution to the problem”. At no time did [Mr. Belokon] make any claim that night or later that there was any private or secret arrangement between us until years later when he made his legal claims on 14</span>

	      </authorialNote>) that he was told about the conversation shortly afterwards. I am not inclined to attach very much weight to this corroboration. The evidence of the “guest” would have been helpful, and Mr. Owen Oyston could, no doubt, have produced evidence from her. He declined to do so, and neither VB Football Assets nor the Court was inclined to press him on this. The upshot is that Mr. Owen Oyston has deprived himself of potentially valuable evidence, which might have borne out his story. It would, no doubt, be permissible to draw inferences from Mr. Owen Oyston’s failure to call the “guest” or to produce evidence from her: it might be suggested that the fact that Mr. Owen Oyston did not call the “guest” is of itself suggestive that the story is untrue. However, I decline to decide this point relying upon inferences drawn from evidence not called. I propose to evaluate what happened in light of the evidence that was before me. </p>

It is worth stressing again that payments other than the ones described so far were being made out of Blackpool FC. The payments on which this Judgment focusses are those of which VB Football Assets makes specific complaint. It is not necessarily the case that these other payments were made for purposes unrelated to Blackpool FC. Although I have expressed certain reservations about the content of Annex 2 to the Judgment (see paragraph 38 above), I do accept (as did VB Football Assets) that some payments – albeit not transparent to the Belokon Side – were made to the benefit of Blackpool FC. Mr. Malnacs’ email may well be a reference to such payments; it is certainly illustrative of the fact that important information was being kept from the Belokon Side by the Oyston Side.  </p>

Apart from some further payments made out of Blackpool FC which VB Football Assets contend were not for the benefit of the club and were unfairly prejudicial, the period between March 2013 and 29 September 2014 (when VB Football Assets’ then solicitors wrote to the Respondents complaining about a number of matters, some of which ultimately found their way into the Petition) is characterised by ever more destructive conduct between the Oyston Side and the Belokon Side. This ranged from venting grievances in public, to arguing about whether or not to take further forward a proposal to buy Blackpool FC, to the Oyston Side not finalising the accounts of Blackpool FC because of the Belokon Side’s failure to consent to them. It is unnecessary to consider this conduct. The fact is that the reason for this is the history described in Sections C(28) to C(56) – the denial of the gentleman’s agreement; the payments out of Blackpool FC; and the overruling of the minority Belokon Side by the majority Oyston Side.  </p>

The prejudice may be damage to the value of his shares but may also extend to other financial damage which in the circumstances of the case is bound up with his position as a member. So, for example, removal from participation in the management of a company and the resulting loss of income or profits from the company in the form of remuneration will constitute prejudice in those cases where the members have rights recognised in equity is not at law, to participate in that way. Similarly, damage to the financial position of a member in relation to a debt due to him from the company can in the appropriate circumstances amount to prejudice. The prejudice must be to the petitioner in his capacity as a member but this is not to be strictly confined to damage to the value of his shareholding. Moreover, prejudice need not be financial in character. A disregard of the rights of the member as such, without any financial consequences, may amount to prejudice falling within the section.” </span>

Quite when this recharacterization occurred is unknown, but it appears to have occurred as a result of an investigation into the payment by HMRC. HMRC was concerned that – if the payment was to Mr. Owen Oyston as a director – then he had not paid the tax chargeable on this amount. This resulted in a meeting with HMRC on 30 September 2013, in which Mr. Cherry and Mr. Dyer both participated. Detailed notes of the meeting were kept by an employee of Mr. Cherry’s firm, and although these notes were never agreed with HMRC, I take them as an accurate record of what Mr. Cherry and Mr. Dyer wanted to convey to HMRC. During the course of this meeting, Mr. Cherry and Mr. Dyer sought to explain why the payment was properly made to Zabaxe and not to Mr. Owen Oyston personally. This involved the making of a series of what I consider to be misrepresentations to HMRC. These misrepresentations can be summarised as follows: </p>

Normally, of course, a dividend is paid without a countervailing obligation to pay interest on the dividend, which the Travelodge loan agreement obliged Segesta (subject to its absolute discretion) to pay. But, in reality, the Travelodge loan enabled the Oyston Side to substitute commercial lending for uncommercial lending and ultimately it is this that persuades me that this was a disguised dividend to the Oyston Side. </p>

But neither point is relevant to the question of unfair prejudice. The fact is that Blackpool FC, through its single season in the Premier League, received considerable sums of money and considerable sums of money were paid away not to the benefit of the club, but for the personal benefit of the Oyston Side. What the club would have done with these monies, had it retained their benefit, I cannot say. But being cash rich is obviously better than being cash poor. The club might have spent the monies unwisely – who can say? The fact is, it never had the opportunity. </p>

In Mr. Varpins’ own words: “to engage in such a quite complicated legal exercise, one needs to be willing to collaborate. What worth is it that we spend an enormous amount of time redrafting something and then the other party simply says no, that is not interesting, we are not going to do it?

The reason for this discrepancy is that whereas Mr. Krasner was essentially valuing the club, and placing relatively little weight on the influx of cash that occurred as a result of Blackpool FC’s single season in the Premier League, Mr. Mitchell was focussing essentially only on this inflow of cash and was disregarding the risks to that cash, even if the club was properly run. The fact is – as Mr. Krasner emphasised – people like Mr. Belokon did not put money into a football club as an “investment”. It may be that some Premier League clubs – the Manchester Uniteds or Arsenals of this world – sitting safely in the Premier League, can be run in this way: although I am uncertain, even of this, given (for instance) the difference participation or non-participation in the European Cup can make to the revenue of a club, even if it sits relatively safely in the Premier League. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In terms of valuing VB Football Assets’ 48.145% interest in Blackpool FC, I consider that the starting point should be a recognition that Segesta (or, perhaps more accurately, the Oyston Side) should have treated VB Football Assets (or, perhaps more accurately, the Belokon Side) equivalently and in a non-discriminatory manner. I have found that the Oyston Side caused Blackpool FC to make a series of payments that were, in fact, disguised dividends to the Oyston Side. These dividends should have been made equally to the Belokon Side. I consider that the starting point in assessing the appropriate buyout price is to approach matters as if the Oyston Side had behaved in a non-discriminatory way and paid to VB Football Assets what the Oyston Side paid to itself. In this way, VB Football Assets will receive a share in the profits of Blackpool FC, calculated by reference to what the Oyston Side considered it appropriate to pay itself.  </p>

Those which pertain to the internal affairs of the Ospreys are not conduct of the affairs of Neath. It would be disproportionate to require Mr. Cuddy to sell the Cuddy share to Mr. Hawkes on the grounds that I have found established, if a less drastic remedy can be devised. In conducting himself as a director of the Ospreys Mr. Cuddy has acted in what he considered to be the best interests of the Ospreys; and in accordance with clause 8 of the shareholders agreement stop in so doing he was not in breach of any duty owed either to Neath or to Mr. Hawkes. There is no justification for terminating or imperilling his position on the board of the Ospreys as a Neath representative, which was one of the fundamental terms of the Hawkes/Cuddy agreement. On the other hand he failed to consult Mr. Hawkes on the StadCo variation…, and has failed to keep them informed about the negotiations with the WRU. That can be cured for the future by giving Mr. Hawkes a voice (and eyes and ears) in the Ospreys boardroom. The spirit of the Hawkes/Cuddy agreement can be preserved by giving Mr. Hawkes the ability to enlarge the board of Neath thus giving him effective control of it.
