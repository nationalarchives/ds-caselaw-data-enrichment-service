On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2001 Başkan Gida made a loan agreement (“the Facility”) with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd and KBC Bank N.V. (respectively “BTM” and “KBC” and collectively “the Banks”), the stated purpose of which was to enable Başkan Gida to borrow, on a rolling basis, up to US$35 million in order to finance the purchase and processing of hazelnuts prior to their export, it being envisaged that repayment would be achieved by the assignment by Başkan Gida to the Banks of its rights to receive the proceeds of the sale of its hazelnuts to its largest foreign customer, the Ferrero group of companies (collectively “Ferrero”).</p>

During January and February 2002, unknown to the Banks at the time, Başkan Gida transferred substantially the whole of its business, assets, trading premises, hazelnut stocks and employees to Aksu Gida Sanayi Ve Ticaret Limited (“Aksu Gida”).  Başkan Gida ceased trading at the end of February and thereupon defaulted on its repayment obligations to the Banks. In May 2002 there was a further purported transfer of the hazelnut business and assets to Başkan Yuksel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks claim, and this is not seriously in dispute between the active participants in this litigation, that from start to finish they were the victims of a premeditated fraud in which the prime movers were those members of the Başkan family who owned Başkan Gida and who (although this is in dispute) were also the beneficial owners of Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel.  The Banks’ case is that the Başkans’ real purpose in negotiating the Facility was to obtain by deception the funds necessary to rescue their potentially profitable hazelnut export business from the state of hopeless insolvency into which Başkan Gida had fallen, using the Banks’ money for the purchase and transfer to Aksu Gida (and later Başkan Yuksel) of the hazelnut stock necessary to continue that business into the future, leaving the Banks with a worthless recourse against Başkan Gida.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With the benefit of hindsight and detailed subsequent research, the Banks say that the Başkans negotiated the structure of the Facility in such a way as to enable them to obtain the Banks’ money, use it for the purchase of hazelnuts and their transfer to Aksu Gida, together with the ongoing hazelnut business and associated assets, within a time-frame which would enable the fraud to be completed before any default in re-payment to the Banks could put them on notice of what had been planned and implemented.  For that purpose the Başkans stated falsely to the Banks during the negotiation of the Facility that Başkan Gida’s terms of trading with Ferrero gave rise to a 45 day period between Başkan Gida’s requirement to pay its suppliers and the receipt of payment from Ferrero for exported hazelnuts, a falsehood which has come to be known in the proceedings as “the 45 Day Lie”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the Banks anticipated incurring a risk of some loss in the event that Başkan Gida ceased trading during the period of the revolving Facility, they claim that the extent of their loss was primarily attributable to two specific frauds in the manner in which Başkan Gida operated the Facility.  The first consisted of the presentation to the Banks of false invoices suggesting that Ferrero was instructed to make payments in respect of hazelnut purchases to the Banks’ collection agent, while at the same time instructing Ferrero to make those payments elsewhere in the invoices actually delivered.  The second consisted of the obtaining of hazelnuts purchased with the Banks’ money and pledged by way of security by false statements that they were to be used to satisfy Ferrero’s export orders, whereas in truth they were then transferred to Aksu Gida. More generally the Banks say that they were the victims of fraudulent trading, since the Başkans did not intend when drawing down money under the facility, that it would ever be repaid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the Başkans succeeded in defrauding the Banks, they were largely denied the benefit of that fraud, primarily because of the prompt intervention of one of their Turkish banks, Yapi Kredi, into the affairs of Aksu Gida.  Despite an attempt at a further transfer of the hazelnut business from Aksu Gida to Başkan Yuksel later in 2002, no long-term rescue of the family business was thereby achieved.  Although Başkan Gida, Aksu Gida and four members of the Başkan family are joined as the first, sixth and second to fifth defendants respectively, and have all formally denied the claim, they have taken no active part in these proceedings.  Even if a judgment in these proceedings could be enforced against them in Turkey, it is unlikely that any of them are worth powder and shot.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks have however sought to recover their losses from two groups of defendants.  The first (“the Abidali Defendants”) consists of Mr Shabbir Abidali, his company Indo Mediterranean Commodities Limited (“Indo-Med”) and two entities in which, or in the assets of which, the Banks allege that Mr Abidali has a beneficial interest, namely Alanvar Establishment and Ridgebeach Limited.  Indo-Med went into voluntary liquidation in March 2006, and its only participation since then has been the provision of documents and a waiver of legal professional privilege, by its liquidator on its behalf.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks claim that Mr Abidali and Indo-Med played a central part in both the planning and implementation of the fraud.  They are therefore sued as participants in an alleged unlawful means conspiracy.  Mr Abidali denies this. He accepts that, at his direction, Indo-Med played a central role in the transactions between Başkan Gida and Aksu Gida in early 2002, but claims that Indo-Med thereby did nothing unlawful, and did not knowingly or intentionally harm the interests of the Banks.</p>

I shall refer to them collectively as “the Ferrero Defendants”.  The Ferrero group included companies incorporated in other countries, but Ferrero Italy, Germany and France together made the overwhelming bulk of hazelnut purchases from Başkan Gida at the material time.  I shall refer to them as “the Ferrero Operating Defendants”.  Ferrero Industrial did not itself purchase hazelnuts, but was formed to manage, on a collective basis, all the raw material purchases required by the operating companies in the Ferrero group, including the Ferrero Operating Defendants.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks put their claim against the Ferrero Defendants on a number of alternative grounds.  Originally, they claimed that by reason of assignments by Başkan Gida of its rights to the payment by Ferrero of the price for the exported hazelnuts, duly notified to the Ferrero Operating Defendants, those defendants are liable in contract, notwithstanding having paid Başkan Gida in full for the specific purchases.   Before these proceedings were issued, that claim was made the subject of  negative declaration proceedings in Italy, with the result that the contractual claim in these proceedings was stayed by Lawrence Collins J. pursuant to the Judgments Regulation.  That claim remains pending in Italy, and its determination is unlikely to occur in the near future. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the Banks claim that the Ferrero Defendants are liable in unlawful means conspiracy for having participated with knowledge in Başkan Gida’s fraud, in particular through the activities and knowledge of three Ferrero employees, Mr Casale, Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Bolowich.  As against the Ferrero Defendants, the claim is that they participated in the implementation rather than in the design of the fraud.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, the Banks claim against the Ferrero Operating Defendants an account upon the basis of their receipt of hazelnuts subject to a continuing security interest in favour of the Banks, or because of receipt of hazelnuts purchased with the proceeds of the sale of hazelnuts subject to that security interest.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Ferrero Defendants deny all these claims.  As to the conspiracy claim, they admit the Başkans’ fraud on the Banks, but deny either knowledge, participation or intent to harm the Banks.  As to the claim in deceit, they deny both misrepresentation and dishonesty.  As to the claim in negligence they deny negligence, and reliance by the Banks, assert contributory negligence on the part of the Banks, and advance both “scope of duty” and remoteness defences. In relation to both the deceit and negligence claims Ferrero deny causation by advancing a <span style="font-style:italic">novus actus </span>defence.  As to the Banks’ Proprietary Claims they say that the Banks cannot prove that Ferrero received any hazelnuts subject to any continuing security interest of the Banks, let alone any interest of which they had knowledge when making payments for them to Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks do not claim that they can prove the fraud and deceit which they allege against the Ferrero Defendants by reference to ‘smoking gun’ direct evidence, although to some extent they do as against Mr Abidali. Rather they say that, when the whole of the facts about the defendants’ participation in the relevant events is examined in detail, their conduct is explicable only in terms of an inference of dishonesty.  For this purpose, and for the active defendants’ purpose of demonstrating the exact opposite, no stone has been left unturned, both in preparation and during the conduct of the trial. Every aspect of the parties’ dealings during two hazelnut crop seasons has been examined in minute detail. Lengthy evidence from hazelnut market experts has been deployed and tested in relation to the central allegation that the Ferrero Defendants’ purchases from Başkan Gida were not on normal arms-length market terms. Enormous efforts were devoted by forensic accountants into establishing (happily in the end by agreement) relevant statistics regarding Ferrero’s stock levels and hazelnut requirements, in relation to an allegation that Ferrero dishonestly assisted Başkan Gida by ordering large quantities of hazelnuts which were not needed. The entirety of Ferrero’s hazelnut purchasing programmes from all sources over two years has been precisely recreated for the purpose of testing allegations of unusual, and therefore suspicious, trends during the period of the fraud.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, the Ferrero defendants’ allegations of contributory negligence by the Banks in the negotiation and operation of the Facility have led to the most detailed examination of the minutiae of the Banks’ conduct during the relevant period, by reference to comprehensive surviving documentation, many days of cross-examination of the Banks’ employees, and the deployment and testing of the evidence of banking experts.</p>

What the parties did, wrote and said to each other is either established by surviving documents and notes of meetings, or largely forgotten beyond practical recall during the six years since the relevant events occurred.  The critical factual disputes concern the matters which they knew, suspected, or to which it is alleged that they deliberately turned a blind eye.  In addition, (as often in a case where fraud is alleged), there is the major question of motive.</p>

With the assistance of the Banks’ legal team he had evidently taken considerable care to piece together his detailed account of events in his long witness statement from contemporaneous documents. That care was if anything exemplified by his considerable disappointment at having his reconstruction revealed to be erroneous on one significant point (namely that he had attended a particular meeting in March 2002, when in fact documents which he had missed showed that he had not), and his dismay at being asked in the middle of his cross-examination to check again whether he had made any other errors.</p>

At the heart of his perception of the differences between the two types of lending lay his frequently repeated assertion that analysis of the creditworthiness of the intending borrower plays a much less significant part of the necessary due diligence to be applied to a structured trade finance proposal, than it does in relation to a proposed traditional loan.</p>

The result is that I found his opinions about those matters less than wholly persuasive, despite his considerable experience in the field of structured trade finance. His evidence about factual matters which did not relate to the alleged shortcomings of his part in the Banks’ due diligence was nonetheless generally reliable. </p>

As a result, although his two witness statements were made after careful consideration of the underlying documents, he lacked that ongoing relationship with KBC which contributed both to the strengths and weaknesses of Mr Lewis’s evidence, being less well prepared than Mr Lewis and therefore having his recollection less well refreshed, but on the other hand being inherently less likely to have his independence undermined by loyalty to a continuing employer. </p>

He was, in every respect, a most impressive witness, demonstrating a thorough appreciation of the issues, gained after a careful refreshment of his memory from the surviving documents, and a careful reading of the criticisms of his bank’s conduct set out at length in the report of Mr Rex, the Ferrero defendants’ banking expert. Although still employed by BTM, and the target of a relatively small part of the criticisms of its conduct pursued in cross-examination, I detected no defensiveness or partiality in his evidence.

She had less immediate contact with the negotiation and operation of the facility than BTM’s other witnesses, and therefore less to contribute. She was however directly involved in BTM’s response to Başkan Gida’s default in early 2002, and provided a useful insight into the thinking behind its conduct at that stage.

He joined BTM in late 1998 with considerable previous experience in factoring transactions, and he was BTM’s main point of contact both with Başkan Gida and with Ferrero throughout.  I found him to be a helpful witness, the reliability of whose recollection was fortified by his ready acknowledgment of the gaps in his memory, and a determination not to guess or reconstruct. Although personally criticised for aspects of BTM’s alleged negligence, he did not generally allow his evidence to be marred by defensiveness or prevarication, and made sensible admissions in relation to relevant shortcomings in his and BTM’s due diligence. My only reservation as to the independence of his approach to the matters of criticism of the Banks’ conduct was that his overall conclusion was that their loss was primarily the fault of KBC (in the operational monitoring of the Facility) rather than BTM. In this respect he succumbed to the inevitable temptation to pass the buck.</p>

She was engaged successively by Başkan Gida, Aksu Gida and by Başkan Yuksel as an export supervisor at the Giresun factory, before being made redundant in 2004. Subject to the combined difficulties imposed by the language and locational barriers, she provided helpful and honest evidence from her experience in that capacity, both in explaining procedures within the factory, where she personally prepared Başkan Gida’s  export documents and invoices, and in describing from her perception as a middle ranking member of staff Başkan Gida’s descent into insolvency, and the manner in which its business was from February 2002 taken over by Aksu Gida and then by Basken Yuksel. Apart from a moment of unease at questioning which implied that she had participated in conduct contrary to a Turkish court order, I found her approach to giving evidence to be a careful and dispassionate process of assisting the court, without any apparent agenda of her own.</p>

As a result he played no part in the later stages of the Banks’ due diligence, and no part in the operational or post-default stages of the Facility, and was for that reason subjected to a much shorter and less searching cross-examination than either Mr Lewis or Mr Byles.

He made some sensible admissions, for example as to the importance of studying Başkan Gida’s audited accounts (which became available only after he had been re-assigned to other work). In certain respects however I found his attempts to respond to alleged failures to identify weaknesses in the financial information about Başkan Gida which he did study rather unconvincing.

The first was Mr Do’s denial of any knowledge at the time that the Başkans remained the controlling force behind both Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel, when Ferrero continued to trade with those companies in and after February 2002, a trade which continued after it became apparent to Ferrero that the Başkans could no longer be trusted.  The second related to Mr Do’s reason for the failure of Ferrero to respond more constructively to requests by the Banks for information after Başkan Gida’s default in February 2002. Mr Do put this down to the Banks’ refusal to provide a requested agenda for proposed face to face discussions, but there was no documentary or other evidence that this request had been communicated to the Banks, and I reject that explanation.</p>

Where a witness is prepared to lie when he perceives it to be in his or his company’s interests to do so, it deprives his evidence of inherent reliability.  Nonetheless, much of Mr Do’s evidence was either unchallenged or corroborated, and it was, much more often than not, reliable for that reason.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Alessio Casale was at the material time first the Deputy Purchasing Manager and, from January 2002, a “Direttore” (i.e. manager) of Ferrero Industrial, with particular responsibility for the purchase of hazelnuts.  He had as a result the day to day responsibility for the conduct of Ferrero’s relationship with Başkan Gida, which he conducted on an almost daily basis on the telephone and by faxes and emails, mainly with Melih Başkan, who was in charge of Başkan Gida’s export sales.  Mr Casale has continued to be employed by Ferrero, and is now a manager within Ferrero Trading SA.  In addition to his native Italian, he is a fluent speaker of English, with a working knowledge of German and French as well.  He and the Başkans used English as their common language.  He also gave his evidence in English, with very occasional help from an interpreter.  </p>

He had a very good but not absolutely infallible memory for detail, occasionally appearing genuinely to recall points of detail which proved to be inaccurate by reference to contemporary documents.  These occasional inaccuracies in no sense detracted from the generally comprehensive quality of his evidence, which he gave at great length in a written witness statement and, in cross-examination, over ten days.  Generally, he displayed an articulate determination to address head on the questions he was asked and, despite a cross-examination aimed at challenging his honesty in numerous respects, remained calm, courteous and cooperative throughout.</p>

Although it was put to him that he had participated in the Başkans’ fraud on the Banks out of a corrupt motive, I have no hesitation in concluding that, throughout his dealings with the Başkans on Ferrero’s behalf, he acted in pursuit of what he genuinely believed to be Ferrero’s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have unfortunately been driven to the conclusion that in certain specific respects Mr Casale persuaded himself that Ferrero’s interests required him to lie in the evidence given at this trial.  I shall describe those aspects of his evidence in due course, together with my reasons for rejecting both his evidence, and his professed honesty, on those occasions.  In summary, they comprise first, his denial that he knew in substance the meaning of the English word “assignment” when negotiating in careful detail the English language versions of documents which involved Ferrero in the structure of the Banks’ Facility to Başkan Gida, in the later part of 2001.  Secondly, and this is a falsehood into which Mr Do and Mr Rosa Brunet were also drawn, he untruthfully denied knowing that the Başkan family were at all times in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control of Aksu Gida, and later Başkan Yuksel, while they were simultaneously pretending to have withdrawn from the hazelnut market.  Thirdly, he was not frank with the court about the extent to which, and the time at which, he suspected that the Başkans were dealing otherwise than honestly with the Banks.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider it possible that the shortcomings in Mr Casale’s evidence about the first and third of those matters may have been caused or at least substantially contributed to by his convincing himself into a state of denial about the extent of his knowledge at the material time, faced with the unpalatable consequences for Ferrero and for himself personally of facing up to the reality now that the matter has become the subject of major litigation.  But I have been unable to persuade myself to any such sympathetic conclusion in relation to his denial that he and his colleagues within Ferrero Industrial knew that the Başkans were, throughout, in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control of Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel.

On the contrary, large parts of it accord both with contemporaneous documents, other corroborative evidence, and with the balance of probabilities.  Nonetheless, his readiness to depart from the truth in accordance with his perception of Ferrero’s interests leads to the result that I have been unable to place unquestioning reliance on Mr Casale as a witness of truth, but have been forced to address all of his detailed evidence with an open mind as to its truth and accuracy, as dictated by a consideration of the evidence as a whole.</p>

He was throughout the material period Mr Casale’s immediate superior at Ferrero Industrial, as one of its two capital Managing Directors, his responsibility being for raw materials procurement, including, but by no means limited to, hazelnuts.  As Mr Casale’s superior he was involved in the important decisions about Ferrero’s relationship with Başkan Gida, but much less with the day to day detail.  He retired from Ferrero in 2005.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a witness, Mr Rosa Brunet faced difficulties considerably greater than those of Mr Casale, in particular because first, his English was less good, so that he needed much more assistance from an interpreter.  Secondly he was experiencing real difficulties with his eyesight, which made it hard for him to read important documents put to him in cross-examination.  More generally, and not least because of his detachment from Ferrero for the last few years, his recollection of events, and in particular dates and times, was much less precise than that of Mr Casale.  He was less focused in his evidence and occasionally a little muddled.  Nonetheless he showed no less enthusiasm than Mr Casale to engage with his cross-examiner, in providing full and usually direct answers to questions.</p>

For reasons which I shall in due course explain, an understanding of who in 2002 really controlled Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel was essential to Ferrero’s commercial decision-making at the time, and must have formed a lasting impression on those, including Mr Rosa Brunet, who took those decisions.</p>

Prior to the centralisation of Ferrero’s purchasing he had been a buyer of certain raw materials, not including hazelnuts, for Ferrero Germany as its direct employee, with executive responsibility for buying decisions. After the establishment of Ferrero Industrial he remained in Germany in effect in a branch office of Ferrero Industrial there, but since all executive buying decisions were made by Mr Rosa Brunet’s team in Italy, his function was reduced to the purely administrative task of placing purchase orders for Ferrero Germany, on strict written instructions, usually from Mr Casale in relation to hazelnuts, with no executive responsibility or discretion of his own. Having thus been marginalised, he eventually retired from Ferrero in June 2004, aged 63.</p>

Nonetheless he clearly did his best honestly to assist the court to the limited extent that he could, and was generally careful to distinguish between reconstruction and recollection. He was open and frank in his answers, readily agreeing with the logic of questions where appropriate, and disclosed no partiality either for or against Ferrero and its senior staff, while disclosing that he and Mr Rosa Brunet had a less than entirely harmonious working relationship.

The first was that he took an active part in the formulation, execution and backdating of apparently contractual documents in 2002 which were plainly designed to give a false and misleading impression to outsiders (i.e. they were sham documents) purporting to record the circumstances and terms of the transfer of assets between Başkan Gida and Aksu Gida.  The second was that he authorised false explanations of those documents by Indo-Med in its pleadings in this litigation before Mr Abidali himself was joined as a party, supporting them by statements of truth and witness statements, including an obviously false witness statement in support of Aksu Gida’s case in Turkish proceedings in 2002.  The third was that while Mr Abidali was responsible on behalf of Indo-Med for its compliance with its disclosure obligations in these proceedings, Indo-Med failed to disclose the overwhelming bulk of the documents which, when subsequently disclosed by its liquidator, revealed the truth of the matters about which Mr Abidali had previously provided false evidence.  When cross-examined about all these matters at trial, Mr Abidali provided explanations and excuses which I found wholly unpersuasive.

The gist of them was a description of Mr Dahod’s interest in the hazelnut business by then being run by Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel as that of a pure financier of a business belonging to the Başkans, with a right to a profit share, rather than that of an owner of the business.  This was flatly contradictory not merely to Mr Dahod’s evidence about the emails, but to the whole of his and Mr Abidali’s case about their participation in Aksu Gida.  Unless satisfactorily explained, which it was not, it revealed Mr Dahod as a liar, not merely about a particular incident, but in the central aspects of his attempted corroboration of Mr Abidali.</p>

Nonetheless, he has had plenty of time before giving evidence in these proceedings to choose between telling the truth and lying in support of Mr Abidali, and my clear conclusion is that, whether for reasons of loyalty or otherwise, he chose to do the latter.</p>

I have no doubt that Mr Trotter’s apparent trepidation stemmed from a fear that it would be suggested to him in cross-examination that he had played a part in that process thoroughly unbecoming of an English solicitor.

To the limited extent that he therefore provided corroboration for parts of Mr Abidali’s evidence, it did him no good on the central matters in issue.  Mr Trotter did provide Mr Abidali with a character reference, but coming from a solicitor who assisted in the drafting of documents which, in my judgment, he ought to have appreciated were being improperly backdated, the reference was of no assistance to Mr Abidali.

His very brief evidence was not accepted by the Banks in the sense of going unchallenged, but Mr Husain was proffered for cross-examination only upon condition that the Banks paid his expenses, which they declined to do.  The result of this rather childish standoff, (bearing in mind the vast costs employed generally in this litigation), was that Mr Husain was not tendered for cross-examination, and I was left to give such weight to his witness statement, tendered under the Civil Evidence Act, as I thought fit.  In the event, Mr Husain’s evidence corroborated Mr Abidali’s case only in relation to the issues affecting Safe Holdings Limited, as to which, I did not in the end disbelieve Mr Abidali.  </p>

His banking career began as a graduate trainee at Chemical Bank in London in 1974.  By the time he left in 1988 he was vice-president and head of ship finance and commodities finance within Europe.  From 1988 to 1992, as assistant general manager at the London branch of Crédit Agricole, he was head of its Corporate Banking and Finance Division with responsibility, among many other things, for its commodity and trade finance units.  Since 1993 Mr Rex has been engaged full time in consulting.  </p>

Nonetheless his responsibilities had included the risk analysis of such transactions from the perspective of a participating bank in a syndicate, the management of the department regularly taking a wide range of country risk, and the preparation of expert evidence on pre-export facilities with characteristics similar to the Facility in the present case.  In my judgment the range and depth of Mr Rex’s banking experience qualified him well for his task in this litigation, even if he had not sat precisely in the hot-seats occupied by the Banks’ main witnesses.  Both in his reports (including the joint statement of the two banking experts) and in his response to cross-examination, Mr Rex proved to be measured, articulate, reasonable and persuasive, keeping an open mind to the consideration of alternative points of view, and giving his opinions with care and precision.  All in all I found him to be a most impressive witness.</p>

He had even less hands-on experience of structured trade finance for emerging market exporters than Mr Rex, although his time at Riggs AP Bank Limited (between 1989 and 1991) necessarily involved international trade finance, ‘AP’ standing for Anglo-Portuguese.  Since 1992 Mr Bryant has been engaged in the provision of consultancy services to the banking industry, including the preparation and giving of expert evidence in a large number of cases.  Again, I am satisfied that his broad and long experience well qualified him to provide expert evidence in the present case, even though his career had not been focused upon the particular type of lending with which it is concerned.</p>

His twenty years’ experience in the hazelnut business included working full time for another large exporter Sezginler from when he left university in 1992 until called to do military service in 1998.  In 1999 he formed a joint venture with a Dutch company with a view to setting up a new hazelnut producing, exporting and trading business, called Arasco.  This did small-scale business (by comparison with Başkan Gida) in exporting hazelnuts during the material period, not exceeding about 2,000 metric tons (“mt”) of kernels per annum and doing little business with the chocolate making industry.  Arasco closed its processing and exporting business after a bad crop in 2003.  </p>

His English was, for most of the time, amply sufficient for him to understand the gist and usually the nuances of questions asked of him in cross-examination, with the need for only limited assistance from interpreters for that purpose.  </p>

In one sense this was an advantage, since it provided for him a standpoint of complete independence.  His absence of experience in dealing with Ferrero and comparable foreign customers on the scale manifested by the transactions in issue, particularly during the relevant period, did constitute a disadvantage in terms of his attempt to assess the commerciality or otherwise of the transactions in issue from Ferrero’s point of view as customer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">More generally however, Mr Solak presented a lively, intelligible and usually vivid picture of the Turkish hazelnut market at the material time, which I found to be of considerable assistance.  My main reservation with his evidence was that he demonstrated a certain rigidity of thought in relation to the complicated issues about Başkan Gida’s likely processing costs, which appeared to stem from an a priori assumption that if the businesses with which he was connected could not process particular standards and specifications of hazelnuts at less than a certain price, then none of his competitors, including Başkan Gida, could do so either.  The consequence was that Mr Solak’s opinions as to Başkan Gida’s likely processing costs constantly came out at the top end of the range of comparables made available to me, being invariably significantly in excess of the estimates provided by Ferrero’s market expert, and very substantially in excess of those cost estimates provided by Başkan Gida to Ferrero at the material time.  This led to the inevitable question in cross-examination why Başkan Gida might be thought likely to have understated its costs to its principal customer when negotiating prices on a cost-plus basis, to which Mr Solak had no ready or persuasive answer.  Similarly, he had no answer to the question why, from the limited documentation available, it appeared that Başkan Gida’s principal competitor for Ferrero’s business, Oltan Gida, appeared to quote similar costs to those of Başkan Gida, and to sell at similar prices, when dealing with Ferrero.  His main reason for equating his own costs with the likely costs of Başkan Gida was that, in his view, there were no real economies of scale to be achieved when processing hazelnuts.  I did not find that evidence particularly convincing, however understandable coming from a much smaller participant in the market at the material time than Başkan Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Solak’s opinions about the commerciality or otherwise of the transactions in issue from Başkan Gida’s perspective appeared to be heavily influenced by his assumption that Başkan Gida had gone out of business in 2002 due to commercial misjudgements made in the conduct of its hazelnut business.  As he put it graphically in cross-examination, if Başkan Gida had got it right, the litigation would not be taking place.  It is in fact impossible to know precisely what caused Başkan Gida’s failure, not least because in their own explanations to Ferrero and Indo-Med members of the Başkan family attributed their problems to a wholly distinct biscuit manufacturing business.  It was therefore necessary for me to approach this assumption, and the consequently dim view which Mr Solak had of Başkan Gida’s business decision-making, with some caution.  </p>

In 1988 Pisani &amp; Rickertsen founded an Istanbul based hazelnut cracker and processor known as Progida AS in partnership with a Mr Ufuk Ozongun.

Although mainly based in Hamburg rather than Turkey, Mr Haas-Rickertsen made numerous visits to Turkey as part of his responsibilities. Both he and Mr Solak were able to have recourse for their opinions about market prices in 2001-2 to detailed manuscript notes taken by them at the time.  Whereas Mr Solak obtained the market information for his notes directly, Mr Haas-Rickertsen acknowledged that he derived a substantial amount of his market information from his partner Mr Ozongun, who was based full-time in Turkey and, unlike Mr Haas-Rickertsen, spoke fluent Turkish.  Mr Haas-Rickertsen’s first language is German, but he gave his evidence almost exclusively in very accomplished English, with occasional assistance from a German interpreter.</p>

The foundation for this attack was that Ferrero was a substantial customer of Mr Haas-Rickertsen’s firms and that, in April 2007, he had declined an invitation to act as the Banks’ expert, partly upon that ground.  How, Mr Wardell asked him, could he give independent expert evidence if he considered himself disabled from doing so on the instruction of a party opposed to Ferrero?  The gist of his response was that his experience as an arbitrator, not infrequently appointed as one of two or three, by a customer of his firm, had in the past enabled him to develop a practice of acting independently in relation to disputes involving customers and that, with his long experience of the hazelnut market, he believed that he could do so in the present case.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although an apparent lack of independence no longer goes to the admissibility of an expert’s evidence (see <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Factortame Ltd) v. Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (No 8)</span> [2003] QB 381), such that expert evidence is admissible even if given by a full-time employee of the party calling the expert, it plainly goes to the weight of the evidence given.  In my judgment, taking Mr Haas-Rickertsen’s written and oral evidence as a whole, the fact that Ferrero remained a substantial customer of his firm during the whole of the period when he was preparing and giving expert evidence did not significantly detract from the independence with which he gave his opinions on matters of market expertise.  By contrast, there was some force in Mr Wardell’s submission that in areas where he was forced to speculate, Mr Haas-Rickertsen appeared to dwell upon speculations favourable to Ferrero’s rather the Banks’ case.  In most instances this occurred in relation to the frequently arising question whether the conduct of Başkan Gida in entering into allegedly disadvantageous contracts with Ferrero could have had any ordinary commercial motive, the Banks’ case being that it was transparently the result of terminal financial difficulties.  In those respects, Mr Haas-Rickertsen’s starting point usually was an assumption that Başkan Gida had a commercial reason for acting as it did, other than pure financial desperation, and much of his written evidence about that issue consisted of the identification of possible explanations why that might be so.  Mr Haas-Rickertsen made no secret of the fact that in those respects he was forced to speculate in the absence of hard evidence, and I consider that his approach derived not so much from any lack of independence, as between the Banks and Ferrero, but from an assumption borne of long experience in dealing in a market in which Başkan Gida was the largest player, that it was a hard-nosed commercial operator, inherently likely to have good reason for doing what it did. In this respect he started from a diametrically opposed assumption to that of Mr Solak, and their opposite starting points explained much of the large differences in their opinions on this issue. I have no doubt that both opinions were genuinely held.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In that respect, both Mr Solak and Mr Haas-Rickertsen understandably placed reliance, in their assessments of the rationale for Başkan Gida’s conduct from time to time, upon their common perception (I infer shared generally in the Turkish hazelnut market) that Başkan Gida had a long established tendency to engage in large scale short speculation; that is, accepting commitments to sell in the future without covering those obligations with stocks in hand, hoping that a fall in the market between contract and delivery would enable it to make a profit by buying the necessary raw materials at a lower price.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In cross-examination, when faced with alternative analyses of financial extremity and ordinary commercial rationale, I found that Mr Haas-Rickertsen approached these questions with an open and independent mind, illustrated by the fact that, by the end of his cross-examination, he readily assented to the proposition that some of Başkan Gida’s last contracts, before ceasing business in early 2002, looked like the last desperate throw of the dice by a business facing financial ruin.  My conclusion on the issue of independence is therefore that, while it has been necessary for me to treat Mr Haas-Rickertsen’s evidence with more caution that that of Mr Solak because of the Ferrero customer connection with his firm, in general Mr Haas-Rickertsen demonstrated a properly independent approach to the giving of his opinions, as might be expected from his long experience as a commercial arbitrator.</p>

Furthermore, although initially reluctant during cross-examination to reassess opinions given earlier in writing, he became increasingly disposed to do so during a long cross-examination (including undertaking re-calculations during short adjournments) which displayed a commendable determination to assist the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was in my judgment some justification for both these competing contentions.  Professor Tekinalp’s career had undoubtedly involved him more frequently in matters relating to pledges than Professor Ansay.  In particular, his involvement was not merely that of an academic, but of a practitioner, in advising upon and settling pledges, although neither he nor Professor Ansay had any experience of litigating disputes about pledges in court.  Against that, Professor Tekinalp did approach the matter instinctively (and understandably) more from the banker’s perspective of a secured lender than from the position of a purchaser of originally pledged goods from a person with apparent authority to sell them, which formed the starting point of Professor Ansay’s analysis.  Furthermore, Professor Tekinalp undoubtedly did fall into the error of making a one-sided selection of the facts relevant to the question of Ferrero’s good faith, albeit that this did not in my judgment undermine anything more than that relatively brief and, in the event, non-critical part of his report.</p>

By contrast, Professor Ansay was initially less clear or forceful in the presentation of his opinion, but correspondingly more helpful in his analytical response to questions in cross-examination.</p>

I have done so by reference to the latest practical date before the events which have led to this litigation began to distort the parties’ relationships, which (leaving aside the Banks which had yet to come on to the scene) had until then been cordial and mutually profitable.  Since so much of the Banks’ case depends upon portraying the other parties’ conduct as a suspicious and uncommercial departure from the established norm, it is necessary to describe the parties’ normal relationships, in the period ending at the end of 2000, in considerable detail, so as to provide the backdrop of apparent normality against which the events in dispute can be appraised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Generally, a variety is identified by reference to place of origin.  In Turkey, the variety producing the best quality comes from Giresun, and hazelnuts from all other locations are sometimes described as Levant.  Within that broad category there are other relevant locations, in particular Ordu, Trabzon and Akcakoca.  The present case is concerned mainly with the Giresun and Ordu varieties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for quality, the principal distinction derives from the use to which hazelnuts can be put, the higher quality being described as rocher, meaning that the nuts can be used in confectionary as whole kernels.  The lower quality, described as paste, means that the nuts are suitable only for being ground into, and used as, paste.  An intermediate quality is that of granulates, which calls for no detailed explanation.  The quality boundary between rocher and paste is not impermeable.  For example, a batch originally selected for use as rocher may, over time, deteriorate such that it is thereafter usable only as paste.  Conversely, a batch sold as paste may be subjected to a process of re-selection, so as to yield a sub-batch of nuts suitable for use as rocher.</p>

For present purposes, the main categories fall between 11 mm and 15 mm.  The more exacting single calibre standard, for example 13-14 mm calls for hazelnuts with a diameter from 13.0 to less than 14.0 mm.  The less stringent dual calibre permits batching of nuts for example between 11 to 13 mm and 13 to 15 mm.</p>

A replacement (slightly more lenient) standard was introduced in March 2002, but it became common ground that this has no relevance to the issues which I have to decide, relating to the hazelnuts supplied to Ferrero during the 2000 and 2001 crop seasons.</p>

In Ferrero’s case these were usually more strict than TSE3075.  In general therefore, Ferrero contracted to receive from its suppliers hazelnut consignments conforming to more rigorous specifications than those generally offered in the market, with the consequence that its suppliers and Başkan Gida in particular had to achieve those specifications either by sourcing higher than average specifications from their own suppliers, or by processing their supplies in such a way as to increase the quality of the specification delivered to Ferrero, by discarding sub-standard nuts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The process whereby hazelnuts grown in a particular orchard in Turkey find their way into an export shipment to a customer such as Ferrero may be divided broadly into the following stages.  The nuts first have to be dried, while still in shell.  Nuts in shell may be stored for anything up to 3 years while retaining merchantable quality.  Once shelled however, and unless frozen, they begin to deteriorate, such that, in kernel form, they have a shelf-life of not more than one year.  The process of shell removal is known as cracking, and the general rule of thumb is that half the weight of the nuts in shell is produced by way of useable kernels.  The shells themselves have a residual value, in particular for use in Turkey for domestic heating during the winter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Once shelled, the kernels are calibrated, traditionally by being passed through large perforated drums.  This is the first stage of what may loosely be called processing, the second stage of which consists of inspection, traditionally by a numerous female workforce picking out sub-standard nuts and other materials from the calibrated stream, on wooden tables in factory premises.  During the period under review, more modern, less labour intensive techniques, including for example inspection by laser technology had begun to be introduced, more generally outside Turkey, and to a very limited extent within Turkey itself.</p>

Crackers, as is implicit in their name, bought hazelnuts in shell from farmers and manavs and sold kernels to brokers or direct to exporters.  There were about 180 crackers in Turkey at the material time, of widely varying sizes.  Brokers, of which there were about 10 at the time, intermediated between manavs and crackers on the one hand and exporters on the other, in relation to the hazelnuts for export and, I assume, sold into the domestic market.</p>

By exporter, I mean only that the company in question exported part of its hazelnut sales.  Nor were exporters merely traders.  Some of them, including Başkan Gida, had their own cracking and processing facilities, so that they could buy nuts in shell from manavs and brokers, as well as from FKB, which only bought and sold nuts in shell.  It is possible, but in my judgment unlikely, that exporters also bought nuts direct from farmers.  Since the expert evidence was to the effect that a typical farmer might produce no more than 1 or 2 mt of nuts per year, and the evidence showed that, at least in relation to Başkan Gida, nuts were purchased mainly by the 20 or 24 tonne truckload, it seems likely that purchases by exporters direct from farmers formed a negligible part of their hazelnut acquisitions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">FKB was a unique player in the Turkish hazelnut market.  Its purpose, as I have described, was to support the market price by large scale purchases, usually early in the season, when an excess of supply from the harvest over demand threatened to reduce prices, and to sell later in the season, if possible, when demand began to outstrip supply.  It sought to minimise the risk of deterioration of its substantial stocks by buying and selling in shell, and by storing the nuts in the meantime in temperature and humidity controlled warehouses.  Unlike all other buyers and sellers in the market, FKB published its buying and selling prices.  Not least because it stored all its stocks in shell, FKB had a reputation in the market for selling nuts of better than average quality. Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence was that, as might be expected of an organisation with a purpose other than the making of profits, FKB incurred very substantial losses in its market support activities, which had to be funded by the State, in the public interest, or at least in the interests of hazelnut farmers, who formed a substantial part of the electorate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Turkish hazelnut market was inherently volatile, due principally to the effect of a variable climate upon both the volume and quantity of each year’s harvest, coupled with the difficulty for end-users in building up substantial buffer stocks caused by the limited shelf-life of the nuts, once cracked.  Additional contributors to price volatility were, first, the susceptibility of the Black Sea producing areas to disruption by earthquake, and the substantial Turkish financial crisis, with consequential large devaluations of the Turkish lira and restricted availability of credit from Turkish banks at reasonable rates of interest, which seriously affected the market during 2001 and 2002.  Since hazelnuts were, in general, exported for payment in foreign currencies, (usually dollars or euros), but acquired by exporters within Turkey in Turkish lira, wide fluctuations in the exchange rate could produce market distortions in which purchase price movements could appear quite different to an exporter than they did to a foreign buyer.</p>

To its purchase cost had to be added an amount for processing the consignment to the calibre and specification required by the foreign purchaser, an amount for export costs (including tax) and an amount to cover the cost of financing the nuts between the date of payment to its supplier and the date of receipt of payment from its foreign buyer.  If the exporter was to make a profit, it also had to factor in weight losses attributable to the rejection of substandard or sub-calibre nuts necessary during processing to achieve the foreign buyer’s specification, less the anticipated proceeds of the sale of the rejected element to other buyers.  Finally, the exporter had to build in a gross profit margin, sufficient to fund general overheads and leave a net profit for distribution to shareholders.</p>

The question whether particular sales by Başkan Gida were loss-making to Başkan Gida was intensely debated between the hazelnut experts and in cross-examination of Ferrero’s main witnesses.  At the heart of the debate lay disagreements about processing, export, finance and overheads costs which Başkan Gida needed to add to its purchase costs in order to make a profit.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was circumstantial evidence that Başkan Gida had over the years built up supply chains, consisting of a small number of selected manavs and crackers, from which the Başkans purchased, on a regular basis, hazelnuts of types and quality better suited for sale to Ferrero than was generally available, thereby reducing their likely processing costs, for example by eliminating the need to re-calibrate some less demanding paste categories.  This was Mr Casale’s assumption, was echoed in the information about Başkan Gida prepared by its finance consultants PRI in 2001, and confirmed as his impression of Başkan Gida’s market profile by Mr Haas-Rickertsen. The effect upon the economics of Başkan Gida’s export business with Ferrero is virtually impossible to gauge, but this aspect of how Başkan Gida did business provides an important part of an understanding of Ferrero’s motivation in cooperating with the Başkans to preserve their business in 2002.</p>

It was founded by the Ferrero family in Alba in Northern Italy in 1946 as a confectionery manufacturer.  Since then it has grown into an international group, operating 15 factories and employing over 19,000 staff worldwide, with a group turnover in the financial year 2006/2007 of €5.74 billion, to which its Italian operations contributed €2.16 billion.  By the beginning of 2001 its main factories were in Italy, Germany and France, with smaller factories in, for example, the USA, Brazil and Australia.

The group was internally divided, without particular regard to corporate or national boundaries, into three main units, namely Soremartec, the Business Unit and the Operations Unit.  Soremartec was responsible for developing and setting the specifications and quality standards of Ferrero’s products.  For present purposes its importance lies in the fact that its task included laying down detailed rules about standards applicable to raw materials, including hazelnuts, which included setting dates in each crop season by which purchases had to be obtained from Turkey,  and dates by when old season nuts had to be used in manufacture.  The Business Unit was responsible for sales and marketing, while the Operations Unit was responsible for the manufacture of Ferrero’s products.  The purchasing (both of raw materials and packaging) came within the remit of the Operations Unit and, separately from Soremartec, Operations had its own responsibility for quality control.</p>

By the beginning of 2001 Ferrero Industrial had two managing directors, Mr Rosa Brunet, responsible for raw materials purchases, and Mr Giovanni Poggio with responsibility for the purchase of packaging and technical equipment.  Before his appointment to Ferrero Industrial in June 2000, Mr Rosa Brunet had previously been the Purchasing Director of Ferrero Italy, since 1986, with responsibility for all that company’s purchasing requirements, including hazelnuts. Between 1985 and 1990, he had gained considerable experience of the hazelnut market in Turkey, in particular in connection with a joint venture company which Ferrero set up with 49% Turkish investors, called Balsu, for the purposes of hazelnut purchases for the group.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The thinking behind the formation of a central purchasing operation for the requirements of all Ferrero companies was the avoidance of internal competition between them in the same market places.  The avoidance of that competition was achieved at the price of creating a single player in the market which was by the beginning of 2001 the largest single non-Turkish purchaser of hazelnuts in the world, the requirements of which were of themselves sufficient adversely to affect market prices.  Ferrero’s purchasing requirements were driven by the operational needs of its manufacturing plants throughout the world, which by no means, either individually or in the aggregate, matched the seasonal pattern of availability of hazelnuts, or in particular the periods when, early in the season, hazelnuts could be obtained at their freshest, before the passage of time while in storage reduced their quality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ferrero Industrial’s natural response to the risk of forcing up the market by becoming an involuntary purchaser of large quantities of hazelnuts at any particular time, was to build up buffer stocks of hazelnuts, and for that purpose to use the group’s own storage facilities, particularly within Europe, to ensure as far as possible that by careful temperature and humidity control, loss of quality while in store was kept to a minimum.  By the beginning of 2001 Ferrero had also embarked upon the freezing of hazelnuts, but this was still on a small and experimental scale.  Although some of its suppliers, including Başkan Gida, were developing their own temperature and humidity controlled storage facilities by 2001, Ferrero Industrial’s routine preference was to obtain delivery of its buffer stocks into Europe as early as possible in each crop season, to the extent consistent with avoiding the creation of a seller’s market, rather than relying upon late-season purchases of nuts which, perforce, would have been in storage in Turkey for a substantial period since being harvested.  The risk of unacceptable loss of quality by late-season purchases was much greater in relation to rocher than it was in relation to paste, and it affected kernels much more than nuts in shell.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The importance of building up buffer stocks in excess of the operating companies’ immediate manufacturing requirements was accentuated by two factors.  The first was that the general success of Ferrero’s business meant that its hazelnuts requirements were, and had for some time before the beginning of 2001 been, increasing year by year.  The second was that, in order to avoid being at the mercy of suppliers, Ferrero planned to build up sufficient stocks of ‘old season’ stock to ensure that its manufacturing requirements could be met from those hazelnuts during the early part of the following season.  In this respect there was something of a tug of war between, on the one hand, the purchasing department’s desire to maintain buffer stocks to avoid being an involuntary buyer of new season crop and, on the other hand, the wish emanating from Soremartec and those responsible for quality control to minimise the use of old crop rather than new crop nuts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Prior to the establishment of Ferrero Industrial, each Ferrero operating company had developed its own separate relationships with hazelnut suppliers.  These relationships were, in effect, inherited by Ferrero Industrial, and thereafter developed for the purposes of its centralised purchasing strategy.  The main policy elements affecting Ferrero’s Industrial’s relationship with its hazelnuts suppliers may be summarised as follows.  First, excessive dependence upon one single supplier was, for obvious reasons, to be avoided.  Thus during the period ending in 2000, Ferrero had three main Turkish suppliers, namely Başkan Gida, Oltan Gida and Yavuzlar, two Italian suppliers, Barbero and Stelliferi, and also obtained some supplies from smaller markets including the United States, Georgia and Azerbaijan.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Ferrero Industrial continued the operating companies’ earlier policy of seeking to establish long-term relationships with its main suppliers.  Within those relationships, Ferrero sought to educate its suppliers as to its particular specification and quality requirements, to encourage them to adopt best modern practice in processing nuts and to avoid or minimise the risk of Ferrero being exploited by its suppliers’ knowledge of its hazelnut requirements.</p>

Furthermore, to assist in the coordination of deliveries, Ferrero had arranged for junior members of its purchasing staff to have a permanent presence at Başkan Gida’s premises in Giresun.  During the relevant period this function was carried out by Mr Altare and Mr Scavino, usually alternately.  Furthermore, it had become habitual for members of the Başkan family to take Mr Casale on tours of selected hazelnut farms, while visiting Turkey, so as to enable him to observe the growing crop at first hand so as to gain a reliable impression of its likely size and quality, beyond that reported to him by the Başkans themselves.  Nonetheless, language barriers prevented Mr Casale or any other members of Ferrero’s senior management from having any significant discussions with persons active in Başkan Gida’s own supply chain, or from forming meaningful business relationships with them.  By the beginning of 2001 the day to day business relationship between Ferrero and Başkan Gida was conducted almost exclusively (in terms of anything other than routine administrative communications) between Mr Casale for Ferrero and Melih Başkan for Başkan Gida.  </p>

As to integrity, Ferrero had not experienced any attempt by Başkan Gida (by contrast for example with Yavuzlar) to exploit its knowledge of Ferrero’s requirements, for example by building stocks of nuts when the market was low, with a view to supplying Ferrero at higher prices thereafter, a type of informed speculation to which Ferrero with its large requirements considered itself particularly vulnerable.</p>

He also had ready access on an informal basis to his boss Mr Rosa Brunet for guidance and assistance in deciding upon the amount to be purchased from each potential supplier.  As the centralised purchasing department for hazelnuts, Ferrero Industrial was also charged with maintaining fairness as between the Ferrero operating companies, both in the allocation between them of relevant supplies and in the fixing of prices.

Mr Casale made a practice of avoiding disclosure even to a trusted supplier like Başkan Gida of Ferrero’s annual requirements or even its immediate needs, not only to avoid Ferrero being taken advantage of by its immediate supplier, but also to guard against the risk of knowledge of Ferrero’s requirements leaking into the general Turkish hazelnut market.</p>

Again, he said that to disclose a specific Ferrero requirement, might turn the market against Ferrero.  Rather, he said that his practice was to indicate on the telephone to Melih Başkan (and to competing suppliers like Oltan Gida) an interest in purchasing hazelnuts of a particular type at a particular price, frequently without specifying any particular quantity at that stage.  Mr Casale’s evidence suggests that discussion focused around a price in Turkish lira at which Başkan Gida would purchase the nuts, it being assumed that the price payable by Ferrero would be the aggregate of that base price, mark-ups at pre-agreed rates, and a conversion to US dollars or euros at then prevailing rates.</p>

Melih Başkan would send to Ferrero, for Mr Casale’s attention, a series of Daily Purchase Reports (“DPRs”) stating the amounts of hazelnuts purchased by Başkan Gida of the relevant type, and identifying the price payable and quoting average currency conversion rates for euros and US dollars for that day.  The DPRs which I have studied appear to distinguish between Giresun and Ordu in terms of variety, and between nuts in shell and kernels.  Mr Casale told me that he was usually informed on the telephone by Melih Başkan of the information recorded in the DPRs so that he did not need to study the DPRs as if they contained fresh information.</p>

To assist in this process Başkan Gida routinely prepared and sent to Ferrero Industrial written Price Calculations (“PCs”).  The first page of these usually summarised recent purchases by Başkan Gida by reference to a series of DPRs, in a manner designed to identify the average price paid for the aggregate tonnage in Turkish lira, together with the average conversion rates into euros and dollars during the period when the purchases had been made.  To those average prices, in euros and/or dollars, Başkan Gida then added a series of mark ups at pre-agreed rates, differing for each type of  variety and specification of nuts supplied, under the headings processing costs, export tax, export cost and profit, to produce a total price payable by Ferrero for each type, per metric ton.  Occasionally, (and this applied only to a small minority of Ferrero’s orders) a quotation for a CPT rather than FOT delivery would be made, including an amount for freight.

To take a random example, the mark-ups for Ordu nuts to Ferrero Italy’s specification in October 2000 were US$120 for processing, US$100 for export tax, US$50 for export costs and US$140 for profit, with a discount of US$60 if the delivery was to be taken as paste, rather than the higher specification for rocher, since less processing costs would be incurred for paste.  By way of comparison, the mark-ups in force on the same day for Giresun nuts at Ferrero Italy’s specification were US$210 for processing, the same as Ordu for export tax, export costs and profit, with a discount of US$90 for paste as against rocher.</p>

Ferrero’s only means of satisfying itself that the prices quoted to it by Başkan Gida were realistic and fair was to compare them with the prices quoted by other suppliers, such as Oltan Gida, which at Ferrero’s request used broadly similar methods of cost-plus calculation.</p>

In any event, the US$140 profit mark up had to accommodate Başkan Gida’s cost of financing its acquisition of that parcel of nuts, between the date when it paid its suppliers and the date when Ferrero paid Başkan Gida, usually between one or two days after receipt of invoice, following delivery FOT.</p>

Whereas all Ferrero purchase orders used the language of the place of incorporation of the relevant operating company, all Başkan Gida’s contracts were in English.  They contained substantially the same particulars in relation to each order as Ferrero’s purchase orders, with one important exception, relating to delivery period.  Whereas Ferrero’s purchase orders usually identified a delivery period by reference to a month, (meaning, unless otherwise stated, delivery by the end of the stated month), Başkan Gida’s contracts almost invariably simply stated, under the heading ‘Shipment’, the phrase “prompt from origin”.</p>

The point matters because in the trade references which Ferrero Industrial gave the Banks for Başkan Gida in July and December 2001, Ferrero stated that it relied on Başkan Gida’s ability to provide shipments “on a timely basis”.  As will appear, Başkan Gida was not by December 2001 routinely providing shipments within the delivery periods specified on Ferrero’s purchase orders, such that, if those periods formed terms of the contracts for the supply of hazelnuts to which those purchase orders related, Başkan Gida was by December 2001 in breach of a large number of them.</p>

The only person to give evidence involved in the making of the contracts (which in every case took place orally over the telephone) was Mr Casale.  The only employee of Başkan Gida to give evidence, Mrs Pay, was not part of the sales staff, her duties being limited to the preparation of export documents and invoices.  Başkan Gida has given no disclosure in the proceedings and it is clear that Ferrero’s disclosure, and in particular the disclosure by Ferrero Industrial, has omitted a substantial part of the contemporaneous documentation, for reasons to which I will have to return.

Secondly, there is no evidence that this discrepancy gave rise to any difficulties at all between the parties by the end of 2000.  Thirdly, most, but by no means all deliveries made during the 2000 season between August and December 2000 were made within the periods stated in the relevant Ferrero purchase orders.  Nonetheless, over 2,000mt of hazelnuts were delivered outside those periods, without apparent complaint.  </p>

Thus, Ferrero administered the transactions reflected in its purchase orders by recording the particulars contained in those orders on its computer systems, and using them for the purpose of monitoring deliveries and approving invoices for payment.  Conversely, according to Mrs Pay, Başkan Gida recorded the details of its written contracts on its computer system, again for the purpose of preparing goods for delivery, obtaining customs clearance and sending out invoices.  Başkan Gida’s contracts were, when requested, countersigned and returned by Ferrero to Başkan Gida.  If available to Ferrero Industrial at the time when it sent instructions to operating companies to prepare purchase orders, Başkan Gida’s contracts were generally copied to the operating companies.  Apart from that, they were simply filed away.  It appears therefore that in the minds of those responsible for the management of the parties’ respective obligations under the supply transactions, no one at Ferrero was particularly conscious that Başkan Gida purported uniformly to supply “prompt from origin” and no one at Başkan Gida appears to have been likely to have regarded delivery within the period stated in the Ferrero purchase orders as a contractually undertaken obligation, however desirable in order to satisfy an important customer.</p>

Nonetheless, whatever the position as a matter of strict contractual obligation (and I bear in mind that none of the hazelnut supply contracts were governed by English law) there was a mutual commercial expectation that, once ordered, hazelnuts would usually be delivered FOT in Turkey within about a month, save where the volume of orders was sufficient to overload Başkan Gida’s processing capacity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.  First, the mutual understanding between the parties (whether or not true in fact) was that Başkan Gida had contracted to purchase sufficient hazelnuts of the appropriate type to satisfy a Ferrero order by the time it was made.  This is the inevitable consequence of the process whereby orders were placed on the back of Başkan Gida’s DPRs. There was no evidence that Başkans Gida purchased hazelnuts otherwise than for immediate delivery, but no evidence as to what, precisely, immediate delivery meant in Turkey. All that Başkan Gida needed to do therefore, as a matter of mutual understanding, was to take delivery of nuts from its suppliers, process and bag them and load them onto transport supplied by Ferrero. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, it was in the mutual interest of the parties that this process should take place as quickly as possible.  First, Ferrero’s interest was, as I have described, to arrange for hazelnuts to be stored in Europe in its own storage facilities, rather than to leave them in storage for long periods abroad.  I have no reason to suppose that Başkan Gida was unaware of this.  Its interest was to obtain payment for hazelnuts sold to Ferrero (usually within a day or two of invoicing, immediately following delivery FOT) as soon as possible, to minimise the period when it needed to finance the purchase of hazelnuts from its own suppliers.  Ferrero had no commercial wish to delay delivery, for the purpose of postponing the date of payment, since throughout the relevant period, it appears that Ferrero’s cash flow was amply sufficient to make payment for hazelnuts ordered, as soon as they became available.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a difficult issue as to Başkan Gida’s processing capacity at the material time, which therefore impacts upon the question whether and to what extent the parties’ expectations as to likely delivery periods were tempered by capacity restraints within Başkan Gida’s factories.  I have no doubt that Ferrero’s status as Başkan Gida’s largest and most important customer meant that available processing capacity was usually deployed to meeting Ferrero’s orders as a first priority.  Mr Abidali’s evidence was that, both in terms of quality and reliability, Başkan Gida’s performance of its obligations to less favoured customers was by no means as good.  Mr Abidali’s evidence was in that respect corroborated by surviving contemporaneous correspondence disclosed by Indo-Med’s liquidator.</p>

It is tempting to conclude that Başkan Gida’s capacity must have been as high as the highest rate disclosed by those figures.  During the 2000 crop season, those figures suggest that Başkan Gida achieved weekly deliveries to Ferrero operating companies which exceeded 1,000mt on no less than six occasions, during September to November 2000.  The highest was in excess of 2,500mt and there was one other delivery in excess of 2,300mt.  During the 2001 crop season Başkan Gida achieved a weekly aggregate delivery to Ferrero companies exceeding 1,000mt on only one occasion, in September.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment these figures do not enable any reliable conclusions to be drawn as to Başkan Gida’s processing capacity, for a number of reasons.  First, the agreed delivery statistics are based upon incomplete records as to the precise dates of physical delivery, which are best evidenced by truck loading documents.  Where those are absent, the agreed statistics adopt the invoice date.  The trouble with invoice dates is that they may show misleading concentrations of deliveries, by reference to batches of invoices sent out by Başkan Gida’s administration department, relating to actual deliveries spaced over a wider preceding period.  Mrs Pay confirmed that this was so.  She was asked in cross-examination to estimate Başkan Gida’s daily loading capacity.  She put it at about ten trucks (i.e. 240mt).  This would support a weekly loading capacity of 1,440mt, assuming a six day week, but she was quick to point out that this was unlikely to be achieved day after day, and in any event depended upon the availability of nuts for loading, with their differing processing requirements.  She also confirmed that invoices were not invariably dated or sent out on the day of delivery of the relevant goods, sometimes being completed days later.  Although her evidence related to matters taking place years ago, it was about aspects of Başkan Gida’s activities falling squarely within her field of responsibility. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason (also reflected in Mrs Pay’s evidence) is that the delivery statistics do not distinguish between different varieties, specifications and qualities of nuts, all of which needed differing levels of processing in order to convert incoming supplies at the Turkish standard to the different specifications required by the various Ferrero operating companies.  There is therefore no set processing time per metric tonne or lorry load of hazelnuts capable of being identified, and therefore no unitary measure of  processing capacity capable of being applied to any set of Ferrero purchase orders, for the purpose of ascertaining whether it overloaded Başkan Gida’s processing capacity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, no attempted estimate of Başkan Gida’s processing capacity would accommodate occasional interruptions, such as might be caused by the discovery that a particular batch of incoming hazelnuts fell short of expected quality standards, necessitating replacement or longer processing.  Another potential source of interruption was Ramadan, during which the obligation to fast during daylight hours is said adversely to affect the productivity of the Turkish workforce.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> A further reason for inability to define processing capacity arises from the fact that some deliveries were accumulated for the purpose of being put all on a single ship. This is likely to have led to a group of deliveries being concentrated within a particular short period, giving the misleading impression that the necessary processing all took place immediately prior to delivery.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All that can be said with any confidence is that Ferrero’s purchase orders were more likely to stretch Başkan Gida’s processing capacity early in the season, that is between August and December in any year, than at any time thereafter, both because this was the period of peak availability of hazelnuts following harvest and because it coincided with Ferrero’s wish both to buy when the supply was high, so as to avoid the risk of increased prices, and to buy early for storage in Europe rather than late, after storage in Turkey.  Departure from a commercial expectation of delivery within approximately one month was therefore inherently more likely as the result of capacity issues during that period, than at any other time in the year.  This is specifically borne out by the agreed statistics for delivery periods actually achieved during the 2000 crop year, when there were a series of late deliveries outside the period specified in Ferrero purchase orders between July and October, and virtually none between November and March.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is necessary briefly to describe the process within Ferrero by which delivery of hazelnuts by Başkan Gida led to payment of its invoices.  The procedures differed slightly as between Ferrero Italy on the one hand and Ferrero Germany and France on the other, largely due to the fact that Ferrero Industrial and Ferrero Italy shared common offices.  I only heard detailed evidence relating to the deliveries to Ferrero Italy and Ferrero Germany.

Başkan Gida would send invoices relating to Ferrero Italy, together with evidence of delivery, to Ferrero Industrial, where they would be checked and approved for payment by Mr Casale’s team.  I accept Mr Casale’s evidence that he did not routinely carry out this process personally, although he and Mr Rosa Brunet both initialled numerous invoices to signify that they had been approved for payment by their staff.  Mr Casale’s evidence was that he or Mr Rosa Brunet sometimes initialled invoices after they had been passed to Ferrero Italy for payment, for example when they were both away from the office at the material time.  It is sufficient for present purposes for me to say that, whenever initialled, invoices needed Mr Casale’s department’s approval before being passed to Ferrero Italy for payment.  Mrs Di Matteo confirmed that the practice of having incoming invoices initialled by Ferrero Industrial (which she called the Purchasing Department) was used only for supplies where payment was due before receipt into Ferrero Italy’s own warehouse or factory.  It therefore applied to all Başkan Gida’s  deliveries.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next stage was for invoices to be sent to Ferrero Italy’s import department, charged with ensuring compliance with customs formalities.  For this purpose they used the invoice and accompanying evidence of delivery, and noted relevant details on a computer database before passing invoices to Ferrero Italy’s accounts department.  With access to the same database, the accounts department could assume without further checking that delivery had been made (although of course the hazelnuts were still weeks away from arrival at Ferrero Italy’s warehouse).  The job of the accounts department was to ensure that payment for the delivered hazelnuts was due to Başkan Gida, and duly recorded as having been made.  For this purpose the accounts department relied primarily on Ferrero Italy’s purchase orders.  Any particular order might generate a whole stream of invoices, as hazelnuts were delivered, lorry load by lorry load, to satisfy an order which might for a quantity in excess of 1,000mt.  Checking invoices against purchase orders enabled the accounts department to satisfy itself first, that the nuts had been ordered, secondly that Başkan Gida was charging the correct price in its invoice, and thirdly that the nuts had not yet been paid for.  Once approved for payment, the invoice was sent to the treasury department, whose only task was to ensure that payment was actually made, in accordance with any agreed timeframe, to the appropriate bank nominated by Başkan Gida.  It was no part of the treasury department’s function to decide whether an invoice was payable, or to check invoices against purchase orders, still less against Başkan Gida’s form of contracts.  Since payments were routinely made by bank transfer, it was the responsibility of the treasury department to ensure that both Ferrero Italy’s bankers had facilities for direct payment to the bank nominated by Başkan Gida, and to ensure that instructions were given for payment to the correct bank.  </p>

Where suppliers such as Başkan Gida frequently requested payment to a number of different banks, it was necessary for the treasury department to ensure that the necessary bank to bank links existed between Ferrero Italy’s bank and each of those used by the supplier.  Başkan Gida (uniquely in Mrs Di Matteo’s recollection) supplied a list of banks for that purpose to the Ferrero Italy treasury department, at the beginning of the season.  Thus it was necessary in relation to each incoming Başkan Gida invoice for Mrs Di Matteo’s staff to check first whether it was the current bank identified for payment on the department’s database, if not, secondly whether it was on Başkan Gida’s list, and if not, thirdly to check with Ferrero’s bank whether there existed a satisfactory payment arrangement between it and the new bank identified on the relevant invoice.</p>

It was Mr Bolowich’s responsibility to approve payment of invoices to Ferrero Germany.  He would ascertain that delivery had been made, either directly with Ferrero Industrial’s employees in Giresun, or with Ferrero’s transport contractors based in Istanbul.  Having checked that payment was due, by comparison with Ferrero Germany’s purchase order, Mr Bolowich would authorise payment by signing the invoice and passing it to Ferrero Germany’s treasury department to arrange for timely payment to the appropriate bank.  As I have said, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I infer that the procedure relating to deliveries to Ferrero France was much the same as that adopted by Ferrero Germany.</p>

Mr Abidali described the essence of the terms of trade between Indo-Med and Başkan Gida as being that Başkan Gida would supply Indo-Med with hazelnuts at cost, Indo-Med would on-sell them at a profit, and that Indo-Med and Başkan Gida would then share the profit between them equally.  This relationship demanded a high degree of mutual trust, since Indo-Med had to rely upon Başkan Gida’s honesty as to the cost of supplying hazelnuts to Indo-Med, and Başkan Gida had to rely upon Indo-Med’s integrity in making a full disclosure of the relevant profit to be shared.  So far as I can ascertain, neither party sought to carry out any due diligence checks upon the other’s compliance with those obligations, which were conducted with a high degree of informality, profit shares being identified during the course of infrequent after-the-event reconciliation meetings between Melih Başkan and Mr Abidali.</p>

It is a reasonable inference that, thereafter, Mr Abidali felt personally indebted to the Başkan family, and to Melih Başkan in particular, for their assistance to him during Indo-Med’s financial troubles.  In short, I infer that Mr Abidali recognised at least a moral obligation to help the Başkan family, should they in turn incur financial difficulties in circumstances where he or his company had the ability to provide practical help.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the end of 2000, the parties were well embarked upon processing, selling, buying and trading in the Turkish hazelnut crop which was harvested during the previous summer.  It was by all accounts a poor crop, yielding (according to official figures) approximately 500,000mt, as opposed to 640,000 in the previous year and 750,000 in the following year.  The market was also adversely affected first, by the disruption to exporters’ activities (and in particular their processing facilities) caused by the earthquake which I have described, and secondly by the serious Turkish financial crisis, which began in the second half of 2000, and which came to a head in early 2001.  The principal adverse consequence of this economic crisis for exporters such as Başkan Gida was a large rise in the interest rates at which Turkish banks were prepared to lend to their Turkish customers.  The effect of this on the cost to Başkan Gida of maintaining its working capital was exacerbated by the fact that in about November 2000 Ferrero decided to cease making pre-payments for hazelnuts deliveries by Turkish suppliers, a decision which Mr Casale attributed to a concern at the credit risk inherent in making pre-payments to companies in a country undergoing an economic crisis.  He said, and I accept, that the decision to end pre-payments was not based upon any specific concerns about Başkan Gida itself, being applied even-handedly to all Ferrero’s Turkish suppliers.</p>

Although a little over 2,000mt were delivered outside the delivery period specified in the Ferrero Purchase Orders, it does not appear that financial difficulties had detracted from the reliability of Başkan Gida’s performance as Ferrero’s largest hazelnut supplier by the end of that year, and the contrary has not been suggested.  Business therefore continued to the beginning of 2001 without there being, or being any basis for, any apprehension on the part of Ferrero or Indo-Med that Başkan Gida’s long and satisfactory track record as an honest and reliable supplier of high quality hazelnuts was being adversely affected, either by the poor harvest, or by the growing Turkish economic crisis.</p>

In short, by the end of July, Ferrero had declined to assist from its own resources, although it made limited efforts to find bank finance for Başkan Gida in Italy.  Mr Abidali had found Mr Dahod, and brokered a financing agreement which had begun to bear fruit, while the Banks had gone no further than the early stages of a due diligence examination of a finance proposal.</p>

For a company like Başkan Gida which exported 95% of its turnover for payment mainly in dollars or euros, but which paid for its labour and materials mainly in Turkish lira, this short term disparity between the rate of inflation and the rate of devaluation ought to have been advantageous since, whether looked at in terms of  US dollars or Turkish lira, the value of its sales was likely to outstrip its cost of sales, until wage and price inflation cancelled or reversed that trend (as, in due course, they later did).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It appears however that two related factors more than cancelled out this apparent short term advantage.  The first was that, (as the experts broadly agreed) Başkan Gida appears to have borrowed from its Turkish bankers the finance necessary to support both working capital, the cost of acquisition and improvement of fixed assets and some unexplained historic debts, in dollars rather than in lira.  Secondly, at the heart of the Turkish economic crisis lay a lack of bank liquidity, which led to Başkan Gida’s Turkish banks charging it ever increasing levels of interest, reaching (according to some reports), 20% or more.  Faced therefore with the double whammy of borrowing in an appreciating foreign currency at exorbitant rates of interest from local banks, it is no surprise that Başkan Gida’s response was to seek foreign sources of finance, to remedy a potentially disastrous predicament.</p>

By a letter to Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale dated 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2001, Başkan Gida sought US$30 million of finance from Ferrero, of which it proposed to use $14.5 million for capital expenditure to improve its processing capacity.  The invitation was supported by a detailed explanation why Başkan Gida’s business with Ferrero was said to have become unprofitable, and was wrapped up within an offer to become Ferrero’s exclusive supplier of Turkish hazelnuts, and to achieve repayment over 10 years by taking a reduced profit share.  Alternatively, it was suggested that finance could be obtained from a bank of Ferrero’s choice, with Ferrero’s promise to buy 30,000 to 40,000 mt of hazelnuts per annum from Başkan Gida constituting that bank’s main security for repayment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wardell put it to both Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet that, since Başkan Gida’s letter allocated only US$14.5 million of the proposed US$30 million investment as being for capital expenditure, the rest must have been to repair a US$15 million hole in Başkan Gida’s balance sheet, thus revealing that Başkan Gida was in grave financial difficulty.  They both denied gaining any such impression.  In particular they made it clear that they took Başkan Gida’s assertion that its business with Ferrero was loss-making with a pinch of salt, pointing out that Ferrero was buying from Başkan Gida at broadly the same prices, with broadly the same built-in gross profit margin, as it was buying from Başkan Gida’s competitors in Turkey, and that all Turkish exporters were anxious to do business with Ferrero on those terms.  Further, Mr Casale pointed to the fact that, in his view, there had been no interruptions in the regularity and quality of Başkan Gida’s deliveries, such as might be attributable to financial difficulties within Başkan Gida.  As to this, the agreed statistics for deliveries in early 2001 showed only a single failure by Başkan Gida to deliver within the periods specified in Ferrero purchase orders for January to March inclusive (namely 6 out of 20 batches ordered by Ferrero Germany on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February).  Actual weekly deliveries showed a dip in February, and an unusual zero for the week beginning 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, but a return to a healthy 400 mt plus per week for the 4 weeks beginning on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, which was a satisfactory level, having regard to the low volume of the 2000/01 crop.</p>

In the meantime, Başkan Gida directed its attention to obtaining finance from other sources.</p>

The Banks’ case is that Ferrero must have appreciated that nothing short of the gravest financial difficulties could have persuaded Başkan Gida to contract on such gravely disadvantageous terms.  Ferrero’s case is that Başkan Gida gave an apparently plausible commercial reason for offering Ferrero substantial discounts off the ordinary cost plus pricing basis in relation to the FKB contracts, and that neither the making nor the performance by Başkan Gida of those contracts gave any indication that Başkan Gida was in financial difficulty.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The immediate background to the making of the FKB contracts was that, during a difficult crop season giving rise to a generally tight market, Başkan Gida had by mid-April 2001 delivered a little over 21,000mt of hazelnut kernels to Ferrero, but that Ferrero anticipated a substantial continuing requirement for 2000 crop season nuts, both for its manufacturing needs during the rest of that season, and to provide a buffer to avoid it being held to ransom at the beginning of the 2001 crop season.  For its part, FKB had amassed substantial stocks for price maintenance purposes early in the season and, by April 2001, was likely to be the holder of the best quality stock, by reason of the combination of selecting good quality for storage, holding nuts in shell, and the use of humidity and temperature controlled warehouses.  FKB announced that it would sell hazelnuts at US$1.70 per kilo (i.e. US$1,700 per mt) ex-warehouse.  Converting to kernels at a 50% yield meant that FKB was offering at a kernels price of US$3,400, but of course the buyer would have to incur the cost of cracking.</p>

On the face of the documents, the discounts appeared to involve Başkan Gida in abandoning the whole of its US$140 profit margin, swallowing its own US$50 export costs and increasing by US$30 its rocher to paste reduction.</p>

With Mr Rosa Brunet’s approval, he had communicated to Melih Başkan an indication (without being precise at to quantity) that Ferrero wished to acquire a few thousand mt of kernels during the residue of the 2000 season.  Melih Başkan’s response was that Başkan Gida was reluctant to make further substantial purchases in the market for fear of pushing up prices at a late stage in the season, and causing itself losses on unrelated orders from other customers against which (by implication) Başkan Gida had not covered itself, and in relation to which Mr Casale assumed that Başkan Gida anticipated making profits at current market prices.  As an alternative, Melih Başkan suggested that Ferrero’s requirements could be fulfilled by using supplies from FKB.  Because those would cost more to Başkan Gida than supplies from the market, Melih Başkan offered to reduce the added cost to Ferrero of buying nuts sourced from FKB by the discounts which I have described.  Mr Casale regarded it as implicit in Melih Başkan’s proposal that, if Ferrero accepted it, it would not itself purchase hazelnuts in the market, and thereby raise prices in much the same way as if Başkan Gida had purchased them on Ferrero’s behalf.</p>

He said that the negotiations took place on the telephone, and that when he later received the PCs confirming them, he did not study them with that degree of attention which would, he accepted, have disclosed a probable loss for Başkan Gida, on the face of the calculations.  His main point was that it was Başkan Gida rather than Ferrero which had proposed those terms, and it never occurred to him that Başkan Gida would deliberately propose a series of large volume loss-making contracts.  He said that, to the extent that the discounts suggested involved the abandonment of a previously agreed profit margin, this was expressly proposed by Melih Başkan on the basis that, by purchasing from FKB, Başkan Gida would preserve the profitability of contracts already made with other customers, by avoiding pushing up prices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the rationale for Ferrero contracting to acquire nuts sourced from FKB at a higher price than the same specification sourced from the market, Mr Casale said that he and Mr Rosa Brunet in consultation with Mr Nasi, concluded that the small extra price was worth paying, because it avoided Ferrero imposing its substantial continuing requirements for 2000 crop nuts on a tight market, thereby encouraging speculators to buy and hoard nuts, with a view to holding Ferrero to ransom at much higher prices at the end of the season.  In that regard Mr Casale prayed in aid a draft letter found on his laptop intended to be sent by Ferrero’s Turkish lawyers to Yavuzlar, specifically describing Ferrero’s disapprobation of exporters who speculated against Ferrero by buying and hoarding, as an illustration of that policy rationale.</p>

They supported this by Mr Solak’s evidence which, after the rectification of some double counting, set out by reference to detailed calculations how, in his opinion, the FKB contracts must have lost Başkan Gida an aggregate of US$2.099 million.  Every part of Mr Casale’s account of the negotiation of those contracts was challenged in cross-examination.  In particular it was put to him that Ferrero would never have continued to deal with Başkan Gida if Melih Başkan had, as Mr Casale described, revealed to him that Başkan Gida had taken speculative short positions in dealing with other customers.  It was even suggested that Mr Casale’s draft letter to Yavuzlar, which was undoubtedly disclosed late, was a recent fabrication, conjured up to support Ferrero’s case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For his part, Ferrero’s expert Mr Haas-Rickertsen initially sought to justify an opinion that the terms of the FKB contracts left Başkan Gida room for profit, but it was based upon taking Melih Başkan’s stated processing costs as being true.  In a supplemental report, substituting his own opinion as to production costs, Mr Haas-Rickertsen reached the view, which he described in cross-examination as preferable to his earlier view, that the FKB contracts were, on his opinion as to associated costs, likely to lead to a loss for Başkan Gida in the sum of US$1.29 million, although he continued to maintain that it was possible (albeit unprovable) that Başkan Gida could have exploited opportunities significantly to reduce that loss.  Both he and Mr Casale pointed to a range of possibilities available to Başkan Gida, such as purchasing from the market rather than FKB (and therefore at lower cost), purchasing at a discount from FKB, reduced processing costs attributable to the generally high quality of the FKB product, achieving a higher than 50% yield when cracking nuts in shell, and gains made on the receipt of whole warehouse deliveries where the actual volumes exceeded the registered quantities.  By the end of his cross-examination, Mr Haas-Rickertsen had been constrained to concede that most of these opportunities, if exploited by Başkan Gida, would only have made marginal differences.</p>

No stone was left unturned, and every aspect of the cost analysis of the acquisition and processing of FKB shells into Ferrero’s specification kernels was wrangled over in the minutest detail.  It would overburden this necessarily very long judgment for me to engage with, or determine, every aspect of that major battle.  I bear in mind in particular that the relevance of the FKB contracts to the Banks’ claims is not their commerciality <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> but the impression as to Başkan Gida’s financial position which the negotiation of them conveyed to Ferrero.  Nonetheless, a reliable judgment as to that impression cannot be wholly divorced from the underlying reality, and a proper appreciation of Başkan Gida’s financial position, and the motives underlying its business decisions, plays a part in a number of other issues which I must also decide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am in no doubt, that by April 2001, Başkan Gida was approaching, if not already struggling with, serious financial difficulties.  Its own quarterly management accounts showed only wafer thin profits and an excessive exposure to short-term borrowing, together with a tiny net positive equity.  Although its accounts for 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2001 would in due course continue to show a small surplus of shareholders’ funds, its auditors later advised that, when a mistreatment of financial expenses was corrected, it had a net negative equity as at that date of the Turkish lira equivalent of US$7.5 million.  Assuming that the auditors’ approach presented a true and fair view, it was probably balance sheet insolvent by mid-April 2001.  The evidence however does not show whether it was commercially insolvent, nor did financial difficulties prevent it from substantially discharging its delivery obligations to Ferrero within the period specified in its purchase orders.  </p>

There is only slight documentary evidence of this, in the form of a document retained by Indo-Med and a note by Mr Solak recording Başkan Gida having offered to sell forward over this period. Melih Başkan’s assertion to that effect to Mr Casale was corroborated by the concurrent views of both Mr Solak and Mr Haas-Rickertsen, to the effect that the Turkish hazelnut market opinion was that Başkan Gida was a notorious short speculator, generally taking a more bullish view of available supply than the rest of the market, and therefore shorting the market in the expectation of a late season fall in prices.  The experts were also agreed that in April 2001 the market was thin, and that although prices were still below the FKB offered level, the impact of any substantial demand (such as the 6,000mt contemplated by Ferrero) would be bound to drive up prices, to the severe embarrassment of any short speculator.  Whether that was, in April 2001, likely to strip Başkan Gida of an anticipated profit (as Mr Casale said he thought) or create or aggravate an impending loss, is impossible to ascertain without access to Başkan Gida’s working records, and probably does not matter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The expert evidence suggests a strong probability that the FKB contracts were in fact loss-making to Başkan Gida, and Melih Başkan must have understood this at the time.  On their face, the PCs which I have described projected an US$80 loss per tonne.  Applied to the aggregate tonnage under these contracts, this projects a loss a little in excess of US$500,000.    I have already referred to the higher estimates of US$1.25 million (Haas-Rickertsen) and US$2.099 million (Solak).  For present purposes it does not matter which of those three alternatives is correct.  What does matter is the commercial rationale leading Başkan Gida to propose loss-making terms to Ferrero for a large amount of business. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In my judgment the motivation was as follows.  First, at the heart of all Başkan Gida’s attempts in 2001 to raise substantial further finance lay its ability to assert a high level of ongoing business with a blue chip customer, namely Ferrero.  That this represented a key attraction to any potential lender is apparent from Başkan Gida’s letter to Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet in March, from the central structure of what became the Dahod loan agreement, and from its presentation shortly thereafter to lenders in the City of London, including the Banks.  From the perspective of obtaining trade finance, its business with Ferrero was, quite simply, the jewel in Başkan Gida’s crown.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, since Başkan Gida was short the market, if it could not find an off-market source to meet Ferrero’s  demand, then Ferrero would be likely to satisfy it (whether through Başkan Gida or other exporters) from the ordinary Turkish domestic market, thereby forcing up prices to Başkan Gida’s grave disadvantage.  In this context, the expert evidence powerfully suggests that what Melih Başkan told Mr Casale about Başkan Gida’s short position was true.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, and this emerged only at a very late stage in the evidence, it appears that, contrary to Mr Solak’s opinion, FKB may have been prepared to sell nuts on deferred payment terms to reliable customers, charging an interest related premium for the credit period thereby provided.  That this was a possibility emerged only when Mr Haas-Rickertsen acknowledged it under cross-examination.  Until then it appeared to be common ground that FKB would require payment on delivery.  For that reason, this possibility was never put to Mr Casale in cross-examination.  If deferred payment terms were available to Başkan Gida from FKB, this would have been a powerful reason for persuading Ferrero to buy nuts sourced from FKB rather than from the market and, since the credit period afforded to Başkan Gida would provide it with a much needed boost to its cash flow, it may well have been worth incurring a loss on the transaction in order to obtain that advantage, as a stop gap, in advance of the obtaining substantial further trade finance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Those being Başkan Gida’s probable motives for negotiating the loss-making terms of the FKB contracts, the question remains whether the Banks have succeeded in showing that, contrary to Mr Casale’s and Mr Rosa Brunet’s evidence, Ferrero must thereby have appreciated that Başkan Gida was a company in terminal financial trouble, such as to falsify Mr Casale’s July trade reference.  In my judgment, their evidence was slightly undermined, but not nearly enough for the Banks’ purposes.  My conclusions on this question are as follows.  First, Başkan Gida had not prior to 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April conducted itself in such a way as to disclose severe financial difficulties to Ferrero.  It had performed satisfactorily as a supplier during a difficult crop season, and Ferrero could look back at a long satisfactory relationship with, apparently, the largest and most successful Turkish hazelnut exporter in the business.  In particular, I find that Mr Casale had no reason to assume that Başkan Gida’s short position in the hazelnut market was loss-making, rather than profitable by April 2001, or that Mr Casale appreciated that nuts might be obtainable by Başkan Gida from FKB on deferred payment terms, such a belief not being suggested to him in cross-examination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I specifically reject the Banks’ case that Ferrero had a general abhorrence of speculators, short and long.  Mr Casale’s draft letter to Yavuzlar clearly corroborates his evidence that Ferrero’s particular aversion was to hoarders (i.e. long speculators), so that the revelation by Melih Başkan to him that Başkan Gida was short the market in April 2001 would not of itself have inclined Ferrero to seek alternative suppliers. I reject the suggestion that the draft letter was a self-serving fabrication.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The one respect in which, in my judgment, Mr Casale’s evidence was less than wholly persuasive on these issues lay in his attempts to justify, after the event, a conclusion that Başkan Gida had room to make profits out of the terms of the FKB contracts.  In fairness, this part of Mr Casale’s evidence appears largely to have consisted of speculation after the event, his real recollection being that he did not give the profitability or otherwise of the FKB contracts to Başkan Gida much active thought at the time.  In my judgment both he and Mr Rosa Brunet probably realised that Başkan Gida was prepared to take a loss on the FKB contracts to protect its short position from becoming an embarrassment due to the effect on the market of Ferrero’s requirements, and they probably also believed, by parity of reasoning with the thrust of Başkan Gida’s letter in March, that its policy was to retain as much as possible of Ferrero’s business, even if that meant, from time to time, eliminating profit or even taking a modest loss.  Nonetheless, I have no reason to suppose that Mr Casale or Mr Rosa Brunet had the slightest idea that the terms of the FKB contracts might expose Başkan Gida to losses of the magnitude suggested either by Mr Solak or (upon later reflection) by Mr Haas-Rickertsen.  I can well envisage why a bulk purchaser dealing with suppliers on cost plus terms would find it difficult to believe that its suppliers deliberately understated their anticipated costs, as the expert evidence suggests that Melih Başkan did in the April PCs.  </p>

Başkan Gida satisfied almost all Ferrero’s continuing requirements for 2000 crop hazelnuts, apart from two orders from Oltan Gida, which although at first sight apparently contrary to the understanding that Ferrero would not go into the market while buying FKB sourced nuts from Başkan Gida, may have been orders which Oltan itself sourced from FKB.  Although Başkan Gida’s compliance with the delivery periods in Ferrero’s purchase orders during this period was not quite as good as it had been during the period from January to April, there were no significant delivery failures and the delays beyond those delivery periods do not appear to have been substantial, virtually all deliveries having been made within 44 days of the date of the relevant contracts.</p>

First, he arranged for Indo-Med’s bankers Habib Bank Zurich (“HBZ”) to make available in May 2001 a discount finance facility to Başkan Gida of up to US$1 million, which he guaranteed. Under its terms, Indo-Med advanced money to Başkan Gida against sight of invoices from Başkan Gida to Indo-Med, together with documents confirming shipments of hazelnuts by Başkan Gida to Indo-Med’s customers.  Unlike Ferrero, which paid generally within two days of delivery FOT Giresun, Indo-Med’s customers paid only after delivery to their premises in Europe and elsewhere, so that the HBZ facility provided a useful bridge, if limited in amount, between the production by Başkan Gida of the hazelnuts necessary to supply Indo-Med’s customers, and payment by those customers to Indo-Med, and by Indo-Med to Başkan Gida. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> Secondly, also in May, Mr Abidali assisted Melih Başkan at the early stages of Başkan’s inquiries into the availability of international finance from London based banks, to replace borrowing at high interest from Turkish banks.  This led to Mr Abidali collecting Melih Başkan and Mr Franko from Heathrow airport at the beginning of June, and driving them and a Mr Victor Politis of PRI to initial meetings at the Banks’ London offices at the outset of the negotiation of the Facility.  Mr Abidali described this assistance as nothing more than acting as “a chauffeur and gofer”, and involving him in no analysis or understanding of the type of facility being negotiated.  He was introduced to the Banks at meetings on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2001 as Başkan Gida’s London agent.  In a very loose sense, since Indo-Med obtained customers for Başkan Gida’s hazelnuts, and was based in London, this was true, but Mr Abidali was at pains to distance himself from any agency from Başkan Gida in connection in raising bank finance.  There being no evidence to the contrary, save for his being described as Başkan Gida’s agent, I am inclined to believe him.</p>

Mr Abidali made known the opportunity to invest in Başkan Gida within his community, and was introduced in early June 2001 to Mr Ashraf Dahod (otherwise known and described in many documents as Sheikh Murtaza) as a potential investor.

Apart from the agreement itself, the only relevant documents which have survived are a draft proposal written by Mr Abidali dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and circulated by fax and email to Mr Başkan and Mr Dahod, and an exchange of short emails showing that Mr Abidali met Mr Dahod in Boston shortly beforehand, during which he explained the proposal in more detail.  In short, it appears that the Dahods simply took the merits of the investment on trust from Mr Abidali.  Apart from the prospect of a very substantial return on capital, it appears that Mr Dahod simply placed implicit trust in the say-so of a fellow member of the community, and that he was prepared to accept Mr Abidali’s reference for the Başkans, borne out of their many years’ satisfactory mutual dealings.</p>

Subject to that provision, Mr Abidali said that the terms of the joint venture were as set out in his proposal dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2001, with the following additional provisions.  First, Indo-Med was to act in all respects as the Dahod family’s agent in the performance of the agreement, responsible for receiving investment funds from the Dahods, and their transmission to Başkan Gida, for monitoring Başkan Gida’s performance of its obligations and, most importantly, for receiving the proceeds of sale of hazelnuts, by payment direct from Ferrero, for deducting the agreed $140 per tonne profit share, and for remitting the balance by way of revolving finance back to Başkan Gida to fund the next tranche of hazelnut procurement and processing.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Dahod Agreement is, in its context, quite extraordinary in its commercial terms.  It was described by Mr Abidali as funding designed to replace Başkan Gida’s Turkish bank funding of its working capital, due to those banks’ unacceptably high interest rates.  Yet the return on capital contemplated by the Dahod Agreement represented a substantially heavier burden to Başkan Gida in terms of the cost of working capital than the interest rate then being charged by its Turkish banks.  On a contemplated 30,000 tonne turnover of business with Ferrero, the Dahod Agreement promised, at a rate of US$140 per tonne, a combined profit share for the Dahods and Indo-Med of US$4.2 million, i.e. a 42% return on the minimum US$10 million capital promised, and a still very large 28% return if the full US$15 million was required.  The manuscript Dahod Agreement itself contemplated that Mr Dahod and Indo-Med would share an annual profit in the region of US$5 million.  In cross-examination, Mr Abidali could offer no explanation why, otherwise than because of extreme financial embarrassment, Başkan Gida should have offered him and Mr Dahod such a large return, but he unconvincingly denied any awareness that Başkan Gida was in grave financial difficulty by that time.</p>

Mr Abidali explained that his understanding was that the finance sought from the Banks was to run in parallel with that provided with under the Dahod Agreement, and to be used for the non-Ferrero business of Başkan Gida, in due course replacing the HBZ discount facility.  Some corroboration of this perception is to be found in a letter from Mr Abidali to HBZ on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2001, which refers to the Başkans being “in the process of finalising a major Trade Finance Package in the City of London to become operative during August this year, in time for the new season of Hazelnut exports.  As such the use of this (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e. the </span>HBZ) facility is no longer appropriate.”  By that letter, Mr Abidali sought and obtained a continuation of the existing HBZ Facility only until the end of August 2001.</p>

When it is borne in mind that the profitable business with Ferrero was, from start to finish in its negotiations with the Banks, described by Başkan Gida as the jewel in its crown, the failure to mention, at any time after 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2001, that this business was already subject to a funded joint venture under which the US$140 per metric tonne profit margin had been passed on in full to Mr Dahod and Indo-Med, is inexplicable unless either, the Dahod Agreement is an invention, or the Başkans were determined, from June onwards, to deceive the Banks, or perhaps the Dahods, or both.</p>

As will appear, neither Başkan Gida nor Indo-Med performed their respective obligations under it.  On the contrary, Mr Dahod’s trust in each of them was thoroughly abused.</p>

Başkan Gida was described as having an enviable reputation for quality and reliability, as exporting 90% to 95% of its sales, and as avoiding speculation save for 10% of its turnover “where it takes positions in order to stay in the market and informed”.  Critically, Başkan Gida was described as having a turn-round period between purchase of raw hazelnuts and on-sale after processing of a mere five days.  Its longstanding relationship with Ferrero, and Ferrero’s commitment to purchase large quantities on a cost plus basis was prominently trumpeted, both in the FAQ and in the two page summary.  At that early stage, the proposed facility was presented as designed to finance Ferrero’s purchase of hazelnuts in the harvest season (August to November), and availability was sought from mid-August 2001 in a maximum revolving amount of US$50 million, with a 180 day facility period.  It was not at that stage presented as Ferrero specific, being designed to finance supplies to all Başkan Gida’s export customers.  The proposal was presented as being capable of being undertaken by a single bank, or by two or more banks acting together.  The principal security offered was to consist of a legal assignment of the receivables due from Başkan Gida’s customers, together with a legal assignment of title to the hazelnuts while in Başkan Gida’s warehouses.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Both BTM and KBC, at this stage entirely separately from each other, responded positively to these approaches.  Both set up two man teams to handle the negotiation and due diligence required, consisting of a relationship manager and a credit analyst.  For BTM the team consisted of Mr Byles and  Mr Philbin (in the latter case only until October 2001).  For KBC the team consisted of Mr van Broekhoven and Mr Lewis.  The conduct of the Banks in connection with the due diligence, the negotiation, the drafting and the operation of the Facility has been criticised as negligent by Ferrero in terms which occupy 40 pages of the re-re-re-amended defence, and 112 pages (excluding exhibits) of their banking expert’s first report.  The determination of the contributory negligence issues requires each Bank’s conduct to be separately viewed, in particular during the due diligence period before they began acting together.  A full description of each of the Banks’ conduct of the due diligence, negotiation, drafting and operation of the Facility would occupy a long judgment of its own.  Nonetheless, because there is little dispute of fact about any of these matters, and because to a significant extent the parties’ respective experts reached a large measure of agreement, it is unnecessary for me to set out the entire history of those matters in painstaking detail.  For present purposes, I shall confine myself to a summary of the Banks’ conduct of those matters, and descend to greater factual detail, to the extent necessary, only at the stage of analysis of the specific allegations of contributory negligence.</p>

For this purpose they sent detailed questions to Quantum, investigated the available credit information about Başkan Gida’s main customers, and prepared and sent to Quantum KBC’s own draft term sheet, to serve as the basis for further discussion.  They also obtained a bank reference on Başkan Gida from Yapi Kredi, one of Başkan Gida’s Turkish bankers, before reporting to the London based Business Committee of the GTFG, ahead of its meeting on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, at which approval in principle was given, together with authority for the conduct of a full due diligence exercise.</p>

At this stage, each of the Banks was pursuing its inquiries separately, although by then aware of the other Bank’s interest.  The teams from both Banks were also aware, prior to travelling to Turkey, that they could expect an opportunity to meet a representative from Ferrero.  In the event, Mr Casale was visiting Giresun on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, in connection with his review of the growing 2001 crop, and attended brief meetings with both Banks’ teams, members of the Başkan family and representatives of PRI, probably on the afternoon of the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>July.</p>

Apart from his evidence, I would have regarded the probabilities as being against him being given such short notice, but on this point I am inclined to believe him.  It follows that he did not go to the meeting armed either with detailed information with which to assist the Banks, or with an appreciation of the particular reliance which might be placed by the Banks on anything he said.</p>

Mr Philbin’s original manuscript notes made at the time are exactly contemporaneous, but scrappy and rather uninformative.  By contrast, Mr Lewis’s visit report was only made on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July, but was based on contemporaneous manuscript notes which he then threw away.  A separate section of Mr Lewis’s report is given over to his meeting with Mr Casale, and I accept his evidence in cross-examination that it is unlikely that he confused information coming from Ferrero with information coming from the Başkans.</p>

I am also inclined to believe Mr Casale’s denial that he confirmed that Başkan Gida “only” purchased hazelnuts on the back of Ferrero orders.  That was certainly the normative basis upon which Mr Casale dealt with Melih Başkan, but I accept that Mr Casale would have been unlikely to assure the Banks categorically about there being no departure from that basis by Başkan Gida, the timing of its purchases being a matter outwith Mr Casale’s knowledge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">As to this, Mr Casale said that he kept an insufficiently close watch on the precise time-lag between orders and deliveries to be able to have made such a statement.  He would have said that Ferrero had the capability to deliver quickly after orders were placed. As for the second part of the extracted quote, Mr Casale said that since contracts followed purchases by Başkan Gida recorded in the PCs, he thought it unlikely that he would have said precisely what Mr Philbin recorded.</p>

They are not of great consequence.  For reasons which will appear later, Mr Casale was throughout his evidence at pains to play down the extent to which he monitored the timing of Başkan Gida’s deliveries, and I have concluded that he was probably better informed in that regard than he has been prepared to admit.</p>

It is common ground (at least after cross-examination) that Mr Casale understood that, if they decided to lend to Başkan Gida, the Banks would be placing considerable reliance upon the strength of the Başkan Gida/Ferrero relationship.  Beyond that, I am not persuaded that the Banks were any more specific.  It is alleged that Mr Byles told Mr Casale at his meeting with him that he would be asking for the gist of what Mr Casale had said to be put in writing.  Mr Casale denied any recollection of being asked to do so at the meeting, but it is common ground that his 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July Letter was the result of a request, originating from BTM and passed on to him by Başkan Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was specifically put to Mr Casale, and denied by him, that the Banks told him that they intended to rely specifically upon what he said about the profit margin built in to the cost-plus basis upon which Ferrero and Başkan Gida normally traded.  Of course, by July 2001, this had for some time been honoured in the breach, rather in the observance, since all contracts after 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April had excluded any such profit margin, because of the special circumstances of the FKB arrangement.  Nonetheless no case has been pleaded that this was a relevant dishonest misrepresentation by Mr Casale made orally at his meetings with the Banks.  Nor was it in fact untrue, as a description of the normal basis on which Başkan Gida and Ferrero did business, and in my judgment Mr Casale had no reason to suppose that the normal basis would not be resumed at the beginning of the 2001 crop season, as indeed it was, at least initially.</p>

In addition, KBC’s team met the manager of the Giresun branch of Yapi Kredi (a Mr Kici) and, among other things, obtained confirmation that local bank interest rates for foreign currency lending to Turkish businesses had exceeded 20%.  No criticism is made of the manner in which either of the banking teams conducted their Turkish due diligence, so that it need not be set out in any greater detail.</p>

For present purposes, I shall deal only with two issues of fact, namely whether the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July Letter contained representations which were then (i.e. on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July) untrue and, if so, whether they were known by Mr Casale to be untrue when he made them.  It is important at the outset to bear in mind that in these three short paragraphs, Mr Casale was summarising his description of a trading relationship going back 10 years, and 8 years on a large scale.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Taking each alleged misrepresentation in turn, I have identified no basis upon which the first was untrue.  Reliance was placed in the RAPOC upon Ferrero having pre-paid Başkan Gida in relation to certain orders in 2000, but nothing was done at trial to show that pre-payments were or flowed out of difficulties in the trading relationship, whether by cross-examination or otherwise.  Reliance was placed upon the relatively few occasions upon which Başkan Gida’s deliveries took place outside the delivery period specified in Ferrero’s Purchase Orders, during the 2000 season.  When it is borne in mind that this was a difficult season, in which Başkan Gida substantially succeeded in supplying Ferrero’s requirements out of a small crop in a tight market, I consider that Mr Casale was entitled to say that Başkan Gida’s performance during that year had been satisfactory, and unaccompanied by significant difficulties.  I do not regard the making by Başkan Gida and rejection by Ferrero of Başkan Gida’s funding proposal in March 2001 as amounting to a significant difficulty in the trading relationship, still less the negotiation of the FKB contracts, by which Ferrero obtained substantial supplies, late in a difficult season, at what Mr Casale was entitled to regard as satisfactory prices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the second alleged misrepresentation (consistent shipments on a timely basis), again, and largely for the same reasons, I do not consider that this was otherwise than true, in relation to the only periods prior to the end of July 2001 or subjected at trial to any detailed scrutiny.  An attempt was made to rely upon the absence of any deliveries during one week in March 2001, but that occurred at the very height of the Turkish financial crisis, there appear to have been no orders in respect of which deliveries were outstanding beyond the periods specified in the purchase orders, and deliveries at a satisfactory rate resumed immediately thereafter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The greatest reliance was placed by the Banks on the third alleged misrepresentation (that Ferrero expected purchasing to continue at the rate of 30,000mt per annum).  Mr Wardell submitted that this cannot in fact have been Ferrero’s expectation by the end of July 2001, because of what he described as the abundant evidence of Başkan Gida’s growing financial difficulties.  To be precise, the pleaded allegation is that “Ferrero did not expect to continue purchasing up to 30,000mt of hazelnuts from Başkan Gida annually <span style="text-decoration:underline">without substantial new funds being made available</span>”: (my underlining).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, I find that Ferrero did expect orders and deliveries of hazelnuts by Başkan Gida to continue at an approximate rate of 30,000mt per annum.  That rate had by July 2001 been achieved, Ferrero’s requirements were on an upward trend and, although it had determined to resist Başkan Gida’s wish to become its sole supplier of Turkish hazelnuts, nothing in the evidence suggests that, by bringing on an alternative competing supplier (as Ferrero did with Oltan Gida in the 2001 crop year) Ferrero intended to cut Başkan Gida’s level of supplies down.  Furthermore, Mr Casale did by July 2001 expect, and with good reason, that the 2001 crop season would produce substantially greater volumes than had the 2000 season.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already rejected the Banks’ primary case in this respect, namely that Ferrero and Mr Casale in particular were by July 2001 aware that Başkan Gida’s financial difficulties had reached a level that made its continuation in business for another full year unlikely.  Nothing happened in or about the performance of the FKB contracts that did or should have suggested to Mr Casale that financial difficulties would shortly impede Başkan Gida’s ability to go on meeting Ferrero’s demands.  Furthermore, Mr Casale’s expectation that a 30,000mt per annum trend would continue was not expressed to have been based upon an assumption that substantial further funding would not be made available to Başkan Gida.  To Mr Casale’s knowledge, Başkan Gida was actively pursuing the obtaining of such further funding with the Banks, and, so far as I can ascertain, there was no basis upon which Mr Casale either did, still less should have, assumed that any funding necessary for Başkan Gida to maintain its level of supplies would not in fact be obtained.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that the pleaded premise for the untruthfulness of this alleged misrepresentation falls away.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the final alleged misrepresentation (as to the basis upon which contracts were entered into), Mr Strauss accepted that there was an implied representation that contracts with Başkan Gida were entered into on a proper commercial basis. Apart from that, the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July Letter was silent as to the terms upon which Ferrero contracted with Başkan Gida. It seems to me impossible to read by implication into the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July Letter what Mr Casale had told KBC at the meeting earlier that month about the cost plus basis upon which the parties contracted.  It was at the meeting with KBC that Mr Casale had given this description, whereas the July letter was sought from him by Başkan Gida in response to a request from BTM, and it was written to BTM. More generally, even if Mr Casale had given a similar explanation at his meeting with BTM, where an intending lender seeks written confirmation of information originally supplied informally by a principal customer of the borrower, and obtains in writing something less than it believed had been said orally, then the natural inference is that the customer intends to commit itself only to that which is confirmed in writing, and not to any additional oral material that is not confirmed.  Accordingly, although the FKB contracts constituted a significant recent departure from the basis of contracting described orally by Mr Casale at the July meetings, neither he nor Ferrero committed themselves to that description by way of trade reference, when asked to do so at the end of the month.</p>

As I have described, it had nothing at all to do with Başkan Gida’s business with Ferrero.  The use of any part of the Dahod Investment in connection with Başkan Gida’s non-Ferrero business was contrary to the Dahod Agreement, yet Mr Dahod was not told about the use actually made of the US$100,000 and, in an email which Mr Abidali sent to him on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, it was clearly implied that the whole of the US$3.15 million had been used in accordance with the Dahod Agreement.

Although responsible to the Dahod Investors for making sure that their money was properly deployed for the purposes of the joint venture (i.e. exclusively on new Ferrero business), Mr Dahod did nothing to ensure that the Dahod monies which he did transmit to Başkan Gida were either kept separate from Başkan Gida’s general funds, or used for new Ferrero business.

By 9 o’clock on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, in a further urgent email, Mr Abidali had told Mr Dahod that the funds had arrived, and that he was “in the process of dispersing them to Turkey” saying nothing about the retention of US$500,000 in London for purposes wholly unconnected with the Ferrero business, and beneficial to Indo-Med.  Adding insult to injury, he continued “thank you also for your trust in me”.  When faced with this further serious breach of the Dahod Agreement in cross-examination, and with an apparent blatant lie to Mr Dahod, he could only say that since the HBZ account was a Başkan Gida account, and Başkan Gida was in Turkey, he neither lied nor broke the Dahod Agreement.  In reality, the effect of those transactions was that, by the end of August, Mr Abidali had, to Melih Başkan’s knowledge, but unknown to Mr Dahod, extracted US$600,000 from payments made to him as a fiduciary, and used them for his own benefit, by reducing Başkan Gida’s then indebtedness to Indo-Med, incurred in non-Ferrero business.</p>

In fact, nothing of that kind occurred.  In cross-examination Mr Abidali said that he had relied on Başkan Gida to set up that payment arrangement with Ferrero and that, apart from one payment, it never happened, because Ferrero declined to pay to Indo-Med a debt due on a contract made with Başkan Gida.  There is some slight evidence of a request by Mr Abidali to Melih Başkan to put such an arrangement in place, but only in late September, and a request to that effect by Başkan Gida to Ferrero, but Mr Abidali acknowledged in cross-examination that the fact that this important part of the agreed payment structure was never put in place represented a miserable failure on his part.

At the end of September, Mr Abidali provided a first report by email of the tonnage shipped to Ferrero under the Dahod Agreement, in the aggregate sum of 4820mt, based upon a purely oral report to him by Melih Başkan.  In October, Başkan Gida started to prepare single page statements of tonnage supplied to Ferrero, broken down between the various Ferrero operating companies, which Mr Abidali passed on to Mr Dahod.  The reports are silent as to the prices paid by Ferrero, or as to the specific use made of the Dahod Investment, but of course the US$140mt profit share could be simply calculated.  By 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October Başkan Gida had, via Indo-Med, reported to the Dahod Investors that a total of 8,592mt of processed kernels had been delivered to Ferrero, from which Mr Dahod could calculate that a profit share was due to him and Indo-Med in the sum of US$1,202,880.  Not one cent of it had by then been paid, nor had the profit share by then been referred to in any surviving written communication between the parties, following the making of the Dahod Agreement in June.  Mr Abidali’s explanation for its non-payment by the end of October was that he assumed that it was being recirculated to finance ongoing Ferrero business and that, since Mr Dahod was not chasing for it, there was no need for him to do anything about it.</p>

From the end of the first week in August the two Banks began to work together as likely co-lenders.  KBC’s Credit Committee approved the transaction subject to conditions on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, and BTM’s Credit Committee approval was given two days later.  In both cases, approval was given subject to conditions and, inevitably, they were not identical.  Getting from two different Credit Committee approvals to a fully contracted and operational joint lending facility still involved a large amount of work, in terms of further due diligence, the negotiation of detailed terms satisfying the outstanding conditions, and the reduction of the transaction into a complex series of written agreements.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the risk of oversimplification, the essence of the structure contemplated by both Banks at the stage of Credit Committee approval was that loans made to Başkan Gida to finance the purchase of hazelnuts would be repaid by Başkan Gida’s European based purchasers (“offtakers”) by the assignment by Başkan Gida to the Banks of its contractual entitlement to payment by the offtakers.  The Banks analysed their risk exposure between loan and repayment as falling into two distinct periods.  The first lay between the making of each tranche of the loan and the delivery of the hazelnuts purchased therewith, after processing, to the offtakers.  The second lay between the delivery date and the receipt of payment by the Banks from the offtakers.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first period, the Banks’ principal exposure arose from the risk that Başkan Gida might fail to perform its contractual obligations to process and deliver hazelnuts to the offtakers, generally described as “performance risk”.  As to the latter, the Banks’ exposure lay in the risk that the Banks might not receive payment from the offtakers for hazelnuts delivered.  That risk turned mainly on the creditworthiness of the offtakers, but also involved transactional issues, such as the enforceability and terms of Başkan Gida’s contractual rights to payment, and their proper assignment.</p>

Against the performance risk, the Banks proposed to take security in the form of a pledge over the nuts purchased with the advances, pending processing and on-sale to the offtakers.  The Banks’ principal security for due payment by the offtakers after delivery lay in obtaining a watertight assignment of Başkan Gida’s contractual rights to payment.  At the time of Credit Committee approval, it was contemplated that the Facility would finance sales by Başkan Gida not merely to Ferrero, but to other substantial European companies.  In the event, for reasons which do not matter, the Facility was agreed in terms which in fact only financed Başkan Gida’s business with Ferrero.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The putting into place of the structure which I have briefly summarised involved engagement with Ferrero in four respects.  First, the Banks had to be (and in due course easily were) satisfied as to Ferrero’s creditworthiness.  Secondly the Banks needed to obtain Ferrero’s description of its trading relationship with Başkan Gida, and a satisfactory trade reference.  This had largely been dealt with by the end of July, as I have described, but the description of the detail of the trading relationship was at that stage only oral.  Thirdly, the Banks needed to satisfy themselves as to the structure and terms of trade between Başkan Gida and Ferrero, so as to give substance to the contractual rights to payment which were to be assigned.  This they sought to do by requesting Başkan Gida to invite Ferrero to sign a framework contract setting out those terms in writing.  Fourthly, the Banks needed to be satisfied that Başkan Gida’s assignment of its rights to payment for hazelnuts sold to Ferrero would lead, as a matter of contract and in practice, to Ferrero making payment to the Banks.  This necessitated pre-agreement with Ferrero that this would occur, and a documentary trail demonstrating both assignment of the relevant rights and notification of the assignment to Ferrero as debtor.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks’ case is that in each of the respects in which Ferrero’s engagement was sought in connection with the Facility, save only for the first, Ferrero acted dishonestly, in furtherance of Başkan Gida’s plan to defraud the Banks.  The essential backdrop to the appraisal of those allegations consists of two parts.  The first consists of Başkan Gida’s continuing day to day business relationship with Ferrero. The second consists of an attempt to trace, on very inadequate evidence, the development of the Başkans’ attitude towards the preservation of the family’s hazelnut business, from one which began with a search for finance to save Başkan Gida, and ended with a fraud on the Banks designed to enable the business to be extracted from Başkan Gida, and carried on through a phoenix company.  Since the first of those two parts of the backdrop is relatively fully documented, and the underlying statistics agreed, I shall take it first, by describing the negotiation and sale of new crop hazelnuts by Başkan Gida to Ferrero from August until 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2001, the date when the Banks allege that, by signing the Framework Contract, Ferrero committed its next significant part in the alleged fraud.</p>

In fact, although its purchases as a percentage of the market fell slightly, due to the increased size of the crop, the volume of its purchases actually increased, from about 94,000mt to 125,000mt of in-shell nuts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The price consequences arising from these features, coupled with the market’s initial misunderstanding of some of them, may be summarised as follows.  I do so by reference to the Turkish lira price for 100 kilos of 11-13mm kernels, produced to TS3075, available for purchase by exporters such as Başkan Gida in Turkey.  Prices started at 2.7 million, falling slightly to 2.65 million for most of September and passing the 3 million mark on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October.  They then rose during the rest of October to 3.6 million, encouraged by a published FKB bid price, and then remained within a range of 3.3 to 3.6 million right through until early February, following which they traded within a tight range of 3.2 to 3.3 million until early April, followed by a very slight reduction through to mid-May, falling back to 3 million on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May.  Thereafter, the growing appreciation of an over-supplied market led to a sustained reduction to a range of 2.5 to 2.7 million through to July, followed by a very slight peak during the last two weeks of the season.  Prices for 13-15 mm nuts followed a similar pattern, at slightly higher levels.  Exchange rate fluctuations meant that US dollar and Euro prices for exported hazelnuts followed a significantly different pattern.  It was also a period during which a temporary lag in the rate of Turkish consumer price inflation against the depreciation of the lira, caused by the sharp devaluation in February 2001, was eventually cancelled out and indeed slightly reversed by April 2002, due to the combination of further price inflation and a correction in the lira/US dollar exchange rate between October 2001 and February 2002.</p>

The allegation is that Ferrero sought dishonestly to assist Başkan Gida in its fraud on the Banks by placing orders for unwanted nuts which Başkan Gida then used to justify draw-down requests under the Facility.  Ferrero’s case by contrast is that the orders placed on Başkan Gida during the 2001 season were the product of a pre-determined policy based entirely on its own commercial interests, adjusted from time to time during the season as changing market circumstances and other unforeseen events required.  </p>

It was confirmed in detail by the evidence of Mr Do, who took over as chairman of Ferrero Industrial and head of Ferrero’s Operations Unit in June 2001.  Its main elements may be summarised as follows.  First, anticipating a plentiful crop and therefore reasonable prices, they planned to build up Ferrero’s stocks of stored hazelnuts well beyond the budgeted production requirements of the operating companies.  Secondly, they sought to achieve such an increase in stock levels in excess of production requirements by maintaining deliveries from Başkan Gida at broadly current levels, and by increasing deliveries from competing Turkish suppliers, in particular Oltan Gida.  Thirdly, they intended, so far as market conditions and prices permitted it, to continue with their established policy of purchasing early rather than late in the season, for reasons for which I have already set out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The commercial rationale for that policy, and in particular for the increase of stocks in excess of production requirements, was explained by Mr Do, Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale as follows.  First, they anticipated that, by contrast with the two previous years, the 2001 crop would be plentiful, with correspondingly reasonable prices.  Secondly, they had in mind that at times during the previous year, tightness of supply had led to stocks being reduced below satisfactory levels, albeit that no interruption in confectionary production had actually occurred.  Thirdly, they anticipated that Ferrero’s general track record as an expanding business might well lead to hazelnut requirements in excess of the budgeted production figures.  Fourthly, Ferrero had both the cash flow with which to finance the holding of increased stocks and recourse to good quality warehouse facilities in Europe for storage, as well as its developing programme for freezing hazelnuts for long term storage.  Fifthly, they (and Mr Casale in particular) doubted the capacity of the hazelnut trees in Turkey to produce two bumper crops in succession, and thereby anticipated that the 2002 crop would probably be less plentiful than their expectations for the 2001 crop.  Finally, they (and Mr Do in particular) wanted to ensure, by diversifying their sources of supply, that Ferrero would not become excessively beholden to a single Turkish supplier.  </p>

Emphasis was placed in particular upon the absence of any description of such a policy in any surviving document, and I was asked to infer that the absence from disclosure of any significant quantity of documentary records of management’s deliberations and decisions about hazelnut purchasing policy was probably the result of a deliberate suppression or destruction of documents by Ferrero in connection with this litigation.  That inference was, of course, squarely put to Ferrero’s witnesses, and equally vigorously denied, reliance being placed upon a management style of doing things orally at meetings without taking extensive attendance notes or minutes, arising from the originally family based nature of the Ferrero business.</p>

On the face of it, both the policy itself and the reasons given for it by the Ferrero witnesses were perfectly rational, when assessed against market circumstances and perceptions which are not in dispute, and against the essential vulnerability of Ferrero as, increasingly, the world’s largest scale involuntary buyer in a volatile market.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Quite separately, the likelihood that Ferrero had the policy which their witnesses described is reinforced by the undoubted fact that the acquisition of increased stocks in excess of production requirements and a diversification of their sources of supply was just what Ferrero did during the season which followed.  As will appear, even when Başkan Gida went out of business in February 2002, and thereby offered Ferrero a golden opportunity to resile from any unperformed orders (on the Banks’ case) in excess of its real requirements, Ferrero confirmed all those orders with Aksu Gida, and later with Başkan Yuksel, and took delivery of the majority of them, such shortfalls in delivery against orders by the end of the season being reasonably attributable to other factors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against those considerations, all of which militate in favour of the acceptance of Ferrero’s evidence on this issue, the paucity of documents recording management decision-making about purchasing policy does appear strange to an English trained eye.  Ferrero was, by 2001, a large, increasingly centralised, sophisticated and multi-national business, whatever its family roots.  Nonetheless I consider it would be wrong to place too much reliance upon expectations of the degree of retained documentation generated by a comparable English business, in deciding whether a surprising absence of documents is sufficient, virtually on its own, to undermine otherwise consistent and credible testimony.  In this instance, I am not persuaded on that account to disbelieve the Ferrero witnesses’ description of the purchasing policy which they adopted for the 2001 crop.</p>

There is no contemporaneous document recording this renegotiation, and Mr Casale could not clearly remember having done so, although he regarded it as probable.  He drew attention in his witness statement to a surviving study made within Ferrero in June 2001 which suggested that Başkan Gida had been charging slightly higher mark-ups than Oltan Gida for equivalent products.  A comparison between PCs for purchases of the 2000 and 2001 crops shows that such reductions must have been negotiated at about this time.  Their precise amounts do not matter.  Since mark-ups for processing and export costs were always identified in US dollars in Başkan Gida’s PCs, and Turkish lira price inflation was still well behind its exchange depreciation with the US dollar, it is not surprising to find that Ferrero felt entitled to ask for, and Başkan Gida felt compelled to concede, reductions in its costs mark-ups.  Mr Casale’s evidence (which I accept) was that Oltan Gida conceded similar reductions in its mark-ups at the same time, and that other suppliers may also have done so.</p>

Ferrero Germany ordered rocher from Oltan Gida and Başkan Gida, but was less exacting in its requirements than Ferrero Italy. In fact, by the end of August, Ferrero Italy’s orders for rocher from Başkan Gida were ahead of orders from Oltan Gida (2,520mt against 1,704mt) and this disparity continued thereafter, so that by the beginning of October, the aggregate rocher orders from Oltan Gida by Ferrero Italy were 6,000mt and 4,368mt respectively.  During the same period, the overall hazelnut orders placed by Ferrero on Başkan Gida almost caught up those placed on Oltan Gida.  By 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, the aggregate orders placed by Ferrero on Başkan Gida were 16,008mt, several thousand mt ahead of the equivalent level by the same time in the previous year.</p>

I shall in due course come to deal with the question whether any such representation is to be found in the Framework Contract, but I must first deal with Mr Casale’s trenchant denial that, as at 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, he was aware of, or suspected, any such thing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> Mr Casale’s first point (in the order of logical analysis) was that the periods specified in Ferrero’s Purchase Orders were not negotiated as contractual terms with which Ferrero expected strict compliance, but rather were inserted, almost on a conventional basis, by reference to the next month end, or, in relation to orders placed late in the month, the end of the following month.  It will be apparent from my analysis of the way in which Ferrero and Başkan Gida traded before the 2001 season that there is much force in this point.  The expression of delivery dates in Ferrero’s purchase orders and Başkan Gida’s contracts were hardly ever <span style="font-style:italic">ad idem</span>, and yet the constant disparity appeared to have caused no difficulties between the parties before the beginning of the relevant period.  This is borne out by reference to the agreed analysis of deliveries against delivery periods for the 2000 crop, in relation to which the volume of late deliveries against orders placed up to and including 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October amounted in aggregate to more than 2,000mt.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Casale’s second point, fully corroborated by Mr Bolowich, was that, since Ferrero Industrial’s policy was to build stocks for relatively long term storage rather than to provide raw materials for production on a ‘just in time’ basis, the precise dates of delivery by Başkan Gida, or by any other supplier, were not of great concern to him, as long as the operating companies’ stocks continued to increase, as he satisfied himself that they did.  He said that, following the placing of orders, he paid little detailed attention to the flow of deliveries, leaving the fine-tuning of deliveries, together with the making of the necessary transport arrangements, and notification of expected arrival to the operating companies, to his subordinates.  Since Ferrero had by then ceased making pre-payments, and only paid upon delivery, and since cash flow management was not Mr Casale’s responsibility or, apparently, a significant concern generally in relation to hazelnut procurement, this evidence is not inherently incredible, and Mr Bolowich’s corroboration of the general thrust of it adds considerable weight.  I have little doubt that the information systems within Ferrero Industrial were sufficient to enable Mr Casale to inform himself with little trouble about Başkan Gida and his other suppliers’ respective performances against specified delivery periods.  In fact, there is evidence that Oltan Gida took the trouble to trumpet its own performance in regular statements to Ferrero, although there is no evidence that Başkan Gida, or any other supplier, did the same.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, Mr Casale did nonetheless rather over-egg the pudding in this respect.  It seems to me, as a matter of common-sense, that in deciding from time to time with which of various competing suppliers to place Ferrero’s next series of orders Mr Casale must, as an evidently thorough and competent businessman, have taken some account of the amounts ordered but yet to be delivered from each of them.  While other considerations, such as price and quality in particular may well have played a predominant role in his choice, it seems to me unreal to suppose that he remained in blissful ignorance of the rate at which existing orders were being fulfilled by Başkan Gida.</p>

Mrs Pay was a generally reliable witness, but her evidence is not specific as to date. It may have related to the period after 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, and it was in any event undermined by her evidence about there being many days in October and November when no deliveries, or only one delivery were made, when the surviving records suggest otherwise.</p>

As will appear below, when I review the question when the Başkans did decide to embark upon a fraud on the Banks, it is probable that they were on the point of doing so by 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October.  Nonetheless there is no evidence that they had at this early stage resolved to take anyone at Ferrero into their confidence in this respect.  On the footing that sophisticated fraudsters generally communicate their dishonest plans only to those who need to know, I consider that the probabilities are very strongly against the Başkans having given any advance intimation of their intended fraud to Ferrero at this stage, and I conclude that they did not.</p>

By the time of closing speeches, the Banks had abandoned the allegation that Ferrero knew in 2001 that Başkan Gida was defrauding its Turkish bankers.

In cross-examination, with some support from surviving documents, it was put to him that he had been involved in the process of the production of a framework contract much earlier.  It was certainly an early requirement of the Banks, having been identified as a likely requirement at the outset of the negotiations.  Furthermore, an email from Mr Stambler of PRI to Mr Byles on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August described an early draft of it as having already been reviewed by Mr Casale.  In a letter to Melih Başkan on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September, Mr Politis reminded him that the draft agreement had been sent for the Başkans' review on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.  </p>

The first, in the last sentence of clause 2, was the statement that Ferrero expected to continue to purchase hazelnuts from Başkan Gida at an annual rate in excess of 30,000mt.  Reliance was placed upon the fact that, at that stage, orders to and deliveries from Oltan Gida had outstripped those to and from Başkan Gida, and that Başkan Gida had not kept up with the delivery periods specified in Ferrero’s purchase orders.  It was therefore suggested in cross-examination that, both by reason of what it observed of Başkan Gida’s performance, and also by reason of its own substantially increased level of orders to Oltan Gida, Ferrero no longer genuinely expected to do 30,000mt of business with Başkan Gida during the 2001 season.</p>

Furthermore, I accept Mr Casale’s evidence that the reduction in frequency of orders was attributable to the availability of a larger crop, and the ability therefore to increase order size and place them less frequently.  More generally, for the reasons given in detail in my description of the ordering and delivery of 2001 crop hazelnuts up until 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, I have not been persuaded that anything had occurred sufficient to displace either Ferrero’s policy of broadly maintaining the level of its orders from Başkan Gida, or its expectation that the same level of deliveries would in fact eventually be made.</p>

I think it highly unlikely that the Başkans would have told him the truth, which was indeed that financial constraints were hampering the rate at which they could fulfil Ferrero’s orders, by preventing them from ordering supplies described as purchased in the DPRs.</p>

Mr Casale attempted unconvincingly to deny studying clause 9 when it reappeared alongside clause 8, although since he had originally objected to the earlier choice of English law I infer that he must have studied the new clause 8 carefully. He was driven (by an agenda to deny any understanding of the English word ‘assignment’ in later documents) to say he had not given any consideration to the meaning of clause 9, and that he signed the Framework Contract (in fact on every page) without understanding that part of it. In my judgment, having received a non-technical Italian translation of the word assignment on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, he knew perfectly well that it meant transfer or cede to another, and approved the Framework Contract on that basis.</p>

I have already concluded that Başkan Gida was balance sheet insolvent by the end of June.  The fact that it could only pay its outstanding debt to HBZ (guaranteed by Indo-Med) at the end of August by misapplying part of the Dahod Investment suggests that it was commercially insolvent by then, but that is not of itself a sufficient reason for concluding that the Başkans did not regard the negotiation of a large facility from the Banks as offering a long term solution to their company’s difficulties.  </p>

Nonetheless an important part of the Banks’ original case against both Indo-Med and Ferrero was that they each knew, by November and December 2001 respectively, that the Başkans were defrauding their Turkish bankers. In closing the Banks abandoned the allegation that Ferrero knew this, but persisted in it as against Mr Abidali.

The gist of the charge against the defendants in the Turkish criminal court was that they had raised money from Başkan Gida’s Turkish bankers by dishonestly pretending that hazelnuts had been exported, by the use of misleading customs and other documents, including invoices, against which the Turkish banks lent.  The conclusion of the expert committee and of the court was that the relevant loans had constituted pre-export finance, that is loans made against draft customs and other documents and pro-forma invoices, and that the customs and freighting documents presented to the Turkish banks demonstrated on their face that the relevant hazelnuts had yet to be exported, so that the Turkish banks could not have been misled in the manner alleged. </p>

The alleged fraud was simply pretending that the nuts had actually been exported when they had not.  Accordingly that question does not appear to have been subjected to any detailed forensic analysis in the Turkish criminal court, and I infer that both the expert committee and the court acquitted the defendants on the assumption, not significantly challenged, that such orders or contracts existed.

Prior to the end of October 2001, there is only one clear example of dishonesty in the Başkans’ dealing with the Banks.  From the outset,  Başkan Gida’s presentation through PRI of a lending opportunity to the Banks had centred upon its apparently profitable business with Ferrero as the jewel in its crown, even though at that stage it was contemplated that any facility would also finance business with other European customers.  At no time during those negotiations did Başkan Gida reveal the existence or performance of the Dahod Agreement, which not only constituted, as between the parties, a self-sufficient basis for financing Başkan Gida’s business with Ferrero, but also transferred to Indo-Med and the Dahod Investors the whole of Başkan Gida’s US$140 per mt agreed profit margin on that business, under an agreement with the Dahod Investors designed to persist throughout the 2001 season.  The Banks were allowed to assume that Başkan Gida’s business with Ferrero was then financed by Başkan Gida’s Turkish bankers, and that the Turkish borrowings attributable to that business would, if the Facility went ahead, be paid down out of the first advances made by the Banks.</p>

The very high profit margin agreed lends force to that view.  If so, there is no evidence that they mentioned this either to Mr Abidali or to the Dahod Investors.  It is nonetheless difficult in those circumstances to treat the concealment of the Dahod Agreement and Investment from the Banks as compelling evidence of an already formed intention by the Başkans to defraud the Banks. </p>

Until then, the presentation by Başkan Gida of its business relationship with Ferrero suggested that, on average, Başkan Gida received payment from Ferrero in respect of any particular delivery of hazelnuts, about 2 to 3 weeks after buying the necessary nuts from its suppliers.  Thus for example, a document headed “Başkan Payment Cycle” sent to the Banks in June 2001 identified the period needed for purchasing and processing as 14 to 21 days (for large orders sent by ship) and 7 to 14 days (for smaller orders sent by truck), the period for payment as being in each case 2 days after shipment, with consequential periods of Turkish exposure for the Banks as 16 to 23 days for large orders and 10 to 16 days for small orders.</p>

Başkan Gida wished to obtain a longer period of use of the Banks’ advances than would be justified by reference to its business with Ferrero which was in the process of becoming the only part of its business to be financed by the Facility.  Accordingly, Başkan Gida presented a wholly untrue and misleading description of the financing period necessary in relation to nuts to be supplied to Ferrero.  </p>

While no documents or other evidence enable it to be said with certainty that Başkan Gida planned prior to January 2002 to misuse the advances by the purchase of hazelnuts and the disposal of them to a phoenix company within the extended finance period, it is again probable that from the moment when the 45 Day Lie was prepared, the Başkans had such a scheme in mind.</p>

Mr Abidali’s case is that Melih Başkan came to London with Mr Franko to take part in a trade fair, and that he took the opportunity of their visit to arrange for a first meeting between Mr Dahod and Melih Başkan, so that Mr Dahod could, as it were, clap eyes on an important member of the Başkan family responsible for managing his investment, receive a presentation about the business in which he had invested, and ask any relevant questions about it.  Mr Abidali denies knowing anything specific about the then state of Başkan Gida’s negotiations with the Banks, any involvement in the 45 Day Lie, and any knowledge of or participation in the putting together of the phoenix scheme until January 2002, when he says that it was put to him for the first time during a visit by him to Giresun for an unconnected purpose to do with litigation in the USA.

On their evidence, they regarded the investment as prospering, by reference to the tonnage which Melih Başkan had told them had by then been shipped to Ferrero, and were not unduly concerned that their profit share had been re-circulated in the financing of that business.  Their case was that on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November they did ask Melih Başkan to provide better reports and accounting than he had to date about the progress of the joint venture, and asked Melih Başkan to prepare an agreement recording the monies by then invested.  Much later, Mr Abidali used this evidence as an excuse for backdating important parts of the contractual structure leading to the asset transfer to Aksu Gida, to make it appear that a Protocol Agreement for the repayment of the Dahod Investment, together with associated promissory notes, had been put in place in November 2001 in response to that request.</p>

I have explained the basis of the allegation that Mr Abidali knew of it. The allegation that he participated in it arises from the fact that he did not protest Emlak Bankasi’s demand on HBZ until 2002.  Mr Abidali’s evidence was that early demands for payment were commonplace, and they were routinely put on one side with no thought being given to them.</p>

Conversely, I do not accept Mr Abidali’s account, weakly supported by Mr Dahod, that they asked Melih Başkan for a written agreement containing a repayment programme on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the Banks’ conspiracy allegation, I consider that the probability that the Başkans had certain brief communications with PRI relating to what became the 45 Day Lie, on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November, while Melih Başkan was in London, is too slender a foundation for implicating Mr Abidali at that early stage in the Başkans’ by then dishonest plans against the Banks. It is not clear that he was personally involved in those communications.  Mr Wardell sought to reinforce the Banks’ case on this point by cross-examining Mr Abidali along the lines that he must by then have appreciated how severely Başkan Gida’s performance had fallen off due to its financial predicament.  When it is borne in mind that the final instalment of the Dahod Investment had only just been made, in the form of a further US$3 million, it seems to me unreal to suppose that Mr Abidali went from optimism about the investment to a state of such pessimism that he was ready to participate in a fraud in order to obtain repayment for Mr Dahod, in the space of one week.  In that context I have not on balance been persuaded that by the beginning of November 2001 Mr Abidali knew that the Başkans were defrauding their Turkish bankers, still less that he agreed to assist them by remaining quiet about Emlak Bankasi’s demands.  I think it probable both that the Emlak Bankasi demands had been reported to him, and that he suspected that something was amiss, but not that a fraud was in progress.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">More importantly, I consider that the probabilities weigh strongly against the Başkans having involved Mr Abidali in their plans at that early stage.  To take him into their confidence would have involved revealing in full Başkan Gida’s hopeless financial predicament, but at a time when they could by no means be sure that the Banks’ Facility would definitely be put in place.  In other words, they needed to maintain the confidence of the Dahod Investors, and of Mr Abidali as their adviser and representative, for as long as the obtaining of the Banks’ finance remained uncertain.  </p>

Both of these were provided by Ferrero Industrial in early December.

This assertion is contradicted by the detailed agreed delivery schedules. Ferrero did not call either of its local representatives, Messrs Altare and Scavino, to give evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The pattern of orders changed more fundamentally than the pattern of deliveries during that period, and calls for correspondingly closer examination.  The pause in Ferrero orders between 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December coincided with a rise in prices, during October, from TL2.6 million (100kg 11-13mm TS3075 kernels) at the end September to TL3.6 million by the end of October,  exacerbated by FKB’s intervention. Ferrero’s case (supported by Mr Casale’s evidence) was that, faced with an (unexpected) tightening of the market, Ferrero simply backed off, at least so far as Başkan Gida was concerned.  That was a sufficient reason for the flow of DPRs and PCs to cease for the time being since, as I have described, they were generated by Ferrero indicating an interest to Başkan Gida in making purchases, invariably by Mr Casale so informing Melih Başkan over the telephone.</p>

They categorise this period as one during which Ferrero’s relationship with Başkan Gida broke down. This is therefore an important issue calling for a close look at the orders which Ferrero did place with other suppliers during that period.</p>

The second was not an order for original nuts, but a reselection order, whereby Ferrero Italy arranged for Barbero to reselect among nuts already obtained from Turkey, so as to yield a consignment suitable for freezing.  That leaves one order by Ferrero France for 600mt on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, and two orders for an aggregate of 408mt by Ferrero Germany, all from Oltan Gida.

Nonetheless, even taking those orders into account, its level of buying was very much less in November than in either October or December 2001.  Ferrero Italy, the operating company with which Mr Casale was most closely associated, made no fresh purchases at all.  The evidence thus largely but not entirely bears out Mr Casale’s explanation for the dearth of orders from Başkan Gida during that period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question nonetheless remains why Ferrero France and Germany made the modest orders which they did in November from Oltan Gida rather than Başkan Gida.  Mr Casale suggested that, by contrast with Ferrero Italy, Ferrero Germany’s principal supplier for rocher nuts at that time was Oltan Gida rather than Başkan Gida.  In my judgment the precise reason must remain, after this lapse of time, a matter for speculation.  Nonetheless I am satisfied that the cessation of orders from Başkan Gida from mid-October through November 2001 was not the result of a loss of confidence by Ferrero in its ability to supply, mainly because of the substantial orders which Ferrero placed in early December, to which I will return in detail in due course. </p>

The gist of the letter (“the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November Letter”) was to suggest that the increased prices which by then had persisted for nearly a month were the result of market misinformation supported by FKB about the size of the crop, to the effect that it was smaller than Başkan Gida believed it to be, coupled with widespread retention of hazelnuts from the market at all levels, from growers to exporters.  As he put it: “everybody from manav to exporters are long up to head”.  Melih Başkan expressed his opinion that there was probably still about 400,000mt of nuts in shell yet to reach the market from a crop which he estimated at about 750,000 to 800,000mt, basing himself on estimates of the amounts still in the hands of growers, crackers, traders manavs and exporters.

As will appear, such large long-dated orders were in due course placed by Ferrero, in December 2001 and February 2002.  Apart from some orders which merely re-graded existing orders, and therefore involved no fresh supplies, the large long-dated orders constituted the entirety of the further business placed by Ferrero with Başkan Gida in the 2001 season, before Başkan Gida went out of business in early 2002.</p>

He did not regard the market views set out in the letter as surprising coming from Melih Başkan, but he thought that it was highly unlikely that Başkan Gida would be able to provide Ferrero with up to 18,000mt kernels by February, on top of those already ordered and awaiting delivery.  Nor did he have any intention of placing aggregate orders with Başkan Gida during the 2001 season significantly in excess of 30,000mt.  He acknowledged that it was unusual for Melih Başkan to send out detailed views about the market in writing, no other similar example being found in the documents disclosed.

They agreed that, in their experience, Başkan Gida had a tendency to adopt generally optimistic predictions of market size year on year, and that Başkan Gida was an inveterate taker of short positions in the market, expecting prices to fall towards the end of the season.  Furthermore, the experts both agreed that there had been a tendency in the market to underestimate the size of the 2001 crop, and that this had led to the mid-season rise in prices, followed by the late season fall, as the true size of the crop later became apparent.  They doubted however whether Melih Başkan was correct in thinking that large scale retention of nuts or long positions by market participants were responsible for the hardening of prices which took place in and after October.  While they agreed with Mr Rosa Brunet’s view about the premature nature of Melih Başkan’s attempt to predict the 2002 crop, they did not altogether rule out analysis of male buds (rather than flowers) on the hazelnut trees as providing at least some slight indication, albeit that the presence or absence of frosts in the first four months of the following year would be far more significant a factor in governing the 2002 crop size.</p>

I consider that the letter was simply a sales pitch by Melih Başkan, designed to encourage Ferrero to place early orders for supplies to be delivered in and after February 2002, so that he could both use those orders as the basis for drawing down large sums under the still to be finalised Facility, long before having to use the funds thereby made available for the purpose of supplying Ferrero with processed hazelnuts, and at the same time achieve a near monopoly supplier status with Ferrero for the rest of the season, something which he had been seeking to achieve throughout 2001, but with no success.  More than a month had passed since Ferrero had placed any fresh orders with Başkan Gida, and Melih Başkan needed to find some way of persuading Ferrero to re-enter the market as a large scale buyer, on terms which did not require Başkan Gida to risk pushing up prices further by making immediate large scale purchases in order to fulfil Ferrero’s requirements.  The market analysis provided by Melih Başkan in the letter offered a reasonable commercial basis for encouraging Ferrero down that route.  While I have no doubt that Melih Başkan cannot have thought that Başkan Gida’s existing financial resources would have enabled it to supply tonnage to Ferrero at anything like the levels contemplated in the letter, he no doubt expected that, before February 2002, substantial finance from the Banks would have become available, and (although Mr Casale could not recall one way or the other) he may have shared that expectation in discussion with Mr Casale.</p>

Melih Başkan’s mistake was however as to the time at which prices would fall.  In the event, it occurred not in February 2002 but in May.  </p>

They came about because of unexpected difficulties which Başkan Gida, in common with other exporters including Oltan Gida, had encountered in relation to the quality of 2001 crop hazelnuts and rocher grade in particular.  Whereas Oltan Gida had gone ahead and delivered rocher orders mainly on time, but sometimes of sub-standard quality, Başkan Gida had, so Mr Casale was informed, rejected rocher supplies and in consequence fallen significantly into arrears with deliveries, rather than deliver sub-standard nuts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ferrero Italy was concerned to obtain delivery before Christmas of sufficient rocher standard nuts to meet its freezing programme.  One of the Golden Rules laid down by Soremartec was that all rocher nuts for freezing had to be delivered to Italy by Christmas.  One of Ferrero Italy’s Italian suppliers, Barbero, had laser processing equipment which enabled it to re-select rocher standard nuts from a paste standard delivery, better than could be expected from Başkan Gida’s mainly manual processing facilities.  Accordingly Mr Casale invited Melih Başkan to agree a re-grading of the three outstanding September rocher contracts from rocher to Ferrero Italy’s paste specification, with a view to their being re-processed in Italy so as to release sufficient rocher standard nuts to complete the freezing programme on time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the Banks’ allegations, Mr Casale said that it was perfectly normal on a re-grade of an earlier contract to use historic prices with appropriate adjustments, rather the current market prices, reflecting the fact that there existed an outstanding un-performed order which, had it wished to, Ferrero could have required Başkan Gida to perform, or pay compensation in lieu to the extent that the market had since risen.  As to the renumbering, Mr Casale said that he was entirely unaware of any improper purpose of Başkan Gida in that respect, nor indeed aware that these were contracts which Başkan Gida might wish to present to the Banks as new contracts, in connection with its obtaining of funding.  As to the alternative of ordering from Oltan Gida, Mr Casale said that, whereas Oltan Gida had by then become a significant supplier of rocher nuts to Ferrero Germany (with a different and lower specification) Ferrero Italy still looked to Başkan Gida for the bulk of its rocher supplies, and saw no reason to switch suppliers in relation to these partly fulfilled orders to a supplier with similar quality problems of its own.  Mr Casale’s reference to Oltan Gida’s problems with quality is corroborated by a letter from Oltan Gida to Ferrero in December 2001, abjectly apologising for a number of sub-standard deliveries to Ferrero Italy, and promising only that new processing equipment would solve the problem in the 2002 crop season. Generally, for reasons which will be apparent from my summary of Ferrero’s case, Mr Casale denied that the Re-grade Contracts were either surplus to Ferrero Italy’s requirements, un-commercial or, still less, a sham.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusions in relation to the Re-grade Contracts are as follows.  There is some evidence that Ferrero Italy used Barbero for reselection of rocher nuts for freezing from a paste delivery, but I consider it probable that, again, Mr Casale over-egged the pudding in his rationalisation of the underlying commercial purpose of the re-grading.  It appears that only a modest proportion of the tonnage reordered as paste was delivered in time for the requirements of the freezing programme, and it is not clear that any of it was re-graded to extract rocher.  Nonetheless the freezing programme appeared to have been fully supported by rocher deliveries, whether from Başkan Gida or other suppliers, without recourse to the deliveries made under the Re-graded Contracts.  This part of Mr Casale’s explanation only emerged for the first time in cross-examination, but I have concluded that in this respect, his memory played him false, and not that the explanation was a concoction which he knew to be false.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless, I consider that, more generally, Ferrero’s case that the Re-grade Contracts were normal commercial transactions rather than a dishonest sham is to be preferred as being much the more probable.  In the absence of evidence that Mr Casale or anyone else at Ferrero was privy to the detailed terms upon which Başkan Gida was negotiating its proposed Facility with the Banks, I consider it fanciful to propose that by agreeing to the Re-grade Contracts, and to the use of newly numbered Başkan Gida contract forms, Ferrero was knowingly assisting Başkan Gida in the furtherance of any improper purpose.  Above all, I consider the central attack on the Re-grade Contracts, as being at off-market prices, to be misconceived.  Başkan Gida had promised to supply rocher nuts at the prices prevailing in September and had failed to do so within the delivery periods specified in Ferrero’s purchase orders.  In those circumstances, it seems to me nothing more than common-sense for a permitted down-grade in the specification required of Başkan Gida’s delivery to lead to price adjustments based upon the originally negotiated September prices, rather than an agreement by Ferrero Italy to pay substantially increased prices (reflecting the harder market in late November) in relation to a variation of an outstanding order brought about by Başkan Gida’s default.</p>

The Banks wished to understand more fully, and to have Ferrero’s confirmation of, the relationship between Ferrero Industrial and the Ferrero operating companies.  Inquiries by the Banks directly of Mr Casale at the beginning of November had produced an insubstantial response, and polite chasing from Melih Başkan in mid-October did no better.  On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November Ismet Başkan sent Mr Casale a draft letter to be written on a Ferrero letterhead addressed to Mr Byles and Mr Lewis, which had been prepared by PRI in accordance with their understanding of the relationship.  That must have been unsatisfactory to Mr Casale, because later on the same day, after discussion between Mr Casale and Mr Politis of PRI, Mr Stambler sent him a shorter draft, which Mr Casale copied onto a Ferrero Industrial letterhead and signed, telling the Banks that Ferrero Industrial managed the relationship with suppliers including Başkan Gida, that Ferrero SpA owned Ferrero Industrial, and that purchases of goods were made in the names of the operating companies that received the merchandise.  The episode demonstrated the care with which Mr Casale ensured that he committed Ferrero only to statements to the Banks with which, after reviewing drafts, he was content.</p>

The Banks were therefore concerned to put in place documentation demonstrating that the necessary assignments would be notified to Ferrero and to obtain Ferrero’s undertaking to pay the Banks.  For that purpose, the Banks caused to be prepared draft notices to, and acknowledgments by, Ferrero of the requisite assignments, and invited the Başkans to obtain Ferrero’s approval or comment on the drafts, before finalisation of the Facility.  </p>

He clearly had a short telephone conversation with Ismet Başkan about it, because in mid-afternoon on the same day Ismet Başkan emailed him again, with a slightly amended version of the draft Acknowledgment and, for the first time, a copy of the draft Notice.

His evidence about it was unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  First, he denied appreciating that completion of the facility was imminent, even though that was clearly spelt out to him in Ismet Başkan’s first email sent on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  His explanation was that he largely ignored the email and concentrated on its enclosure (Version 1 of the Acknowledgement), because Melih Başkan had told him on the telephone in advance to expect it.  I have no doubt that Ismet’s sense of urgency was expressed in any telephone conversation as clearly as it was in the emails.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, having thus been forced to concede that he read Version 1 carefully, when taken paragraph by paragraph through it by Mr Wardell, he then denied appreciating the plain meaning of substantial parts of it, on the alternative grounds that he did not understand the meaning of the language, or that he did not read it with sufficient care.  In particular, he persisted in denying that he understood the meaning of the word ‘assignment’ where it appeared in numerous places in all the Ferrero Industrial versions of the Acknowledgement.  He also denied that he appreciated that the numerous references to the General Terms and Conditions for Sale of Hazelnuts, and to the Framework Agreement, were intended to be references to the Framework Contract.</p>

Fourthly, he said that he did not pay much attention to the draft Acknowledgment, regarding it just as a request to Ferrero to agree to pay invoices to any account subsequently stipulated by Başkan Gida from time to time.  Finally, he described Ismet Başkan’s reference in his second email on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December to Mr Casale saying that “there are stupid things inside” as being a reference not to Version 1 of the Acknowledgment, but to a letter written to him by Mr Politis.</p>

In particular, as I have already said in relation to the use of the same word in the Framework Contract, I consider that he did understand the general meaning of the word ‘assignment’ and that the reason why he found it unnecessary to seek legal or linguistic advice about the documentation was that he had a reasonable understanding both of its meaning, as a matter of language, and of its commercial intent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That is not to say that the draft Acknowledgements and Notices were models of clarity.  Far from it.  Version 1 of the Acknowledgement was little better than meaningless, read on its own, and was not accompanied by the draft Notice in Ismet Başkan’s original email.  Version 2 was a little better, and made explicit reference to the Framework Contract which, in my judgment, Mr Casale cannot have failed to appreciate.  Nonetheless the draft Notice still rather confusingly refers to the consequence of Başkan Gida’s agreement that all payments should be made to the arranging banks as being a request to acknowledge that Ferrero should make payments to a “specified account of Başkan Gida” when the accompanying version of the Acknowledgment identified no such account.  This was however largely corrected by Version 3 of the Acknowledgement, although at that stage the precise account numbers and sort codes were not identified.  Nonetheless, the lack of clarity in the draft documentation by no means justifies the level of incomprehension which Mr Casale asserted in relation to it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Rosa Brunet was also cross-examined, but only briefly, about round one of the Acknowledgement negotiation.  His role was a minimal one, being shown Version 3 or 4 without, according to him, seeing the Notice to which it referred, and suggesting that the draft be sent to Ferrero Italy’s treasury department for their views.  It is surprising that a sophisticated businessman like Mr Rosa Brunet should have thought he could sensibly appraise the draft Acknowledgement without sight of the Notice to which it prominently referred.  His explanations were first, that Ferrero did not have a copy of the draft Notice when he was shown the draft Acknowledgment, and secondly, that he did not realise there was meant to be a notice attached to the Acknowledgement.  The first explanation was, by the time Mr Rosa Brunet was shown the documentation, wrong in fact, since Ferrero had received a draft of the Notice on the previous day.  I find the second explanation difficult to believe.  The most that can be said about Mr Rosa Brunet’s involvement at this stage, is that he received the document from a trusted subordinate (due to be promoted to the status of director at that very time) and passed it on to Mr Salomone, who he may well have regarded as better qualified that he was to consider its terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Di Matteo was also cross-examined about her role in the negotiation of the Acknowledgment.  By contrast with Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet, I found her evidence broadly credible.  Taking her witness statement and cross-examination together, the gist of her evidence was as follows.  She understood broadly what an assignment was, and her Italian translation of it was substantially that to be found in the Italian version of the Framework Contract which Mr Casale had been given.  She said that in her experience she could only think of one previous example of an assignment of debts in an international transaction, but that she came across domestic debt assignments about 50 times a year, even though the practice was not popular.  Her general expectation was that, if and when an assignment of debts to a bank was finalised, the assignee bank would notify the debtor that it had become the beneficiary of the debts, and that invoices in relation to the debts would require the debtor to pay the bank.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When shown the draft Acknowledgement and Notice, her reaction was that it was no more than an advance indication that, if a contemplated facility between Başkan Gida and the Banks went ahead, there would be an assignment, with a consequential notice to that effect from the Banks.  She suggested the addition of the Same Account clause in order to ensure that, if any assignment did occur, her department would be able to make sure that invoices coming in from Başkan Gida led to the relevant debts being paid to the correct account.  She took the trouble to ensure when reviewing the documents that Ferrero’s bankers had the means of making direct payment to KBC, and a note to that effect in her manuscript appears on the draft of the Acknowledgment shown to her.</p>

Nonetheless she accepted that the final version of the Acknowledgment did on its face appear to contain an unqualified obligation upon each Ferrero signatory to make payments in respect of contracts with Başkan Gida entered into after 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2001 to the designated accounts, even though the documents still lacked account numbers and sort codes.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Taking all that evidence together, I consider that round one of the negotiation of the Acknowledgement demonstrated Ferrero, and Mr Casale in particular, taking a thorough, careful and intelligent approach to the invitation from Başkan Gida that they should become involved in the drafting of important documentation required for the purposes of an imminent loan facility by the Banks to Başkan Gida.  The result of Ferrero’s involvement, led by Mr Casale, with light supervision from Mr Rosa Brunet and valuable assistance from Mrs Di Matteo, was that the originally unsuitable form of Acknowledgment containing commercially unsatisfactory undertakings and provisions affecting Ferrero’s dealings with Başkan Gida, and failing to make appropriate distinctions between the different roles of Ferrero Industrial and the operating companies, was refined down to a much shorter pair of drafts with appropriate versions for the different Ferrero companies involved, committing Ferrero to payment into accounts to be designated in due course, once the Facility was completed, as the debtor in relation to debts to be assigned by Başkan Gida to the Banks.  The obvious commercial purpose of the proffered documents, which in my judgment Mr Casale, Mr Rosa Brunet and Mrs Di Matteo all appreciated, was to assure Başkan Gida and the Banks that, if the Facility went ahead shortly thereafter, Ferrero would not thereafter refuse to make payments of its debts arising from contracts with Başkan Gida to accounts at KBC of which the details were to be communicated in due course.  I consider it also to be clear that Ferrero, and Mr Casale in particular, appreciated that without such confirmation in advance of the completion of the Facility, it would not be likely to be completed, with severe financial consequences for Başkan Gida.</p>

It is in my judgment incredible that Ferrero’s part in those negotiations could have been achieved in the way that it was, if its principal negotiator Mr Casale had been so ignorant of the underlying purpose of the documentation as not to appreciate what the word ‘assignment’ meant.</p>

He suggested that Mr Casale had deliberately engineered a situation where the forms of Acknowledgement and Notice sent to each of the Operating Defendants made no reference either to the Framework Contract, or to any assignment at all, whereas the Acknowledgement sent to and signed by Ferrero Industrial did so in terms.  The innuendo was that, in order to assist in Başkan Gida’s intended fraud, the Ferrero debtor companies would thereby be able with a clear conscience to continue paying Başkan Gida once the Facility was in place, unaware of any assignment, whereas Ferrero Industrial, which merely arranged contracts but incurred no debts, could thereby safely undertake obligations by reference both the Framework Contract and to an assignment of debts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addressing that serious allegation, it is necessary for me to ask why Mr Casale should have prevaricated so much about his role in this negotiation, and untruthfully denied an understanding both of the meaning of the word ‘assignment’, and of the obvious reference to the Framework Contract in the draft Acknowledgements to be signed by Ferrero Industrial.  For reasons which will be apparent from a reading of the whole of this judgment, I have concluded that Mr Wardell’s allegation that Mr Casale had a sinister intent in his participation in the drafting of these documents ought to be rejected.  I am, quite simply, not persuaded that Ferrero or Mr Casale in particular had any inkling at this stage that Başkan Gida intended to defraud the Banks, rather than merely to obtain substantial finance from them at acceptable rates of interest.  In my judgment, Mr Casale’s lies and prevarication about his understanding of the draft Acknowledgments was the result of a corporate decision made by Ferrero in 2002 to deny any understanding of the meaning of an ‘assignment’, embarked upon because of its perception in 2002 that, by having paid Başkan Gida on contracts the benefit of which had in fact been assigned to the Banks, Ferrero had exposed itself to a grave risk of having to pay twice for the same goods.  Whether it will have to pay twice is a matter for the Italian courts to decide. </p>

They were the first new orders (as opposed to re-grades) placed by Ferrero on Başkan Gida since mid-October.

By contrast, of the 16,000mt ordered from Başkan Gida, some 5,232mt remained outstanding at the beginning of December, of which 504mt were supplied during the first week of that month.  Of the amount outstanding, some 3,240mt were also overdue, in the sense of having not been delivered within the periods specified in the relevant Ferrero purchase orders.  Oltan Gida had provided defective quality in some of its deliveries. Although therefore Başkan Gida’s performance against orders fell significantly short of that of Oltan Gida, against a similar volume of orders, Başkan Gida’s delivery rate during November had been consistently in excess of 500mt per week, reaching weekly amounts in excess of 800mt in early November.  This was not as good as the rate achieved during the corresponding period in the previous year, but it was by no means so low as to be indicative of terminal financial difficulties affecting Başkan Gida.</p>

He said that the proposal that Ferrero should buy large tonnages from Başkan Gida for long forward delivery came from Melih Başkan, without any prior prompting from Ferrero, in the sense of an indication that it was actively seeking further supplies.  The Turkish hazelnut market had not fallen from the price which had, in October, led Ferrero substantially to withdraw from the market.  Melih Başkan’s proposal was, according to Mr Casale, expressly based upon his (Melih Başkan’s) expectation (which he shared) that the market would fall substantially in Spring 2002, so that the price offered, although below what Ferrero would expect to pay for immediate delivery, was based upon Başkan Gida’s expectation of being able to purchase the necessary unprocessed nuts in a falling market, at a price sufficiently lower to enable it to make a profit at the price proposed to Ferrero.</p>

Thus, although the delivery periods proposed by Melih Başkan, to enable Başkan Gida to benefit from the anticipated falling market, involved deliveries outside the period specified by Soremartec, Mr Casale said that the offer of a price lower than that currently payable for immediate delivery made the proposal worth discussing with his superiors.  He said that they (Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Do) agreed that it was attractive to obtain at a reasonable price  supplies sufficient to fulfil their stock increase policy from a plentiful crop, leaving Başkan Gida with the market risk (or “responsibility” as Mr Casale described it),  so that Melih Başkan’s offer was accepted for those reasons.</p>

Yet again, the minutiae of the costs analysis involved in processing and exporting the relevant nuts was trawled over in the greatest detail, although there was broad agreement as to the then current prices which Başkan Gida would have needed to pay, in order to obtain, in early December, the nuts necessary to perform those contracts.  I find it unnecessary to determine the numerous issues arising from that contest, since it is common ground that, marked to market in early December 2001, the three contracts were all loss-making, and Mr Casale himself acknowledged that he appreciated it at the time, and that it was implicit in the basis upon which Melih Başkan proposed the transactions to him.</p>

An a livrer contract means a contract placed in one season for delivery in the following season, and an example was given from Mr Solak’s own notes of an a livrer contract made in December 2001 for delivery in October to December 2002.  Substantial discounts off spot market prices were identified as capable of being obtained in a livrer contracts which, as Mr Solak acknowledged, involved substantial short speculation in the hope of a fall in prices.</p>

Of course, it is now known that Başkan Gida used these contracts in support of applications for draw-down under the Facility, in furtherance of its fraud.  It is a reasonable inference that the Başkans had this illicit purpose in mind when offering to supply Ferrero large quantities on forward delivery terms in early December.  But the critical question is whether anything about the circumstances in which they were proposed and agreed leads to the inference that Ferrero was a knowing participant in the achievement of those purposes.  </p>

I accept the uniform evidence of Messrs Casale, Rosa Brunet and Do to the effect that Ferrero had formulated a policy to obtain nuts in excess of its production needs for the purpose of building up stocks in a plentiful season, and that the implementation of that policy was a sufficient commercial basis for Ferrero contracting on forward delivery terms for the large quantities represented by the Early December Contracts, providing that the prices offered were reasonable.  </p>

Prices for immediate delivery were still at a level which had led Ferrero to wish to withdraw from the market, and there is no evidence that Oltan Gida would have been prepared to engage in short speculation of the type implicit in Başkan Gida’s offer.  Furthermore, the placing of substantial orders for immediate delivery would merely have increased the risk of a further hardening in prices, and cost much more than the price then being offered by Başkan Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is correct that the terms proposed for the Early December Contracts represented a substantial departure from the ordinary course of business between Ferrero and Başkan Gida, and in particular from the basis of trading set out in the Framework Contract and that, if marked to market in early December they would have been loss-making for Başkan Gida.  All those factors were I have no doubt apparent to Ferrero at the time, as was the fact that, in offering forward delivery at prices below the spot price, Başkan Gida was taking on its shoulders the risk that the market would not turn down as the Başkans and Mr Casale expected.  In fact, the market did turn down in 2002, but not in sufficient time to have turned the contracts from loss-making to profitability within the agreed delivery periods, save for the Ferrero France contract, which permitted delivery as late as June 2002.</p>

The case for a backdating of the Ferrero Italy contract is stronger than in relation to the other two, where the appearance may be attributable to Mr Casale just being late in sending ordering instructions to the two operating companies. Mr Casale’s expectations, constantly pressed upon him by Ismet Başkan in his emails that week relating to the draft assignment documents, was that the last day for negotiation of the Facility was Friday 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, and the documents themselves expressly contemplated closing on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, in the sense that that was the start date for contracts in respect of which Ferrero was invited to undertake to pay to the specified accounts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty for the Banks in making play of this probability is that they were unable to advance and put to Mr Casale in cross-examination any consistent suspicious rationale for the backdating.  It was suggested to Mr Casale that he must have had appreciated that the Ferrero Italy contract was backdated from 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, so as to enable Başkan Gida to receive payment under it without those payments being caught by the assignment to the Banks.  He denied any such perception, and no similar analysis can be applied to the backdating of the Ferrero France and Germany contracts from 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  Furthermore, the Facility did not in fact complete, nor was there any assignment of debts, on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, nor was there any basis on that date for Mr Casale to suspect that the Başkans would dishonestly use that contract as a means of raising money with the Banks, and then (as in fact they did) invoice Ferrero on terms requesting payment otherwise than to the designated accounts.  For reasons which I shall have to expand upon when addressing the honesty or otherwise of Mr Casale’s repeated trade reference for Başkan Gida on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, I am not persuaded that anything about Başkan Gida’s conduct until that date was sufficient to place Mr Casale on inquiry as to Başkan Gida’s integrity, after a long and mutually satisfactory trading relationship spanning many years.</p>

They included Mr Fontana, (head of Quality control at Ferrero Italy) who signed both the contract and the purchase order for Ferrero Italy, Mr Caroly of Ferrero France and Mr Bolowich of Ferrero Germany, as well as Messrs Altare, Bertone, Cicolin and Gagliasso within Ferrero Italy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, the fact that Başkan Gida went out of business when the bulk of the deliveries promised under the Early December Contracts remained outstanding by no means suggests that the Early December Contracts were shams, or that Ferrero did not desire to obtain the promised supplies.  At the time when Başkan Gida ceased trading, none of the delivery periods agreed under those contracts had expired, albeit the period under the Ferrero Italy contract was about to.  Over 700mt had by then been supplied to Ferrero Italy, and the bulk of the remainder was in due course supplied, on the same terms as to price, by Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel.  It follows that I broadly accept as true Mr Casale’s account of the negotiation and making of the Early December Contracts.  The fact that all three of them were slightly backdated was, in my judgment, insufficient to put him, still less Ferrero, on notice of the improper purpose for which, by then, the Başkans had probably decided to deploy them.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient to deal with the first and second of the Banks’ alleged false representations together, not least since one of the significant difficulties which it is alleged that Ferrero had experienced with Başkan Gida was its failure to make deliveries on a timely basis.  In relation to these two representations, the Banks repeated all the matters relied upon in support of their allegation that the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July Letter was untrue.  I have rejected those, and need not address them again.  In relation to the period after July, the Banks relied upon the substantial failures by Başkan Gida to make deliveries within the delivery periods specified in Ferrero’s purchase orders, upon the apparent breakdown in the regular provision of DPRs and PCs since 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, and the apparent discontinuation of the (by then) conventional basis of negotiating orders reflected in the Framework Contract.  They relied also upon the fact that Ferrero had been obliged to re-grade a series of rocher orders into less demanding paste orders due to Başkan Gida’s inability to provide rocher kernels of sufficient quality under those orders.  They invited me to infer that, even if not part of a dishonest conspiracy, the early December forward contracts involved Ferrero ordering on different terms precisely because of Başkan Gida’s inability to go on supplying in accordance with the procedure reflected in the Framework Contract.  Finally, the Banks pointed to the promotion of Oltan Gida to approximate parity with Başkan Gida as a supplier of Turkish hazelnuts as evidence that Ferrero no longer regarded Başkan Gida as a reliable supplier, due to the difficulties which it had encountered in Başkan Gida’s performance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Casale’s and Mr Rosa Brunet’s evidence on these matters may be summarised as follows.  They both firmly denied that they considered that the long established and mutually beneficial close trading relationship between Ferrero and Başkan Gida had broken down, emphasising that they would not have committed Ferrero to purchases in excess of a further 6,000mt from Başkan Gida during the previous week if either of them thought it had broken down.  They regarded the trade reference as a description of a long term relationship with Başkan Gida over many years, against which matters arising during the previous few months needed to be looked at in context.  They both regarded Başkan Gida’s performance during the peak part of the 2001 season (which by common consent, including that of the experts, ran until Christmas) as having been satisfactory, and attributed Başkan Gida’s delays and difficulties in fulfilling the rocher orders as being attributable to quality problems which had emerged with the new crop in the course of processing, and which affected all Turkish suppliers, and in particular Oltan Gida, as much as Başkan Gida.  As for paste orders, for example by Ferrero France, they attributed delays in delivery of these orders to Ferrero Industrial’s insistence that Başkan Gida concentrate primarily on the maintenance of high quality rocher supplies to Ferrero Italy, and to storage capacity limitations in France.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the failure to make deliveries on a timely basis, the main thrust of Mr Casale’s evidence was that he did not take much notice of Başkan Gida’s rate of performance against delivery periods specified in Ferrero’s purchase orders, being content to leave the timing of deliveries (and the making of the necessary detailed transport arrangements) to his subordinates, while he focused on the rate at which deliveries actually made satisfied both the operating companies’ production requirements, and Ferrero Industrial’s policy of increasing stocks in excess of production, both of which he said were during the period from August until December 2001 being satisfactorily met by the combination of Başkan Gida’s and other suppliers’ deliveries.  The deliveries were therefore in his view timely for Ferrero purposes, whether or not strictly in accordance with the conventional delivery periods routinely inserted in Ferrero’s purchase orders.  Mr Bolowich’s evidence on this point largely corroborated that of Mr Casale.</p>

He said that as at 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December he had no perception that the conventional basis had been abandoned for good, even though the Early December Contracts had been negotiated on an entirely different basis, due to the particular state of the market, and the broad consensus between the Başkans and himself as to the likelihood of a fall in prices in 2002.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to these issues, my conclusions are as follows.  First, I have no difficulty in accepting Ferrero’s evidence that Ferrero did not regard the mutually beneficial trading relationship as having broken down by 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  My conclusion that both the Re-grade Contracts and the Early December Contracts had been made for genuine commercial reasons rather than as participation in any unlawful conspiracy to defraud the Banks leads inevitably to a conclusion that Ferrero continued to regard Başkan Gida as a valued supplier worthy of being given very substantial hazelnut orders, by 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  Looking at the matter in the round therefore, Başkan Gida continued to be a supplier for which Ferrero Industrial believed that it could give a favourable trade reference, on the basis that a beneficial relationship established over many years had not been undermined by anything which had happened since July 2001.  Furthermore, nothing in the detailed review of the relationship during that period leads me to the conclusion that a favourable trade reference could not reasonably have been given by Ferrero Industrial at that time.  An attempt was made by Mr Wardell in cross-examination of Mr Casale to suggest that Ferrero had deliberately avoided calling the production manager at Ferrero France, because he would have regarded Başkan Gida’s delays in supplying paste kernels pursuant to that operating company’s orders as wholly unsatisfactory.  I regard that assertion as speculative.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning therefore to the first two specific falsehoods alleged, the reality was in my judgment as follows.  First, Başkan Gida had not made all its shipments to Ferrero on a timely basis, if “timely” is to be measured against the delivery periods set out in Ferrero’s Purchase Orders.  By 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, 22,440mt had been ordered, 11,448mt had been delivered and, of the balance, 2,616mt were overdue, in the sense of not having been delivered within the periods specified in Ferrero’s purchase orders.  Of the same balance, 6,432mt were the subject matter of the forward orders placed during the previous week.  I have included as overdue the quantities which were the subject matter of the November re-grades, because they provided for delivery in November 2001.  Even if a November delivery seems unrealistically short in relation to contracts made on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, they arose as a result of Başkan Gida’s default, rather than Ferrero’s wish to postpone delivery.  They are therefore properly to be regarded as overdue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">2,600mt overdue as a proportion of 22,500 odd ordered or even 11,500 odd delivered may not seem very large, but some of the delays were substantial.  Furthermore, Başkan Gida had enjoyed a substantial period since mid-October until early December, when Ferrero was placing no fresh orders, during which to catch up with its deliveries and, although it had made significant progress, it had not fully done so.  Yet further, Oltan Gida’s delivery performance in relation to a broadly equivalent amount of orders (prior to the Early December Orders) had been substantially better than that of Başkan Gida, albeit at the serious cost of having delivered a significant amount of sub-standard kernels due to the quality problems which undoubtedly were affecting the 2001 crop during that period.  It is in that respect notable that Ferrero placed no further orders with Oltan Gida after November 2001, before June 2002, from which it is not difficult to infer that Ferrero’s receipt of sub-standard kernels from Oltan Gida represented a real difficulty in those parties’ trading relationship.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have described Başkan Gida’s rate of weekly deliveries during November as having been satisfactory, albeit less than achieved during the same period in the previous year, and less than Oltan Gida was achieving.  In early December its weekly deliveries fell to only 312mt during the week beginning 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December, and only 216mt during the week beginning 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  It is fair to suppose, since transport arrangements would have by then to have been made in respect of that week’s deliveries, that Ferrero Industrial had at least the means of knowing what Başkan Gida’s delivery rate would be during that second week.  Mr Casale said that he saw nothing surprising in a falling off of the delivery rate during late November and early December since, in 2001, it was the Ramadan period and a similar decline in weekly deliveries is observable during the Ramadan period in the previous year, although not to such a low level.   I accept that evidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">While Mr Casale may not have found it necessary himself to do a regular and detailed monitoring of Başkan Gida’s rate of deliveries against the periods specified in Purchase Orders, at least not to the microscopic extent conducted during this trial, I consider that he significantly understated his degree of awareness at the time of this aspect of Başkan Gida’s performance.  There is no doubt that his office had the statistics available for such an analysis, and I consider it to be inconsistent with the thorough and careful way in which Mr Casale demonstrably carried out his duties for him to have been as detached from this aspect of the performance of Ferrero’s major supplier as he claims.  Furthermore, as the author of the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December Letter and the person in Ferrero with the largest responsibility for the accuracy of its contents, I consider that when giving evidence he appreciated his vulnerability in the assertion as to the timeliness of Başkan Gida’s deliveries, and therefore carried his assertions of detachment from the detail of Başkan Gida’s performance beyond the boundaries of an honest lapse of recollection.  By contrast, Mr Rosa Brunet probably was less aware than Mr Casale of the details of Başkan Gida’s performance in terms of timeliness, and, with less personal vulnerability, felt able to acknowledge frankly that the assertion in the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December Letter that Başkan Gida achieved a uniformly timely performance could not, once the detailed facts were investigated after the event, be justified.  I agree with Mr Rosa Brunet.  The statement in the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December Letter that Başkan Gida provided consistent shipments on a timely basis did, as at that date, involve a misrepresentation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question whether this amounted to a “significant difficulty”, experienced by Ferrero in its relationship with Başkan Gida is more difficult.  As I have described, the evidence demonstrates that there were significant difficulties in the quality of the 2001 crop that adversely affected the performance of both Ferrero’s main hazelnut suppliers in different ways. Başkan Gida was affected by the mould and aflatoxin problems in the Ordu crop, while Oltan Gida was also affected by the cimiciate problems affecting the Akcakoca variety. These problems began to manifest themselves in October and November, having been unnoticed at the beginning of the season.  It led to Ferrero relaxing its cimiciate specification. The substance of Mr Casale’s evidence, supported by Mr Rosa Brunet, was that whereas Oltan Gida chose to deal with that difficulty by sacrificing quality to timeliness, Başkan Gida appeared to have done the exact opposite, in particular by rejecting deliveries from its suppliers, and then having to find replacements.  The results were that Oltan Gida’s deliveries gave rise to a quality problem whereas Başkan Gida’s gave rise to a timing problem. There is documentary evidence of rejections of Oltan Gida deliveries, in particular of rocher supplied to Ferrero Italy, and compensation being deducted from the cost of supplies in the following season. That evidence was not sufficient to permit any detailed comparative analysis, but Oltan Gida’s grovelling written apology, coupled with the fact that Ferrero made no further orders from Oltan Gida after December, until mid 2002, while placing very large orders with Başkan Gida, does provide some corroboration.  Even though I have rejected Mr Casale’s attempt to distance himself from the detail of that problem, I accept his and Mr Rosa Brunet’s evidence that neither of them regarded Başkan Gida as blameworthy for dealing with the quality problem in that way.  When it is borne in mind that because of its stocking policy, Ferrero could endure considerable delays in delivery without suffering adverse consequences in terms of interruption to production, whereas a lack of quality in its raw materials threatened its reputation for producing a high quality end product, that attitude seems to me to have been entirely reasonable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, it appears from the evidence (in particular from Mrs Pay) that Başkan Gida’s ever deepening financial problem was a major contributor to its failure to make timely deliveries of the 2001 crop, even if quality problems may also have been a significant contributory factor.  Both Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet denied any awareness as at 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2001 that financial embarrassment in the form of a shortage of working capital played any part in Başkan Gida’s under-achievement in terms of timely deliveries.  They were aware in general terms that Başkan Gida was seeking a more economical source of working capital than that available from its Turkish bankers, and that, prior to the beginning of the 2001 season, Başkan Gida had obtained significant additional finance (as is now known, from Mr Dahod).  They also knew that Başkan Gida was at an advanced stage in obtaining finance from banks unaffected by the Turkish financial crisis, albeit that it had not been put in place prior to the beginning of the season.  They had also been told much earlier in 2001 that Başkan Gida did not consider its business with Ferrero to be profitable, but, with good reason, they took that assertion with a pinch of salt.  They also knew that, by comparison with the previous year, Başkan Gida’s supplies to Ferrero were not assisted in terms of working capital by any pre-payments.  There had also been market rumours that Başkan Gida was financially embarrassed but again, Ferrero were in my judgment entitled to place little weight upon them, not least since Başkan Gida had maintained steady, if unspectacular, deliveries of hazelnuts from the start of the 2001 season right through to early December, particularly if (as Mr Casale said in evidence), those rumours came from Başkan Gida’s competitors.</p>

Başkan Gida’s continuing search for non-Turkish lenders was consistently presented both to Ferrero, and indeed to potential lenders, as a search for cheaper working capital, rather than a project designed to make good a shortage of it.  At its highest, Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet may have suspected that a delay in getting its non-Turkish facility completed may have been a contributory factor, but I accept their evidence that they did not know or believe that it was.</p>

It did not in fact cause Ferrero any practical difficulties of its own, since first, its freezing programme was satisfied from the aggregate of its rocher deliveries from all its suppliers, and since the delayed deliveries were still received well in time to avoid any production interruption, and to constitute stocks in hand in fulfilment of Ferrero Industrial’s stock policy.  At the most, it meant that deliveries were to an extent received later than prescribed by the Soremartec Golden Rules, but this had occurred in previous years and I can well understand that from the procurement perspective of Ferrero Industrial, it was envisaged as preferable to obtain good quality hazelnuts late, rather than defective quality hazelnuts in good time.</p>

Ferrero’s belief was that the under-performance in terms of timeliness was attributable to a factor for which Başkan Gida could not fairly be blamed.  It was not therefore a relationship difficulty in the sense referred to in the reference.</p>

Its policy for the 2001 season was to continue, but not significantly exceed, the levels of orders placed with Başkan Gida in previous years.</p>

The Banks’ pleaded case suggested that this representation would have been untrue even if Mr Casale had believed that Başkan Gida could deliver at that level only with the assistance with finance from the Banks.</p>

I consider that Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet probably did have it in mind in expecting to maintain orders to Başkan Gida up to 30,000mt for the 2001 season, that by 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December Başkan Gida was on the point of receiving non-Turkish bank finance, for the purposes of providing the working capital necessary not merely to fulfil the early December orders, but further orders at the level which Melih Başkan had invited in the November Letter.  But that expectation of a successful outcome to the Başkans’ search for a cheaper source of finance in no way undermines the truth of the representation made in the letter.  In the event, Ferrero did order 30,000mt from Başkan Gida during the 2001 season, when orders by all the operating companies are taken into account, and took delivery of only slightly less, albeit from the combination of Başkan Gida and its two successor companies.</p>

Of course, the Re-grade Contracts and the Early December Contracts were placed on a quite different basis from that reflected in the procedure recorded in the Framework Contract, but that did not of itself render any of those contracts improper or un-commercial from Ferrero’s perspective, even if, as is probably the case, Başkan Gida had an improper purpose in mind in relation to the early December contracts, since I have concluded that Ferrero was entirely unaware of it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question whether Mr Casale acted dishonestly inevitably raises an issue as to motive.  Plainly, it was in Ferrero’s interests that Başkan Gida should obtain, rather than be deprived of, its long-sought non-Turkish finance.  For reasons which will become apparent when I deal with the events of 2002, I have concluded that Ferrero had a powerful desire to maintain Başkan Gida as a major supplier of Turkish hazelnuts, not merely because of its own deserved reputation for producing high quality nuts meeting Ferrero’s exacting specifications, but also because the Başkans’ very long experience of the market had involved building up supply chains, stretching back through crackers, manavs and growers, whose own activities Ferrero assumed contributed in no small measure to the high quality of the end product.  Ferrero had, of course, no easy means of access to, or means of supporting,  the entities and persons in the supply chain behind Başkan Gida, but could preserve the chain as well as Başkan Gida by assisting in the achievement by Başkan Gida of its own commercial objectives. When faced with an invitation to provide a trade reference, Ferrero therefore had an understandable motive for painting its supplier in as rosy a hue as was consistent with the objective facts, but not, in my judgment a sufficient motive for telling an outright lie.</p>

I accept that evidence.  In my judgment Mr Casale failed to focus on the fact that, read objectively, a reference to timely deliveries would ordinarily be taken as meaning timely, by reference to delivery periods specified in orders and contracts, rather than, as he intended, merely by reference to Ferrero’s production requirements and stocking policy. I have come to the conclusion that this inaccuracy in an otherwise fair and genuine trade reference is to be attributed to negligence rather than dishonesty on Mr Casale’s part. A careful appraisal of the December Letter, by reference to the meaning which the Banks might be expected to place upon the statement about timeliness, ought to have made him realise that his intended meaning was not that which, objectively, that statement conveyed.</p>

He relied upon an exchange of emails between the Banks’ lawyers, Lovells, Başkan Gida’s lawyers White &amp; Case and himself on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December (the last Friday before Christmas) which started with a note from White &amp; Case that the condition precedent remained outstanding, and which concluded at 8.52 p.m. with an email from Lovells to White &amp; Case stating that the condition had been satisfied.

This is thin evidence for receipt by the Banks of a document upon the detail of which they now allege that they relied at the time, but on a narrow balance I am just persuaded that, although not studied with any care, it was either received or, more likely, that PRI confirmed that Ferrero had signed it. </p>

Furthermore, the acknowledgment made no reference to debts, but merely to Başkan Gida’s rights under the Framework Contract, which had neither been made by, nor sent to the Ferrero operating companies, which, by contrast with Ferrero Industrial, were the companies which became debtors under contracts for the supply of hazelnuts.</p>

Again, in my judgment this paints Mr Casale too much in the role of a Machiavelli.  The evidence of the second round of the negotiations suggests that Mr Casale supplied to Başkan Gida the names of the individuals at each of the operating companies to whom notices of assignment and Acknowledgements should be sent for their signature.  These were Mr Rosa Brunet for Ferrero Italy, Mr Bolowich for Ferrero Germany and Mr Aimaro for Ferrero France.  Their names can be seen used by the Banks in communications sent direct to the operating companies on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December, to which I shall refer in due course.  In my judgment Mr Casale fully expected that notices of assignment and Acknowledgements would be sent to each of the operating companies.  In insisting that the Ferrero Industrial Acknowledgment should be given on its own behalf, and not on behalf of the operating companies, Mr Casale was doing no more than he had done in round one of the negotiations, and for no sinister purpose.   </p>

For present purposes it is necessary only to describe how, in accordance with this structure, the Facility was intended to operate in practice.  The Facility Agreement committed the Banks to lending to Başkan Gida in Dollars or Euros up to specified limits for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing and export of hazelnuts by Başkan Gida to specified buyers (“Buyers”), including the Ferrero companies.  The limits were US$30 million until the end of December 2001, US$35 million during January 2002, US$25 million during February to June inclusive and US$20 million during July, the Facility expiring at the end of July.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks’ security over the hazelnuts between purchase by Başkan Gida and onward sale to Buyers was constituted by the combination of the Master Pledge Agreement, individual pledges signed in relation to each deposit of hazelnuts with SGS, the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement, and the Master Trust Receipt.  I shall have to consider each of these in more detail when addressing the Banks’ proprietary claim.  For the purposes of my findings of fact, it is necessary to outline the functions imposed upon SGS, under the Collateral Management Agreement.  By way of background, the structure put in place reflected the understanding of the Banks, on advice, that the effectiveness of a pledge of goods in Turkey depended critically upon being able to identify defined goods being held in the possession of the pledgee or its agent.  Loss of possession, in particular to the pledgor, gave rise to a threat (the extent of which was the main point at issue between the parties’ Turkish law experts) of loss of security.  The Banks recognised that the need for Başkan Gida to process hazelnuts between purchase from its suppliers and delivery to Buyers meant that there would be an inevitable loss of possession to Başkan Gida as pledgor during the processing period, and the perceived vulnerability of any pledge expressed to persist during that period was meant to be buttressed, to the limited extent possible, by the Master Trust Receipt.</p>

Mr Aslan regarded it as no part of his duty to ascertain where they were to go (i.e. whether into the processing factory or elsewhere), still less did he have any responsibility to monitor the processing or the delivery of processed hazelnuts FOT Giresun to Ferrero or anyone else.</p>

Nothing in the two rounds of negotiations between Başkan Gida and Ferrero Industrial, through Mr Casale, during the course of which the Acknowledgments reached their final form, could have given rise to any expectation or concern that the Ferrero Operating Defendants might refuse to sign such documents.  The versions forged by Başkan Gida were all in a form which Mr Casale had already had approved, and in particular contained the Same Account clause requested by Mrs Di Matteo.  There survives a fax from Mr Politis of PRI to Mr Byles and Mr Lewis dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December in which, on Başkan Gida’s behalf, he objects to a suggestion that the first draw-down should only follow the Ferrero companies’ further signature to revised Acknowledgements correcting a typographical error in the account number, stating that “Başkan feels that we have strained the relationship enough on this subject”. </p>

Having failed to obtain Mr Casale’s agreement to sign on behalf of all the relevant Ferrero companies, Başkan simply avoided by the forgeries having to wait until the relevant officials from companies situated all round Europe complied with a routine request, a process which, as is evident from the time it took Ferrero France to reply to Mr Lewis’s fax, might well have been overtaken by the Christmas holidays. </p>

In Italian criminal proceedings early in December 2003 to which I shall have to return, Ferrero Industrial alleged that Mr Lewis’s fax had been left unanswered because Ferrero Industrial did not anticipate having to make any payments for hazelnut supplies by Başkan Gida.

I consider that the failure of all the Ferrero companies except for Ferrero France to reply to his fax is because no-one applied any pressure for replies, the Banks having decided before Christmas not to insist on a satisfactory reply as a condition precedent to beginning substantial lending under the Facility.  I draw no adverse inferences as to the integrity of Ferrero, Mr Rosa Brunet or Mr Casale from that failure.</p>

Submission of the relevant Ferrero Italy purchase orders would have demonstrated to the Banks that the utilisation request lodged on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December was based on Ferrero Italy orders on average more than three months old, specifying delivery periods which had long since passed.</p>

In support of the allegation of dishonesty, the Banks also repeat in relation to these contracts similar allegations to those made in relation to the Early December Contracts such as that Ferrero had no need of the hazelnuts to which they related; that, if marked to market on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2001 they were loss-making and that, if all that was being done was to re-number and re-date old contracts, this made no commercial sense.

He said that having been told by Mr Casale that the outstanding amounts were correctly recorded in the new contracts, he signed them without any further inquiry, still less checks of his own, not regarding it as his job to become immersed in matters of detail that were the responsibility of Mr Casale and his subordinates.  He said that he gave no thought to the use which Başkan Gida might wish to make of the re-numbered contracts, but if they had been used for the obtaining of finance, he would not have thought there was anything wrong about having outstanding orders re-confirmed by fresh contracts.</p>

Nonetheless he accepted in cross-examination that he probably did think at the time that Melih Başkan wished to use the re-numbered contracts in connection with raising finance from the Banks.  Nonetheless, he said that it did not occur to him for one moment that the Başkans had any improper intent to mislead by the use of the re-numbered contracts, having no doubt at that stage as to their integrity.  He added that he could not see how any pretence that the contracts related to fresh orders could have been made to the Banks by the use of re-numbered contracts which contained reference to the original Ferrero Italy purchase order numbers.  His evidence as to why Ferrero had no copies of the re-numbered contracts to disclose was not entirely consistent, as between his August 2005 witness statement and his cross-examination, but in the context of an enormously complicated case I do not regard that discrepancy as being of much significance.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the question whether I should conclude that Mr Casale or Mr Rosa Brunet knowingly participated in the Başkans’ intended dishonest use of the re-numbered contracts by signing them on behalf of Ferrero Italy depends critically upon the anterior question whether anything in the Başkans’ conduct to date was sufficient to put them on inquiry as to their integrity.  An honest person with such a suspicion would, when asked to sign the re-numbered contracts have stood back and asked whether the Başkans could put them to a dishonest use when raising finance from the Banks.  From that perspective, questions to Melih Başkan as to why, for example, the outstanding deliveries could not simply be made the subject of an exchange of letters referring to them as such would have been unlikely to have produced a satisfactory answer.  By contrast, to a person without such prior suspicion, the fact that the Başkans wished to make outstanding deliveries the subject of fresh contracts, even in connection with imminent or available Bank finance would not in my judgment have, of itself, been inherently suspicious, coming from a family with whom Ferrero had a longstanding relationship of mutual trust and respect.  Businessmen are not ordinarily expected to approach requests from counterparties with a predisposition to ask whether the request derives from a dishonest motive.  In the present case there is no evidence that Ferrero knew anything of the terms of the Facility, let alone whether the presentation of outstanding orders as the subject matter of fresh contracts would of itself have made the difference between obtaining or not obtaining finance for their performance.  In the event, perhaps ironically, it was only because of a concession by the Banks, in accepting signed contracts rather than purchase orders as the basis for the utilisation request, that the Başkans were able to use the re-numbered contracts for the purpose of raising finance at all. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am therefore disposed to give Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale the benefit of the doubt in relation to their participation in the signing of the re-numbered contracts.  I have little difficulty in that regard in relation to Mr Rosa Brunet, whose seniority would have entitled him to pay little attention to the detailed content of documents which he was asked to sign by a trusted junior who had his own subordinates under him.  My conclusion has been less straightforward in relation to Mr Casale.  In the end, the absence of a motive for either of them to have played a knowing part in a deliberate deception of the Banks at this stage is sufficient to lead to a conclusion in their favour.</p>

Although it was uncommon for Ferrero to receive invoices dated long before a particular delivery, I am not persuaded that Mr Bolowich’s email should have made Mr Casale think that the invoice to which Mr Bolowich was referring had been dishonestly backdated.  Mr Casale suggested the obvious alternative explanation in cross-examination (although as he acknowledged he could not in fact recall what had happened), namely that there had been some reason for a delay in the delivery.  Furthermore, Mr Bolowich’s email does not in terms explain that his concern was whether the money should have been paid to the Banks’ Collection Account, and he could not recall whether he had spelt out the nature of his concern to Mr Casale when he received his instructions on the telephone to pay Pamukbank.  I have little doubt, had Mr Casale asked Melih Başkan about this, that he would have been told that, since these hazelnuts had not been funded by the Facility, payment was not due to be made to the Banks in respect of them.  That is exactly what happened when Ferrero Australasia paid an invoice into the Collection Account in respect of a contract which had not been funded by the Banks, later in January.  In those circumstances the suggestion that this event shows either an active dishonest participation by Mr Casale in a conspiracy, or that it should have put Mr Casale on notice of the Başkans’ fraud, falls well short of the mark.</p>

Contact 5089 was for the same quantity, for delivery as to 600mt in April, 720mt in May and 696mt in June 2002 respectively.  The Başkans wanted to use those two contracts for the purpose of drawing down money under the Facility, but their delivery dates were too far forward to give rise to a repayment stream within the specified 45 day period.

More generally, Mr Wardell submitted that Mr Casale’s obtaining (or forging) of Ferrero Germany and Ferrero France’s signatures on revised versions of these two contracts demonstrated him both knowing of and participating in the Başkans’ fraudulent designs on the Banks, by falsifying contract details to make them appear to comply with the requirements of the Facility.</p>

His assumption (rather than recollection) was that he had arranged for that to happen without being appraised of any change in the delivery periods, and that, because he did not regard delivery periods as important, he instructed Ferrero Germany and Ferrero France to sign them, without realising that the dates had indeed been changed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusions on this episode are as follows.  First, the evidence comes nowhere near proving that Mr Casale forged the Through version of Contract 5089 appearing to be signed by Ferrero France.  In my judgment it was both signed and stamped by Ferrero France, even though that company retained the earlier, slightly different To version in their records unsigned, and despite there being no surviving evidence of the Through version having been transmitted back to Ferrero Italy.  It seems to me fanciful to suppose that Ferrero France would have objected to signing either the To or Through versions of Contract 5089 on Mr Casale’s instructions.  Ferrero Industrial and Mr Casale in particular were in charge of these matters, and the responsible officers of the operating companies habitually acted upon his instructions, just as Mr Bolowich did in relation to Contract 5088.  I can see no reason why Mr Casale should have had a Ferrero France stamp in his office, and I do not regard Ferrero’s failure to call Mr Caroly (who had in any event left Ferrero France before this matter came on for trial) as justifying an inference of forgery.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the more general suggested inference that this episode shows Mr Casale acting as a dishonest conspirator, I regard that as thoroughly improbable.  This event occurred before Mr Casale had any reason to suspect the Başkans of dishonesty.  Even if Mr Casale had recognised that the delivery period was being changed, and had asked Melih Başkan for an explanation, I would expect Melih Başkan to have satisfied him with the explanation that the Facility terms prevented Başkan Gida using the Banks’ funds in relation to these contracts unless the delivery periods were adjusted as requested.  Ferrero had no reason to object to Başkan Gida being given the option to make earlier delivery.  I see no reason why a variation to adjust the delivery periods in that way should have been regarded by Mr Casale as an improper, still less dishonest request by the Başkans, providing only that they made no secret agreement between themselves that Ferrero and Başkan Gida should remain bound by the original delivery periods, to the exclusion of the new ones.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">  There is some very slight evidence to that effect, in that when these consignments were reordered from Aksu Gida in February 2002, the original delivery periods were reinstated.  Since both Ferrero France and Ferrero Germany would at that stage probably have been writing new orders based upon the original purchase orders of December 2001, this is not particularly surprising, all the more so since neither Ferrero France nor Ferrero Germany retained signed copies of the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January revisions on their files.  That evidence therefore falls well short of establishing a case of a secret bargain between Melih Başkan and Mr Casale to adhere to the previously agreed delivery periods, sufficient to render the revised versions signed on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January instruments of fraud.  In relation to Contract 5088, it is difficult to see how that could have happened without Mr Bolowich’s knowing involvement, and the Banks quite properly no longer maintain any allegation of dishonesty against him.    </p>

Furthermore, even if that process was circumvented (as it was), the Başkans would not themselves thereby have obtained a benefit from their fraud if Başkan Gida was not thereby rescued from insolvency (which it was not), since Başkan Gida’s numerous creditors, including both the Banks, its Turkish bankers and the Dahod Investors would ultimately have had recourse to the money, or its proceeds in the form of hazelnuts, in any enforced liquidation of Başkan Gida.</p>

Aksu Gida had no other business than the provision of employees to Başkan Gida, and in particular no hazelnut business of its own.

Nonetheless, the Scheme would not achieve its desired purpose (namely the preservation of the hazelnut business for the Başkan family’s benefit) unless first, Başkan Gida’s suppliers and customers could be persuaded to transfer their business to Aksu Gida and, secondly, the Başkan family retained concealed beneficial ownership of Aksu Gida, or the means of resuming ownership once the dust generated by the collapse of Başkan Gida, and the non-payment of its major creditors, had settled. The Başkans needed also to retain de facto control of Aksu Gida throughout.  This is because it is, on the face of it, difficult to see how the Başkans would have been able to persuade Ferrero to take on Aksu Gida as its main Turkish hazelnut supplier if its only credentials were that it was a company with no previous experience of the sourcing, processing or  export of hazelnuts, owned as to 20% and managed by a man with no such experience, and no English or other European language with which to communicate with Ferrero, and with no track record of having a supply chain of the type which had in the past contributed to Başkan Gida’ reputation as the supplier of the highest quality hazelnuts.  The same difficulties might be thought to attend any attempt to persuade Başkan Gida’s supply chain to transfer their business to Aksu Gida, for similar reasons, save for the language barrier.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The mechanics by which the Scheme was implemented, so as to be fully up and running by the end of February 2002 before the Banks had any inkling of it, are not the subject of significant factual dispute.  Even the backdating of most of the principal documents used to implement the Scheme is not now denied, although previously dishonestly concealed by the Scheme’s participants when seeking with some success to defend it from Başkan Gida’s creditors before the Turkish courts.  The main issues which I have to decide about this part of the case concern the manner in which the Scheme was presented first to Mr Abidali and the Dahod Investors and secondly to Ferrero, the true nature of the deal between the Başkan family, Mr Abidali and the Dahod Investors in relation to the ownership and control of Aksu Gida,  the question whether the Scheme in fact involved unlawful acts, either in its implementation or use, and the question whether either Mr Abidali or Ferrero knew (in the relevant sense) that it did.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The last two questions arise at two distinct levels.  The first looks at the Scheme on its own, the potential unlawfulness being the deprivation from most of Başkan Gida’s creditors of their rights to share in its assets pursuant to Turkish insolvency law.  The second level treats the Scheme as part of a wider conspiracy to defraud the Banks, the alleged unlawful acts being the dishonest obtaining and use of the Banks’ money, contrary to the terms of the Facility Agreement, for the purchase of the hazelnuts to be transferred to Aksu Gida under the Scheme, and without any intention that the money borrowed would ever be repaid. It also involved the dishonest obtaining of hazelnuts free from the Banks’ rights as pledgee, and the dishonest breach of the trust which then attached to them.</p>

By the beginning of his visit he knew that the Başkans had succeeded in obtaining a very large pre-export finance facility from the Banks, not least because he had been sent a press release by PRI crowing about its part in the transaction and stating that “PRI secured US$50 million in pre-export financing from two major international banks in London at a cost less than half of what the Company was paying to Turkish banks.”  In reply, Mr Abidali had sent PRI a short congratulatory email.  Although he denied knowledge of it, contemporary documents show that Indo-Med had also paid KBC’s fee for the Facility on Başkan Gida’s behalf, debiting it to the inter-company running account. I reject Mr Abidali’s evidence that he did not know what the payment to KBC was for.</p>

While I accept that, prior to his visit, Mr Abidali may have had no particular concern for the future of the Dahod Investment, I reject his evidence that he thought that the Banks’ money was to be applied solely for non-Ferrero business, for reasons which I shall explain later.</p>

The biscuit factory had run into financial difficulties, a dispute had erupted between Başkan Gida and Yapi Kredi relating to the investment and Yapi Kredi was not providing facilities to Başkan Gida as previously promised.</p>

He said that Başkan Gida was not in a position to repay the advances in cash but was looking for a way to repay in stocks of hazelnuts or other assets.  This might be done by making stocks or assets available to Indo-Med or to another company which might be in a position to continue to use the finance which Indo-Med and Mr Dahod had provided to carry on a trade in hazelnuts.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Abidali’s evidence was that, although this information gave him cause to discuss with Mr Dahod how the Dahod Investment should be preserved, it did not occur to him that a dispute between Başkan Gida and one of its Turkish banks had any adverse implications for Başkan Gida’s ability to continue trading generally.  He did not understand the proposal to amount to a wholesale transfer of Başkan Gida’s assets and business or that, if implemented, it would lead to Başkan Gida being unable thereafter to pay its creditors in full.  He said that the Banks were not even mentioned, and that he gave no thought to their position.  If, as I consider likely, the Scheme was introduced to him broadly in the manner described in the passage quoted above, I find his evidence as to how he regarded its implications as wholly unreal.  A proposal to pay a smaller creditor in kind, with assets sufficient to enable it to take over the debtor’s trading business in the face of a dispute with one of its larger bank creditors, and with insufficient funds to pay in cash, clearly implies commercial insolvency at the very least.</p>

It is clear from surviving documents that it was during Mr Abidali’s second visit that serious drafting of the requisite documents began, and I accept Mr Abidali’s evidence that he was first introduced to Mr Alpay during this visit, for a serious discussion about the detail of the scheme.  There is some doubt when Mr Abidali first met Mr Aksu.  In Further Information served on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004 verified by Mr Abidali’s statement of truth, it is said that he was introduced to Mr Aksu “in or about the second week of January 2002”, and the Further Information makes a brave but incredible attempt to portray an arm’s length commercial discussion between Mr Abidali and Mr Aksu (who shared no common language), interpreted by Mr Melih Başkan, under which Mr Abidali discussed using an investment in Aksu Gida as a means of carrying on a Turkish business with the hazelnuts proposed to be transferred to Indo-Med in settlement of the Dahod Investors’ debt.  Since the Further Information suggests that the discussion commenced with Mr Aksu having “the Protocol Agreement dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2001” explained to him, and since it is clear from surviving documents that the Protocol Agreement was not signed and dishonestly backdated until, at the earliest, 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2002, I am satisfied that Mr Abidali’s attempt to portray Latif Aksu as a serious player in the formulation of the Scheme, rather than as a puppet, was a complete fabrication.  The account continues disingenuously to suggest that it was Mr Aksu who identified suitable local lawyers for Indo-Med to instruct, and Mr Aksu who arranged for drafts to be prepared, in Turkish and English, to record the terms of the agreement for Indo-Med’s subscription for a shareholding in Aksu Gida.  I am in no doubt that these steps, like the rest of the Scheme, were masterminded by Mr Alpay and his team, on the Başkans’ instructions.</p>

The reason is that Mr Abidali (probably on advice from Mr Alpay) decided to instruct Mr Trotter to assist Indo-Med in connection with the documentation, and Mr Trotter’s file on the subject opens with a request from Mr Abidali to courier to him in Istanbul a form of authority to enable him to sign documents on Indo-Med’s behalf.  Mr Trotter’s file, with its evidence of the backdating of the main Scheme documents (so clear that the backdating has been admitted) only became available to the Banks when, at their request, Indo-Med’s liquidator waived legal professional privilege.  Until then, Mr Abidali had maintained that the documents had been signed on the dates they bore, for example in affidavit evidence in Turkish court proceedings later in 2002 which I shall describe in due course.  </p>

The objective of creating a new company apparently 80% owned and controlled by Indo-Med, and 20% owned and managed by Latif Aksu, to the exclusion of the Başkans, for the purpose of carrying on Başkan Gida’s former hazelnut business was thereby largely achieved, at least in appearance, leaving only the transfer of the necessary stock in trade, plant, machinery and leasehold possession of the factory and warehouse premises to complete the exercise.

First, the supposed debtor obligations apparently recorded in the November 2001 Protocol Agreement and Promissory Notes were a complete fiction, the truth being that there was something akin to a joint venture between the parties pursuant to which the Dahod Investors through Indo-Med had provided finance for the entire crop season which was months away from being due for repayment.  Secondly, the appearance of creditor pressure reflected in the bankruptcy application and its prompt settlement were the precise reverse of the truth, since the initiative for repayment had come from Başkan Gida’s owners, rather than from Indo-Med.  Thirdly, the appearance that Aksu Gida was to be owned, controlled and managed independently from the Başkans was also a fiction, as will appear from my detailed findings of fact as to what subsequently occurred.  In short, subsequent correspondence between Mr Abidali and the Dahod Investors on the one hand, and the Başkan family on the other hand, clearly demonstrates that, from the moment of the implementation of the Scheme in February 2002, the true understanding between those parties was that the Dahod Investors’ and Indo-Med’s beneficial interest in the hazelnut business thereafter carried on by Aksu Gida (and later by Başkan Yuksel) continued as it had always been to be that of a financial investor with a US$140 per mt profit share, rather than that of an owner, controller or manager.  Furthermore, a wealth of evidence including but by no means limited to correspondence between Mr Abidali and Melih Başkan during 2002, demonstrates that the Başkans remained in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control, and continued to exercise day to day management, of the affairs of Aksu Gida, Başkan Yuksel and the hazelnut export business, notwithstanding the contrary picture presented by the documents, and ineffective attempts by the Başkan family in particular to conceal their continuing involvement.</p>

Following Mr Abidali’s visit to Giresun in mid-January, it was necessary for him and Melih Başkan to discuss the Scheme with Mr Dahod, for which purpose they both went to see him in Boston, breaking their journey in London for a brief meeting and dinner with Mr Trotter.  Face to face discussions with Mr Dahod took place in and near Boston on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, about which he and Mr Abidali gave evidence, broadly to the effect that the Scheme was explained to him in the same way as it had been explained to Mr Abidali, and his approval duly obtained, upon the basis that it appeared to be the best way of protecting his investment in the hazelnut business from the unwelcome consequences of the Başkans’ dispute with Yapi Kredi.  Mr Dahod said that he approved the Scheme without asking to see, or being shown, any documents relating to it.</p>

Nonetheless, since his subsequent email correspondence with Mr Abidali is one of the most important pieces of evidence demonstrating that the Scheme was a sham, and since Mr Werbicki on Mr Abidali’s behalf relied heavily in his submissions upon Mr Dahod’s apparent corroboration of his client’s account of events, it is necessary for me to make such findings of fact as are practicable about the way in which the Scheme was introduced to Mr Dahod.  For this purpose, I have not been significantly assisted by the evidence of either Mr Abidali or Mr Dahod, for the reasons set out in my summaries of their shortcomings as witnesses.

Either Mr Dahod was told of the structure of the Scheme as pretended by the documents which I have described in detail, but assured that in fact the profit sharing partnership with the Başkans was to continue behind a façade which pretended the contrary.  Alternatively he was dealt with on a strict “need to know” basis, and left in the dark as to the pretence to be generated by the Scheme documents, and told only that there was to be a reorganisation of the Başkans’ corporate vehicles with which he need not concern himself, and which would in substance leave the profit sharing partnership, and the continued involvement of the Başkans as owners and controllers of the business, intact.  On balance, I find that the second of those alternatives probably represents the truth.  My reasons follow.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Dahod Investors’ participation in the Başkan family’s hazelnut business had by January 2002 led to an investment in excess of US$12 million, but had generated only two documents associating the Dahod name with that business, namely the email setting out the heads of terms and the short summary presented to the spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community for his approval, which I have labelled the Dahod Agreement, but which was by no means a full description of the terms of the joint venture.  Secondly, the Scheme documents do not mention the Dahod Investors at all.  They remain entirely undisclosed beneficial owners behind the screen of Indo-Med.  Thirdly, although two of the main Scheme documents (namely the Protocol Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement) were in anglicised draft by 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, Mr Trotter appears to have been instructed to send those drafts only to Mr Abidali at his Indo-Med offices in London on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, rather than (as he could easily have done) to Mr Abidali in Boston, for discussion with Mr Dahod.  The clear implication is that Mr Abidali and Melih Başkan decided to keep to themselves the terms of the sham Scheme, and to describe to Mr Dahod only the commercial realities.  Finally, that impression is confirmed by Mr Dahod’s description of the corporate changes which took place early in 2002 as “the major reorganisation of  Başkan” in a discussion paper prepared by him about the first year of the joint venture on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002.  Even as late as July 2003, when Mr Dahod signed a letter of representation requested by Indo-Med’s auditors Chantery Vellacot, he described the Dahod Investors as having funded only the purchase of hazelnuts (during the relevant year of Indo-Med’s account ending in December 2001) and having simply assigned the benefit of those advances to Indo-Med during fiscal year 2002 when “Başkan faced difficulties and were unable to repay the funds”. </p>

After a decline in deliveries in December which, as in 2000, got worse towards the end of the month, deliveries picked up thereafter, amounting in the weeks beginning 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December, 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January to 96mt, 504mt, 504mt, and 744mt respectively.

Like Mr Abidali, Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale both knew that the Facility had by then been implemented, but knew nothing about its amount or detailed terms, beyond that which might be deduced from a careful reading of the Notices and Acknowledgments of Assignment.  Beyond notifying the Ferrero Defendants of the typographical error in the Akbank designated account number, the Banks had done nothing to bring to the attention of any Ferrero company the detailed terms of the Master Assignment, the Master Pledge or Trust Receipt, or the arrangements for storage of hazelnuts in an SGS controlled warehouse.</p>

In their defence the Ferrero Companies originally pleaded that in early 2002 Mr Casale had been orally informed both (i) that somebody’s permission had been needed before hazelnuts could either be processed or taken out of the warehouse and that this had caused a short delay in production at the Giresun factory; and (ii) that part of the temperature controlled warehouse in Giresun was under the control of someone other than Başkan Gida, whose permission was needed in order to release hazelnuts for processing, and could not be accessed.

Mr Casale said that he assumed that Başkan Gida would be unlikely to wish to store hazelnuts destined for Ferrero for any significant length of time, because, once processed and made available for delivery FOT, Başkan Gida could obtain almost immediate payment.</p>

Had it been, he accepted that he would probably have assumed that some third party was exercising security rights in relation to hazelnuts stored there, but not that this necessarily related to hazelnuts later to be exported to Ferrero.  Furthermore, he said, reasonably in my judgment, that he would have assumed that, before any nuts were released, any relevant terms for the release of the security would have been complied with.</p>

Further, the Banks say that since Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet knew about the assignment to the Banks of the Framework Contract and of Başkan Gida’s rights under all outstanding contracts with the Ferrero operating companies, they must have appreciated that a scheme under which outstanding contracts would be performed by Aksu Gida, with payment for deliveries therefore being made to Aksu Gida, would specifically involve a fraud on the Banks.  It is therefore alleged that by agreeing to participate in the Scheme by transferring outstanding orders to Aksu Gida, without first informing the Banks or discussing the proposal with them, Ferrero thereby agreed to participate in those frauds, not least because, without Ferrero’s willing participation, the Scheme could not have proceeded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to obtain Ferrero’s cooperation it seems to me inherently likely that Melih Başkan would have been at pains to emphasise, to the extent consistent with the achievement of the Scheme’s purpose, the extent to which it would ensure ‘business as usual’ in relation to Ferrero’s hazelnut requirements.  Although Mr Casale knew Mr Latif Aksu and Mr Franko as Başkan Gida employees, based respectively in Giresun and Istanbul, Melih Başkan could not reasonably expect Ferrero to feel any real assurance that business would continue as usual unless Başkan family management remained in place, even if behind a screen, so as to avoid giving the obvious impression that Aksu Gida was merely a front for the Başkans.  In particular, I would have expected it to have been obvious to Melih Başkan that if he was to persuade Ferrero that its hazelnut requirements would continue to be sourced from the supply chains established by the Başkan family over many years, it would be necessary to encourage Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet to assume that the Başkans would, behind the scenes, still be using their longstanding relationship with those suppliers to ensure this happened.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, that is the impression which Melih Başkan gave to Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale at the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January meeting.  Their recollection that he spoke of the Başkan family withdrawing temporarily from the hazelnut business while at the same time saying that “we will maintain the same labour force, the same structure and that we will continue as before doing business” hints at, but underplays, a message conveyed by Melih Başkan to the effect that, although the Başkan family would appear outwardly to have withdrawn during the temporary period necessary to deal with Yapi Kredi, they would, in the background, continue to ensure that business with Aksu Gida would, for Ferrero, be business as usual.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider also that, although no doubt Melih Başkan presented the Aksu Gida proposal as one which was, at that stage, a possibility rather than a certainty, he did nonetheless make it plain to Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet that his family wished to obtain a reliable indication of Ferrero’s attitude towards cooperation with the scheme.  Being then uncertain of Ferrero’s attitude, Melih Başkan would not have wished to present the proposal as being definite, lest the family burn its boats with its main customer before discovering that customer’s attitude.  For that purpose, I can well imagine that Melih Başkan portrayed the Yapi Kredi problem as something which might, rather than would, require the family’s apparent withdrawal from the hazelnut business.  Nonetheless, the fact that Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale almost immediately sought Mr Do’s views upon whether Ferrero should cooperate, that Melih Başkan must by early February have received a positive indication to that effect from Ferrero, in order to pass it on to Mr Abidali and that, by 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January the Başkans pressed the starting button by getting Indo-Med to issue the bankruptcy proceedings against Başkan Gida, demonstrates in my judgment that Melih Başkan made it clear to his listeners on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January that he was seeking a positive Ferrero response which, shortly thereafter, he must have obtained.  To the limited extent that Mr Casale’s evidence suggests otherwise, I reject it.</p>

For Melih Başkan there was nothing to be gained by telling Ferrero more about the proposed scheme than it needed to know, and any emphasis upon the planned pretence of an Indo-Med/Aksu ownership of Aksu Gida would detract from the ‘business as usual’ assurance which I have concluded that he both needed to, and did, give.  As practical businessmen, I have no reason to think that Mr Rosa Brunet or Mr Casale would have wanted to pursue questions about the ownership of Aksu Gida, provided that they were reasonably satisfied, as I infer that they were, that the Başkan family would remain in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control throughout.</p>

I must first summarise their own evidence about it, starting with Mr Casale.  In his witness statement he said that nothing in Melih Başkan’s presentation gave the slightest indication that the proposed lease of the factory or transfer of assets or business to Aksu Gida would be anything other than legitimate, that it did not occur to him that Aksu Gida might be a front company for the Başkans, or that the Başkan family would own or control Aksu Gida.  When pressed hard in cross-examination with the proposition that it was obvious from Melih Başkan’s presentation that Aksu Gida was going to be used by the Başkans as a front to defeat the claims of Başkan Gida’s creditors, Mr Casale’s response was to say that it never occurred to him to suspect such behaviour of a company with which Ferrero had worked for ten years, doing business amounting to millions of dollars, without a single dollar being lost.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In cross-examination, Mr Casale’s final position in relation to his understanding whether Aksu was to be independent from the Başkan family was that his impression was that it was, but that he did not know that it was.  Mr Wardell suggested that it was inconceivable that honest managers of Ferrero’s hazelnut business would have agreed to have transferred that business to an independent Aksu Gida without carrying out detailed due diligence, and deciding the matter formally, at board level.  Mr Casale’s response was only that he, Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Do were honest, that they were the decision-makers in relation to that question, and that they did decide to transfer the business to Aksu without due diligence or a board meeting.  Elsewhere, Mr Casale supported the rationality of such an approach by evidence that he knew Mr Aksu (albeit he could not speak to him in any common language) as a Giresun employee and Mr Franko as a manager based in Istanbul and that, bearing in mind that the factory, the equipment and the employees, including the laboratory staff, would all remain the same, this was a sufficient assurance of business as usual to make due diligence unnecessary.  In cross-examination he accepted that all he knew about Latif Aksu was that he was an employee of  Başkan Gida, but not his rank or his job description.  He did not appear to have known what Mr Franko’s job was either.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Throughout his evidence, Mr Casale maintained that he never gave a moment’s thought to the question what effect the Aksu Gida proposal might have upon the Banks as creditors of Başkan Gida.  He said (and I accept) that question was not discussed.  In cross-examination it was put to him that he must have wondered how the proposal would impact upon the Banks’ Facility, which, as he knew, Başkan Gida had only recently obtained.  His answer was that, as at 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, Ferrero was paying invoices in the usual way, and nothing had occurred to suggest that there was any difficulty with the Banks.  He emphasised that Melih Başkan’s account concerned problems with Yapi Kredi, rather than with any other banker to Başkan Gida.  When asked how he thought Aksu Gida was going to provide working capital to fund the purchase of nuts for export to Ferrero he said that he had no idea.  When asked why a supposedly independent Aksu Gida would wish to take on Başkan Gida’s unperformed speculative forward contracts with Ferrero, when the market had if anything risen since early December, his response was only that the delivery periods were from March to June, so that there was plenty of time for the market to fall, and that any entrant to the hazelnut business would think it worth taking on the risk inherent in those contracts in order to obtain Ferrero as a major customer.</p>

He was, in the end, agnostic as to the intended ownership of Aksu Gida, saying that this information had neither been volunteered nor requested, so that he did not know whether Aksu Gida was or was not to be owned by the Başkan family.  He did not share Mr Casale’s recollection of understanding that the Aksu Gida arrangement was intended to be temporary, and his explanation for the absence of due diligence or rigorous questioning was more heavily based upon his perception that what was being described was, at that stage, a mere possibility. </p>

He said that he gave no thought to the question who might be the owners of Aksu Gida, or whether the Başkans might be able to resume ownership or control in due course.  As to the suggestion that the proposal smacked of impropriety, his main point was that, as presented to him, it appeared to be an open and transparent transaction, rather than something carried out in secret, hidden from Başkan Gida’s creditors.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point in my analysis of this issue is that, contrary to Mr Casale’s denial and Mr Rosa Brunet’s agnosticism on the point, they were given to understand by Melih Başkan, and did understand, that during the temporary transfer of the hazelnut business to Aksu Gida, the Başkan family would remain in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control.  I have already described why, in my judgment, it was essential for Melih Başkan to convey that message to Ferrero.  I consider it inconceivable that Ferrero would have agreed to place large orders with Aksu Gida without further questioning or due diligence, if that assurance had not been both given and understood. Nor would the meeting otherwise have generated not a single surviving document within Ferrero. Mr Do said that, from his perspective, uncertainties whether Aksu Gida would deliver the goods could be dealt with on a wait and see basis, since Ferrero paid only after delivery and was therefore exposed to no credit risk, while having stocks sufficient to cover its production needs in the meantime.  While I recognise the theoretical force of that proposition, I am unable to believe that Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale would simply have ventured into the uncharted territory of buying hazelnuts from a brand new company with no track record, controlled and managed only by two barely known employees of Başkan Gida, with the more senior of whom they could not even communicate, without making much more rigorous inquiry, both as to the ability of management to maintain quality standards, and as to the preservation of the supply chain. I reject Mr Rosa Brunet’s explanation for the absence of due diligence, namely that the Scheme was then presented only as a possibility. Although that is how it was presented, no due diligence was later carried out by Ferrero before it became an actuality.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that the proposal presented to and understood by them involved the following elements.  First, its objective was to enable the Başkan family to shield their cherished hazelnut business from attack by a major creditor, namely Yapi Kredi.  For this purpose, it matters not whether they envisaged that Yapi Kredi was a creditor of the Başkan family or (or also) of Başkan Gida itself.  Even if Yapi Kredi was not understood by Ferrero to be a direct creditor of Başkan Gida, its hazelnut business was vulnerable to an attack by Yapi Kredi on the Başkans, since Başkan Gida was itself a major Başkan family asset, available by way of execution of any judgment against the Başkans personally. In fact I very much doubt if any of Messrs Casale, Rosa Brunet or Do gave significant thought to the distinction between debts of the Başkans and debts of Başkan Gida.  As practical businessmen employed by a group for which Başkan Gida presented no credit risk, I would have thought such analysis unlikely.</p>

This was not a proposal which Melih Başkan described as at all likely to be implemented during the short period between the end of one hazelnut export season and the beginning of the next, when nothing would be outstanding for delivery.  Mr Casale’s description of his presentation expressly involved an assumption that there would be outstanding deliveries from Başkan Gida to Ferrero, at the point when the proposal was implemented.</p>

While a decision to take that course after the obtaining of such an advance might be thought to be at worst unkind, a decision to do so followed by the obtaining of further advances, and without informing the Banks of that decision, or seeking their cooperation, would be dishonest.</p>

Apparent alienations of assets while retaining covert control together with a promise that ownership will be restored in due course are as old and familiar as the hills.  Furthermore, it must have been obvious to Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet that Yapi Kredi were not to be informed either that the transfer of the business to Aksu Gida was temporary, or that the Başkan family were to remain in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control.  Indeed, the extent to which Melih Başkan went in blaming Yapi Kredi for all the family’s troubles (including forcing them to borrow the money for the purchase of the biscuit factory in the first place) suggests that Melih Başkan went out of his way to de-sensitise his listeners from any sense of moral disapprobation at the intended deception of Yapi Kredi which the scheme necessarily involved.</p>

In favour of a conclusion that it was apparent to them is the fact that they knew by then that the Facility was up and running, and therefore (if they thought about it) that the Banks were likely to be creditors of Başkan Gida, although they knew nothing of the personal guarantees given by members of the Başkan family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In favour of a negative conclusion to that question are the following considerations.  First, the Başkans had only recently established a new long term relationship with the Banks which Mr Casale knew had taken many months to negotiate, and which was designed to secure finance for the hazelnut business free from the difficulties of using Turkish bank lending. In the absence of any suspicion of premeditated fraud, it would be counter-intuitive to think that the Başkans would almost immediately put that relationship at risk merely because of a difficulty with one of their Turkish banks.  Secondly, neither Ferrero, Mr Rosa Brunet or Mr Casale owed any duty to the Banks, who they may fairly be supposed to have assumed had constructed a sophisticated security structure for their lending, together with a duly careful and diligent system for its monitoring and implementation. In fact, as will appear, they had not, but this cannot have been apparent to Ferrero at the time.  Thirdly, Ferrero and its relevant decision-makers were in principle entitled to consider their own commercial interests when presented with the proposal by businessmen who had proved trustworthy over many years, without worrying themselves about how that proposal might affect other stakeholders in Başkan Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, I have accepted subject to exaggeration Mr Casale’s evidence that Melih Başkan put forward a proposal which might rather than definitely would happen, and that the contingency was explained (untruthfully) by Melih Başkan as based upon the family not yet knowing whether the Scheme would be necessary as part of its strategy for dealing with Yapi Kredi.  In truth the only contingency by then affecting the Başkans was whether or not Ferrero would cooperate with it, but Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale would have had no reason to know that.  Presentation of a proposal as a possibility may reasonably be supposed to dull the sensitivities of the recipients as to its full implications.</p>

Putting assets beyond the reach of creditors by a pretended disposal of them to a third party while facing financial ruin is unlawful in most civilised countries. Although I accept Mr Do’s evidence that he believed that the transaction was transparent, and therefore lawful, in my judgment that resulted from the very brief explanation given of it to him by his colleagues.  It was transparent only in the sense that no-one at Ferrero had any reason to suppose that the lease and asset transfer to Aksu itself would be concealed.  It was covert in the sense that the Başkan family were to remain in control, and because the scheme represented a temporary expedient rather than a permanent transfer.  I do not thereby mean that Mr Rosa Brunet or Mr Casale deliberately misled Mr Do in that respect.  It was simply that the brevity of their explanation to him failed to disclose the subterfuge of which they had been made aware of by Melih Başkan.</p>

Notwithstanding the suggestion in cross-examination to the contrary, it was in my judgment a perfectly rational commercial decision, having regard to three factors.  The first was that Ferrero had sufficient supplies to meet immediate production needs, and believed that there was a plentiful supply of hazelnuts still available on the market if, contrary to expectations, Aksu Gida also defaulted.  The second was the ‘business as usual’ description of the way in which Aksu Gida business would be run, supervised by the Başkans.  The third was that because Ferrero never pre-paid, it would incur no credit risk in ordering outstanding supplies from Aksu Gida.  By contrast with those favourable factors, a refusal to cooperate would merely have meant that if Yapi Kredi’s claims against the Başkans did adversely impact upon Başkan Gida’s ability to deliver on its outstanding orders, Ferrero would then simply  have no ready supplier in place to deliver comparable quantities to a reliable specification.</p>

In cross-examination on a different issue, Mr Casale revealed that he warned his subordinates Mr Altare and Mr Scavino in early  February that a transfer of the business to Aksu Gida might happen and that, if it did, Ferrero would cooperate with it by transferring outstanding orders to Aksu Gida.  His best recollection was that this occurred at the time when Ferrero placed its last three contracts with Başkan Gida, which occurred on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.  It is a fair inference that Mr Casale so informed Melih Başkan at the same time if not earlier, and this precisely accords with Mr Abidali’s email to Mr Dahod on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February recording that Ferrero had received the proposal “very positively”, and that therefore it was “all systems go”.</p>

That application was an official document, with grave consequences for the credit of Başkan Gida if it came into the public domain.  I consider it unlikely that the Başkans would have risked burning the Başkan Gida boat in that way if they had not by that stage been confident of Ferrero’s cooperation in the scheme.  Whether or not by coincidence, that was also the date upon which Melih Başkan asked for the last set of contract renewals between Ferrero and Başkan Gida, to which I now turn.</p>

It may be that the Banks had it well in mind that, with the benefit of hindsight, Başkan Gida’s purpose in seeking to raise further finance on these contracts was not to default upon them, leaving Aksu Gida to perform them free of any assignment, but rather to perform them and defraud the Banks by raising invoices which misdirected Ferrero’s payments otherwise than to the Collection Account.

As I have said, there is no evidence that anyone at Ferrero appreciated that the invoices later to be sent in respect of deliveries by Başkan Gida under these two contracts would direct payment elsewhere than to the Collection Account, and knowledge of an intent to defraud of that kind was not put to Mr Casale.  As for knowledge that the Başkans intended that Başkan Gida should default on these two renewed contracts, that flies largely in the face of the objective facts, since, apart from 120mt, they were fully performed by Başkan Gida, and even that small outstanding amount was delivered very shortly thereafter by Aksu Gida.

They have given rise to similar allegations by the Banks against Ferrero to those made in relation to the Early December Contracts, with which they share the same features, namely being for large tonnages, for delivery during a long forward period, and at prices which, if marked to market on the date they were made, represented a very substantial loss for Başkan Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The immediate background to the Early February Contracts may be summarised as follows.  First, the Başkans had by then committed themselves to the implementation of the Scheme.  The evidence for this consists of the bankruptcy application which they caused Indo-Med to make to the Turkish courts at the end of January, together with the documentary records of a stock-take purportedly made by Aksu Gida of hazelnuts to be transferred by Başkan Gida to Aksu Gida under the Scheme, dated 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January to 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2002.  It is of course possible that the Aksu Gida stock certificates were all dishonestly backdated, like the Scheme documentation itself, but this cannot have been true of the bankruptcy application.  The third piece of evidence to the same effect is Mr Abidali’s email to Mr Dahod telling him on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February that it was “all systems go” for the Scheme.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The background from Ferrero’s perspective was that weekly deliveries continued during the last two weeks in January and the first week in February at an apparently satisfactory and uniform rate of 744mt.  The Ferrero Operating Defendants’ stock positions as at 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2002 were approximately 2,650mt for Ferrero France, 6,724mt for Ferrero Germany and 9,274mt for Ferrero Italy.  This was sufficient to meet those operating companies’ production requirements for most or all of the rest of the 2001 season, but that left scope for at least 6,000mt to be ordered for the provision of a buffer stock for the beginning of the following season.   Existing orders to Başkan Gida by the Ferrero Operating Defendants by the beginning of February amounted to 22,440mt, against which deliveries had been made by 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February in the aggregate of 14,448mt, leaving 7,992mt outstanding.  Little of that was overdue, since the delivery periods for the whole of the Early December Contracts for 6,432mt had not yet passed, and a number of the earlier contracts in respect of which deliveries were outstanding had since been renewed with later delivery dates.  Nonetheless, on the assumption that Başkan Gida continued to deliver at the weekly rates then being achieved, it would take at least ten weeks to complete all outstanding contracts.  By contrast, virtually no deliveries were outstanding from Oltan Gida, and no new contracts had been placed with it since November 2001.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for market prices, the price (converted to Euros) which Başkan Gida would be likely to have to pay in early February for paste kernels to TS3075 before processing to achieve Ferrero’s specifications were actually higher than the prices negotiated for processed hazelnuts for export in the Early February Contracts.  The result was, marked to market as at 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, the prices charged in those contracts to Ferrero would have been insufficient to enable Başkan Gida  even to purchase the hazelnuts necessary to fulfil those orders in the Turkish market, before incurring any processing or export costs.  As for market movement, the Turkish lira price for the hazelnuts which Başkan Gida would need to purchase to fulfil the Early February Contracts had fallen a little since early December (for standard 2 from TL3,550 per mt to TL3,250) while due to exchange rate fluctuations, the Euro price had risen slightly, from 2,746 on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December to 2,872 on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, using the tables derived from Mr Solak’s contemporary notes.  Whether viewed from a Euro or Turkish lira perspective, the fall in the market which both Melih Başkan and Mr Casale expected to occur in 2002 had yet to materialise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Ferrero witnesses’ evidence about the making of the Early February Contracts was as follows.  Mr Casale said that, as in December, he had been approached by Melih Başkan with an offer to make large supplies over long delivery periods, at prices which, while favourable at current market rates and within Ferrero’s budget, reflected their common expectation that an excess of supply over demand would soon cause prices to fall.  Mr Casale said that he asked Melih Başkan whether negotiations with Yapi Kredi were such as to make it at all likely that Başkan Gida would be able to deliver the amounts proposed, and was told that, at that stage, negotiations were still proceeding, so that it remained uncertain whether the Başkans would need to implement the scheme described at the meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, but that if they did, Aksu Gida would be able to make the proposed deliveries in place of Başkan Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Casale then discussed the proposed terms with Mr Rosa Brunet, and they briefly discussed the matter with Mr Do.  The view was taken that orders should be placed as Melih Başkan had suggested, for the following reasons.  First, building further stocks accorded with Ferrero Industrial’s policy to build up buffer stocks for use early in the following season.  Secondly, the prices offered were both within budget and fair having regard to the parties’ expectations of the market.  Thirdly, regardless whether Başkan Gida was replaced by Aksu Gida, placing substantial orders would help preserve the supply chains, whether accessed by Başkan Gida or by Aksu Gida, upon which Ferrero depended for the obtaining of the highest quality hazelnuts.  It was not Ferrero’s understanding that the placing or withholding of the Early February Orders would make a difference to whether the Scheme had to be implemented or not.  Their understanding was that this depended entirely on the progress of the negotiations between the Başkans and Yapi Kredi.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In support of the Banks’ case that the Early February Contracts were not genuine (i.e. that Ferrero had no need for, or intention to take delivery under them) the Ferrero witnesses were pressed in cross-examination with the undoubted fact that the delivery periods agreed under these orders were even more clearly outside the ambit of the Soremartec Golden Rules than had been the periods agreed in the Early December Contracts.  Again, the replies, which I broadly accept, were that these rules were favoured as much as in the breach as in the observance, as had occurred in the previous year, in particular in relation to the FKB Contracts. Furthermore, the Ferrero Italy purchase order for the subject matter of Contract 5105 was signed by Mr Fontana, head of Quality Control for Ferrero Italy, and it states the delivery period in clear terms. In fact, it appears that the later conversion of contract 5105 into an a livrer contract for the following season did take place under pressure from Soremartec or from quality control at Ferrero Italy, when it was re-made with Başkan Yuksel in early May.  In the meantime, Ferrero did take delivery of the bulk of the subject matter of contract 5103 (only 192mt being outstanding by 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July), and of slightly more than one third of the amount ordered under contract 5104.  Furthermore, Ferrero continued to place orders with other suppliers in every month between February and July inclusive 2002, including, in particular, a 1,200mt order on Oltan Gida in June.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in response to cross-examination based upon the very low prices reflected in the Early February Contracts (if marked to market as at that date), Mr Casale pointed to the fact that within the delivery periods specified, the market did fall substantially.  Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Do said that, from their position of relative detachment compared to that of Mr Casale, they had no recollection of appreciating that the prices negotiated between Mr Casale and Melih Başkan for the Early February Contracts were particularly low.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two features stand out in relation to the negotiation of the Early February Contracts, which call for special attention.  The first is that, when it is borne in mind that over 5,500mt of the subject matter of the Early December Contracts remained outstanding by early February, and that the market had yet to begin to fall significantly, the addition of a further combined tonnage of almost 6,000 in early February at similarly low prices increased Başkan Gida’s uncovered short speculation with Ferrero to a tonnage in excess of 11,000, a truly remarkable level for a business for which, as Ferrero by then knew, faced possibly terminal difficulties due to the dispute with Yapi Kredi.  As Mr Haas-Rickertsen was constrained to accept in cross-examination, the February orders really did represent the last desperate throw of the dice by the Başkans, and this must in my judgment have been apparent to Mr Casale, even if not to his more detached superiors.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second feature is that the combination of deliveries outstanding by early February with the aggregate of the Early February Contracts constituted an order book for Başkan Gida and/or Aksu Gida in excess of 12,000mt, which it would be likely, on the track record thus far achieved in that season, to take the whole of the rest of the 2001 season to perform.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The following factors, relevant to the genuineness or commerciality of the Early February Contracts, emerge from that analysis.  The first is that, from the Başkans’ perspective, it made eminent commercial sense to seek to tie in Ferrero as a principal customer for Aksu Gida in the first months of its trading and, which is the other side of the same coin, for the Başkans to seek to avoid driving Ferrero into the arms of competitors during the necessarily vulnerable early part of Aksu’s life.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that the Başkans no doubt appreciated that there was a price to pay for obtaining that tie, namely a significant reduction in price for future deliveries from the current market price, all the more so when dealing with a counterparty with the same market view, namely that it was likely to fall.  Thirdly, and most importantly, that commercial analysis would only have made sense to either of the negotiators, on the basis of a common assumption that the Başkans with their particular market view and large appetite for short speculation, were to be in control of Aksu Gida and, in all probability, the ultimate beneficial owners of it.  I cannot conceive that Mr Casale would have thought that any wholly independent newcomer to the hazelnut export business would have been prepared to take on an 11,000mt short speculation against the market as the dominating aspect of the first four months of its trading activity.  The only explanation for the apparent indifference of Mr Casale and his superiors to the question whether Başkan Gida or Aksu Gida would perform these large contracts is that they regarded both companies to be emanations of  the same controlling mind and will, namely the senior members of the Başkan family.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">None of those considerations lead to the conclusion that the Early February Contracts were not genuine, or that they are inexplicable as the product of a commercial negotiation.  On the contrary, it is readily understandable why Ferrero should have been prepared not merely to have been tied in to taking on a new company as its principal supplier, but to have positively supported an arrangement under which a connected successor to Başkan Gida would start business with a full order book with which to soak up the stream of hazelnuts likely to come from the Başkan’s established supply chain, so as to preserve that chain for the future as the best source of high quality Turkish hazelnuts then known to be available.  In fact, the preservation of the supply chain which had until then provided Ferrero with the best quality supplies came across in the oral evidence time and time again as Ferrero’s principal motive for behaviour which, from time to time, otherwise appears to be difficult to explain. Ferrero also had an established policy to avoid becoming over- dependant upon any single supplier.  The threat to Başkan Gida’s survival made support for Aksu Gida as its successor an obvious way of avoiding over- dependence on Oltan Gida, which was the only competing Turkish supplier with which Ferrero wanted to do large scale business at the time.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The more difficult question is whether that motive was a sufficient stimulus to lead Ferrero into knowing participation in a dishonest and unlawful design against the Banks, whereby the Başkans sought to achieve their own objective of remaining the principal hazelnut exporters in Turkey by using hazelnuts purchased with the Banks’ money as Aksu Gida’s initial working capital.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The effect of Ferrero placing purchase orders and/or signing contracts for almost 6,000mt of hazelnuts in early February was in fact to put into the Başkans’ hands documents which, to the Banks or to any other third party, appeared to recognise a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> intention on  Başkan Gida’s part to supply, and on Ferrero’s part to pay Başkan Gida for, a quantity of goods justifying the advance of many millions of Euros by way of working capital finance, spread over several months.  Yet Mr Casale, Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Do all knew that the Başkans did not regard Başkan Gida as having <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> undertaken any such commitment, since the plan presented on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, if it took place, necessarily involved a large scale default by Başkan Gida.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The knowledge, shared by Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet, that the Scheme probably involved an element of deception of Yapi Kredi certainly ought to have generated in their minds the question whether the planned large scale default by Başkan Gida in complying with the Early February Contracts was to be shared with the Banks, if and when those contracts or the purchase orders which accompanied them were used for the raising of finance.  Neither Mr Casale nor Mr Rosa Brunet suggested that they asked this question, either of the Başkans or of the Banks.  On the contrary, their evidence was that the question simply never occurred to them.  Mr Casale in particular said that he gave little thought to the extent to which Başkan Gida really needed working capital funding for its business with Ferrero, because of Ferrero’s readiness to pay in full on delivery.</p>

They did at least suspect that the Banks might be no more made privy to the Başkans’ plans than would Yapi Kredi, if for no other reason than by doing so, the Başkans would risk Yapi Kredi learning on the banking grapevine that they were to be in control of Aksu Gida.</p>

I think it most unlikely that they believed that the Başkans would use the Early February Contracts or, for that matter, the late January renewals in the specifically fraudulent way which they actually did.  I have described how the late January renewals were used. As for the Early February Contracts, the Banks used contract 5104 as the basis for the final utilisation request, leading to the issue of a letter of credit in the sum of €7.244 million, but in the event only drew down €1.992 million under it, by means of pro-forma invoices which pretended, contrary to the truth, that Başkan Gida rather than Aksu Gida was to make deliveries under that contract.  By that time, namely 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, Başkan Gida had already handed over the further conduct of the export business with Ferrero to Aksu Gida.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The main reason why I doubt whether anyone at Ferrero believed or even specifically suspected that such a use was to be made of the late January and Early February Contracts was because of the obvious risk to which that conduct would expose Ferrero, in terms of having to pay twice for the same goods.  There is no evidence whatever that either Mr Rosa Brunet or Mr Casale had any corrupt motive for exposing Ferrero to risk, let alone to liability, while assisting the Başkans.  On the contrary, when at the beginning of March the possibility that Ferrero might be so exposed first came to Mr Casale’s attention, in circumstances which I shall describe, I consider that it came to him as a complete surprise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that Başkan Gida’s first utilisation request on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2001 had been based upon Contracts 5094 to 5097, and its first draw-down, made on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2002, was supported by Contracts 5094, 5096 and 5097.  By the time that Başkan Gida became liable to make repayment of that first draw-down in early February, it had already invoiced Ferrero Italy under Contracts 5096 and 5097, directing it to pay not to the Collection Account, but to separate Başkan Gida accounts, while at the same time sending false copy invoices to the Banks purporting to direct payment to the Collection Account.  The Banks therefore expected to receive payments from Ferrero Italy at the rate of €2,555 and €2,556 per mt (being the prices agreed under Contracts 5096 and 5097 respectively).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to avoid sending warning signs to the Banks of its invoicing fraud, it was therefore necessary for the Başkans to arrange for an income stream to be paid from Ferrero Italy to the Collection Account, in respect of other deliveries.  Başkan Gida was at this time making deliveries under Contract 5093.  This had been used as the basis of its second utilisation request on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2002, and draw-downs starting on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, but the 45 day period for repayment in relation to those was not yet imminent.  The difficulty for Başkan Gida was that the price under Contract 5093 was €2,739 per mt, so that a direction to Ferrero Italy to pay amounts falling due under those invoices would generate the wrong income stream, and thereby put the Banks on enquiry that something might be amiss.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Başkans resolved this difficulty by use of what have come to be known as the split invoices.  In relation to each 24 mt delivery to Ferrero Italy, Başkan Gida sent two invoices.  The first, priced at €2,555 per mt (when simulating Contract 5096) contained the prescribed endorsement directing Ferrero Italy to pay to the Collection Account at KBC for Euros.  The second, priced at €184 per mt, directed payment to Başkan Gida’s account at Garanti Bankasi in Turkey.  In relation to each delivery, both invoices identified the same contract number (5093) and the same batch number, but used different invoice dates.  The aggregate of the two invoices precisely matched the price payable under Contract 5093, of €2,739.  A similar split was engineered so as to create the impression of payments under Contract 5097 (namely €2,556 per mt).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider it inconceivable that the junior staff in Ferrero Industrial’s office who first reviewed these six pairs of split invoices would have failed to notice that, in relation to each pair, most unusually Başkan Gida was sending two different invoices for the same 24 mt batch, the effect of which was to request Ferrero Italy to pay more than 90% of the price for each batch to one bank and less than 10% of the price to another.  The relevant employee (whose identity cannot now be ascertained) would have ascertained that the batch to which each pair of invoices related had both been ordered and delivered.  Each invoice identified the original Ferrero Italy purchase order (number 1121188), and Ferrero Industrial had readily available means of knowing that delivery had by then been made FOT at Giresun.  Since the aggregate claimed under each pair of invoices was the correct price for that batch, I think it probable that the relevant employee would simply have included all six pairs in a larger group of invoices and other documents for Mr Rosa Brunet’s signature, on the assumption that, for reasons which he neither knew nor thought it necessary to ascertain, Başkan Gida wished to split the payments to be received from Ferrero in relation to those deliveries between different bank accounts.  Had Mr Casale been in the office, rather than (as he was in fact) in Bulgaria, I would have expected the relevant employee to have mentioned the pairs of split invoices to him as something unusual, but consider it probable that he thought it insufficiently important to trouble Mr Casale about while he was away, or, still less, to bring them to the attention of the more senior Mr Rosa Brunet.  I would not expect him to have studied or understood the small print on the prescribed endorsement, which described Başkan Gida as having:</p>

I think it highly unlikely that the relevant employee would have taken the trouble to check back against earlier invoices and earlier orders, so as to discover that the €2,555 per mt payable under the larger of the invoices in each pair precisely reflected a price payable (but already paid)  in respect of a different purchase order.</p>

Again, they would have appeared unusual, and accounts would no doubt have satisfied themselves that the aggregate amount demanded under each pair represented the full extent of Ferrero’s liability for payment.  By then, the invoices were signed off by Mr Rosa Brunet, and I consider that this would have been sufficient comfort for the staff in accounts for them to pass the invoices on to treasury for payment, without further inquiry.</p>

While adverse inferences may be drawn from the failure of a party to call an apparently available witness, the presentation of these pairs of split invoices to members of Ferrero’s staff who had, at that stage, no reason to be suspicious of the Başkans’ integrity does not in my judgment give rise to any sufficient <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> case to justify the drawing of an adverse inference in this context. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The highest that the case can be put against Ferrero staff other than Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale is that the small print in the English language form of prescribed endorsement on the larger of each of the pairs of invoices does not, if thought about, lie easily with a splitting between different banks of the amount payable for a single delivery under the same contract.  But again, I consider it unlikely that this foreign small print would have been studied closely by relatively junior accounts staff.  Even if it had, the most suspicious imaginable person would have thought only that the Başkans were for some unexplained reason directing payment of less than 10% of the invoice to a prima facie inappropriate recipient.  This is hardly the stuff of fraud, and the fact that these invoices were promptly paid strongly suggests that no alarm bells rang in Ferrero to the effect that, <span style="font-style:italic">quoad</span> that small percentage, Ferrero might thereby have exposed itself to a risk of having to pay twice.  It is only the possession of a very large quantity of hindsight that reveals the true dishonest purpose behind the splitting of the invoices.</p>

Since the relevant page had already been signed by Mr Casale, and since no executive decision was being sought from Mr Rosa Brunet, I think it probable that he treated the addition of his signature as nothing more than an administrative formality, in relation to a clause which Mr Casale had already approved, forming part of a contract to which he had, on Mr Casale’s advice, already decided to commit Ferrero four months previously.  I think it unlikely that he gave any detailed consideration to the precise terms of clause 6.2, or, in particular, to the extract quoted above upon which both he and Mr Casale thought it useful to place emphasis in their evidence.</p>

He had been given a day’s warning of the Başkans’ request that he sign the relevant page of the Framework Contract, by telephone on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.  He had also had the relevant page emailed to him direct by Başkan Gida before receiving the faxed page which he actually signed, so that he had time to consider, in his usual careful way, whether he should sign it on behalf of Ferrero Industrial.  Since he was away on business unrelated to hazelnuts on both days, I consider it probable that he signed the relevant page before being told of the receipt in Italy of the Transfer Letters.  I reach this conclusion, on balance, because the clear impression which I derive from the whole of the evidence (oral and written) about the Transfer Letters is that no-one at Ferrero Industrial appears either to have been surprised by their arrival, or to have thought that they called for any executive decision by Mr Casale or anyone else in authority.  The decision to go along with the transfer to Aksu had already been made, albeit on a contingent basis, prior to 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, so that all that was done by Ferrero Industrial when the copies of the Transfer Letters were received was to forward them on to the relevant operating companies, and this was done by Mr Altare.</p>

In my judgment it is probable that Mr Altare informed Mr Rosa Brunet as soon as they arrived.  The evidence was that their offices were near to each other, and that Mr Rosa Brunet’s door was always open.  </p>

For Mr Rosa Brunet the signature of the relevant page was simply too much of an administrative detail to ring the necessary alarm bells.

The Framework Contract purported to set out the trading relationship between Ferrero and Başkan Gida as at the date of its signature, 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2001.  In one respect, namely the incomplete nature of clause 6.2, it did not do so.  By February 2002 the Banks knew, first, that Ferrero had been asked but refused to promise not to vary that trading relationship without the Banks’ consent and that, in November 2001, the 45 day period for payment had represented a major change in the nature of the relationship described in the Framework Contract.  While therefore the Banks were to a limited extent entitled (as they did) to take some comfort from the Ferrero signature against clause 6.2 that Ferrero was still playing its part in the structure of the Facility, the signature of the relevant page went no further than that.  Clause 6.2 expressly entitled Ferrero to pay amounts to such accounts as Başkan Gida should from time to time direct, and this is exactly what, during the following week, Ferrero continued to do. </p>

Although both Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale described such a transfer as still only a “possibility” by that date, in my judgment they both regarded it as a probability, and their uncertainty about it at that stage mainly related to the likely date upon which it would be implemented.  It also suggests that Mr Rosa Brunet and Mr Casale did indeed regard the transfer as amounting to no significant interruption with business as usual with the Başkans, as the persons who Ferrero thought controlled Aksu Gida, and the conduct of the hazelnut business following the transfer.</p>

She expressed the letter as if coming from Mr Bolowich, and copied it to Mr Casale.  Later, on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February Mr Bolowich himself sent a manuscript fax message to Mr Melih Başkan headed “Aksu Gida – invoices”, asking him to use the new order numbers and not the old Başkan numbers.</p>

In cross-examination, after being shown his secretary’s letter and his own manuscript fax message, (by the first of which he expressed himself to be considerably surprised), he eventually agreed with Mr Wardell that Mr Casale must have instructed him to communicate with Melih Başkan about matters concerning Aksu Gida.  In re-examination he said that he could not actually recall such a conversation, but this did not undermine the force of his assumption that he must have been told by Mr Casale to contact Melih Başkan.</p>

In that respect I prefer Mr Bolowich’s evidence, although I accept that there later came a time when, at the Başkans’ request, Mr Casale arranged for routine written communications concerning Aksu Gida to be made to Mr Franko, as part of the Başkans’ scheme to appear to withdraw from the hazelnut business while, in reality, remaining in control of it.  In the same way, Mrs Pay’s evidence was that the Başkans no longer frequented the Giresun factory and office complex after the transfer to Aksu, but continued to act as her supervising managers thereafter, over the telephone. </p>

Bearing in mind that Ferrero was in the process of cooperating with that transfer, it seems to me inconceivable that anything other than the most careful attention to incoming invoices, whether from Başkan Gida or Aksu Gida, was given by someone at Ferrero Industrial and/or Ferrero Italy, if for no other reason than to avoid payment being made to the wrong company.  The need for care was reinforced by Ferrero Industrial’s and Ferrero Italy’s receipt of a fax from Başkan Gida on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February correcting its earlier statement of the amounts outstanding under existing contracts with Ferrero Italy, and providing a schedule of deliveries which, notwithstanding the Transfer Letter, Başkan Gida intended still to make under two specified Ferrero Italy purchase orders, corresponding with Contracts 5093 and 5094.

Mr Wardell submitted that Mr Casale would have connected the amounts payable under the invoices directing payment to the designated account at KBC with the amount payable under Contracts 5096 and 5097, and thereby appreciated that the Başkans were seeking to create an income stream masquerading as a series of payments under those contracts, on the basis that information about the amount payable per delivery under each contract would be something which the diligent Mr Casale would carry round in his head.  Alternatively he submitted that split invoices were so unusual, whether coming from Başkan Gida or any supplier, that Mr Casale would have carried out the relevant research of the office files necessary to make that connection, or alternatively studied the English small print in the prescribed endorsement on the invoices directing payment to KBC, so as to appreciate that Başkan Gida could not properly direct payment of only part of the purchase price to the Banks.  Thus he would have discovered that the Başkans were engaged in an invoicing fraud against the Banks, having ascertained that invoices delivered to Ferrero Industrial under Contracts 5096 and 5097 had directed payment not to the Banks, but to a different Başkan Gida account.  It followed, submitted Mr Wardell, that Mr Casale lied when professing an inability to recall this event in February 2002.</p>

In particular it draws upon Mr Casale’s undoubted thoroughness and attention to detail, in a context where such attention was called for by the circumstances of the transfer to Aksu Gida then taking place.  Nonetheless, I have not in the end been persuaded by it, for two main reasons.  The first is that it is critically informed by hindsight, and by knowledge of the way in which, behind the scenes, the Başkans were in fact defrauding the Banks by the use of false copy invoices.  The second is that if carried to its logical conclusion, any understanding by Mr Casale that the Başkans were in the process of perpetrating an invoicing fraud on the Banks, such that money which Ferrero should have been paying to the Collection Accounts was being mis-directed into the Başkans’ pocket must have led Mr Casale to have appreciate that Ferrero itself was a potential victim of that fraud, by reason of its exposure to a liability to pay twice, if and so far as it wrongly paid the Başkans.</p>

The gist of his evidence was that the first occasion upon which the split invoices came to his attention was when the Banks’ claims that they had been underpaid by Ferrero came to be investigated internally within Ferrero, in late May or June 2002.  He said that, in February, not only did he not suspect that the Başkans were using the split invoices to deceive the Banks, but that he did not notice, or have drawn to his attention, the fact that split invoices were being used at all.  I have rejected the second part of that evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">While Mr Casale was, to that extent, wrong in his evidence, I am not persuaded that he was lying.  My conclusion is that, having appreciated or having had drawn to his attention the splitting of the invoices for ten, or all sixteen, of the deliveries under Contract 5093, he simply gave no sufficient thought to the reason why Başkan Gida might have done it to have alerted himself to possible wrongdoing on their part and, their reasoning being none of his business, gave no further thought to it, and forgot about it, until the invoices were investigated in the context of the Banks’ claims later in 2002.  Having thus forgotten about them, it is easy to understand why when giving evidence, the absence of any recollection of having noticed them at the time led him to the wrong assumption that the split invoices did not come to his attention at that time.  Absent a serious suspicion that the Başkans were up to no good, the episode during which he signed those invoices cannot have taken more than a minute or two, during a busy day primarily directed to more important matters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is instructive to pause in this narrative of very detailed facts to consider the respective positions of the parties to this dispute during the second half of February 2002, after the transfer of the hazelnut business to Aksu Gida and the notification of that transfer to Ferrero.  Beginning with the position on the ground in Turkey, it was for the most part business as usual.  Başkan Gida had, prior to the transfer, been delivering to Ferrero at a rate of roughly 500mt a week from Giresun and its other factories.  By the end of February, Aksu Gida deliveries amounted to 624mt out of total of just under 2,000mt delivered by Başkan Gida and Aksu Gida together, and in March the total of just over 2,000mt was entirely delivered by Aksu Gida.  The workforce and middle management remained the same, and Aksu Gida even continued to use the name Başkan as part of its business logo.  The Başkans continued behind the scenes to run the business albeit, as described by Mrs Pay, on the telephone rather than by attending at the premises.  She said that, during the period when the hazelnut business was being conducted in Aksu Gida’s name, her supervisor was Fuat Başkan.</p>

During late February it was Mr Altare’s turn to be Ferrero’s representative in Turkey.  It is impossible to be sure how he divided his time between the Giresun factory and other plants in Turkey supplying hazelnuts to Ferrero, but likely that he spent between two and eight days in Giresun during late February.</p>

The Banks thought that it was truly business as usual, in all respects in accordance with the terms of the Facility.  That is not to say that there were not what appeared to the Banks to be glitches, such as Başkan Gida’s delay in obtaining Ferrero’s signature to the completed clause 6.2 of the Framework Contract, and the failure of any Ferrero company other than Ferrero France to acknowledge receipt of the same correction to the Acknowledgements of Assignment.  </p>

The Banks had received purported copy invoices containing the prescribed endorsement requiring payment to the Collection Account by Ferrero, but of course Ferrero had received no such instruction in the invoices actually sent.  Akbank’s notification reached the Banks on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February and, rather than embarrass their customer Başkan Gida by raising the matter directly with Ferrero, the Banks decided to seek an explanation from the Başkans first.  By 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February the Başkans had, both directly and through PRI persuaded the Banks that the apparent misdirection of the payments was entirely the result of an administrative error by Ferrero, which would not occur again, and the payments were transferred at the Başkans’ request to the Collection Account on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.

Clause 27.1(a) of the Facility Agreement required this to be in place by the end of January 2002.  But needless to say, the Başkans took no steps at all to establish such a facility with Yapi Kredi, with which they were by then in nearly terminal dispute, but managed to persuade the Banks throughout January and February that it was the subject matter of active negotiations, and would be put in place by the end of February, if the Banks were prepared (as they were) to provide the necessary extension of time.</p>

This last draw down was based upon Contract 5104, and supported by false copy invoices suggesting that Başkan Gida was to invoice Ferrero Germany and direct payment to the Collection Account.  Contract 5104 was one of the three Early February forward contracts, in respect of which the Başkans had never intended that any deliveries would be made by Başkan Gida.  On the contrary, they formed the bulk of Aksu Gida’s intended order book for the residue of the 2001 season.  By the time of the final draw-down on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, almost a fortnight had passed since the sending of the Transfer Letters, and the Ferrero Operating Defendants had all sent new orders for the entirety of the tonnage the subject matter of the early February forward contracts, to Aksu Gida.</p>

In respect of all the tonnage released, Başkan Gida was obliged to and did sign trust receipts promising to use the released hazelnuts for no purpose other than supply to Ferrero.  While there are unfathomable difficulties in identifying precisely what the Başkans did with the released hazelnuts, Başkan Gida delivered only 408mt to Ferrero during its final week of deliveries beginning 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.  Bearing in mind that those nuts needed processing prior to delivery to Ferrero, it seems very unlikely that anything more than a very small proportion of the nuts released from Warehouse 2 during that week can have been delivered in accordance with the trust receipts, or that the Başkans had any intention that they should be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That brief description illustrates the simultaneous perpetration by the Başkans of every element of their fraud on the Banks.  The invoice fraud enabled them to direct payment to Başkan Gida of money which they pretended to the Banks they had directed to be paid by Ferrero to the Collection Account.  The trust receipt fraud enabled the Başkans in effect to steal nuts pledged to the Banks by false promises to deliver them to Ferrero.  The Başkans were fraudulently trading through Başkan Gida by borrowing money from the Banks which they had no intention that Başkan Gida should ever repay.  At the same time the Başkans were putting the finishing touches to the Scheme for the transfer of Başkan Gida’s assets, and in particular its stocks of hazelnuts, to the front company Aksu Gida.  It will be recalled that the Protocol and Share Transfer Agreements with Indo-Med were not signed, at the earliest, until 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, even though Ferrero had been sent the Transfer Letters six days previously.</p>

For that purpose it is convenient to look at the period in late February 2002, just prior to the Banks’ discovery of the fraud, and for me to make findings as to what Ferrero and Mr Abidali knew by then, in relation to each of the elements of the fraud which I have described.</p>

His case was that through Indo-Med, he and Mr Dahod obtained payment of US$10 million of Başkan Gida’s debt under the Dahod Agreement, by means of a lawful scheme, advised and approved by Turkish and English lawyers whereby Indo-Med obtained 80% of the shares of Aksu Gida, and Aksu obtained US$10 million worth of assets, mainly hazelnuts, from Başkan Gida by means of arm’s length transactions at proper value, leaving Başkan Gida both able and free to pay its remaining debts to its other creditors out of assets not forming part of that sale.</p>

That this is so is unmistakably apparent from correspondence, in particular between Mr Abidali and Mr Dahod, and between Mr Abidali and Melih Başkan later in 2002, which I have yet to describe in detail, all of which was belatedly disclosed in these proceedings by Indo-Med’s liquidator.  The fact that the Başkans and Mr Abidali succeeded in deceiving the Turkish courts into believing that the Scheme had the reality portrayed by the backdated documents in no way dissuades me from that conclusion.  It merely demonstrates the dedication with which the Başkans and Mr Abidali participated as conspirators, with partial success, in the fraudulent use of Aksu Gida as a front company.</p>

On his own admission, the Scheme was introduced to Mr Abidali by the Başkans as one designed to achieve payment of Başkan Gida’s debts to its smaller creditors, of which Indo-Med was described as the largest.  Mr Abidali knew from the beginning of 2002 that Başkan Gida had obtained a large trade finance facility from the Banks and, although there is no evidence that he knew the amount of the indebtedness of Başkan Gida to the Banks thereby created from time to time, I am satisfied that he believed that the Banks were, like Yapi Kredi, among those larger creditors of Başkan Gida who would suffer by the implementation of the Scheme.  I reject as a lie Mr Abidali’s evidence that he believed that Başkan Gida retained sufficient assets to pay its larger creditors after the asset transfer to Aksu Gida.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that Mr Abidali well understood that, save for the land on which its various factories and warehouses were situated (and which he knew was charged to Yapi Kredi or other Turkish banks) Başkan Gida retained no significant assets with which to pay back its borrowings from the Banks.</p>

Mr Abidali can have been in no doubt from the way in which he described the transaction as having been introduced to him by the Başkans that Başkan Gida was insolvent, so that the transaction was, on any view, what used in England to be called a fraudulent preference (now a wrongful preference). Whether that preference of itself involved unlawful means is a matter to which I shall return, but Mr Werbicki sensibly accepted that if the sham documents were designed to give a false appearance to the Scheme which (if believed by third parties) would disguise the preference and thereby shelter the assets transferred from recovery in the event of Başkan Gida’s liquidation, that would involve unlawful means.  The false appearance of creditor pressure created by the combination of the Protocol Agreement, Promissory Notes and the bankruptcy proceedings can have had no purpose other than the sheltering of the assets transferred from recovery under Turkish insolvency law as, in substance although not in form, a preference.</p>

While I accept that Mr Zenginpeduk probably did take his detailed instructions from Mr Alpay or some other representative of the Başkan family, I reject the substance of that submission. The Second Protocol Agreement, which Mr Abidali signed (after Mr Trotter’s anglicisation in September 2002) makes repeated express references to Indo-Med having instituted bankruptcy proceedings against Başkan Gida, and purports to be a settlement of that claim.  Mr Abidali therefore knew of every element in, and the falsity of, the appearance of creditor pressure which lay at the heart of the Scheme. I have no reason to suppose that the legal reason for the creation of that false impression was explained to him. He knew only that the falsity involved was part of a structure designed to protect the assets transferred from the claims of Başkan Gida’s major creditors.</p>

Aksu Gida had no financial resources of which Mr Abidali was aware with which to purchase hazelnuts, and the evidence discloses no discussion between him, the Başkans and Mr Dahod about the obtaining of trade finance or other borrowings.

He said that he had no knowledge of the provisions in the Banks’ Facility relating to Warehouse 2, the lien or the trust receipt in relation to the hazelnuts to be purchased with the Banks’ money, and learned nothing to put him even on suspicion that the Başkans were planning dishonestly to use the Banks’ money and the Banks’ hazelnuts as the means of providing Aksu Gida with the wherewithal to start, and continue, its business.  Mr Abidali also maintained a vigorous case, albeit without recourse to forensic expert witnesses, which he said were beyond his financial resources, to the effect that the nuts actually transferred by Başkan Gida to Aksu Gida were not of a quality sufficient for use in the Ferrero business, and had not in fact come from Warehouse 2.  </p>

My reasons are as follows.  First, Mr Abidali knew by the beginning of January that Başkan Gida had obtained a major trade finance facility from the Banks.  Secondly, although I accept that he may not have known whether the Facility was to be used to fund Ferrero business, or alternatively Başkan Gida’s other business, and may have been unaware of the amounts and dates of relevant draw-downs, he knew that Başkan Gida was to continue to trade actively until the moment of transfer of the hazelnut business to Aksu Gida.  He knew more than enough about the realities of trade finance to appreciate that such trading involved the making of periodic draw-downs of working capital from any banks providing trade finance.</p>

Fifthly, and by contrast with the way in which the Scheme was presented to Ferrero on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, nothing in the manner in its presentation to Mr Abidali involved the suggestion that it was merely a contingency plan, against the possibility that negotiations with Yapi Kredi might not work out, nor was the debt being claimed by Yapi Kredi explained to Mr Abidali, according to his evidence, as one owed by the family rather than by Başkan Gida.  It follows that the presentation of the scheme to Mr Abidali necessarily involved a mutual understanding between him and the Başkans that Başkan Gida was by early January 2002 already insolvent.  </p>

It follows that, far from there having been any perception of light at the end of the tunnel, following which Başkan Gida might have paid its debts to its main creditors in full, Mr Abidali knew that the Başkans were, from mid-January at the latest, continuing to incur credit for the ongoing business of Başkan Gida with no honest intention that the creditors with whom such credit was being incurred would be paid in full, and this must have remained his understanding until the completion of the Scheme actually led to Başkan Gida ceasing to trade, in late February.</p>

No case that he knew that the nuts transferred actually belonged beneficially to the Banks was even put squarely to Mr Abidali in cross- examination, although it was put that he helped the Başkans with the timing of the draw-downs and transfer of nuts to Aksu Gida.  That was in my judgment a sufficient putting of a case that the nuts transferred had been acquired by Baskan Gida with the use of the Banks’ money.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The strongest argument in favour of Mr Abidali was that, having with Mr Dahod contributed in excess of US$13 million to enable Başkan Gida to buy nuts for its Ferrero business, he may reasonably have assumed that the nuts being transferred to Aksu Gida had been purchased with the use of Mr Dahod’s revolving loan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are however a number of difficulties with that argument.  The first is that, as Mr Abidali admitted in cross-examination that he knew at the time, the Dahod Investment monies were paid by Indo-Med into Başkan Gida’s general account, rather than being segregated for Ferrero business.  I was not persuaded by Mr Abidali’s assertion in cross-examination that he nonetheless trusted and believed that the Başkans were restricting the use of the money for that purpose.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Abidali stoutly maintained, albeit with the benefit of hindsight rather than on the basis of information known to him at the time, that the nuts transferred to Aksu Gida were not suitable, in terms of quality and specification, for Ferrero business, basing himself on the inspection and testing certificates signed by the Giresun quality control staff at or about the time of the transfer.  I consider that in fact a substantial part of the nuts transferred to Aksu Gida were then processed and sold to Ferrero, but it hardly assists Mr Abidali’s case that he assumed that the nuts transferred had been purchased with Mr Dahod’s money for him to assert that they were unsuitable for Ferrero business.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Mr Abidali must have believed that a significant part of the nuts transferred to Aksu Gida had been purchased with the Banks’ money, although he neither inquired nor knew precisely what proportion of the nuts were so attributable.  My reasons are as follows.  First, during the latter part of 2001, Mr Abidali had been told by the Başkans that the whole of the Dahod Investment was urgently needed to enable Başkan Gida to satisfy Ferrero’s requirements, therefore by implication leaving nothing spare for the purpose of building up any stockpile.  Secondly, Mr Abidali must have appreciated that a company such as Başkan Gida with serious working capital difficulties would be unlikely to have the capital resources with which to build up such a stockpile, beyond the immediate requirements needed for processing nuts to meet Ferrero orders imminently due for delivery.  In short, Başkan Gida would be operating hand to mouth, rather than on the basis of comfortable hazelnut reserves.  In this respect I reject Mr Abidali’s evidence that he thought that Başkan Gida maintained large hazelnut stocks at all times.  Thirdly, Mr Abidali knew, from the beginning of 2002, that Başkan Gida’s working capital requirements were being met from a mixture of the Dahod Investment and the new facility granted by the Banks.  If he made no inquiries as to how, in detail, those alternative sources of working capital were being applied the inevitable inference is that he must have believed that the stockpile transferred to Aksu Gida by the end of February had been acquired from a mixture of those two sources.  In that respect, I think it most unlikely that the Başkans would have had any wish to provide him with any more specific explanation, and that he would have had no wish to investigate whether his belief to that effect was true, still less as to the precise attribution of the monies used to build that stockpile. </p>

For the reasons which I have given, the split invoices were not either. True it is that Ferrero received numerous invoices from Başkan Gida after the grant of the Facility requesting payments to be made otherwise than to the Collection Account, in circumstances where a minute study of the terms of the Notices and Acknowledgements of Assignment might have suggested that payment should have been made to the Banks.  There was however no evidence that anyone at Ferrero knew precisely which Başkan Gida contracts had been submitted to the Banks for the purposes of obtaining finance, or knew anything of the detailed terms of the Facility Agreement and associated documentation other than the assignment documents which I have described in detail.</p>

There is no evidence that Ferrero knew anything about the security provisions in the Facility Agreement. All they had was an un-formed understanding that some hazelnuts at the Giresun factory were held on security terms that required third party consent to their release.  Without knowledge of the terms of the lien, or of  the trust receipt, it is difficult to see how Ferrero could have known or suspected a breach of those terms.  Furthermore, the evidence does not suggest that, by contrast with what Mr Abidali was told, Ferrero was given any explanation by the Başkans as to how Aksu Gida was going to obtain the hazelnuts which it needed to continue supplies to Ferrero or, more generally, how Aksu Gida’s working capital requirements were going to be met.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for Başkan Gida’s fraudulent trading, I have concluded that Ferrero in the persons of Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet probably did come to suspect, during the period between 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and the end of February, that the Banks had not been informed of the Başkans’ plan to transfer the ongoing hazelnut business to Aksu Gida, and their knowledge of the likelihood that Başkan Gida/Ferrero contracts would be used for the purpose of raising finance with the Banks must also have given them reason to suspect that the implementation of the Scheme would lead to the Banks not being repaid in full in relation to borrowings obtained during the period when the Scheme was being planned and, later, implemented.  But I do not consider that, at any time before the end of February 2002, the suspicion had matured in the minds of anyone at Ferrero into a belief that fraudulent trading of that kind was probably taking place, or that, by making no inquiries either of Başkan Gida or of the Banks in that regard, Mr Casale or Mr Rosa Brunet were deliberately avoiding learning for sure that which they believed was probable.  In summary, there was nothing sufficient to demonstrate to Ferrero that Başkan Gida was borrowing against contracts which it did not intend to perform, in circumstances where performance by Aksu Gida would (rather than merely might) lead to the Banks not being paid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have reached this conclusion on balance by considering, both separately and collectively, the events likely to have given rise to that suspicion, namely the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January meeting, the December and January countersigned contracts, the Early February Contracts, the receipt of the Transfer Notices (coupled with the Framework Contract amendment) and finally the receipt of the split invoices.  I have reviewed each of those events separately, and their effect upon Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet’s knowledge and suspicions, above.  Taken collectively, I consider it likely that their effect would have been to trigger a suspicion that the Başkans might not have been dealing openly with the Banks in relation to the proposed transfer to Aksu Gida, but not to a level which can be properly be described as a belief that some form of fraudulent trading was likely or probable.  To the specific reasons for that conclusion already given, I would add the following general observations.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, perhaps the most important events which should have focused minds at Ferrero upon the honesty of the Başkans’ dealing with the Banks were the making of the late January and early February contracts.  But the evidence is that the late January contracts were substantially performed by Başkan Gida, and that the early February contracts were only to a modest extent used for the raising of further finance.  Secondly, both those sets of contracts were made (or remade) at a time when the Scheme was described to Ferrero as merely contingent, the impression being given that the prospect of a satisfactory outcome of the negotiations with Yapi Kredi was still on the cards, such that there was light at the end of the tunnel for Başkan Gida itself.  Thirdly, the evidence does not suggest that there was any way in which Ferrero could know the extent to which and the terms upon which the Başkans might use those contracts for the raising of further finance with the Banks and, in the absence of any knowledge of the terms of the Facility, Ferrero had no way of knowing without detailed inquiry whether in practice the Başkans could obtain funding from the Banks on terms which were otherwise than fully secured, such that a transfer of the business to Aksu Gida would have necessitated a negotiation between the Başkans and the Banks sufficient, for example, to transfer their security and rights to repayment to the assets and business of the new company.  My finding that the Başkans were doing no such thing derives from an understanding of the invoicing fraud, the trust receipt fraud and the detailed terms of the proposed Scheme, of all of which Ferrero were ignorant, and about none of which (being neither a shareholder, investor in or creditor of Başkan Gida) Ferrero had any duty or commercial incentive to inquire.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in relation to the transfer scheme itself, Ferrero knew nothing about the detailed terms of the sham documents, or about the joint venture involving Indo-Med and the Dahod Investors, or their participation in the Scheme.  All Ferrero knew was that the Scheme, as explained to them on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, involved an element of subterfuge and deception of Yapi Kredi, since the new company was, at one and the same time, to appear to be independent from the Başkans while in reality continuing to be controlled by them.  Again, I consider that Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet probably suspected that the Başkans may have been keeping the Banks similarly in the dark about the difference between the outward appearance and the inward reality, but not to have reached a stage where they knew for sure or believed that this was so, or that the Başkans’ reasons (whatever they were) for keeping the reality from Yapi Kredi also necessarily applied to the Banks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, although Ferrero had a substantial commercial motive for wishing to cooperate with any plan by the Başkans which would preserve their business and in particular their supply chain from potential destruction at the hands of Yapi Kredi, I am not persuaded that Ferrero as an institution, still less Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet as individuals, had any motive for wishing to associate Ferrero with a scheme which they knew or believed would involve a fraud on the Banks.  In my judgment Ferrero’s commercial objective to preserve its supply chain and to avoid becoming beholden to a single supplier was insufficient to justify participation in what its senior management believed was a fraud, and no evidence of any kind has emerged to suggest that either Mr Casale or Mr Rosa Brunet had any personal corrupt or other motive consciously to expose Ferrero to the risks attendant upon participation in a fraud.  On the contrary, as I have already stated, my impression of both of them, supported by all the evidence which I have seen, suggests that their loyalty to Ferrero and their determination to further its best interests was beyond question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In reaching those conclusions about what Ferrero through Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet did or did not suspect, believe or know at the material time, I have taken full account of the fact that both of them have been untruthful in respect of significant parts of their evidence, and in some instances, deliberately so. I have also considered whether aspects of Ferrero’s conduct after the end of February 2002, during the period following the Banks’ discovery of the fraud, justifies an inference that Ferrero knew about it, or about parts of it, before the end of February.  Finally, I have taken full account of the Banks’ submissions that in relation to important factual issues, Ferrero had decided not to call certain available witnesses.  I have concluded that none of those matters, taken separately or collectively with all the other evidence, justifies a conclusion that Ferrero’s knowledge or suspicion of the Başkans’ fraud was greater than that which I have thus far described.  I shall set out my reasons for that conclusion at a later stage in this judgment, after reviewing the whole of the facts chronologically.</p>

Accordingly, on Friday 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March the Banks called an event of default.  Later on the same day they learned for the first time, via SGS, of the “hiring” of the Başkan Gida business to Aksu Gida and, on further inquiry, that Yapi Kredi had sought to attach hazelnuts at the Giresun factory, and was alleging that Başkan Gida had been made fraudulently bankrupt and that Yapi Kredi would be suing Başkan Gida for “swindling”.  By the end of Friday the Banks learned (as was the fact) that a judge and appointed experts from the local Turkish court had attended at the Giresun premises together with police, and that Latif Aksu was claiming that the business had been leased to Aksu Gida a month previously.  The Banks’ immediate concern was to ensure that hazelnuts still in pledge at Warehouse 2 were protected from Yapi Kredi’s attachment.  In that respect the Banks succeeded, but only in relation to the modest quantity of poor quality hazelnuts still located in Warehouse 2 by that date, which the Banks eventually sold to Indo-Med for US$720,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no dispute about what occurred during the telephone conversation, since Mr Byles broadly accepted, in cross-examination, Mr Casale’s written account of it in his witness statement.  It was a short conversation.  Mr Byles told Mr Casale that there were outstanding payments due to the Banks.  Mr Casale responded by saying that he had checked with Ferrero Italy and that none of the invoices from Başkan Gida were outstanding.  Mr Byles did not ask into what bank account payment had been made, but told Mr Casale that Başkan Gida was no longer operating.  Mr Casale’s reply was that he knew that, and he volunteered that Ferrero was in contact with Aksu Gida, which was supplying Ferrero with hazelnuts.  Mr Byles did not inform Mr Casale of any security interest of the Banks in hazelnuts stored at the Giresun factory, nor of the rumours and suspicions then reaching the Banks that the Başkans had been involved in a fraud.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Each side blames the other for having been uncommunicative during that brief conversation.  For the Banks, it was put to Mr Casale that a reasonably careful study of the Banks’ 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February email would have revealed that the Başkans had been practising an invoicing fraud, since no invoices corresponding to the numbers specified in the email had actually been received by Ferrero Italy, let alone with a direction for payment to the Banks.  Mr Casale acknowledged this in cross-examination, but said that he had not at the time of his telephone conversation on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March yet read the email.  For their part, the Ferrero Defendants criticised Mr Byles for not notifying Mr Casale of the Banks’ continuing security interest in nuts stored at Giresun.  Mr Byles sought to explain that by saying that, in his view, the Banks’ nuts were either still secure in Warehouse 2, or subject to Yapi Kredi’s attachment, so that there was no likelihood of further sales by Aksu Gida of the Banks’ nuts to Ferrero, against which any warning needed to be given.  For his part, Mr Byles criticised Mr Casale’s tone as not being forthcoming, and as sounding rather annoyed at being telephoned.  Mr Casale’s response was that the call had reached him on his mobile telephone while taking his son to the local swimming pool.  Mr Byles acknowledged that, by the time of his telephone conversation with Mr Casale, the Banks suspected the Başkans of a fraud, but chose not to reveal their suspicions at that stage to Ferrero.</p>

PRI had by this stage abandoned its former loyalty to the Başkans as clients (perhaps from a belated recognition of the need to preserve their reputation with the banking community) and lost no time in informing the Banks that, in their view, Aksu Gida was a front or “shell” company still being run by the Başkans notwithstanding their protestations to the contrary, and that Ferrero was cooperating with the Başkans’ scheme to protect their assets from angry creditors.</p>

First, the Başkans told them about the US$13 million loan obtained from the Dahod Investors, describing them (without naming them) as a religious group based in the USA.  The US$13 million loan was described (in accordance with the sham documents, but contrary to the truth) as having been repayable in December 2001.  Secondly, the Aksu Gida  scheme was described as a “rental scheme” frequently used in Turkey, carried out in close cooperation with the religious group and brokered by what they described as the Başkans’ London agent (a reference to Mr Abidali although he was not named either).  The Başkans denied being in control of Aksu Gida, and said that the religious group were in control.  </p>

Thus the Banks discovered from the Başkans’ frank admission that nuts which had been financed under the Facility were being on-sold to Ferrero via Aksu Gida by means which wholly circumvented both the Banks’ security and structured mechanism for repayment by the assignment of Başkan Gida’s receivables from Ferrero.  The Banks drew the inference that Ferrero was “part of the scheme”, and that, (correctly in my judgment) Ferrero would not have participated in the Scheme by buying large quantities of nuts from Aksu Gida if it did not itself believe that the Başkans remained in effective control of that company.</p>

Mr Byles also acknowledged in cross-examination that he had already concluded by that stage, in part from the fact that Ferrero claimed to have paid all invoices from Başkan Gida, that some form of invoicing fraud had been perpetrated by the Başkans.</p>

The Banks did not communicate further at all with Ferrero after Mr Byles’ short conversation with Mr Casale on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, until 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, and at no time informed Ferrero of their suspicions that there had been an invoicing fraud, and that in buying nuts from Aksu Gida, Ferrero risked obtaining property which had been dishonestly misappropriated from the Banks’ security.

Both witnesses suggested that Ferrero itself was, in any event, being uncooperative by that stage, and both regarded it as unlikely that any hazelnuts originally released from Warehouse 2 were by early March still in the hands of Aksu Gida awaiting delivery to Ferrero, so that there was no practicable prospect of protecting the Banks’ proprietary rights by giving Ferrero notice of them.</p>

He said that after his discussion with Mr Byles he had telephoned Melih Başkan, to be told that there had been a big misunderstanding which the Başkans would sort out, and which was not Ferrero’s problem.

He relied upon Mrs Pay’s evidence that, from March 2002 onwards, the Başkans absented themselves from the Giresun plant and continued a supervisory role, invisibly as it were, over the telephone.  Above all, he submitted that, leaving aside Mr Bolowich’s initial communications with Melih Başkan, the exchange between Mr Casale and Melih Başkan which I have just described stands as an isolated incident among the surviving documents, suggesting that, in sharp contrast to the much more frequent surviving exchanges between  Mr Abidali and Melih Başkan, the Başkans took the trouble to ensure that their continued supervision of Aksu Gida was as invisible to Ferrero as it was designed to be to the rest of the outside world.  He concluded that, since all Ferrero’s orders for performance by Aksu Gida for the rest of the 2001 season had been placed with Başkan Gida by the time of the Aksu take over, that there was in any case little need for contact between Mr Casale and Melih Başkan about operational matters affecting Aksu Gida thereafter.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Otherwise however, I reject Mr Strauss’s submissions on this point, for the following reasons.  First, as already explained, I consider it inconceivable that Ferrero would have agreed to transfer in bulk its existing order book from Başkan Gida to Aksu Gida if it had not been assured that the Başkans were to remain in overall control.  Secondly, there is nothing in Mr Strauss’s point that the email exchange in March which I have described was an isolated occurrence.  Ferrero routinely destroyed its operational emails after a relatively short period, such that the Ferrero Defendants (and Ferrero Industrial in particular) have not in fact disclosed what must have been a substantial email traffic with Aksu Gida for the relevant period.  The exchange in March 2002 between Mr Casale and Melih Başkan was disclosed as part of the contents of Mr Casale’s personal lap top computer.  Furthermore, the content of the March 2002 emails which I have described demonstrates that Mr Casale sought to communicate with Melih Başkan primarily by telephone, and only resorted to a short email when Melih Başkan did not respond to an invitation to call him back.  Telephone conversations have left no records capable of forensic analysis.  Nor was it an isolated survivor in fact. There was another contact between Mr Casale and Melih Başkan about the affairs of Aksu Gida on or about 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2002, to which I shall shortly refer, of which a surviving fax provides evidence. Finally, even if it had been an isolated survivor, Mr Casale’s 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March email tellingly reveals an inbuilt assumption that Melih Başkan was the person to speak to if routine communications at a more junior managerial level failed to produce the desired result.  It is that underlying assumption which gives the email such weight as probative of Ferrero’s knowledge that the Başkan family were to remain in control of Aksu Gida, notwithstanding their protestations to the contrary to the outside world, as reflected for example in what they told the Banks’ representatives at their meeting earlier in March.</p>

Understandably Mr Casale could not remember this routine conversation when cross-examined about it. For this novation to have resulted from a single telephone conversation suggests that a Başkan family member must have been on the other end of the line. I find that it was probably Melih Başkan, speaking at the same time for both Aksu Gida and Azer Gida.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April Yapi Kredi obtained a form of freezing injunction from the Turkish courts, in connection with its claim to set aside the asset transfer to Aksu Gida as a fraud on Başkan Gida’s creditors.  Until then, trading between Aksu Gida and the Ferrero Defendants had been proceeding smoothly, but the injunction had the effect of freezing the bank account into which the Ferrero Defendants had been invited to make payments for deliveries received.  This led to Aksu Gida making a series of requests to the Ferrero operating companies that, in future, payments be made not to Aksu Gida’s bank, but to a private individual named Onal Ozel at a different Turkish bank.  The request began with a telephone inquiry by Mr Franko of Mr Bolowich whether Ferrero Germany could stop a payment then being made, which Mr Bolowich told him was no longer possible, and a request to make no further payments to Aksu’s bank due to what Mr Franko described as “problems with his bank”.  This was followed by an email on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April requiring payment of all future invoices to be made to Mr Ozel, with which at least some of the Ferrero Operating Defendants complied, until it was reported to Mr Do, who ordered it to be stopped immediately, on the basis that payment of debts due to companies ought not to be made to private individuals.  Mr Casale’s evidence, which I accept, was that Aksu Gida had explained that the reason for the request was to prevent Yapi Kredi interfering with its business, but that Ferrero were not told of the injunction.</p>

The aggregate amounts claimed exceeded €8.213 million from Ferrero Italy, €5.443 million from Ferrero France and €10.293 million from Ferrero Germany, an aggregate claimed from Ferrero as a whole in excess of €23.949 million.</p>

Save for the loss in transit of Ferrero France’s curt response, the Banks had received in reply precisely what Ferrero wished them to receive.  For its part, Ferrero had by the end of April received the unambiguous warning that something had gone so gravely wrong in the operation of the Banks’ Facility that the Banks were persisting in a claim to be entitled to payment by Ferrero of approximately €24 million by reference to invoices of which the Banks had given full particulars, but of which Ferrero had no records, and by reference to contract and purchase order numbers in relation to which Ferrero had received very substantial deliveries for which it had paid Başkan Gida in full.  Plainly, Melih Başkan’s assurance that it was not Ferrero’s problem, and had been sorted out with the Banks was, by the end of April, demonstrably incorrect, and Ferrero faced at least the risk that, if the underlying receivables had indeed been duly assigned, and proper notice given to Ferrero, that it might find itself obliged to pay twice for the same goods.</p>

Save that the outstanding order numbers and quantities were different, and for the name change necessary to convert them into transfer letters from Aksu Gida rather than from Başkan Gida, each of the documents was in precisely the same form as the February Transfer Letters, and the Ferrero Defendants complied with the request in exactly the same way.  The Ferrero operating companies sent Başkan Yuksel fresh purchase orders for the balance of the amounts outstanding under the existing Aksu Gida orders, and deliveries continued to be made by Başkan Yuksel, from the same premises, in exactly the same way as they had previously been made by Aksu Gida.  It was, incidentally, at this stage that Ferrero Italy rescheduled delivery under contract 5105 for the following season, the time having by then passed for deliveries which would satisfy Ferrero Italy’s quality control in relation to the 2001 crop.</p>

Mrs Pay continued to be employed in the business, and in response to my question said that during the Başkan Yuksel period, her supervisor was Melih Başkan.  No attempt was made to re-construct Başkan Yuksel as a company owned by Indo-Med and Latif Aksu, and the transfer to Başkan Yuksel appears not to have caused a ripple on the surface of the commercial understanding between the Dahods, Mr Abidali and the Başkans.  They continued to be engaged in a three cornered joint venture or partnership in the conduct of the hazelnut business, with the Dahod Investors and Indo-Med continuing to enjoy the same profit share as previously.</p>

In practice, the entire operation of purchase, processing and re-export, together with the administration of the necessary documentation, continued to be carried out at the Giresun premises.  Nonetheless the cash flow generated by the sale and purchase of hazelnuts was routed through a bank account of Başkan Yuksel, thereby conveniently avoiding the effect of the Turkish freezing injunction on Aksu Gida’s account.</p>

Ferrero’s evidence, which I do accept, was that the motivation for agreeing to transfer outstanding orders from Aksu Gida to Başkan Yuksel was, again, to preserve if possible their supply chains for what continued to be high quality hazelnuts.  By the time the Ferrero Operating Defendants placed their fresh orders with Başkan Yuksel, the hazelnut market had fallen substantially in price, such that the prices originally agreed in and before February with Başkan Gida, and transferred unaltered to Aksu Gida, were significantly greater than the lowest prices obtainable in the market by early May.  Nonetheless the new orders were placed at the same prices as had been negotiated in and before February, Mr Casale’s evidence being that Ferrero did not think it right to renegotiate them.  If Başkan Yuksel had been, genuinely, a separate concern from Aksu Gida, it is difficult to conceive of any reason why Ferrero should have agreed to reorder nuts outstanding from Aksu Gida at what had become the unnecessarily high prices originally negotiated with the Başkans.  By contrast, if (as I find) Ferrero understood that Başkan Yuksel was just another front for substantially the same family business concern, it is entirely understandable that the prices were not changed.</p>

Mr Casale denied in cross-examination that he had asked for the confirmations to be backdated and, on balance, I believe him.  I am by no means persuaded by his evidence that he failed to notice that the documents, once received, had been backdated.  In my judgment he had no particular motive for asking for backdating, and probably regarded the dates on the documents, once received, as not being worth making an issue about.

Mr Gun’s advice is redacted on  the grounds of privilege, but the letter contains the following description of a conversation between him and Cevat Başkan, following the meeting with the Banks:</p>

I told him that my impression was that KBC bank had no chance of recovery from Başkan and therefore tried to sue Ferrero as a last hope, based on the notices and acknowledgements.  I said the issue whether or not KBC would be successful was a separate matter but it would be risky for Ferrero to continue business with Başkan or any other companies associated with Başkan as KBC would interpret this co-operational collusion between Başkan and Ferrero.  I told him that in these circumstances I could not recommend Ferrero to continue business with either Aksu, Başkan Yuksel or any other company associated with Başkan as it would increase the likelihood of KBC bringing proceedings versus Ferrero.…”</p>

Furthermore, as these proceedings demonstrate, Mr Gun’s warning of the risks for Ferrero in continuing to deal with such Başkan related entities was prophetic.  In fact, Ferrero ignored Mr Gun’s warning and continued to deal with the Başkans through Başkan Yuksel until the end of 2002, after which this and other litigation with the Banks ensued.</p>

In my judgment Ferrero’s case, and its witnesses in their evidence, have consistently and deliberately played down the extent of their appreciation, from March 2002 onwards, that the Banks were the victims of a fraud by the Başkans.  I consider that what had before the end of February been a mere suspicion that the Başkans might not have been dealing frankly with the Banks matured in early March into a belief at least in Mr Casale’s mind that they probably had defrauded the Banks.  Whenever it was in early March that he studied the Banks’ 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February email, he must have appreciated from the fact that Ferrero Italy had received none of those invoices which the Banks itemised that the probable explanation was an invoicing fraud.  Once he had been copied in by Mr Bolowich and informed by Mr Caroly of the similar requests sent in late April to Ferrero Germany and Ferrero France, also relying upon copy invoices none of which appeared in the operating companies’ records, the conclusion would be hard to avoid.  </p>

In my judgment he understood that perfectly well by the end of April, once informed about the amounts being claimed against Ferrero France and Ferrero Germany, to which he must have added the amount which he knew was being claimed from Ferrero Italy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Banks may therefore fairly ask rhetorically why should Ferrero, if believing that the Banks were victims of a fraud by the Başkans, have been so uncooperative in response to the Banks’ inquiries, and why during this trial should Ferrero and its witnesses have played down the extent of their belief to that effect, to the point of lying about it, and for that matter lying about their knowledge that Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel were front companies for the Başkans, if not for the purpose of seeking to protect themselves from identification as participants in that fraud?  Such conduct is undoubtedly consistent with an inference of guilty participation.  The question is whether it is probative of it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion is that Ferrero’s conduct in and after March 2002 falls a little short of justifying that inference, and is to be explained on other grounds, as follows.  By the beginning of March Ferrero had committed itself to obtaining the bulk of its hazelnut requirements from the 2001 crop from the Başkan front company Aksu Gida, having done so in circumstances in which the proposed transfer of Başkan Gida’s business was not perceived to give rise to any risk that Ferrero might be liable to make double payment in respect of the same hazelnuts.  The Banks’ email of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February suggested to Mr Casale for the first time that this assumption might not have been correct.  By the end of April Ferrero was facing claims from the Banks in excess of €20 million, entirely in respect of hazelnut deliveries for which it had already made payment in full, apparently as the result of the conduct of the Başkans, upon whom Ferrero was continuing to rely for future high quality supplies.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the acutely worrying uncertainty in the minds of Ferrero’s responsible managers (Messrs Casale, Rosa Brunet and Do) during the whole of the period from March 2002 onwards was not whether there had been a fraud by the Başkans but whether there was a real risk that Ferrero rather than the Banks were potential victims of it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was I consider obvious to Ferrero from an early stage that, if there was a real risk of liability to make double payment pursuant to the Banks’ claims, there was little or no prospect that the Başkans, as authors of Ferrero’s predicament, would have the resources to satisfy the Banks’ claims, at least in the short or medium term, despite the Başkans repeatedly proffering to Ferrero their desire to do so.  The result is that Ferrero accurately appreciated that the likely outcome of the Başkans’ fraud would be a very serious dispute between Ferrero and the Banks as its joint or alternative victims, and one in which, rightly or wrongly, Ferrero did not envisage that its best interests would be served by cooperation with, or the provision of assistance to, the Banks in their inquiries.  Like the Banks in March, Ferrero lay low until, at the end of July, the emergence of the forged Acknowledgements as an important part of the Banks’ case appeared to put a defensive weapon into Ferrero’s hands, thereafter used as the basis for refusing further cooperation and, after the Banks’ letters before action, for the aggressive defence constituted by the criminal complaint.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst that analysis sufficiently explains Ferrero’s conduct towards the Banks from March to the end of 2002, it leaves outstanding, as calling for further explanation, the question why Ferrero should have chosen to continue to do business with the Başkans through Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel for the rest of 2002, to have decided to put forward a false case that they did not know that they were front companies for the Başkans, and to support that case by lying about it in evidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Ferrero continued to do business with the Başkans largely because it had committed itself to that course shortly after the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January meeting with Melih Başkan, so that at no time thereafter did a cold calculation of Ferrero’s commercial interests favour an about-turn.  The basic motivation remained, namely to preserve, if possible, a supply chain which had served Ferrero very well in terms of quality and quantity over many years.  It may be that Ferrero calculated (wrongly in the event) that it would be impossible for any third party such as the Banks subsequently to prove that Ferrero knew in 2002 that both Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel were indeed front companies for the Başkans.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the false case presented to the contrary in this litigation, I consider that the motivation lay not, as Mr Wardell submitted, in the desire of Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet to conceal their disloyal shortcomings from their employers, but in Ferrero’s desire, shared by them and by Mr Do, to avoid painting Ferrero into precisely the corner about which Mr Gun warned in the letter from which I have quoted, namely that of becoming tainted by the Başkans’ fraud by virtue of a continuing association with their companies.  It is perhaps an irony that the combined effect of initial obstructiveness, continued dealings with the Başkans’ companies and subsequent untruths about their state of knowledge merely increased that suspicion of complicity which led the Banks to make the conspiracy allegations which they have against Ferrero in this litigation. </p>

It was, in short, business as usual, in that the profit sharing joint venture was transferred seamlessly from Başkan Gida to Aksu Gida, and from Aksu Gida to Başkan Yuksel, without any apparent change in Mr Dahod’s understanding of the substance of the business relationship between the parties.  It is convenient to analyse the evidence about this relationship in three strands.  The first concerns Mr Abidali’s continued efforts to assist the Başkans in the promulgation in Turkey of the sham transactions which I have described, mainly for the purpose of fending off hostile claims by Yapi Kredi.  The second consists of routine communications about day to day trading matters, arising from the fact that, in addition to being the nominee holder of the Dahod Investors’ shareholding in Aksu Gida, Indo-Med continued to be a major trading partner with the Başkan business, in both its Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel stages.  The third strand consists of the correspondence bearing directly upon the true nature of the parties’ mutual interest in that business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With the assistance of the Başkans’ legal team (headed by Mr Alpay) Indo-Med took the appropriate steps to obtain registration in Turkey as 80% shareholder of Aksu Gida.  More importantly Mr Abidali contributed an affidavit to Aksu Gida’s defence of Yapi Kredi’s claim, in June 2002.  The affidavit contained three connected lies.  The first was that the Indo-Med funding of US$12.55 million (a reference, without naming them, to the Dahod Investors’ contribution) had been for the pre-finance of raw material purchases by Başkan Gida for supply to Indo-Med (whereas in truth it had been for the pre-finance of supplies to Ferrero).  The second was that the Protocol Agreement and promissory notes had indeed been made in November 2001, so that the debt had become due but unpaid in January 2002.  The third was that the genesis of the transfer to Aksu Gida was a providential meeting between Indo-Med and Mr Aksu which enabled Indo-Med, by enforcement of its debt, to exploit an opportunity to enable Aksu Gida to continue Indo-Med’s supply of hazelnuts.  Thus the Başkan Gida/Aksu Gida business transfer was explained as the result of commercial pressure by Aksu Gida’s new owners to enforce an overdue debt, a picture apparently verified by the sham and backdated documents, and which Mr Abidali well knew to be false when making his affidavit.</p>

In my judgment they clearly justify an inference precisely to that effect.  They show Mr Abidali and other employees at Indo-Med consulting the Başkans (mainly Melih Başkan) in relation to a range of routine matters relevant to the Aksu Gida/Başkan Gida hazelnut business, usually in relation to issues arising from the on-sale to its own customers by Indo-Med of nuts supplied by Aksu Gida or Başkan Yuksel.  </p>

Due to incorrect labelling the Egyptian customer was forced to pay excess import duty and Saifuddin Abidali complained to his brother Mr Abidali about it.  The gist of the exchange was that the labelling mistake was treated as Melih Başkan’s responsibility.  He personally apologised to Saifuddin Abidali for the difficulty and agreed to bear the financial consequences.  When an appropriate deduction was agreed, the balance of the payment for the consignment was treated as a “balance due to Başkan” for a supply by the front company.  In cross-examination, Mr Abidali was forced to accept that if the Başkans were not in substance in control of Aksu Gida, then he had in substance been lying to his own brother in private emails.</p>

At the end of August Mr Abidali sent Mr Dahod a summary account of tonnage delivered to Ferrero from the 2001 crop together with the Dahod Investors’ profit share, amounting to US$3.8 million, of which Mr Abidali said that US$1.2 million had already been paid on account from money received in instalments from Turkey.  He referred to part of the 2001 crop as having been carried forward to the new crop (no doubt an oblique reference to the postponement of delivery date agreed by Ferrero Italy for the bulk of its last order).

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The relationship with Başkan was established to provide working capital to Başkan for all Hazelnut purchases by Ferrero.  The investors (the various Dahod entities and Indo-Med) were to receive a fixed return of $140 per ton of Hazelnut purchases by Ferrero.  The expected volume for Ferrero was a minimum of 30,000 tons.  Consequently, an investment of $13,150,000.00 was expected to return $2,940,000.oo per year to the Dahod entities.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The investor’s capital was considered to be relatively safe and liquidity was expected to be high except during the peak of the harvest.  Also, the capital was expected to cycle through the investors during the year.  The expectation was that as the capital cycled through the Dahod entities, they would have the opportunity to make commitments on an annual basis and also, change the relative contribution among them before the start of each season.  Further, the cash flow was expected to be reasonably predictable to allow cash management by the investors.  The major risk in the return was the total shipment to Ferrero.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">While the total Ferrero booking (31,525 tons) was more than the minimum target, the shipment (27,144 tons) was below expectations.  Consequently, the total return to the Dahod entities was only $2,660,112.00.  However, the cash flow was very unpredictable and not only that the return has not been fully paid yet, but also, the capital was never cycled through the investors.  The unpredictability of the cash flow forced the Dahod entities to execute unplanned liquidation of other assets to meet their cash commitments.  Such unscheduled liquidation resulted in a significant penalty.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In reality, the events of the first year have dramatically altered the risk-reward profile of the investment as a result of the major reorganization of Başkan.  The investors’ capital is now supporting most of the shipment and not just the ferrero shipment since the investors’ capital makes up $14,350,000.00 ($13,150,000.00 of the original investment plus the $1,200,000.00 of reinvested return from the first year) of the $15,000,000.00 working capital.  As a result, the investors’ capital is not liquid and cannot cycle through the investors.  The return on the shipment to customers besides Ferrero is unknown and unpredictable.  Consequently, the total return on the investment is not concomitant to the risk of the investment.  The unresolved legal issues faced by Aksu further heighten this risk.</p>

The potential for success remains to be very promising if the terms and conditions can be quickly modified to reflect the new reality.  Also, the cash flow needs of the Dahod entities have to be considered to avoid continued unexpected and expensive liquidation of other assets.”</p>

Far from being an aggregate of deliveries by a Başkan company, a Dahod company and a third company of unknown parentage, Mr Dahod described the deliveries as having been made during the period of a “major reorganization of Başkan” in which the profit sharing partnership with the Başkan family had continued both throughout, and successfully.</p>

While, as I have concluded, Mr Dahod was not shown any of the sham Başkan Gida/Aksu Gida transfer documents, and probably not told about the structure which they purported to create, there is no doubt that the Başkans themselves also regarded the substance of the profit sharing joint venture as being unaffected by the transfer, as appears from a draft of a letter which Melih Başkan proposed to send to Mr Dahod, but copied to Mr Abidali for his comments in February 2003.  That draft clearly portrays the Başkans as owners and controllers of the hazelnut business throughout, and described the Başkan Gida/Aksu Gida transaction merely as one pursuant to which the Dahod Investors’ “credit” was transferred by one company to the other, leaving the Dahods as major lenders to, rather than owners of, Aksu Gida.</p>

The label is unhelpful in drawing attention away from the continuing requirement in all types of conspiracy claim to demonstrate an intent by the defendant to injure the claimant.  It is in truth a sub-species of the tort of conspiracy to injure, in which the ordinary requirement that such intent be predominant in the mind of the defendant is replaced by the requirement to show that unlawful conduct has been the means of the intentional infliction of harm to the claimant.</p>

A defendant may intend to harm the claimant’s business either as an end in itself or as a means to an end.  A defendant may intend to harm the claimant as an end in itself where, for instance, he has a grudge against the claimant.  More usually a defendant intentionally inflicts harm on a claimant’s business as a means to an end.  He inflicts damage as the means whereby to protect or promote his own economic interests.</p>

A high degree of blameworthiness is called for, because intention serves as the factor which justifies imposing liability on the defendant for loss caused by a wrong otherwise not actionable by the claimant against the defendant.  The defendant’s conduct in relation to the loss must be deliberate.  In particular, a defendant’s foresight that his unlawful conduct may or will probably damage the claimant cannot be equated with intention for this purpose.  The defendant must <span style="font-style:italic">intend</span> to injure <span style="font-style:italic">the claimant.</span></p>

Take a case where a defendant seeks to advance his own business by pursuing a course of conduct which he knows will, in the very nature of things, necessarily be injurious to the claimant.  In other words, a case where loss to the claimant is the observe side of the coin from gain to the defendant.  The defendant’s gain and the claimant’s loss are, to the defendant’s knowledge, inseparably linked.  The defendant cannot obtain the one without bringing about the other.  If the defendant goes ahead in such a case in order to obtain the gain he seeks, his state of mind will satisfy the mental ingredient of the unlawful interference tort.  This accords with the approach adopted by Lord Sumner in <span style="font-style:italic">Sorrel v Smith</span> [1925] AC 700, 742:</p>

The ends which must have been intended are different. <span style="font-style:italic">South Wales Miners’ Federation v Glamorgan Coal Co </span>Ltd [1905] AC 239 shows that one may intend to procure a breach of contract without intending to cause loss.  Likewise, one may intend to cause loss without intending to procure a breach of contract.  But the concept of intention is in both cases the same.  In both cases it is necessary to distinguish between ends, means and consequences.  One intends to cause loss even though it is the means by which one achieved the end of enriching oneself.  On the other hand, one is not liable for loss which is neither a desired end nor a means of attaining it but merely a foreseeable consequence of one’s actions.”</p>

For the purposes of unlawful means conspiracy, the starting point is in my judgment the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Manifest Shipping Co Ltd v. Uni-Polaris Insurance Co Ltd [2003] 1 Ac 469</span>.  Like the <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG</span> case, it was not about conspiracy.  There, the question was as to the quality of knowledge which had to be proved against a ship-owner, for him to be held to have been privy to the unseaworthiness of his vessel within the meaning of section 39(5) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906.  The relevance of the decision is that the passage from the speech of Lord Scott to which I am about to refer was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Attorney General of Zambia v. Meer Care &amp; Desai</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 875, at paragraph 21, as an exemplary description of blind-eye or Nelsonian knowledge in a case specifically about dishonest assistance and unlawful means conspiracy.  The passage in question consists of paragraphs 112 to 116 of Lord Scott’s speech, which deserves reading in full.  I shall content myself with two extracts.  In paragraph 112, he began:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Did the assured have blind-eye knowledge of the unseaworthiness of the <span style="font-style:italic">Star Sea</span>?  It is as well to return to the language of the sub-section.  What is required is “privity” on the assured’s part of the unseaworthiness.  “Privity” in its ordinary meaning connotes knowledge.  “Blind-eye” knowledge approximates to knowledge.  Nelson at the battle of Copenhagen made a deliberate decision to place the telescope to his blind eye in order to avoid seeing what he knew he would see if he placed it to his good eye.  It is, I think, common ground – and if it is not common it should be – that an imputation of blind-eye knowledge requires an amalgam of suspicion that certain facts may exist and a decision to refrain from taking any step to confirm their existence.”</p>

But a warning should be sounded.  Suspicion is a word that can be used to describe a state-of-mind that may, at one extreme, be no more than a vague feeling of unease and, at the other extreme, reflect a firm belief in the existence of the relevant facts.  In my opinion, in order for their to be blind-eye knowledge the suspicion must be firmly grounded and targeted on specific facts.  The deliberate decision must be a decision to avoid obtaining confirmation of facts in whose existence the individual has good reason to believe.  To allow blind-eye knowledge to be constituted by a decision not to inquire into an untargeted or speculative suspicion would be to allow negligence, albeit  gross, to be the basis of a finding of privity.”</p>

The use of the word “suspicion” and “belief” are indicative of the strength of the suspicion that is required.  But perhaps the most helpful guide is to be found in what was said by Roskill and Geoffrey Lane LJJ about the reason for refraining from inquiry – “in the hope that by his lack of inquiry he will not know for certain” – “in order to avoid obtaining certain knowledge of the truth”.  It is probable that Lord Denning MR was saying the same thing when he used the phrase “So that he should not know it for certain”.  The illuminating question therefore becomes “why did he not inquire?”  If the judge is satisfied that it was because he did not want to know for certain, then a finding of privity should be made.  If, on the other hand, he did not inquire because he was too lazy or he was grossly negligent or believed that there was nothing wrong, then privity has not been made out.”</p>

Equally, it suggests that a suspicion that a counterparty may, <span style="font-style:italic">vis-à-vis</span> a third party, be up to no good, falls short of a suspicion firmly grounded and targeted on specific facts, of the kind necessary for subsequent lack of inquiry to give rise to blind-eye or Nelsonian knowledge.</p>

Having resigned as managing director of the claimant company he was approached by three of its other employees who, fearing redundancy, sought to improve the financial consequences of being dismissed by a dishonest scheme whereby they hoodwinked the company into thinking that they had been employed on terms requiring notice to be given expiring on particular dates.  For that purpose they persuaded Mr Howes dishonestly to sign letters of employment and to backdate them to a time when he had been managing director of the claimant company, so as to make it appear that they had been employed upon the terms which they sought to assert.  Quite separately, and without Mr Howes knowing about it, they fabricated and then backdated a statement of general terms and conditions of employment which provided the requisite termination provisions, and then used the combination of the letters and the general terms to achieve their dishonest ends.  Mr Howes thought that the letters which he had dishonestly backdated stated no more nor less than the terms of employment which had actually been agreed, albeit otherwise than in writing, at the material time.</p>

Accordingly, as the judge found, he was party to an unlawful means conspiracy.  We would also accept that it could fairly be said that this conspiracy, and in particular the signing of the backdated letters was “directed to” the company, in the sense that the purpose of executing the letters in a backdated form was to induce the company to believe that they had been signed by Mr Howes at a time when he had power to bind the company.”</p>

On the contrary, and notwithstanding the shortcomings in the quality and even the integrity of the evidence of the principal Ferrero witnesses, I am persuaded on the evidence taken as a whole that at no time did Ferrero know (in the sense of having either actual or Nelsonian knowledge) before the end of February 2002 that the Başkans were or had been procuring monies from the Banks by deception, although I consider that during the period between 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and the end of February 2002, the responsible employees of Ferrero, and in particular Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet, probably began to suspect that, in some undefined way, the Başkans may have been up to no good vis-à-vis the Banks.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before descending into the detailed analysis of the overt acts relied upon, I wish to emphasise at the outset that my reasons for rejecting this broad formulation of the Banks’ conspiracy case against Ferrero is significantly (but not exclusively) based upon the following general considerations.  The first arises from the need to appraise events in their historical context, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, in particular when addressing supposed inferences as to the state of mind of defendants alleged to have participated in a dishonest conspiracy.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The historical context in which the events relied upon by the Banks need to be set is that they occurred at the end of a 10 year commercial relationship between Ferrero and the Başkans throughout which (and this is not challenged) the Başkans had conducted their part in the relationship with complete integrity and trustworthiness.  The aphorism that businessmen are in principle entitled to trust their counterparties may have uncertain force as between parties at the outset of a business relationship.  It is of powerful force when that trust has been earned by mutual dealings over a very long period.  To that may be added the fact (also unchallenged) that, quite apart from their relationship with Ferrero, the Başkans had a general reputation for integrity and trustworthiness in the conduct of what was, by 2001, a very large enterprise (by Turkish standards) which had been carried on as a family business for many years.  It is therefore right to assume that Ferrero’s starting point in addressing the question whether anything said, done or omitted by the Başkans during the relevant period suggested that they were up to no good, was that the Başkans had earned an entitlement to be given the firm benefit of any doubt.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second general point relates to motive, as distinct from intent.  Although motive is not, in that sense, a necessary element to be proved for the purposes of establishing a claim in conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, it is a vital ingredient in any rational assessment of the question whether a defendant, and Ferrero in this instance, acted dishonestly, as the broader formulation of the Banks’ claim necessarily assumes.  Furthermore, as Mr Strauss succinctly put it in his closing submissions, motivation in relation to dishonest conduct necessarily requires an assessment not merely of the incentives, but also of the disincentives to embarking upon the course of conduct alleged.  The supposed incentives need to be balanced against the disincentives, which in the case of participation in a fraud include not merely a disinclination to do that which is immoral, but also the risk of incurring long-term damage to the commercial reputation of a business enterprise, and the personal risks to the careers and even liberty of the individuals involved, if found out and brought to justice.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Looking first at the incentives, it emerged with complete clarity during the trial that Ferrero had, as its relevant senior employees recognised, a powerful commercial motive for assisting the Başkans in the enhancement and preservation from perceived threats of their hazelnut export business, namely to preserve not merely a supplier with a track record of producing the highest quality hazelnuts, but also the supply chains behind that supplier, upon whom the Başkans depended, and which might be dissipated or otherwise lost if the Başkans were put out of business.  An additional subordinate motive for supporting the Başkans’ preservation of their business was the avoidance of being exposed to a single large supplier of Turkish hazelnuts, in the form of Oltan Gida, at a time when no other competing supplier appeared to offer Ferrero a wholly satisfactory service.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Recognising perhaps that such a motive would not easily be regarded as sufficient to justify Ferrero participating in a fraud on two well-resourced banks with offices within the EU, the Banks tried hard to identify further motives behind Ferrero’s alleged participation in the conspiracy, and also to minimise the obvious disincentives by the submission that Ferrero believed that there was no risk of being found out.  The main alternative motives consisted of the obtaining of cheap nuts, and a possible but unidentified private corrupt inducement to Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet (the case against Mr Bolowich having been abandoned at the conclusion of his cross-examination) to ensnare an otherwise innocent Ferrero in the Başkans’ scheme.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the “cheap nuts” motive fails, both on the facts, and as a matter of analysis.  While of course Ferrero like any purchaser had the ordinary commercial motive to obtain its raw materials at the lowest price reasonably obtainable in the market, I am not persuaded that the particular prices which Ferrero obtained under the December 2001 and February 2002 Forward Contracts (being the main contracts relied upon for this purpose) were so low as to amount, on any analysis, to a significant motive for participation in a fraud.  Furthermore, if viewed against a common perception by both the Başkans and Ferrero that spot prices in the Turkish hazelnut market were likely to fall by the contracted time for delivery, the proposition that the nuts obtained under those contracts were in any real sense “cheap” largely falls away.  For different reasons, the criticism of the prices agreed under the late November re-grade contracts (namely that they were by reference to historic rather than current market prices) is also, for reasons which I have already given, misplaced.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the supposed private corrupt motive on the part of Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet, the Banks have, quite simply, failed to unearth any evidence for this at all, despite strenuous efforts, in particular by a persistent examination of certain payments to a company connected with the Dahods’ and Mr Abidali’s religious community called Safe Holdings Ltd which, in the event, went nowhere.  While there may be cases in which, even in the absence of any direct evidence, a private corrupt motive on the part of company employees may sometimes be inferred as the only explanation for what is otherwise a clearly proved fraud participated in by them, this is by no means one of those cases.  On the contrary, whatever the shortcomings in the honesty of parts of the evidence of Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet, their absolute loyalty to Ferrero was fully demonstrated by the evidence, taken as a whole.  Indeed, I consider that it was that sense of loyalty which led them to commit themselves to Ferrero’s untrue case about its lack of understanding that Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel were front companies for the Başkans, and to the protestation of an unrealistic level of ignorance about the meaning and implications of the word assignment, where used repeatedly in the relevant documentation which Ferrero received and (as I have concluded) carefully considered.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There remains Mr Wardell’s point about a perception within Ferrero of a low risk of being found out if the Başkans’ fraud on the Banks subsequently came to light.  As to that, the level of complicity in the Başkans’ fraud alleged against Ferrero under the Banks’ wider formulation of its case makes it virtually inconceivable that, if Ferrero believed that the Başkans were planning and implementing a fraudulent scheme to obtain the Banks’ money, that it would be otherwise than a mere matter of time before the fraud itself was found out.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The more difficult question is whether there is any substance in the submission that Ferrero could have thought that its own participation in that fraud would go undetected.  That issue is closely bound up with the implications of the Ferrero witnesses’ readiness to lie in the witness box in support of a false case by Ferrero designed to distance itself from the Başkans, and with the Banks allegations about destruction of relevant documents which I deal with elsewhere.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion is that while it is theoretically possible that, if Ferrero had been an active participant in the Başkans’ fraud on the Banks in the manner alleged, it might have regarded the risk of being found out as low, nonetheless even a low risk of an entirely unacceptable consequence would remain a powerful disincentive to the participation alleged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the general analysis of the issue of motivation, as outlined above, leads clearly to the conclusion that the alleged participation either of Ferrero as an entity or of its employees Mr Casale and/or Mr Rosa Brunet in the Banks’ broader formulation of the conspiracy is unsupported by any evidence of a motive which would afford a rational explanation for such  grave and potentially self-destructive conduct.  The absence of any such qualifying motive is therefore a substantial factor in the balance against an inference of participation by Ferrero in that conspiracy, quite apart from the factors which emerged from the detailed consideration of the overt acts relied upon, to which I now turn.</p>

The gist of the Banks’ case is that these acts display Ferrero deliberately concealing from the Banks what Mr Wardell described as the breakdown in the trading relationship between Ferrero and Başkan Gida during the same period, the deliberate provision of a falsely optimistic trade reference designed to enable the Başkans to obtain the facility by deception, the drafting of the Acknowledgements of Assignment in such a way as to enable the Başkans to commit the invoicing fraud without giving rise to any liability on the part of Ferrero, and the making of the December Forward Contracts on terms as to price sufficient to demonstrate to Ferrero the Başkans’ dishonesty, and to make it clear that those contracts were to be used purely for the raising of money from the Banks, rather than for any genuine commercial purpose.</p>

Looked at in the round, the single most important event is constituted by the making of the three December Forward Contracts.  Together they constituted an order in an aggregate amount exceeding 6,000mt, for delivery during periods ending between March and June in the following year.  Although they were priced below the then spot price, and represented a substantial departure from the ordinary pattern of trading between Ferrero and Başkan Gida, I have concluded after detailed analysis that they were genuine commercial contracts negotiated to meet Ferrero’s real needs (both in terms of production and the building up of a buffer stock), at a negotiated price which reflected both parties’ broadly congruent perceptions as to the likely development of the market during the delivery period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since the aggregate tonnage ordered represented a very substantial part of Ferrero’s outstanding requirements in relation to the 2001 season, the placing of those orders with Başkan Gida of itself demonstrates Ferrero’s continued confidence in Başkan Gida as their principal (or by then joint principal) supplier. It shows both that the relationship between Ferrero and the Başkans had not broken down and that Ferrero expected the relationship to continue well into 2002, during the period agreed for delivery of the hazelnuts ordered under those contracts.  </p>

Although the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December Trade Reference contained a negligent misrepresentation, I have concluded that it did not involve dishonesty by Ferrero or by Mr Casale personally.

While the suspicious construction of Ferrero’s conduct which the Banks placed on these events is understandable, and while I have been obliged to treat with reserve Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet’s evidence about them, due to their clearly demonstrated unreliability as witnesses in relation to other matters, I have concluded on balance, and in particular when these events are set in their historical context, that they do not disclose dishonest assistance by Ferrero in the Başkans’ scheme to defraud the Banks, or overt acts from which a concurrent or prior combination by Ferrero with the Başkans in such a scheme can properly be inferred.</p>

Thus, those events do not support an inference that, while agreeing to participate in the Scheme for the setting up of what Ferrero probably did understand was to be a front company, Ferrero combined with the Başkans in any plan to obtain money from the Banks by deception, to serve as the seed corn for the business to be conducted by the front company.</p>

They consist of the making of the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January contract renewals (contracts 5100 and 5101), the making of the Early February Contracts, the signing of the amendment to the Framework Contract and the simultaneous transfer of outstanding orders to Aksu Gida, without informing the Banks of the latter, Mr Bolowich’s and Mr Casale’s continuing contacts with Melih Başkan and the approval, without communication to the Banks, of the split invoices.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The most important item in this group of events is the making of the February Forward Contracts.  The Banks’ case was that Ferrero had no need for a further 6,000mt of nuts at this late stage in the season, had no reason in any event to buy them all from Başkan Gida rather than, for example, the more efficient Oltan Gida, that the price payable was so far off the spot market price as to be inherently uncommercial and therefore suspicious, so that it should be inferred that the sole purpose of the making of them was, to Ferrero’s knowledge, to put into the Başkans’ hands documents enabling them to draw down very large sums of money from the Banks which they had no intention that Başkan Gida, or anyone else, would ever repay.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a formidable case, all the more so because by February 2002 Ferrero could no longer attribute the qualities of unquestioning integrity and trustworthiness to the Başkans, having regard to their apparent readiness to mislead Yapi Kredi about the real ownership and control of Aksu Gida, should their plan to transfer the business to that company proceed.  For reasons already given, that case misses its target, but only by a small margin.  I have concluded that Mr Casale and/or Mr Rosa Brunet probably did ask themselves how (if Başkan Gida raised monies on those contracts) it would repay the Banks if the transfer of the underlying orders to Aksu Gida went ahead, but did not pursue inquiries on the basis that it was none of Ferrero’s business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment however, the state of mind of Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet in relation to the Early February Contracts fell short of blind-eye or Nelsonian knowledge of the Başkans’ intended fraudulent use of them, so that Ferrero’s participating in them fails to justify an inference that it had by then combined with the Başkans with a shared objective of enabling them to obtain money by deception from the Banks, whether as the seed corn for Aksu Gida’s business or otherwise.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My main reason for that conclusion is that, contrary to the central thrust of the Banks’ case about them, the February Forward Contracts did have, and were perceived by Ferrero to have, commercial purposes for both parties.  For the Başkans they secured a virtual monopoly of the supply of Ferrero’s further requirements for the 2001 season, to the exclusion of their major competitors, and on terms that would enable those contracts to be transferred so as to constitute Aksu Gida’s initial order book if the Scheme went ahead.  They did so at a price which, however unfavourable in terms of the then spot price, was one which both the Başkans and Ferrero thought reasonable having regard to their shared perception that the market would thereafter fall during the delivery period (as indeed it did).  For Ferrero the contracts secured their requirements (both for production and buffer stocks) from suppliers and underlying supply chains of unquestionable quality, coupled with an assurance that the Başkans would, if necessary, honour them through Aksu Gida if the transfer went ahead.  Ferrero had its own commercial interest in providing a substantial order book for Aksu Gida, so as to ensure that it would have sufficient business as a purchaser within Turkey to preserve the Başkans’ supply chains, and the price offered was, again, favourable but not unrealistically cheap, having regard to Ferrero’s perception that the market was likely thereafter to fall.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since those contracts had a commercial purpose for both parties, there was in my judgment no reason for Ferrero to suppose that they would be used simply to raise money from the Banks which the Başkans did not intend should be repaid.  Ferrero had no way of knowing at what time before the intended supply of any particular consignment of nuts the Başkans needed to raise working capital, or whether therefore the February Forward Contracts would be used to raise money by Başkan Gida prior to the transfer, or by arrangement with the Banks, by Aksu Gida after the transfer.  Ferrero simply did not know what the Başkans proposed to do by way of funding the working capital requirements of Aksu Gida, whether with the Banks or otherwise, and, in sharp contrast with the position of Mr Abidali, those matters were none of Ferrero’s business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The essence of Nelsonian knowledge (as is vividly depicted by <span style="text-decoration:underline">Manifest Shipping</span>, and by the episode at the Battle of Copenhagen from which it takes its name) is that a failure to inquire about matters giving rise to suspicion qualifies as the basis for an inference of knowledge only if the reason for the failure to inquire is that the defendant fears that he will learn for certain that which he already considers likely.  In my judgment, no-one at Ferrero reached that level of suspicion as to the fraudulent use to which (in fact) the Başkans proposed to put part of the value of one of the February Contracts, and their absence of inquiry about it is to be attributed not to a fear that they would discover an intended fraud, but rather to a belief that it was none of Ferrero’s business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next large group of alleged overt acts consists of those aspects of Ferrero’s conduct following the Banks’ discovery of the fraud which they criticised as characteristic of persons anxious to conceal their wrongdoing, coupled with Ferrero’s simultaneous participation in trading with Aksu Gida, acquiring nuts from Aksu Gida which the Banks claim belonged to them, and cooperating in the further sham business transfer from Aksu Gida to Başkan Yuksel.  Again, I have already reviewed this part of Ferrero’s conduct in detail.  I have concluded that Ferrero knew throughout that the Başkans were in <span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>control both of Aksu Gida and of Başkan Yuksel, so that they were knowingly trading with the Başkans throughout that period.  I have also concluded that, for most of that period, Ferrero’s suspicion about the integrity the Başkans’ conduct had risen to a level where it believed it probable that they had in some way been defrauding the Banks.  In both those respects I have rejected Ferrero’s case, and the evidence of its witnesses, to the contrary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless I have also concluded, contrary to the Banks’ case, that Ferrero had sufficient commercial reasons for continuing to trade with the Başkans during the rest of 2002, notwithstanding Mr Gun’s advice to the contrary, and that its uncooperative attitude towards the Banks when asked for information about its dealings with the Başkans’ companies was also sufficiently attributable to motivation other than a desire to cover up prior participation in the Başkans’ fraud, that it would be wrong to treat that conduct, however objectively unsatisfactory, as justifying an inference of participation in a conspiracy of the broader type alleged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Italian criminal complaint was, as was evident from the unsuccessful attempt of Ferrero’s witnesses to distance themselves from any responsibility for it, a singularly unattractive and, in the event, unsuccessful application of the principle that, sometimes, attack is the best form of defence.  It does not however follow that the aggressive defence constituted by the criminal complaint was designed to fend off a counterattack alleging participation in a fraudulent conspiracy, still less does it justify an inference that Ferrero thereby demonstrated a sense of vulnerability to such a claim.  The central focus of the criminal complaint was the alleged use by the Banks of the forged Acknowledgements of Assignment.  In my judgment the criminal complaint was specifically aimed at putting out of action before it could even be launched a feared claim by the Banks that Ferrero was liable pursuant to the Assignments to pay the Banks in relation to hazelnuts for which it had already paid the Başkans: i.e. the Banks’ contractual claim.  That was the claim made in the Banks’ letters before action which immediately preceded those proceedings.</p>

Putting forward a false case and then supporting it by lying in the witness box must always give rise to serious questions about that which it is sought thereby to conceal.  So, if it were true, would deliberate destruction of relevant documents, or the deliberate withholding of them in breach of a disclosure obligation.

Indeed, the time and effort applied to the prosecution and defence of that claim would itself have been sufficient to constitute a substantial piece of litigation in its own right.  Nor was it so lacking in substance that it would be fair or appropriate for me to deal with it summarily, or by recourse to the traditional rules whereby the affidavit of a solicitor that his client has no further documents to disclose is taken as being conclusive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before getting into the detail, three general points deserve emphasis.  The first is that the yardstick by reference to which misconduct in relation to disclosure of documents is to be measured needs to take account of the fact that, in the three European countries where the Ferrero Defendants are incorporated and carry on their business, disclosure of documents plays an altogether less prominent role in civil litigation than it does in England or, for that matter, in the USA.  It is therefore reasonable to suppose that, whereas from the moment when an English company appreciates that matters may become the subject of litigation, steps are expected to be taken to ensure the preservation in safe custody of relevant documents, the same perception may not apply, at least with the same force, in Italy, France or Germany.  Mr Wardell for the Banks acknowledged that this was a relevant consideration, at least in relation to Italy, where most of the relevant documents might have been expected to be found.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second general point is that the purpose of my analysis of this question is, at least at this stage in these proceedings, which are not concerned with orders for costs, strictly limited.  The question is whether misconduct by or within Ferrero in relation to the disclosure or destruction of documents supports an inference that attempts were being made to cover up participation in the alleged conspiracy.  It follows that the analysis is properly to be limited to allegations of the deliberate withholding or destruction of documents known to be relevant, rather than to routine destruction, mindless as to the consequences, or delays or failures in producing documents attributable to carelessness, indolence or a lack of an appropriate sense of the diligence required.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third general point is that in any case of alleged deliberate destruction or withholding of relevant documents, it is necessary to identify the real culprit, and in particular whether the alleged misconduct is that of Ferrero as an institution or of a particular employee, and in each case, whether the likely motive is the concealment of damaging material from the Banks, and therefore from this court, or the concealment by an employee of material from Ferrero, on the basis that it might lead to damage to his career.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first concerns Ferrero Italy’s and Ferrero Industrial’s originals or copies of nine of what the Banks describe as the forty key contractual documents in the case, including in particular the ten Başkan Gida contracts which, by countersigning them, Ferrero is alleged to have assisted the Başkans to use for the obtaining of money by deception.  Apart from those contracts, the missing key documents also included Ferrero Industrial’s copy of the KBC faxes dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2001, and Ferrero Italy’s original letters from KBC of 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2002, making claims in respect of unpaid invoices.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The idea that these documents might have been destroyed by Ferrero to keep them from coming to the attention of the Banks seemed fanciful, since by their very nature, the Banks would have been assumed by Ferrero to have been likely to have their own copies for use in any proceedings, as indeed they did.  It emerged from Mr Wardell’s closing speech that the allegation of destruction in relation to this category is destruction by Mr Casale, to keep the documents from coming to the attention of his employers, rather than institutional destruction by Ferrero.  The suggestion was that Mr Casale destroyed them fearing that their examination by Ferrero during its investigation in 2002, after the discovery of the Başkans’ fraud, would lead to him being identified as a co-conspirator with the Başkans.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I regard that allegation as no more persuasive than a suggestion that these documents had been destroyed by Ferrero.  In relation to all of them, Mr Casale would have appreciated, as a highly intelligent man, that destruction of the only copies of those documents to which he had access, namely those in Ferrero Industrial and Ferrero Italy’s files would at best merely postpone the date upon which, if as damaging as the Banks suggest, they would in due course have come to the attention of his employers.  The countersigned contracts were, of course, all held in copy form by the Banks, as he would have appreciated if, as alleged, he had signed them  only to enable the Başkans to draw down money on them.  The faxes from the Banks of December 2001, April and May 2002 were part of sets also sent to the other Ferrero Operating Defendants (and thereby out of Mr Casale’s control) and in any event retained in copy form by the Banks.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, this allegation comes nowhere near displacing my clear impression that, although prepared to lie from time to time, Mr Casale remained wholly loyal to his employers throughout.  Furthermore, as Mr Strauss observed, there are numerous examples of missing copy contracts in Ferrero’s files for the relevant period.  In fact, more went missing in relation to the 2000 year than in relation to the year in question.  It is also destructive of any notion that there existed a privately motivated conspiracy between Mr Casale and the Başkans, unknown to Ferrero that, upon request later in 2002, the Başkans sent copies of a number of the relevant contracts to Ferrero, upon its inquiry, which were in due course disclosed in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second category of which complaint was made was Ferrero’s email archives for the period 2001/02, a failure which was described in the Banks’ written closing submissions as “incredible”, the apparent implication being that this was being deliberately done to avoid disclosure in these proceedings, or that Ferrero’s evidence that email archives were routinely destroyed to free up spare computer capacity was simply untrue.  In this case Mr Wardell eventually confirmed in his closing speech that the allegation here was one of negligence rather than the deliberate destruction of documents perceived to be relevant and harmful.  Accordingly, while that routine destruction was, to an English eye, both surprising and unhelpful, it contributes nothing to the inference of participation in any conspiracy.</p>

In relation to these two categories, Mr Wardell submitted that there had been a deliberate institutional withholding of these documents by Ferrero telling their lawyers falsely that they had no such relevant documents in their possession.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have not found this allegation easy to determine.  It is in my judgment striking that the events with which these proceedings are concerned, and in particular the investigation of the Banks’ claims in and after April 2002, appear to have generated such a paucity of internal management records within Ferrero.  Mr Wardell was also able to point to certain categories of documents, relating to production targets and information about quality, where documents survive from the 2000 period but are absent during the relevant period, a trend for which Mr Do’s description of his hands-on face-to-face ‘talk about rather than write about it’ management style provided only a partially satisfactory explanation.  Also in favour of the Banks’ case under this heading is the fact that in relation to certain material issues, Ferrero has advanced a false case and supported it by lying witnesses.  Litigants who behave in that way can hardly complain if the court approaches an allegation of destruction of relevant documents with something less than the usual disinclination to believe such a serious allegation without convincing proof.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against a finding of deliberate destruction or withholding of documents of these types are the following factors.  First, there is, as Mr Wardell acknowledged, the likelihood inherent in the Ferrero Defendants’ places of business that an altogether less rigorous attitude to the preservation of documents for litigation purposes than applies in England may have been a large, but not sinister, contributor to the surprising paucity of documents of this type.  Secondly, the Ferrero Defendants have in other respects displayed a conscientious approach to the disclosure of many documents, including for example documents which for the purposes of their inquiries they obtained from the Başkans, and then disclosed.  There is not demonstrated any uniform picture probative of deliberate destruction or withholding, but rather one which appears possible only in patches.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Above all, there is, quite simply, no convincing proof of this allegation, but rather a reasonably grounded suspicion that destruction or withholding may have occurred.  While convincing proof in the form of an admission to that effect is extremely rare, it is less uncommon to find proof in the form of other documents which by cross-reference point to documents which have not been produced, in circumstances where concealment or destruction is more likely than mere accidental loss.  No such paper trail exists in relation to the categories of which complaint is here made.  In certain instances the Banks attempted to suggest otherwise, in particular in relation to a supposed written request by Melih Başkan for Ferrero to countersign contracts 5094 to 5097 and 5100 to 5101.  But, as it seems to me, those requests could equally have been made orally, without giving rise to any document, or made in documents which, because of the routine destruction of emails, have disappeared otherwise than because of an intent to destroy them to conceal relevant evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for board minutes, Ferrero’s answer has not been that there are no such documents, but that if and to the extent the matters in issue in these proceedings were discussed at board level within Ferrero the minutes do not record any relevant record of those discussions.  While again, this might appear surprising in relation to a large English group of companies, I do not consider that it would be right to draw an inference that relevant minutes have either been destroyed or withheld, in circumstances where other companies may organise their affairs so that management discussions about sensitive matters take place outside formal board meetings, or within them, but on the basis that the discussions are not then minuted, precisely for the preservation of their confidentiality. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion is that there is on balance insufficient material from which I can properly conclude that there has been deliberate destruction or withholding of relevant material by Ferrero in relation to these two categories, despite the existence of reasonable grounds for a suspicion to that effect.  Even if there had been such destruction or withholding, the question would nonetheless remain whether that justified an inference that Ferrero was seeking to cover up documents probative of its participation in the conspiracy alleged rather than, as I consider more likely, documents adverse to Ferrero’s case that, for example, there was an insufficient understanding of the meaning of the word assignment in the December 2001 documentation, or that Ferrero did not appreciate that the Başkans beneficially owned and controlled Aksu Gida and Başkan Yuksel.  In other words, even if I had concluded that destruction or withholding of relevant documents was probable, it would not have served to do more than reinforce my conclusions as to the reasons why, in certain respects, Ferrero has advanced a false case, and its witnesses told deliberate untruths.  As exemplified in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Heinl v. Jyske Bank</span>, not every lying witness is thereby shown to be a conspirator, nor, in my judgment, every destroyer or withholder of relevant documents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I can pass quickly over the remaining three categories of complaint about disclosure summarised in the Banks’ written closing submissions.  The sixth was concerned with inadequate reasons for redacting documents, and a delay in disclosing a letter from the Başkans to Michele Ferrero.  In both cases, those shortcomings reflected misunderstandings in the nature of Ferrero’s disclosure obligations, and give rise to no sinister inferences.  The final two categories concern delays in Ferrero’s production of stock records and a shipping data-base, all of which would have been of great assistance to the forensic experts if disclosed earlier, and no doubt have saved very substantial preparation costs.  Nonetheless, the reasons for their late disclosure give rise to no inferences probative of Ferrero’s participation in the alleged conspiracy, so I need say no more about them at this stage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I must briefly mention a repeated complaint by the Banks about Ferrero’s non-disclosure of the Soremartec Standards.  In a short judgment given during the course of the trial I ruled that the documents corresponding to that label were not disclosable by any of the Ferrero Defendants, not being documents in their possession or control, but rather in possession and control of their associated company Soremartec and, arguably, of the ultimate Ferrero parent company, neither of which are defendants in these proceedings.  In response to my observation at the end of that judgment that, nonetheless, production of the Soremartec Standards would be of assistance to the court, those companies persisted in their previous decision not voluntarily to disclose them, in the interests of preserving confidentiality in documents containing significant business secrets.  This was despite my indicating that the court had procedures whereby such documents, even if disclosed and used in evidence, can be preserved from coming into the public domain.</p>

They include Mr Caroly of Ferrero France, Mr Schulz of Ferrero Germany, Messrs Altare, Scavino, Bertone and Gagliasso from Ferrero Industrial, Mr Carelli of Ferrero Italy and unspecified but theoretically available members of Ferrero Italy’s accounts department.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, again, necessary to focus upon the relevance of this alleged omission to the matter in question, namely whether it should thereby be inferred that Ferrero knew about and participated as a conspirator in the fraud on the Banks.

	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Although it is not suggested that anyone at Ferrero other than Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet knew about the fraud in late 2001/early 2002, it is submitted that Ferrero as a whole is at fault for having closed ranks around these two men, and conducted these proceedings in such a deliberately tight-lipped way.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">I consider that this concession was rightly made.  The participation in the conspiracy by Ferrero is not alleged by the Banks to have extended beyond Ferrero Industrial and Ferrero Italy, specifically in the persons of Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet.  It follows that witnesses from the other Ferrero Operating Defendants, or even from the departments within Ferrero Italy with which Mr Casale was not concerned (such as the accounts department) would be unable to offer evidence going directly to that question.  </p>

In my judgment it goes no further than to support the inferences which, specifically in relation to the absence of Mr Altare and Mr Scavino, I have already drawn.  For reasons which will be apparent, those fall well short of an inference that Ferrero participated in the alleged conspiracy.</p>

The critical question is  whether  Ferrero shared with the Başkans as part of that objective the defeating of the claims of Başkan Gida’s creditors, or whether, put more conventionally, the objective of saving the Başkans’ hazelnut business involved, to Ferrero’s knowledge, the use of unlawful means, necessarily involving the infliction of injury upon the Banks, as one of those creditors.  In such an event, there would remain also the question whether the attainment of that objective by the unlawful means thereby identified, caused all or any part of the loss actually suffered by the Banks.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point is to ascertain from whom, or from what, Ferrero perceived that the Başkans’ hazelnut business needed to be saved.  The story given to Ferrero by Melih Başkan on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January was that it needed to be saved from the unwelcome attentions of Yapi Kredi due to a developing dispute between the Başkan family and Yapi Kredi about the biscuit business.  The Başkans did not want Ferrero to know that Başkan Gida was hopelessly insolvent (although it was), and although I have concluded that Ferrero probably did not distinguish between Yapi Kredi as a creditor of Başkan Gida  and as a creditor merely of the members of the Başkan family, the evidence does not suggest that Ferrero realised, at least prior to the end of February, that Başkan Gida was hopelessly insolvent, or that this was the real threat to the continuation of the Başkans’ hazelnut business.  Ferrero simply assumed that, as a major Turkish lender to the Başkan family businesses, probably including Başkan Gida, Yapi Kredi could in a dispute with the Başkans use its position in a way which could threaten the hazelnut business, whether by refusing to make further loans or by calling in existing loans, or by seeking to appropriate the Başkans’ shareholding in Başkan Gida as a means of enforcing debts owed by the family directly, in connection with the biscuit business.  I consider it unlikely that Mr Casale or Mr Rosa Brunet gave any conscious thought to the identification of the precise threat facing the hazelnut business within that range of alternatives, save to understand that the threat emanated from Yapi Kredi.  Ferrero was not, and had not been since it ceased making pre-payments in 2000, a creditor of Başkan Gida, and had no reasons connected with credit risk to give any considered thought to Başkan Gida’s ability to pay its debts.</p>

These were, quite simply, not matters with which businessmen like Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet, accustomed to trading with Başkan Gida on terms which afforded no credit, had any reason to concern themselves.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded, notwithstanding their denial, that Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet probably did know that the objective of saving the hazelnut business involved an element of subterfuge and deception vis-à-vis Yapi Kredi, in creating a false picture distancing the Başkans from continuing beneficial ownership and control of the hazelnut business.  If Yapi Kredi’s threat to the business resided purely in its status as a creditor of Başkan Gida, it is not easy to see how that deception would fend off the threat.  By contrast if Yapi Kredi’s threat consisted of its ability to execute against assets of the Başkans by virtue of their personal liability to that bank, then it is easy to understand why the deception might be essential.  Armed with a false cloak of invisibility as owners and controllers of the hazelnut business, the Başkans would be able to say to Yapi Kredi in any negotiations: “Sue us all you like, but it will not get you the hazelnut business”.  It follows that the element of unlawfulness (i.e. fraud) inherent in a deliberate deception of Yapi Kredi was not, in the way that the Scheme was presented to Ferrero by Melih Başkan, one which if implemented would necessarily injure Başkan Gida’s creditors as a body, let alone the Banks.  Injury to the Banks was simply not the obverse of a coin which had deception of Yapi Kredi on its face.</p>

It is only an inevitable consequence if the transfer is carried out at an undervalue (or for no value), or if it is done on terms which prefer the transferee as a creditor, or if once the decision to transfer has been made, so that it is known that the first company will shortly go into insolvent liquidation, it continues to incur debts knowing that they will not be repaid in full: i.e. fraudulent trading.  Fraudulent trading is of course unlawful (both in England and in any civilised country) but preferential payments of debts and transfers at an undervalue are not, at least in England.  Subject to its vires, a company may deal with its assets as it thinks fit, and pay its debtors in such order as it wishes to.

They knew nothing of the detailed and carefully prepared sham documents which were to be used to implement the transaction, nothing about the creation of a false impression of creditor pressure, and were not told (by contrast with Mr Abidali) that the objective was to pay off one of Başkan Gida’s smaller creditors in kind, the implication being that its larger creditors would be left with a shortfall.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows in my judgment that while Ferrero did understand that the transaction whereby Aksu Gida was to take over the Başkans hazelnut business as a front company was to be structured in a way that would conceal the Başkans’ continuing beneficial ownership of the hazelnut business from Yapi Kredi, they were not given to understand that any deception would be used so as to conceal from Başkan Gida’s creditors as a body the whereabouts of what had formerly had been Başkan Gida’s assets.  In that sense, Mr Do’s half-informed assumption that the transaction was to be open and transparent was not incorrect.  No attempt was made at any stage, whether by the Başkans, Ferrero or anyone else, to conceal the fact that the asset constituted by the hazelnut business had been transferred, virtually lock stock and barrel, by Başkan Gida to Aksu Gida.</p>

While I accept that Ferrero may well have thought it foreseeable that the transfer would take place in circumstances where some of Başkan Gida’s creditors (and in particular its unsecured creditors) might not get paid in full, that perception falls critically short of anything sufficient to give rise to an intent to injure those creditors, as a necessary corollary of achieving the shared objective.  Nor did the manner in which the Scheme was presented to Ferrero on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January necessitate a conclusion that such shortfall as might be incurred by any creditors of Başkan Gida after the transfer would arise as a result of the use of any unlawful means in connection with its implementation.</p>

Nonetheless I have not been persuaded that the suspicion thereby engendered ever reached a level at which it could properly be said that Ferrero had blind-eye knowledge of that aspect of the Başkans’ dishonest plans, still less that Ferrero had an intention thereby to injure the Banks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the common objective which Mr Abidali shared with the Başkans from then on was to protect the Başkans’ hazelnut business, including the Dahod Investment and Indo-Med’s profit share in it, from Yapi Kredi and from Başkan Gida’s other major creditors, by a transfer of its business and in particular its substantial stock of hazelnuts to a front company (Aksu Gida) to be beneficially owned and run by the Başkans. The end result sought to be achieved was to leave the Dahod Investors and Indo-Med as the profit sharing investors in the whole of the Başkans’ hazelnut business, in circumstances where, freed from the claims of Başkan Gida’s major creditors, that investment could be expected to yield the very profitable returns originally contemplated under the Dahod Agreement, with the added prospect, albeit not then finally agreed, that the Dahod and Indo-Med profit sharing entitlement would be extended to cover the whole of the Başkans’ exports, rather than merely those to Ferrero.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The attainment of that objective, to Mr Abidali’s knowledge, involved the use of the following means.  First, the commission of a large and deliberate preference, by Başkan Gida effectively repaying in full the Dahod Investors’ loan, primarily by means of the transfer of hazelnuts at Indo-Med’s direction to Aksu Gida.  Secondly, it involved the deliberate creation by the use of sham documents of a false appearance that the transaction was brought about by the exercise of commercial pressure by Indo-Med as an unpaid creditor, and that the effect of the transaction was the transfer of Başkan Gida’s business and current assets, including its stock of hazelnuts, to a company owned as to 80% by Indo-Med, in which the Başkans had no beneficial share, control nor managerial involvement.  Thirdly it involved a period during which the Transfer Scheme was to be prepared in secret, while Başkan Gida continued to trade, and to incur debts to its major creditors, including the Banks, which the Başkans did not intend should be repaid in full once the Scheme was fully implemented.  During that period the nuts identified for transfer to Aksu Gida, or part of them would be being acquired by Başkan Gida with the use of funds representing both the Dahod Investors’ original contribution and money drawn down under the newly completed Facility with the Banks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded that there is no basis for attributing to Mr Abidali knowledge that the Scheme involved transferring to Aksu Gida hazelnuts belonging beneficially to the Banks (in the sense of being either pledged to or held on trust for them), nor that the Scheme involved the perpetration by the Başkans of the Invoicing Fraud.  Nonetheless, I have found that Mr Abidali knew enough about the terms of the Scheme (namely that it was to involve the transfer of substantially the whole of Başkan Gida’s current assets, leaving behind only land charged to Yapi Kredi) for it to be clear to him that debts incurred to the Banks during the period while the Scheme was being prepared, but prior to its becoming publicly known, were debts which the Başkans did not intend should be repaid in full.  Furthermore, the way in which the Scheme was presented to Mr Abidali from early January 2002 onwards was, in my judgment, such as to demonstrate to him that Başkan Gida was insolvent, in every relevant sense.</p>

The Banks’ and Ferrero’s  Turkish law experts had not at that stage been instructed to assist in that regard, but at my request they prepared supplemental reports which helpfully presented a useful summary of the relevant provisions, about which they were, happily, in almost total agreement.

Sections 278 to 280 contain provisions providing for the avoidance of certain types of disposal of assets by insolvent persons, including gifts, transactions at an undervalue, and transactions reducing the insolvent’s assets in a manner not expected of a prudent person acting in good faith, provided that application is made within stated time limits from the onset of insolvency.  Transactions by an insolvent person with intent to cause damage to its creditors may be set aside at any time, provided that the recipient of the assets is shown to have known of the insolvent person’s intention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that the obvious preference afforded to Indo-Med and the Dahod Investors by the Scheme did not, of itself, render the Scheme unlawful in Turkey, nor would an undervalue inherent in the terms upon which the hazelnuts were transferred (had it been proved) have done so either.  Nonetheless I consider that the obvious trouble and expense to which the Başkans’ legal team headed by Mr Alpay went in the construction of the fictitious appearance of an overdue debt, dishonoured promissory notes and the application by Indo-Med of creditor pressure, as reflected in the sham documents and the collusive bankruptcy proceedings, demonstrates a perception by them that, in the absence of an appearance of creditor pressure, the Scheme was vulnerable to being set aside under Article 280.  The creation of a false picture of creditor pressure was therefore a deception by the perpetrators of the Scheme designed to mask its vulnerability to being set aside under Article 280.  That deception was unlawful not because of any provisions of Turkish insolvency law, but simply because of its inherently fraudulent nature.  Mr Werbicki was in my judgment correct in his concession that, deliberately to create an untrue impression of creditor pressure as a means of disguising a preference would be unlawful means (day 84 pp. 150 to 152).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other main element of deception involved in the Scheme was the false portrayal of Indo-Med and Mr Aksu as the true owners and therefore controllers of Aksu Gida after the transfer of the hazelnut business, and the concealment of the Başkans’ continuing beneficial ownership and control.  Again, and despite Mr Abidali’s evidence to the contrary, I have concluded that this was indeed a deliberate deception, known to Mr Abidali to be untrue, both at the stage of the planning of the Scheme, and in its implementation.</p>

Nonetheless, since this is in substance simply a particular species of fraud, there is no reason to suppose that it is any less unlawful in Turkey than in England.  Since the Scheme involved Başkan Gida continuing to trade normally, and thereby to incur debts to the Banks under the Facility until after the business transfer to Aksu Gida had been fully implemented, it did involve fraudulent trading by the Başkans, as a third element of the unlawful means employed for the achievement of the Başkans’ and Mr Abidali’s common objectives.</p>

He knew, of course, that neither Indo-Med nor the Dahod Investors were pressing creditors, so that the presentation of creditor pressure by the sham documents involved a deliberate deception.  He was aware that the Başkans were to continue beneficially to own and to control the hazelnut business once transferred to Aksu Gida, so that the whole structure of the sham documents presented a deliberate falsehood.  Finally, he knew enough about the way in which hazelnut purchases by Başkan Gida had been funded (by a mixture of Dahod Investors’ money and draw-downs under the Facility from the Banks) for it to have been obvious that some of Başkan Gida’s hazelnut stock (substantially all of which was to be transferred to Aksu Gida) had been funded using the Banks’ money, at a time when the Başkans were arranging for Başkan Gida to borrow from the Banks money which, as Mr Abidali knew, they did not intend should be repaid in full.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The final question relevant to Mr Abidali’s liability as an unlawful means conspirator, is whether he had the requisite intent to injure the Banks.  In my judgment he did, for the following reasons.  First, his knowledge that, while the Scheme was being prepared in secret, Başkan Gida was probably continuing to borrow in the usual way under the Banks’ Facility money which the Başkans did not intend that it should repay in full necessarily involved, as the obverse of the coin, injury to the Banks in the same way that every victim of fraudulent trading is injured.  The injury consists in losing money lent on a mistaken assumption, dishonestly induced, that the borrower intends to repay it.  Secondly, the deceptions inherent in the structure of the Scheme documents, designed to reduce or eliminate its vulnerability to attack under Articles 278 to 280 of the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Code also involved injury to the Banks, since they were major creditors of Başkan Gida whose Turkish statutory rights to seek to set aside the transfer of Başkan Gida’s assets and in particular its hazelnut stock, would be adversely affected if the deception were believed.  To that extent the injury which is the obverse of the coin is only the consequential reduction in the amount of the Banks’ claim in the liquidation of Başkan Gida attributable to an inability to rely upon Articles 278 to 280, where, but for the deception, those remedies would otherwise probably have been available.</p>

Why, he submitted, should Mr Abidali have been any more motivated than Ferrero to become involved in a fraudulent conspiracy against the Banks?  Although much travelled, Mr Abidali’s business base was in London, and he knew that the Banks’ offices (for the purpose of the Facility) were also in London, having visited them with the Başkans.  By becoming involved in a fraud on the Banks, he risked ruin and even loss of liberty even more clearly than did Ferrero.  He had not invested his own or Indo-Med’s money in Başkan Gida and was therefore, it was submitted, interested in the outcome of the Scheme only to the extent of Indo-Med’s share of profits under the Dahod Agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Mr Abidali’s motivation was as follows.  First, the prospect of retaining rather than losing Indo-Med’s profit share on the whole of the Başkans’ exports to Ferrero for the 2001 crop and thereafter was, for a business of Indo-Med’s size, significant.  Secondly, Indo-Med depended upon the continuing health of the Başkans’ hazelnut business for its own supplies, and for the continuation of the profit sharing venture which Mr Abidali already enjoyed under his arrangement whereby Indo-Med acquired hazelnuts from the Başkans at cost, and shared with the Başkans the profits of its on-sale of them, on a 50/50 basis, without having to pay his debts to the Başkans before his customers paid him.  Thirdly, Mr Abidali owed the Başkans a favour, for having in effect bailed Indo-Med out of the large financial difficulties caused in the late 1990s by its involvement in sales to Russia.  Fourthly, Mr Abidali had an obligation to his co-religionist Mr Dahod to protect the large investment in the Başkans which Mr Dahod had undertaken entirely on his advice.</p>

Mr Werbicki made much of the fact that the Scheme and accompanying documents had been approved by Turkish and English lawyers, so that Mr Abidali could not have thought there was anything improper in it. In my judgment Mr Abidali can gain no comfort from Mr Trotter’s assistance. Either Mr Trotter was grossly negligent or worse, or (more probably) Mr Abidali managed to deceive him as to the underlying reality. As for Mr Alpay, he appears to have been the progenitor of the dishonest sham. The only comfort which Mr Abidali may have gained was that the dishonest Scheme would probably work, if the deceptions inherent in it were believed, which to an extent they were in Turkey.</p>

Although the detailed drafting of documents had by then  started, I consider that it would be wrong to treat Mr Abidali as having unequivocally decided to commit Indo-Med to the Scheme without Mr Dahod’s approval, so that the drafting prior to that date was, however expressed, in substance subject to contract.  The fact that the Scheme remained contingent upon Ferrero’s approval, which was only obtained about a week later, does not affect the date of Mr Abidali’s joinder, but may affect the date from which further trading by Başkan Gida should properly be regarded as being (to Mr Abidali’s knowledge) fraudulent trading, since it was only at the point when the Scheme became unconditional that it could be seen to be only a matter of time before Başkan Gida ceased trading, leaving its major creditors unpaid.  Mr Abidali’s liability for loss caused by Başkan Gida’s fraudulent trading <span style="font-style:italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Banks arises only because of his participation in a Scheme of which that was to his knowledge a necessary element.</p>

The first draw-downs under the Facility had occurred before Mr Abidali joined the conspiracy, and the first six draw-downs had occurred before the Scheme became unconditional due to Ferrero’s agreement to play its part in it.  By then, the Banks had lent Başkan Gida in excess of €10 million, and may (although I need not decide that question at this stage) have incurred an irrecoverable loss of that amount for which Mr Abidali would not be liable.</p>

That element of loss arising out of the unlawful means constituted by that deception necessarily requires quantification, since it is clear that an unwinding of the Aksu Gida transfer under Articles 278 to 280 of the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Code (even if sought within the relevant time limits) would not have led to the Banks being repaid in full, or anything like it.  In such a liquidation, the Dahod Investors would through Indo-Med have had been able to prove for their full investment, and the Banks would also have faced competition from secured and unsecured claims of Başkan Gida’s Turkish banks.</p>

He relied upon the well known case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pilkington v.

Professor Tekinalp’s starting point was that the relevant provisions of the Civil Code should be interpreted so as to uphold and enforce the requirements of good faith, so much so that every transaction by a possessor of goods under a personal contractual restraint as to the disposal of them could be impugned if a lack of good faith within the meaning of Article 3(2) was shown.  By contrast, Professor Ansay’s starting point was what he described as the “publicity principle”, pursuant to which third parties who receive goods should normally be protected if the person transferring them has the appearance of being the owner.  Closely related to that principle was his understanding that the whole system of property in movables under Turkish or Swiss law is based upon possession, such that a person in possession of goods is presumed to be the owner of them, and has authority to sell them by virtue of his possession.  Thus he regarded Article 943 as reflecting in relation to pledges the underlying publicity principle, so that a person receiving originally pledged goods is unaffected by the pledge if he acquires them either from the pledgor to whom they have been returned or from a third party in possession.</p>

The present case is of course concerned with return of the goods to the pledgor.  He described the second sentence of Article 943 as an exception to the general rule (reflected in the first sentence) that a pledge is lost whenever the pledgee ceases to have possession of the goods.  He says that the second sentence is therefore to be narrowly interpreted, and he distinguishes between a purely temporary and short-term return of the goods to the pledgor, and a long-term or unconditional return of the goods, concluding that:</p>

Anything other than such a short-term return of the goods to the pledgor, with an unconditional duty to hand them back to the pledgee, will lead to the extinguishment of the pledge.  He gives as an example of a short-term return to the pledgor with an unconditional duty to return them to the pledgee, the occasional surrender of the pledged item or keys to the warehouse for maintenance, service or use by the pledgor.</p>

Upon release, Başkan Gida owed the Banks no unconditional duty to return the nuts to Warehouse 2.  It follows on Bauer’s analysis (with which Professor Ansay agreed) that release of nuts from Warehouse 2 extinguished rather than suspended the pledge.</p>

For example, if the chattel is temporarily returned to the pledgor for repair of maintenance purposes, the provisions concerning the right of pledge are suspended.  For the duration of this period, the creditor may not apply for the pledge to be realised.  As of the time at which the pledgee regains possession of the pledged thing, the provisions concerning pledges take effect once again.

First, his distinction between short-term temporary return of the goods to the pledgor and a more permanent return unaccompanied by any duty to hand them back to the pledgee suggests that, on the present facts, the pledge was extinguished in relation to any batch of hazelnuts once released by SGS from Warehouse 2 to Başkan Gida for processing and sale.  This was, coincidentally, Pekin &amp; Pekin’s understanding when drafting the Master Pledge Agreement and advising the Banks, and they added the Master Trust Receipt as a hoped-for alternative means of security in relation to the nuts once released from Warehouse 2, but without any particular confidence in its efficacy, on the assumption that the release would extinguish the pledge.</p>

It is by no means necessary to read it even as attempting to provide for the efficacy of the pledge in relation to nuts once released, and such a conclusion would militate against the commercial efficacy of the security structure, since processing and sale to Ferrero could not sensibly proceed while the nuts remained pledged.  Even if it purported to do so, it was in my judgment ineffective for that purpose, on the true interpretation of Article 943.</p>

If the restorer sells the antique to a fourth party, or transfers it to the original pledgor, the fourth party will obtain title only if acting in good faith, while the pledgor will not escape the pledge because he is receiving it in bad faith. In my judgment the reason why good faith is relevant in that example is that the restorer was never the owner, and as a mere bailee from the pledgee never had any authority to alienate the chattel. In the present case by contrast, Başkan Gida was the owner throughout, whose authority to alienate was qualified only by the pledge.</p>

Since however the Turkish experts both agreed that this is a fact sensitive question, I shall briefly express my conclusions about it, in case a higher court should take a different view about the Turkish law issues which I have already decided.  The question is, “whether Ferrero failed to exercise the degree of care expected from it by the circumstances”.  I should note that the translation of Article 3 of the Turkish Civil Code produced by Professor Tekinalp used the phrase “required by the circumstances” but in cross-examination he agreed with Professor Ansay’s view that the phrase “expected from him (or it) by the circumstances” was a better reflection of the Turkish text.</p>

Where for any purpose expressly provided for by the Civil Code a party needs to demonstrate good faith (for example to obtain ownership of a chattel on a purchase from someone without authority to alienate it under Article 988), then the test imports something more than mere honesty.  Where the facts about a transaction would put a reasonable purchaser on inquiry as to the vendor’s authority or title, then the purchaser must make such inquiries as to the vendor’s title or authority as, taking into account all relevant facts, are reasonable in the circumstances.  The relevant facts include the qualifications and skills of the purchaser, but the test is otherwise largely objective.  If the purchaser fails to make such reasonable inquiries, then he will be affected by such adverse rights or want of authority which those inquiries would have revealed.  Conversely, if reasonable inquiry would not have revealed the adverse rights or want of authority, the purchaser will take free of them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The nearest analogy to that Turkish law concept seems to me the English law doctrine of constructive notice, whereby the purchaser of a legal estate in land will be affected by equities affecting that estate if he fails to make such reasonable inquiries of the vendor’s title as are called for by transactions of the relevant kind.  Failure to make those inquiries leaves the purchaser with constructive notice of such adverse rights as reasonable inquiries would have revealed: see Megarry &amp; Wade’s Law of Real Property (7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition) at paragraph 8-018.  Professor Ansay, whose evidence on the meaning of the good faith in Article 3 I found more impressive than that of Professor Tekinalp, warned that reasonable inquiries in relation to the purchase of land were regarded by the Turkish courts as inherently likely to be more extensive than reasonable inquiries in relation to the purchase of a chattel, due to the greater propensity for land to be subject to adverse rights.  The doctrine of constructive notice is of course of particular application to the purchase of land in English land law, and the English courts have shown a similar reluctance to extend the doctrine into commercial transactions about goods.</p>

My reasons are as follows.  First, Ferrero knew nothing whatsoever about the Master Pledge Agreement, still less about the terms upon which any nuts released from Warehouse 2 were thereafter held by Başkan Gida.  All Ferrero knew was that at some stage during the life of the Facility, it had been necessary for third party consent to be obtained in relation to certain nuts in advance of processing, and that there may have been third party security rights in relation to some of the nuts stored from time to time by Başkan Gida at Giresun.  Secondly, Ferrero knew nothing at all about the sources from which Aksu Gida or Başkan Yuksel were obtaining nuts for on-sale to Ferrero, after the business transfer, save that Mr Casale and Mr Rosa Brunet no doubt hoped and assumed that Aksu Gida would take over Başkan Gida’s supply chains.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My third reason relates to the possibility that careful thought might have suggested that some of Aksu Gida’s early deliveries had been made from hazelnut stocks already obtained by Başkan Gida, if only because of the apparently smooth transition from the one company to the other during the period immediately following the transfer requests on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.     Although I have concluded that during this first period Ferrero probably entertained a growing suspicion that, in some undefined way, the Başkans might not have been acting properly or frankly <span style="font-style:italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Banks, I have concluded that Ferrero had no reason even to suspect that the Başkans were abusing any continuing property rights of the Banks in relation to hazelnuts offered for sale by Aksu Gida, even though Ferrero might have suspected that some part of those nuts had been acquired with the use of the Banks’ money.</p>

As for enquiries of Aksu Gida, I have little doubt that the Başkans would have lied to Ferrero about it.  As for the Banks, Mr Byles’ evidence was that when Mr Casale told him that Ferrero was buying nuts from Aksu Gida, it did not occur to him that there was any possibility that Aksu Gida held nuts which were still subject to the Banks’ security.  During the first period, prior to Mr Casale’s conversation with Mr Byles, I see no reason why inquiries by Ferrero should have extended to the Banks, at least until Ferrero was notified on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February of outstanding payments due to them.  Thereafter, for the reasons which I have given, I consider it unlikely that inquiry of the Banks would have put Ferrero on notice of any property rights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The insuperable difficulty with the Banks’ knowing receipt claim is proof of the necessary knowledge on Ferrero’s part.  Ferrero had no more knowledge of the Master Trust Receipt than it had of the Master Pledge Agreement.  In <span style="text-decoration:underline">BCCI (Overseas) Ltd v. Akindele</span> [2001] Ch 437, the Court of Appeal held that liability for knowing receipt depended upon the recipient having knowledge that the assets received were traceable to a breach of trust or of a fiduciary duty, and identified as a single test of knowledge in that context that it must be such as to make it unconscionable to retain the benefit of the receipt: see per Nourse LJ at page 455 E to G.  Knowledge for that purpose is to be distinguished from mere notice, and requires at least “a clear suspicion”: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Uzinterimpex JSC v Standard Bank plc</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 819, per Moore-Bick LJ at para 44.</p>

It knew neither of the constructive trust, nor of the breach of it, nor that, whether or not there had been a breach of trust, the hazelnuts acquired from Aksu Gida had originally been subject to any trust in favour of the Banks. The same insuperable difficulty affects any claim in relation to hazelnuts which had been purchased with the proceeds of sale of nuts held on constructive trust.</p>

As with almost every issue in this case, enormous quantities of time, effort, cost and tenacity were applied to this question.  The Banks and Ferrero used distinguished accountants as forensic experts to present their respective arguments by reference to numerous lever arch files of supporting documentation.  For his part, Mr Abidali advanced his own arguments, based in particular upon Aksu Gida’s inspection records deriving from an apparent stock-take conducted at the supposed time of the transfer of the hazelnuts from Başkan Gida at the end of January 2002.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> I am acutely conscious that a trial judge should not leave issues of fact unresolved merely because, on his analysis, they are unnecessary for his decision, if there is a real risk that a higher court might take a different view of the law, or of other facts forming part of the analysis.  I have however concluded that no useful purpose would be served in the present case by my attempting to determine this very difficult question with any precision.  My reasons are as follows.  First, for the question how many of the hazelnuts released from Warehouse 2 formed part of Aksu Gida or Başkan Yuksel’s sales to Ferrero to matter it would be necessary for a higher court to form a different view not merely of the applicable principles of Turkish law, but of my factual conclusions that Ferrero knew neither of the Master Trust Receipt, nor of the Master Pledge Agreement, such that knowing receipt cannot be proved, nor the absence of good faith within the meaning of Article 3 of the Turkish Civil Code.  Secondly, if a higher court was to take a different view from mine as to those two factual questions, it seems to me very likely that a different view would also have been taken of Ferrero’s liability as an unlawful means conspirator.  It is only if I were upheld on conspiracy, but reversed on knowing receipt or good faith under Article 3, that it would be necessary to decide this outstanding factual question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the answer to this question does not depend to any material extent upon my view of the relative credibility of witnesses who were cross-examined.  Neither of the forensic experts were cross-examined, mainly because pursuant to directions given at a case management conference, and upheld during the trial, no permission was given for the opinions of the forensic experts to be admissible as evidence, although I was invited to read them as helpful encapsulations of the parties’ respective submissions on the issue.  Similarly, Mr Abidali’s case on this issue was set out in a verified statement of case rather than in a witness statement largely because, again, he had no admissible first hand evidence of his own to contribute.  Mr Aslan’s evidence about the day to day handling of receipts and releases from Warehouse 2 was mainly uncontentious, and none of the relevant employees of Başkan Gida or Aksu Gida were called.  The result is that the determination of the issue depends upon the weighing of argument based upon documents of widely varying degrees of reliability.  It follows that, in the unlikely event that this issue needs to be determined, it can be done by means of an inquiry based upon submissions and documents, without the need for oral evidence, and without the risk of there having to be a retrial.  </p>

The reports were attached to the prospectus and spoke in glowing terms of the mine, but had in fact been prepared for the intending vendors of the mine rather than for the purchasing company.  The Court of Appeal, reversing Romer J, held that since it had never occurred to the directors that the prospectus would be read by intending investors as meaning that the directors had themselves commissioned the report (which, objectively, it plainly did mean) they could not be held liable for deceit.  Their conduct was described as grossly negligent, but in those days that gave rise to no liability.  Negligence may therefore consist not merely of a failure to apply due care in checking the truth or otherwise of a representation made, but also in a careless failure to appreciate the objective meaning of the statement made.</p>

The question whether a representation has that continuing character depends in every case upon the context in which it is made.  An inference to that effect will readily be drawn where the representor is seeking to induce a contract between himself and the representee: see for example <span style="text-decoration:underline">With v. O’Flanagan</span> [1936] Ch 575, in particular where the claim is for rescission of the contract subsequently made.

He may, of course, rely on other things as well.  What operates on his mind, or motivates him, or influences him to act as he does, may be a number of things, some operating more or less strongly, one perhaps predominating… But, as long as a misrepresentation plays a real and substantial part, though not by itself a decisive part, in inducing a plaintiff to act, it is a cause of his loss and he relies on it, no matter how strong or how many are the other matters which play their part in inducing him to act.”</p>

Where a claimant seeks information about a particular aspect of a contemplated transaction, (rather than general advice as to its wisdom), the defendant is, in general, not liable for loss which the claimant would still have suffered even if the information provided had been true.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">  The giving of a trade reference to a bank contemplating lending to the subject of the reference is a paradigm example of the provision of information about, rather than advice as to the wisdom of, a contemplated transaction, to which the BBL principle applies.  It is sometimes called the scope of duty principle, but even Lord Hoffmann has now recognised that this label is less than ideal: see (2005) 121 LQR 592, at 596.  The BBL principle simply limits the extent of the loss for which the maker of the negligent statement is held by the law to be liable by excluding all that loss caused by the recipient’s reliance upon the negligent statement which the recipient would have suffered even if the statement had been true.  Sometimes the limitation operates by way of type of loss, sometimes by limiting its amount.  It is sometimes described as a cap on the claimant’s loss by reference to the liability which the maker of the negligent misstatement would have incurred, had he made it by way of contractual warranty.  The BBL case was itself about liability for breach of a contractual duty of care.  Nonetheless the BBL principle has been applied by analogy to cases of purely tortious liability, most recently in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Calvert v. William Hill</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 1427.  It would be extraordinary if the voluntary provider of a gratuitous trade reference was subjected to a wider liability than a person who provided the same information for reward.</p>

That would in my judgment impose an entirely unreasonable burden on the provider of a gratuitous trade reference.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded in my findings of fact that this trade reference contained a single misrepresentation, namely that Başkan Gida provided shipments to the Ferrero operating companies on a timely basis, and that this misrepresentation was made negligently, rather than fraudulently, by Mr Casale because, like the defendant directors in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Angus v.

In my judgment the Framework Contract did not contain continuing representations.  The context in which it was made was that Mr Casale had rejected a much more detailed draft contract, with elaborate provisions about variation, termination and arbitration, on the basis that Ferrero Industrial was prepared to do no more than sign a brief statement setting out the basis of Ferrero’s then contractual arrangements with Başkan Gida, provided that it involved Ferrero entering into no new obligations or altering the way in which it then did business with Başkan Gida.  In substance therefore, the Framework Contract was to constitute no more than a snapshot as at the date of its signature of the way in which Ferrero and Başkan Gida did business, leaving the parties entirely free to vary their arrangements thereafter, or to alter the pattern of their trading, even if that involved no alteration in its underlying terms and conditions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, there are two reasons why the Banks cannot have regarded the Framework Contract as containing continuing representations, such that they expected any alteration of the terms or pattern of trading to be notified to them by Ferrero thereafter.  The first is that the 45 Day Lie contained a description of a significantly different pattern of trading than that set out in the Framework Contract, yet it was unaccompanied by any notification to the Banks from Ferrero that any such change had occurred.  Secondly and more importantly, when the Banks sought during the negotiation of the Acknowledgments of Assignment to impose an obligation on Ferrero not to change its terms of trading with Başkan Gida without the Banks’ consent, this was roundly rejected by Mr Casale.  Ferrero thereby made it clear to the Banks that it reserved the right to change the terms of trading with Başkan Gida at any time, so the Banks cannot have entered into the Facility in reliance upon any assumption, one way or the other, as to the terms or pattern of trading which was then, or which might during the currency of the Facility be agreed upon between Ferrero and Başkan Gida, by way of departure from the snapshot summarised in the Framework Contract.</p>

Since Mr Casale eventually acknowledged in evidence that he expected that all contracts which Ferrero was asked to sign after the completion of the Facility were likely to be used by the Başkans for the obtaining of funds under the Facility, I consider that, exceptionally, these contracts may be taken as documents containing representations not merely to the counterparty, Başkan Gida, but also to the Banks.

The context was only that shortly beforehand, Başkan Gida and the Banks had entered into a Facility Agreement pursuant to which Başkan Gida would be likely to wish to raise money on the strength of contracts entered into after completion of the Facility, so that it might wish to re-make an earlier unperformed contract so as to bring it within the range of contracts pursuant to which, under the Facility, the Banks were prepared to lend.  In those circumstances it seems to me quite immaterial whether the apparently new contract followed on from some earlier unperformed contract, provided that, as conventionally represented by the new contract, the parties to it intended, as from the date which it bore, to comply with the obligations therein stated.</p>

Accordingly, if notwithstanding the signed contract, the parties secretly agreed that they would continue to adhere, as between themselves, to some quite different period, then the signed contract might be capable of containing a misrepresentation.  The question in each of the cases where a misrepresentation as to delivery period is alleged, is whether following the signing of the relevant contract, any previously agreed different delivery period was regarded by the parties as remaining part of their bargain.</p>

However careless Mr Casale may have been in not checking the delivery period, Ferrero Italy could not have been heard to say that it could refuse to accept delivery of any of that balance, upon the basis that the delivery period originally specified in September had already passed.  Accordingly, there was in my judgment no mis-statement of the delivery period in Contract 5094 and, since it relates only to a balance outstanding from an earlier contract, it cannot be regarded, objectively, as representing by implication that it was the consequence of some fresh purchase order.  The only representation made in it was that, as at 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, Ferrero Italy was obliged to take delivery of 192mt of hazelnuts of the type and quality specified in the contract, if tendered at any time in the period December 2001 to March 2002.

The contract numbers, dates, quantities, specification and price all remain the same.  The alterations relied upon by the Banks related to the delivery period.  For Contract 5088 it was originally “during March 2002/April 2002 from origin” and was changed to “from December 2001 through March 2002”.

They were in fact signed not by Mr Casale but by the respective responsible officers of the two operating companies, on Mr Casale’s instructions and, on the basis that there survives no allegation of dishonesty against either of them, the natural consequence is that they thereby committed their respective companies to taking delivery of the subject matter of those two contracts within the altered periods specified.  It is as a practical matter inconceivable that either company would have refused delivery within the earlier period rendered permissible by the alteration, and the altered contracts did not in any event compel Başkan Gida to make delivery at any time earlier than the last day of the altered period under each contract.  Nor would the Banks, if acting prudently in accordance with the terms of the Facility, have lent money on either of these contracts unless and until supported by pro-forma invoices in respect of deliveries planned within the 45 day period between advance and repayment specified by the Facility Agreement.</p>

In deciding to lend money on the strength of those contracts, the Banks appear to have been entirely unconcerned whether the contracts were the result of entirely new purchase orders, or rather for the balance outstanding under earlier contracts, whether the delivery periods were different from periods earlier agreed, or whether they had or had not been made in conformity with the pattern of trading described in the Framework Contract.

He also obtained the admission from Mr Lewis that, even if Ferrero had qualified its trade reference by saying that it believed that Başkan Gida was in financial difficulty, but that if the Banks lent to it, Ferrero would be happy to continue trading with it, then the Banks would probably have lent.  The implication from that exchange is that the Banks were looking to Ferrero’s Trade Reference as an indication that it was happy to continue trading with Başkan Gida, rather than looking to each individual part of it, as a separate factor relevant to the decision whether or not to lend.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question whether the Banks can be said to have relied upon the representation as to timeliness in the December Letter is complicated by the fact that it was the second of two, and that the representation was true when originally made in July, but untrue when repeated in December.  If one asks whether it would have made any difference to the Banks’ decision if there had been no reference to timeliness in either of the two Letters, but merely a truthful reference to quality in both, the answer is, as a matter of factual inference, that it probably would not.  Conversely, if the question is whether the removal from the December Letter of an earlier plaudit about timeliness in the July Letter would have made any difference, a careful comparison between the two would probably have set alarm bells ringing, if only to a muted extent.  The application of the test “did the claimant have the misrepresentation actively in his mind when making his decision” would thus produce a negative answer under the first analysis, but possibly a positive answer under the second.</p>

This being a paradigm case of the provision of information rather than advice as to the merits of the Banks’ contemplated transaction, the question is:  would the Banks have suffered the same loss if the representation as to timeliness had been true?  The Banks’ loss was caused not by any tardiness in the making by Başkan Gida of deliveries of hazelnuts to Ferrero, but by the Başkans’ commission of a series of deliberate premeditated frauds.  They began with the invoicing and trust receipt fraud, included fraudulent trading, and were completed by the transfer of Başkan Gida’s remaining assets (other than its freehold land) to a front company masquerading as independent from the Başkans, by means of a preference which was dishonestly concealed by the false creation of an impression of creditor pressure.</p>

Mr Wardell tried hard to persuade me that, in addition to that common cause, the truth about Başkan Gida’s delivery performance would have revealed the company’s financial difficulties as its underlying cause, and thereby presented to the Banks a picture of a company inherently more likely to be affected by management fraud, than would a company in financial health.</p>

First, the question is not whether the Banks would have been put on inquiry as to a risk of fraud if Ferrero had told the truth, but rather whether if Başkan Gida had maintained a satisfactory delivery record against contractual obligations during the two months prior to 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, the fraud on the Banks would not otherwise have occurred.

In this context it is important to bear in mind that the negligence proved consisted not of any failure by Ferrero to conduct some deeper investigation into the underlying causes of Başkan Gida’s deteriorating delivery performance, but in Mr Casale’s failure to appreciate that the statement in the December Letter as to timeliness had an objective meaning other than that which he intended to convey.  For those reasons, the Banks’ limited case in negligent misrepresentation would fall at the BBL hurdle, even if it were to survive the application of the test of reliance.</p>

Its outcome is therefore dependent upon the trial process in a more fundamental way than the issue as to the destination of the hazelnuts released from Warehouse 2, and if the contributory negligence question were to matter, it would require a re-trial of a part of this case which lasted several weeks before me.  I consider it therefore appropriate, even if not strictly necessary, to deal with the contributory negligence issues, upon the hypothesis that the Banks have, contrary to my view, established a vicarious liability of Ferrero Industrial for Mr Casale’s negligent mis-statement in the December Letter.</p>

The apportionment required by the application of section 1(1) of the 1945 Act requires me to assume hypothetically, contrary to my conclusion, that Ferrero Industrial both caused and incurred legal responsibility for the Banks’ loss, but that hypothetical approach provides little assistance in any assessment of Ferrero’s proportionate responsibility, causal potency, or blameworthiness.  The best I can do is to identify those blameworthy respects in which the Banks caused their own loss, to identify the degree of blame which ought to be attached, and the causal potency of that conduct in absolute rather than relative terms, and then leave it to any higher court which might form a different view about Ferrero’s responsibility to carry out the necessary apportionment.</p>

Since no such inquiries were made, and the evidence included no qualified expert opinion as to what their outcome might have been, it is a matter of speculation whether the Banks would, on further inquiry, have been so satisfied.  In my judgment, and having regard to the fact that by then Başkan Gida was insolvent, and to the less than perfect security structure available, I consider that the prospect that the Banks would have been satisfied is slightly less than even.

The document ended, under a section headed “RESULT” (to which reference is made on the front page under the heading “CONCLUSION”), with statements by the auditor that the accounts as settled by the company did not conform with the General Directives of Accounting Applications and Accounting Standards (applicable in Turkey), and reference was then made to tables showing what, if adjusted so as to conform with those standards, the relevant figures should have been.  Those tables were contained in an earlier section headed “ACCOUNTING CONTROL”, clearly identified in the Result section, and were preceded by a more detailed explanation of the reasons for the adjustments which the auditor considered it necessary to make.  It is readily apparent from the Accounting Control section of the accounts that the main reason for the downward adjustments which the auditor regarded as necessary was the inappropriate treatment in the company’s accounts of financial expenditure, including exchange losses incurred on foreign currency loans.</p>

Notwithstanding his evident sympathy for the Banks, having to deal with accounts in an unfamiliar foreign form, Mr Bryant also readily accepted that the Banks’ failure to appreciate that the audited accounts did show negative net equity and a trading loss in the auditor’s opinion was negligent. </p>

Nonetheless, a serious financial weakness in the borrower creates the operational risk that it may go out of business during the currency of the Facility, thereby bringing to a halt the stream of merchandise, the delivery of which triggers the off-taker’s payment liability.  If the music stops in that way during the currency of the facility, it is almost inevitable that the lender will suffer a loss, unless fully secured at all times, which in the present case, the Banks were not, even in the absence of fraud.</p>

Since the necessary expert advice from an independent Turkish accountant had not been obtained, even by the time of trial, and since none of the Banks’ witnesses, including Mr Bryant, however distinguished, had the necessary specialist Turkish accounting expertise, I was provided with no reliable information upon which to assess the strength or weakness of that analysis.  It certainly sounded persuasive in the mouth of Mr Graham, who was in all respects a most impressive witness, but even he acknowledged that the outcome of any sufficiently diligent inquiry as to the implications of the auditor’s opinion had to be a matter of speculation.  He readily acknowledged that, in the absence of a satisfactory outcome to that inquiry, after a proper study of the audited accounts, the Facility would not have proceeded.</p>

The weakness of that case arises from the undoubted fact that Başkan Gida was by then commercially, if not hopelessly, insolvent, having by October 2001 resorted to defrauding its Turkish banks. It seems to me that, consistent with Mr Graham’s own view, it would be wrong to treat the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome to that inquiry as being more than speculative.</p>

Thus the Banks’ primary security was to consist of hazelnuts in Warehouse 2 with a cost price approximately equivalent to the amount advanced followed, during the short period necessary for processing, by a trust of the nuts released for that purpose.  The Master Trust Receipt provided in terms that the nuts would be sold only to a buyer to which Başkan Gida was not indebted, with the entire proceeds of such a sale being paid immediately to the Banks, or (if Başkan Gida was indebted) only on terms that the buyer would pay the Banks directly without deduction or setoff.  The intent was that the nuts would only be sold to Ferrero, as is evidenced by the fact that upon any release, Başkan Gida had to provide pro-forma invoices to Ferrero “which must domicile payment to the Collection Account”: see Schedule 10 to the Facility Agreement, setting out the operating procedures.  </p>

But on about 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2001, Mr Byles learned that, on average, only 70% of any consignment purchased by Başkan Gida and pledged to the Banks would be of sufficient quality for on-sale to Ferrero, and that the remaining 30% would have to be swapped or sold in the market by Başkan Gida in order to obtain replacement nuts (or the money to buy replacement nuts) of sufficient quality to complete the Ferrero order.  The 30% would therefore fall out of the security structure and, since they would be sold or swapped on terms which did not lead to immediate payment of the proceeds of sale to the Banks, would perforce have to be dealt with otherwise than in accordance with the Master Trust Receipt.

Furthermore, since the security structure in the facility as eventually agreed was not adjusted to accommodate the problem, the result was that, even in the absence of a fraud, Başkan Gida would have had to embark upon the process of buying, processing and selling hazelnuts in a manner which inevitably conflicted with the terms of the Facility Agreement, and the Master Trust Receipt in particular.  Plainly, that ought not to have happened, and the fact that it did inevitably reflects blame upon the Banks in failing fully to appreciate the manner in which the transactions which they intended to finance were on a day to day basis and had for many years been conducted.</p>

The evidence as to the way in which the 30% problem was actually presented, in particularly orally by Melih Başkan to Mr Byles and Mr Lewis, together with the application of common-sense, suggests that the 30% problem would not in practice have been addressed by Başkan Gida in that mechanical way.  A trader knowing that a 100mt of hazelnuts purchased for processing and resale to Ferrero would leave only 70mt of the requisite specification would not buy a 100 tonnes to meet a 100 tonne order.  He would increase his purchase to accommodate the necessary attrition attributable to sub-standard nuts.</p>

Ferrero’s case is that the Banks should have, but failed to, put in place a system of monitoring of the progress of nuts from the moment of release from Warehouse 2 until delivery to Ferrero, the progress of the delivery of final (rather than pro-forma) invoices to Ferrero and the progress of Ferrero’s payments pursuant to those invoices.  It is common ground that the Banks did not do so.  This arose in part from the absence of any monitoring provisions to that effect in the Facility documentation, and in part from the fact that, even in the absence of contract, the Banks did nothing internally to put in place procedures which would have enabled that monitoring to take place, once draw-downs started to be made under the Facility.  That involves, incidentally, no criticism of those responsible for the day to day process such as Mr Parello and Mr Wenden of BTM, who were simply following orders.

Even if it was, I consider that the improbability that such a warning to Ferrero would have been of any real use to the Banks means that its causative potency was slight.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The outcome of the foregoing analysis is that the Banks were in my judgment blameworthy in respect of three out of the four surviving items in Ferrero’s list, and that in respect of two of them, namely the audited accounts and the monitoring procedures, each failure was, independently of the other, of real causative potency.  Viewed separately, the failure properly to deal with the 30% problem probably was not, but in conjunction with the failure to appreciate the implications of the audited accounts, it adds a little to a case that, in the absence of contributory negligence, the Facility would not have proceeded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I return to an overall consideration of the Banks’ responsibility for their loss, bearing in mind that the primary cause was a premeditated fraud, against which facility structures and due diligence are generally inadequate protection, and bearing in mind that the elements of blameworthy failure which have prevailed stand as isolated exceptions in an otherwise thorough and detailed due diligence carried out over a lengthy period.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Viewed in that way, the Banks’ failures come nowhere near to constituting such a predominant cause of their loss as to displace any responsibility which might otherwise have attached to Ferrero.  On the other hand, they come much nearer to the heart of the matter than a negligent assertion by Ferrero that Başkan Gida deliveries were timely, which comes nowhere near it at all.  Abjuring as I do any deeper comparative analysis, because of the hypothetical difficulties to which it gives rise, I say only that a serious but not overwhelming case of contributory negligence has been established against the Banks.</p>
