	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Barings group collapsed in February 1995. The immediate cause was unauthorised trading conducted on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange by Mr Nicholas Leeson (“Leeson”), the General Manager of Baring Futures (Singapore) Ltd (“BFS”). Leeson’s trading on his 88888 account incurred losses amounting to £791 million.

Significant elements of this fault were the failure of BFS’ local management to supervise Leeson’s running of the BFS back office, the failure of management in London and Japan to understand his “switching” trading or question the high profits he reported and the lack of adequate risk monitoring.  Perhaps the most notable element of fault was BSL’s provision to Leeson from March 1994 onwards of funding which was not reconciled to trades or customers or supported by credible explanations, without any serious attempt to investigate the reasons why it was needed. In fact this funding was margining Leeson’s unauthorised trading.</p>

The claimants are three of the Barings Group companies acting by their liquidators. The first is Barings plc (“Plc”), the holding company of the Barings Group. The second is Bishopscourt (BS) Ltd, at all material times called BSL, a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands but based in London and registered as an overseas company in England &amp; Wales.

It was the futures trading company of the Group on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (“SIMEX”).

The first is that in which Plc and BSL are claimants, “the Plc action”, commenced by two writs issued and served in 1996 and 1998 which have been consolidated. In the Plc action the claimants claimed against the partners in the accountancy firm known as D&amp;T, carrying on business in Singapore, part of a world-wide group of partnerships known as Deloitte &amp; Touche. The claim against them is in negligence arising out of their audit of the Barings Group consolidation balances of BFS and BFS statutory accounts for the year to 30 September 1992 (“the 1992 audit”) and for the 15 month period to 31 December 1993 (“the 1993 audit”).

The breach of duty alleged against C&amp;LS arose from their audit of consolidation schedules and statutory accounts of BFS for the year to 31 December 1994 (“the 1994 audit”). The breach of duty alleged against C&amp;LL arose from their audit of Plc’s and BSL’s statutory accounts for 1992, 1993 and 1994 and of the Group accounts for those years.

BSL conducted securities and futures trading, both on behalf of customers and on its own account. It had strong positions in the Asian equity markets, particularly in Japan. In the late 1980s it made significant profits dealing in Japanese equity warrants, and it opened new offices and expanded into new markets.

A trader reported to the head of his particular trading activity (“his product head”), via a product reporting line.

I should express two qualifications to this. Firstly, Mr Gamby denied, before the Singapore inspectors and in the CDDA proceedings, any responsibility for settlements at BFS. This denial was rejected by Jonathan Parker J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Barings plc (No. 5)</span>. Secondly, Mr Bowser denied before me that, while he was BSL Derivatives Controller and so head of Settlements at BSL between March 1992 and November 1993, he had any responsibility for settlements outside BSL.

It was headed by Mr Ron Baker, who joined Barings in April 1992, from Bankers Trust International. Ms Mary Walz, who had been one of his colleagues at Bankers Trust, joined Barings at about the same time to work with Mr Baker. Mr Baker was very successful in establishing that operation and acquired a high reputation in BB&amp;Co. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The method by which Barings staff were remunerated had an important impact upon the events which led to the collapse of the Barings group. In each year of account, half of the group profit (for 1993, as I held in the strike-out application, the Plc and BSL groups were treated separately) was set aside for the payment of bonuses to staff over and above their nominal salaries. From this fund there would be allotted to each business group, by senior management, a part of the fund, the size of which depended upon the relative success of that group in generating revenue in that year. This in turn would then be shared out among the members of that group in accordance with an assessment of the contribution of each to the success of the group. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Typically the remuneration of a member of a successful group would primarily consist of this bonus, which might be several times the size of his nominal salary. It will be seen that this system of remuneration had a corrosive effect on Barings management generally. It gave rise to competition between groups to include among their number particular “star” earners; obstruction of the free flow of information about trading between groups, and between groups and senior management; and the pampering and protection of “stars”, in particular Leeson, for fear that they might take their services elsewhere.</p>

There were differences in the terms of the contracts between Singapore and Japan: for example, a Nikkei 225 tradeable futures unit on Osaka was defined as 1000 times the Nikkei 225 price, whereas a unit on SIMEX was only 500 times that price, so SIMEX units were half the size of Osaka units. A “tick”, which was the basic amount of the movement up or down in the price of a futures contract, was worth four times as much on the Osaka market as on SIMEX (¥2,500 on SIMEX and ¥10,000 on Osaka). Also the margining requirements of the Japanese exchanges were more onerous than those of SIMEX. This was a major reason for the move of business from the Japanese exchanges to SIMEX which was under way from 1992 onwards.</p>

Thus a broker such as BFS, which was a clearing member of SIMEX, when entering into such a contract on behalf of a customer, contracted as a principal with SIMEX. In turn, SIMEX as principal contracted with the counterparty’s broker. Therefore, subject to any right to be indemnified by its customer, the broker was individually liable for due performance of that contract. Such was, of course, also the position where the broker contracted on its own behalf or on behalf of a related company, i.e. when trading “in-house”.</p>

The profits and losses on all open contracts were aggregated. If the market had moved adversely to the member’s positions overall, the member was required to pay the net loss as “settlement variation” (sometimes referred to as variation margin). This protected SIMEX against the member’s increased exposure to loss. If the market had moved in favour of the member’s positions overall, its settlement variation requirement would reduce, reflecting the member’s reduced exposure to loss.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This treatment of options was significant in Leeson’s concealment of his fraud. Leeson conducted his unauthorised trading through a BFS account numbered 88888. In order to conceal his unauthorised trading on the 88888 account, which was consistently loss-making, Leeson needed to bring the balance on the account to nil over any relevant reporting date (balances had to be reported at month-ends, for the purpose of preparing monthly management accounts for BFS; and at accounting reference dates, auditors required confirmations by clients of any positive or negative balance shown on any account). As explained below, one means by which Leeson did this was to sell options on the 88888 account, funding the margins required out of excess margins held, BFS’ overdraft and, from February 1994, out of the Dollar Funding. On the sale of an option, the 88888 account was credited by CONTAC with the premium. But until it was exercised, that was the only effect of the sale of the option on the 88888 account equity balance. The equity balance: </p>

Had anyone looked at the daily or monthly activity statement for the account, he would have seen a huge and growing margin requirement at lines (ix), (x) and (xi) of the calculation described at paragraph 113 above. But the equity balance, which was the figure reflected in overall CONTAC balances, was, when it mattered, nil (enabling Leeson to avoid having the auditors require the balance on the 88888 account to be confirmed by a customer). Only if an option was exercised against Leeson did CONTAC at that point debit the loss to the account, as a realised loss.</p>

In relation to customer trades, such a reconciliation is necessary because the broker needs to know whose customer moneys it holds, and from whom it needs to call margin and in what amounts. Further, in cases where margin is to be paid to the exchange by the broker before the requisite funds have been collected from the customer, the broker needs to be able to satisfy itself that the credit risk (i.e. the risk of the customer defaulting) is acceptable.   </p>

There were in 1991 serious problems in reconciling customer margins, with many large outstanding unreconciled balances. BSL had bought the First Futures system in 1989, and it took some time to develop it to the point at which it met BSL’s needs in a satisfactory manner. Thus it could not calculate customer margins on business transacted on the Japanese exchanges until mid-1992.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">BSL could have installed such a PC-SPAN system when BFS was activated, to calculate margins on SIMEX, but it did not. According to Mr Bowser’s evidence, this was because at that time the priority for BSL’s IT department was development of a system allowing First Futures to calculate margins on the Japanese exchanges: as I have mentioned, BSJ could not calculate margins at the customer level and BSL’s existing system for calculating the margin due from individual customers was highly unreliable. BFS could and did calculate margins at the customer level. Therefore installation of SPAN software in London to calculate SIMEX margins for what was at the time expected to be a low-volume office did not seem essential. The expedient solution was to rely on BFS’ margin data without checking it. It was no doubt also relevant that at the time SIMEX, which had introduced SPAN only in March 1992, was the only exchange in the Far East to use it and BSL did not use SPAN in London until September 1992<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="68">

Indeed, he did abuse the Funding Spreadsheet in January and February 1994, by failing to give credit for dollar collateral sent to BFS on behalf of customers (see paragraph 325 below). However after that point, when Leeson needed extra margin from February 1994 onwards to finance his unauthorised trading, he requested it, and was sent it, outside the standard system (see paragraph 330 below). </p>

By the beginning of 1992, a substantial number of Mr Killian’s F&amp;O agency customers were expressing a preference to have their business transacted on SIMEX rather than the Japanese exchanges. Futures and options on the Nikkei 225 contract could be traded on SIMEX as well as the Japanese exchanges and margin costs and commissions were lower on SIMEX. By 1992, a substantial proportion of Barings’ agency business was being executed by Chase Manhattan on SIMEX. Mr Killian’s perception was that this flow of business to SIMEX away from the Japanese exchanges would continue.

It also seems unlikely that, if Leeson’s intentions had been fraudulent from the outset, he should have removed the 88888 account from the trade feed but not from the margin feed.</p>

Positions needed to be rolled over because a Nikkei futures contract only had a life of three months and matured at the quarter end in March, June, September or December. Consequently, if a client or house book wanted to maintain an existing futures position it had to be rolled over to the next contract period before expiry. As Mr Killian explained “<span style="font-style:italic">a roll... involves effectively closing out the near contract and purchasing a far contract to replace it</span>”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="101">
		<p class="EndnoteText"> day 108 page 124</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Market makers on SIMEX offered rolls as a single trade whereby they would buy (say) September futures at x and sell an equivalent number of December futures at y. The difference between x and y would be the spread and represent the cost to the customer in rolling over his position. There was, therefore, a prevailing price for rolls on SIMEX which could be bought as a single trade without the necessity for the order filler to take any directional risk (that is, risk that the market would move during the roll operation) or execution risk (that is, the risk of an error in implementing the order).</p>

Mr Killian’s evidence was that he understood Leeson to be beating the spread price by carrying out the two trades independently. He had done the same himself as a trader<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="103">

The trader sells the product on the market on which the price is higher and buys an equal quantity of the same product on the other market where the price is lower. As long as he effects the two transactions (the two “legs” of the arbitrage) as nearly as possible simultaneously, the strategy is one of low market risk. The price differential is <span style="font-style:italic">“captured”</span> once the two markets converge and the price of the product is the same on both markets, whichever way the markets may have moved in the meantime.     </p>

Both these variants involve straightforward directional trading, that is, gambling on the directional movement of the market. In both cases, a properly-run bank or broker would limit the extent of the positions which the trader was permitted to have open, either in the course of a day’s trading or overnight.   </p>

This is to be compared with the total revenue for the whole of FPG in 1994 of £62 million, of the entire Bank Group of £84.4 million, and the whole of BIB of £406.6 million. Thus Leeson’s reported switching revenues amounted to 59% of FPG’s revenue, 43% of the entire Bank Group’s and 9% of BIB’s during 1994.</p>

However it became clear in early 1994 that Leeson was initiating trades and managing risk himself (including an element of intra-day directional trading). Therefore Mr Norris obtained agreement that Leeson should be subject to his own risk limits and that his revenue should be split out from Mr Brindle’s volatility book. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Norris said that, while this debate was continuing, Leeson’s proprietary switching business was seen as falling within existing risk limits. Mr Brindle managed risk on the Nikkei switching within the limit on his volatility book. BB&amp;Co managed risk on the JGB switching, when that started in April 1994, within its overall limit for JGB-linked trading (as was stated in the Risk Committee minute recording the start of JGB switching<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="204">
		<p class="EndnoteText"> G33/19</p>
	      </authorialNote>). However it was clearly appropriate that the trader managing the risk should be subject to his own, appropriately-set limits: Mr Brindle’s limits, based on maximum loss, were difficult to apply to an arbitrage business, for which a limit based on a maximum number of open contracts was appropriate. Hence the imposition in June 1994 of formal risk limits on Leeson’s switching business<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="205">

The booking of fictitious trades to the 88888 account seems to have begun in July 1992 and continued and increased in parallel with Leeson’s unauthorised trading.  </p>

This reconciliation was intended to check that BFS’ record corresponded with SIMEX’s. During this process, Leeson frequently caused adjustments to be made to the prices and quantities of trades, either by annotating the trade blotters or by giving instructions direct to the back-office staff. The effect of these adjustments was to corrupt BFS’ records, and consequently the information sent to other Barings parties, so as to produce a false picture of exceptionally profitable trading. Although these adjustments started to be made in very significant numbers from August 1993, occasional adjustments were made earlier in 1993.</p>

These were entered into the CONTAC system and had the effect of reducing the total long positions reported to SIMEX. Doing this reduced the margin called from BFS by SIMEX. In her witness statement, Miss Hassan suggested that she began booking these fictitious trades in account 88888 in 1994, but CONTAC records indicate that the practice dates back to the start of Leeson’s unauthorised trading on the 88888 account.</p>

In 1992 the position is slightly less clear, in that in the course of that audit Miss Koo traced the receipt of the ¥670m through to an 88888 account daily activity statement (see paragraph 596 below). Therefore it may be that Leeson only began destroying the daily activity statements after that audit. The monthly activity statements were only printed out on Leeson’s request and were given to him. </p>

BSL entered the payment in its books on that date, but Leeson caused it to be credited to the 88888 account in BFS’ books as received on 30 September. The result was that the deficit in the 88888 account was cancelled out, leaving a small credit balance of ¥5.6m for which Leeson forged a confirmation from BSL.

The entry credited to the 88888 account an amount equal to the balance on that account (thereby reducing the balance to zero) and debited the same amount to the “bank funds receivable” account in CONTAC. Leeson directed the BFS staff to print out the report of end-of-month balances from CONTAC for entry into the SUN system after these fictitious entries had been made, and then to reverse them the following day. </p>

This allowed him to alter the records of his own trading and to create records of fictitious trades.

Mr Killian and Mr Gueler, whom Mr Jones believed to be supervising Leeson’s trading activities, were not doing so.

Leeson’s use of the overdraft to fund continuing negative balances on the 88888 account in late 1993 and early 1994 was a breach of its terms and led to a letter of complaint from the Citibank manager to Mr Jones on 18 February 1994<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="252">

His solution was to request from BSL, and later also from BSLL, the Dollar Funding which I discuss in detail below. Leeson continued to use the excess of margins and other sources of funds identified above, but requested Dollar Funding to meet the difference between those funds and the amount required for margin on BFS’ positions, including the 88888 account<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="253">

These consisted of margin on trades conducted by BFS on behalf of BSJ and profit on those trades which BFS did not repay to BSJ. In relation to the switching business, there was an equal and opposite loss-making trade on a Japanese exchange for every profitable trade on SIMEX. When BFS failed to pay over the profits on the SIMEX trades, which occurred especially in January and February 1995, BSJ ended up borrowing heavily from its banks in order to fund its own loss-making positions<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="255">

However this payment was not put to Mr Hawes, and it seems unlikely that Mr Leeson would have made a separate and unrelated request for US$32 million on the same date as Mr Jones’ fax. The existing daylight facility would not have met the difficulty referred to in Mr Jones’ fax if Mr Jones told Mr Hawes that the funds were needed for more than one day. Furthermore, unlike the later Dollar Funding payments requested by Leeson, the US$32 million was deducted from BSL’s normal yen margin due on that day. The balance of probability is therefore that on the 9 February 1994 Leeson persuaded Mr Jones to make a request for US$32 million, in order to make good a shortfall of funds available to Leeson to finance his unauthorised trading.  </p>

As the Dollar Funding increased, so did the shortfall shown on the K2/P4 line. On 30 June 1994 it was £120 million. As at 24 February 1995 it stood at £306 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="275">

But if his explanation is correct, and if BSL had investigated the K2/P4 line further at that time, they need only have compared the total margin required from customers (a total certainly available from First Futures) with the total margin paid by customers plus any debtors. The difference would represent the extent to which customers were trading against the security of non-cash collateral. Comparing that difference with the K2/P4 line would demonstrate that by March 1994 non-cash collateral explained only part, and a decreasing part, of the K2/P4 line. The remainder was the Dollar Funding.</p>

The first strand in time is the investigation in April and May 1993 into the K2/P4 line, thrown up by the solo consolidation exercise. The second is the enquiry as to the reasons for the Dollar Funding, which Leeson began requesting on 1 March 1994. The third is a series of attempts beginning in May 1994, to obtain a reasonably accurate division of how much had been, or was being, advanced for the purpose of financing house trading and how much to finance customer trading. The principal reason for these latter enquiries was concern that Barings’ large exposure reporting to the Bank of England did not reveal accurately the exposure of BSL to SIMEX as a result of margin deposited for house trading. </p>

Although Mr Hawes believed that Miss Henderson’s successor was continuing the exercise, that proved not to be the case and no further investigation of the reason for the K2/P4 line took place for over a year.</p>

Therefore loans to them could not account for the K2/P4 balance. She believed that she had explained that to Mr Hawes and that he had approved the loans, as she had told him of Leeson’s explanations of why he needed the money and debated with Mr Hawes which account it should come from. Mrs Granger’s concern was, not that the funding was being called, but that it was being treated as customer funds: although BFS called BSJ a customer, actually it was house and so she felt that the money for their trading should come out of the house account<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="282">

Accordingly I accept D&amp;T’s submission that Mr Hawes knew of that connection in or before April 1994.

His questioning about this shortfall was a major factor causing Leeson to flee to Kuala Lumpur. </p>

As I have explained at paragraphs 325 to 329 above, it now appears that the position was more complicated than that. Most of the payments in January and February 1994 were genuine payments of customer funds but, because BSL paid twice over, still resulted in Leeson obtaining funds which he could use for unauthorised trading. The same applies to the two payments in which Mr Jones seems to have been involved. The first “classic” Leeson-initiated Dollar Funding request was on 1 March 1994, and there were no further BSL-initiated payments after that date.</p>

The “classic” Leeson-initiated Dollar Funding then began on 1 March. Including both the January and February payments and the Leeson-initiated Dollar Funding from March onwards, the total available to Leeson was US$125 million on 15 March. The total then dipped, but recovered to around US$100 million in mid-April. It again dipped until mid-May, but from 20 May onwards was well in excess of US$100 million. From 8 September 1994 and for the remainder of the year the total remained over US$150 million. As at 30 December 1994 the figure was US$205 million.

A substantive approach involved obtaining assurance as to the correctness of the financial statements by direct verification of the balances in those statements and of the transactions and documents underlying them. If adopting a controls-based approach, an auditor obtains assurance by testing the extent and operation of the internal controls which should detect or prevent errors in the financial statements. </p>

He said that a premium of ¥7.7 billion was due from SLK. On 2 February 1995 Leeson produced forged confirmations from SLK and BSL and a forged bank statement from Citibank, which appeared to show that SLK had repaid the ¥7.7 billion.

However as the trial proceeded, BFS reacted to the evidence from both factual and expert witnesses that it was usual in small broking firms for one person to be in charge of both front and back offices.

In addition to checking balances, D&amp;T should have checked that all open positions entered into by BFS were recorded in BFS’ books and authorised by customers. They should have done this by reconciling the open positions recorded by SIMEX against those confirmed by customers, as recommended by Mr Swinson.

The lack of segregation should have caused no concern as long as BFS was providing an execution-only service, rather than itself initiating trades, and D&amp;T had no reason to know in either 1992 or 1993 that Leeson was initiating trades.   </p>

Therefore D&amp;T were not obliged to devise specific procedures, such as that devised by Mr Swinson, to test for it. No relevant audit guideline or other professional practice guidance required such a test in the absence of any indication to the auditors that BFS’ financial statements were incomplete as a result of fraud, of which there was no indication. </p>

BFS, as a futures broker, was subject to a number of inherent risks. Many, such as the risk of errors in implementing clients’ instructions, are not relevant to this judgment. In this section I deal with two inherent risks which were alleged to have been relevant to D&amp;T’s audits of BFS: the risk of unauthorised trading, and the lack of segregation of duties (though the latter could also be categorised as a control risk which increased other risks). </p>

Unauthorised trading by a company’s trader which binds the company is a paradigm example of circumstances where this may occur. Where a trader knowingly enters into a trade which binds his employer which he knows he was not authorised to do (the position is different where he expects it to be ratified later), he will wish to conceal the trade by falsifying the company’s records.</p>

The possibility of misreporting means that checks by the customer or by risk control for unauthorised trades might be ineffective. And by, for example, reporting trades he has not done, a trader could obtain margin for unauthorised trades. Therefore lack of segregation must increase the risk of unauthorised trading.

However on his return Mr Hawes asked Mr Norris whether he was happy for Leeson to be effectively running BFS alone (though Mr Norris did not recall that). Mr Hawes agreed that he knew that Mr Jones was not responsible for settlements or trading. He said that Mr Jones had no knowledge of the detail of BFS’ affairs, save in the area of cash management, and it was a waste of time to ask him about them. At least later in 1994, Mr Hawes knew that Mr Jones was not fulfilling the role of a finance director for BFS either. Mr Hawes passed these impressions on to James Baker in mid-1994 in advance of the internal audit. Mr Baker’s note of 22 June recorded that:</p>

Therefore BFS always held, for futures trades, about 25% more margin than it had to deposit with SIMEX.

Undoubtedly Mr Jones should have been doing that, and it was a natural assumption that he would do so. But it was only an assumption, and not tested. An effective finance function would also not negate the risks posed by Leeson running both trading and settlements. It might have prevented a trader using the excess margins to trade with, but it would not necessarily prevent him finding funds by other means. For example, he might report fictitious trades to clients and call margin in respect of them to finance his own trading; or build up extensive positions using the profits from temporarily profitable trading, which could expose the company to large losses if the market turned against him.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Swinson’s evidence was that D&amp;T had to take the lack of segregation of duties into account in assessing the weight to be given to particular evidence, in particular explanations from Leeson. However he agreed with Mr Spence that in all other respects Leeson’s position was adequately dealt with by the decision to conduct a substantive audit. That position did not require the substantive audit procedures to be more rigorous, or the audit evidence stronger, than usual<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="415">

Otherwise an auditor would always be liable whenever a fraud occurs. By definition there would have been a risk of that fraud occurring and the auditor would have failed to devise procedures that detected it. That cannot be correct. </p>

Clearly the size of the risk is relevant to that assessment. This seems to me the planning process laid down in the D&amp;T manual and in my judgement was the correct approach.</p>

Mr Swinson’s evidence was that it was acceptable for BFS to send out the requests on faxes as it did, but that D&amp;T should have had the returns directed to them. Mr Spence said that in an intra-group context it was usual to rely on inter-company correspondence, so it was acceptable for the returns to go to BFS. Mr Mason, BFS’ expert on Singapore practice, supported him. In the light of that evidence, I do not find D&amp;T to have been at fault in allowing BFS to control the confirmation process.</p>

Mr Swinson gave evidence that, when auditing a futures broker, this required an auditor to obtain reasonable assurance that the brokers’ records agreed both with the exchange and with customers (to the extent that the broker was not trading on its own account). This was true for open positions as well as balances. Mr Spence agreed with the requirement to obtain reasonable assurance of the completeness of the records, and I think with its application to open positions, although he disagreed as to what test should be done to achieve that assurance. </p>

A broker trades as a principal on SIMEX. If it has entered into trades on SIMEX which a customer refuses to acknowledge, the broker is liable for those trades. Conversely, if its customer has instructed it to effect certain trades but it has not done so, it is liable to the customer for breach of contract. An auditor has to obtain reasonable assurance that liabilities of this kind which would affect the financial statements as reflecting a true and fair view of the audit client’s affairs have been disclosed to him. </p>

Mr Swinson suggested that D&amp;T should have compared the total positions shown on the SIMEX CMP schedule with the total positions shown on the customer confirmations. This would have ensured that all positions entered into by BFS were authorised by customers. Given BFS’ small number of customers, such a test would have been quick and reasonably cheap to complete.   </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This was because any transaction had an effect on the financial balances. I have explained at paragraphs 113 to 121 above how CONTAC dealt with futures and options trades. It will be evident from that that any transaction entered into on behalf of a customer had an immediate effect on the equity balance for that customer. Futures transactions gave rise to an immediate margin requirement which, when paid, increased the equity balance and to a continuing requirement for settlement variation which increased or reduced the equity balance. Option trades gave rise to an immediate realised profit or loss which affected the equity balance as the premium was debited (on a purchase) or credited (on a sale). On a sale, the seller had to put up margin which, when paid, increased the equity balance. Therefore, Mr Mah said, verifying the equity balance on an account verified whether or not there were open positions on that account: if the balance was nil, D&amp;T could feel satisfied that there would be no open positions on it.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Spence agreed with this logic. His evidence was that D&amp;T complied with their duty, to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial records were complete and that no unauthorised trading had taken place, by doing a fully substantive audit which covered all balances. The customer confirmation for each account with a positive or negative financial balance established that all positions on that account were authorised. The fact that the confirmations added up to the exact total of amounts owed to customers shown in CONTAC meant that it was reasonable for D&amp;T to believe that there were no other active accounts than those which had been confirmed. Mr Spence’s opinion was that D&amp;T were not obliged to do more unless they were specifically put on enquiry as to the risk of fraud and thus of the manipulation of balances<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="416">

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">BFS disagreed with this. First, it pointed out that, on a sale of an option, only the premium was reflected in the equity balance immediately. Margin was not reflected until paid, which might be late or never.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I heard much debate as to the chances of an account balance being nil despite having open positions on it, other than through deliberate manipulation. Mr Swinson’s expert report originally took the point that, when one looked at the trading general ledger produced by CONTAC for 31 December 1993, there were a large number of BFS accounts which had nil balances but clearly had open positions, since they showed a figure for settlement variation. Under cross-examination this proved to be a misapprehension. In fact all the accounts to which Mr Swinson referred were inactive accounts with no open positions. The only account which had a nil balance but open positions was the 88888 account. </p>

He said that nil was a number like any other, and the chances of a balance being nil by chance were no different to those of it being any other number. Mr Swinson’s position on this seemed to me unrealistic. His own logic indicated that he was wrong. The chances of a particular active account ending up at the accounting reference date with any particular balance, including a nil balance, are infinitesimal without deliberate manipulation. </p>

However in that case the auditor would carry out a controls-based, rather than a fully substantive, audit. Presumably he would devise tests that would check that those controls would produce complete records and detect unauthorised trades: that was not a question explored in evidence before me. But in this case D&amp;T were carrying out a substantive audit precisely because BFS was a small operation, with few customers, and that was why it was verifying the balance sheet by looking for external evidence. </p>

I have, at paragraph 543 above, reached the conclusion that unauthorised trading, and deliberate concealment of that unauthorised trading, were inherent risks in any audit of a futures broker. However in the case of BFS, all the experts agreed that there did not appear to be any specific risk of unauthorised trading. Mr Swinson accepted that the risk appeared low. I have further concluded, at paragraphs 572 and 573 above, that the procedure followed by D&amp;T would have detected any form of unauthorised trading save where it had been concealed by manipulation of the balances.</p>

Still less were D&amp;T obliged to devise procedures which had no other purpose than to detect one particular means by which fraudulent trading might be concealed. Mr Swinson’s test would have had no other purpose than that: he accepted that the only misstatement which his test would catch and D&amp;T’s approach would not was one where the balances had been fraudulently manipulated to zero. </p>

BFS’ argument here depended upon D&amp;T appreciating that the 88888 account was a principal account, rather than one of the many sub-accounts of the omnibus accounts (for example the BSL segregated account). Otherwise there was no more reason for them to obtain a confirmation for it than for any of those sub-accounts. Mr Swinson accepted that, in the 1994 audit, it was understandable for C&amp;LS not to confirm nil balances, where they believed the balances in question to be included in the omnibus accounts<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="420">

Therefore, Mr Brindle argued, D&amp;T knew it was a principal account. As such it should have been confirmed. Even though the balance on it was zero, that might be the result of fraudulent manipulation. It was also possible that the customer believed the balance to be something other than zero, but would not have the chance to correct BFS’ misapprehension if it was not asked.   </p>

They were presented with confirmations of balances from customers which added up in total to the exact figure shown in CONTAC for the balance owed to customers. That gave them reasonable assurance that all other accounts must be nil and therefore had no open positions. In the absence of any warning bells, there can be no reason to require them to obtain a confirmation of any such accounts. </p>

They checked the balances shown on CONTAC against both SIMEX’s records and customer confirmations. Given the level of risk which they had reasonably assessed to exist, that gave them reasonable assurance that (i) all transactions into which BFS had entered on SIMEX were reflected on CONTAC, (ii) BFS’ customers had authorised all transactions entered into on the accounts which were the subject of customer confirmations, (iii) those were the only active accounts and therefore (iv) the financial statements were complete. </p>

Therefore D&amp;T were not negligent in either the 1992 or the 1993 audit in failing to perform the test on open positions devised by Mr Swinson.</p>

The evidence of Mr Spence was that Miss Koo would have started with the six confirmations which BFS had sent to, and received back from, BSL and BSJ (or apparently had done so in the case of the forged confirmation of the 88888 account). These were for four BSL accounts (the segregated, non-segregated, house and 88888 accounts), and the two accounts for BSJ Tokyo and BSJ Osaka. The totals of the figures for <span style="font-style:italic">“account balance”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“variation margin”</span> on each account confirmation, all added together, equalled exactly the total figure for <span style="font-style:italic">“client payable”</span> in BFS’ trial balance.

She also knew that, for example, BFS and BSL agreed that, of that S$80.212m, S$61.6m was in respect of the BSL segregated account (though Miss Koo did not check this figure against CONTAC). This meant that, if Miss Koo believed that BFS had credited the ¥670m to BSL’s segregated account on 30 September (and thus included the ¥670m in the S$61.6m), she might infer that BSL had also treated the payment as made on 30 September (and so done the same).</p>

However the fax from BSL providing the confirmation for the segregated account was sent in two versions, at 13.46 and 15.10 respectively London time on 7 October. Singapore was eight hours ahead of London. Therefore it seems unlikely that Miss Koo saw the BSL confirmation for the segregated account on 7 October. So she would have been unable to conclude her work on the issue of liabilities to related companies until the following day.</p>

BFS however accepted an exception to this general rule in the case of payments between companies in the same group, in order to maintain consistency between the books of the paying and recipient companies. Thus BFS accepted that Miss Koo would have been justified in allowing BFS to treat the payment as having been received on 30 September 1992, and so in the period of the 1992 accounts, if she was satisfied that BSL was treating it as having been paid on that date.</p>

In particular, auditors should be alert to the risk of window-dressing as a result of payments or receipts taking place close to accounting reference dates, and this payment was just the sort of transaction which should have been investigated with that in mind. </p>

He contended that the ¥670m came within an exception to the conventions. He identified two possible exceptions. The first was that the payment was equivalent to an unbanked cheque, a suggestion which he put in his report but did not strenuously maintain before me. The second was that D&amp;T might have assumed that BSL had intended the payment to be made on 30 September and the late receipt was due to the time difference between London and Singapore.</p>

But they amount to little more than the expression of a common sense approach to accounting for receipts which I should have thought would be basic to any auditor’s approach. I was not shown any auditing textbooks but it seems fairly obvious, even to a layman, that a recipient of a payment should usually account for it on the date on which it is received. To do otherwise is to record an untruth. Likewise a payer should account for the payment on the date on which it is paid or intended to be paid. The experts agreed that, in an intra-group context, it is necessary that payer and payee should account for a payment on the same date and, depending on the method of payment, that may require a divergence from the usual rule. But the usual rule would be the auditor’s starting point.</p>

The credit seems to an outside eye a paradigm potential suspect for a window dressing transaction, given that it was between related companies, on the last day of the accounting period, and of a significant amount. Even Mr Mah admitted<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="443">

In that case, for BFS to account for the receipt on 1 October would lead to inconsistent treatments of the payment in the group consolidated accounts.

However I accept D&amp;T’s contention that the fax signified no more than that Citibank Singapore credited the payment to BFS’ account as of 1 October, and did not denote that the payment was expressly made for value 1 October. </p>

She might have obtained that evidence by contacting C&amp;LL, or raising the point with BSL. She did neither. The fact that BSL confirmed the balances for its accounts was consistent with the explanation that had been given by BFS. But the evidence of Mr Swinson, which I accept, was that it was not sufficiently clear evidence to rebut the concern that the payment was being recorded on a different date to that on which BSL had recorded it<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="453">

She had seen the daily activity statement recording the entry of the ¥670m into BFS’ books. I have found that she should have observed who was shown as the account-holder, if not the account number. That was BFS. Had she noticed that, she could not have regarded confirmation of the balance on the BSL segregated account as confirming that the two companies had treated in the same way a payment which BFS had paid into an account in its own name. Nor could the (forged) confirmation on the 88888 account have provided any comfort, given that the payment was from BSL, and to its segregated account.</p>

Without further enquiry, it would not be open to her simply to assume that BSL must have booked it on 30 September. But she then would have seen the credit to the 88888 account. That should have made her realise that either the explanation which she noted on the Bank Reconciliation was wrong (in that BSL must have paid the money for credit to the 88888 account) or the confirmations for both the segregated account and the 88888 account were wrong.</p>

In support of this, D&amp;T pointed to an impressive contemporaneous example of incompetence in the BSL financial control department’s treatment of sums due between BFS, BSL and BSJ.

However that issue is rendered irrelevant, and D&amp;T’s hypotheses are answered, by BFS’ further contention. This was that, if D&amp;T had not been negligent, they would have discovered that the ¥670m had been credited, not to the BSL segregated account, but to the 88888 account in BFS’ name. In the light of that, neither a forged balance confirmation from BSL nor a forged fax stating that BSL had treated the payment as made on 30 September would have answered the questions D&amp;T should have asked. </p>

If he removed the inconsistency by crediting the ¥670m to the BSL segregated account instead, the balance on that account would then no longer match the BSL confirmation. This would prove that BSL had not treated the payment as made on 30 September. The debit balance on the 88888 account would also increase by ¥670m. Leeson might have produced a further forged confirmation for the increased balance, but it is difficult to see how D&amp;T could reasonably have accepted it in those circumstances. </p>

Those questions would have been in addition to the need to resolve the original question as to whether the receipt had been booked to the wrong date. That would have required Leeson either to treat the sum as received on 1 October and produce a revised confirmation for the 88888 account or to obtain a confirmation from BSL that it had treated the payment as made on 30 September. By that stage D&amp;T would have been on notice to look carefully at whatever Leeson produced.

BFS contended that D&amp;T should have realised that this was anomalous and that the difference should have been the other way round.

Likewise if market movements on day T resulted in the broker having to pay to SIMEX further margin on short option positions or settlement variation on futures positions, it had to do so on day T+1. By contrast, the customer was required under SIMEX rules to pay margin to its broker by day T+3. </p>

BFS did not pay BSL interest on margin held on its behalf (whereas it did pay interest to BSJ), so it was not surprising if, in return, it bore the cost of funding delays in the receipt of margin from BSL.

The question of substance underlying that rather fine distinction is whether D&amp;T would have been entitled to accept an explanation given by management in response to their enquiry, or whether they should have required supporting evidence for it. It is to that question that I now turn. </p>

I agree that, as a matter of construction of the Guideline, paragraph 14 is located in the part dealing with substantive tests. But application of paragraph 16 leads me to a similar conclusion. As I have said, paragraph 16 states that analytical procedures at the review stage are intended to corroborate earlier conclusions. It goes on that, if their results show a relationship which is inconsistent with earlier conclusions or (which seems the import of the final sentence) are themselves unexpected, the auditor should resolve the point by further audit procedures. The obvious guide as to what those procedures should be is paragraph 14.</p>

So D&amp;T should have been alert to investigate indications that BFS was breaking the rules and should certainly have taken further steps if that was the explanation.

		<p class="EndnoteText"> nor is it likely that trades done earlier than 29 December, on 23 or 24 December, would have resulted in the imbalance, because of BSL being delayed in making payment by the Christmas holiday.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the size of the discrepancy (customer margins were 31% less than the level which would have been expected) would have seemed too large to be accounted for by such a factor. Indeed, trading by BSJ, BSL and its customers on 29 and 30 December might if anything be expected to be much lighter, rather than much heavier, than usual. D&amp;T pointed to the size of the flows of cash in and out of BFS’ account. On one date they picked from BFS’ bank statements, the flow out of the yen house account was over S$13 million. But the amounts held for customers were S$40 million less than would have been expected. An exceptional series of transactions might have explained a discrepancy of such a size, but it would have been exceptional and needed to be verified.</p>

When they took over in 1994, C&amp;LS had no reason to query the results of the previous year’s audit and the imbalance had disappeared (because of the Dollar Funding) in the accounts they were to audit. At least as it appears in advance of hearing the evidence which may be adduced in Phase 2 of the trial, C&amp;LL were relying on the local auditors and were as ignorant of the consequences of SIMEX margining rules as London management was. As for SIMEX, it did not know that BFS was not supposed to trade on its own account, or to have resources of its own. On the contrary, SIMEX knew that BFS had a House account and had no reason not to believe that to be used for house trading.</p>

They should have looked for evidence that the customer margin was indeed received in the few days after 31 December 1993, and that the balance then reverted to the expected way round.

D&amp;T could have checked this explanation, among other means, by comparing the positions shown on SIMEX’s CMP statement with the customer confirmations.

It is difficult to think of conduct more “<span style="font-style:italic">antithetical to the interests of</span>” the owners of a children’s home than abusing the children in their care, or to the interests of a solicitors’ firm than defrauding their client. Yet both resulted in the employers being liable.

However, when looking at vicarious liability to third parties who have been injured by an employee’s acts, the approach of the courts is to look at the class of acts which an employee is authorised to perform, and at limitations on the employee’s authority to perform that class of acts of which the third party knows. It will almost always be possible for the employer to say that he did not authorise the employee to injure third parties and that the third party must have known that.

Still less can that result follow just because the third party ought to have known that the employee was not authorised to injure him.

If anything, as D&amp;T point out, the case for doing so is even weaker in this case than it was in relation to Mr Jones, since Mr Jones was a director and therefore a fellow insider, whereas Mr Leeson was not.</p>

It is that D&amp;T had a contractual duty to BFS to investigate the truth of the representations made to them by Leeson, just as they had a duty to investigate the accuracy of the trial balance provided to them at Leeson’s instigation. They failed to investigate either properly, and BFS is suing them for breach of that duty. That breach is the cause of their loss. It makes no more sense to say that Leeson’s representations were the cause of D&amp;T’s liability than to say that his provision to D&amp;T of a misleading trial balance was the cause. Both the trial balance and the representations were merely the subject matter upon which D&amp;T should have exercised their professional skill, and failed to do so. In the words of Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith New Court</span>, in my view the deceit by Leeson were not “<span style="font-style:italic">a substantial factor in producing the result</span>” – that is, D&amp;T’s exposure to suit. </p>

Therefore breach of that duty caused the loss of the property stolen.” </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That passage seems to me to hold the key to reconciling the rule as to causation in cases of fraudulent misstatement which I have described above with the rule rendering auditors liable for losses caused by frauds which they negligently fail to detect. Clearly an outside third party who was misled by Leeson’s false statements into entering into a transaction would be able to recover all losses flowing from that transaction. But D&amp;T were not an outside third party. They were in breach of a pre-existing duty, owed to BFS, to guard against being misled by just such false statements. When I have regard to the policy of the two rules, it is clear that the rule imposing liability on D&amp;T for its breach should prevail. To adopt Lord Hoffmann’s reasoning, it is “<span style="font-style:italic">correct to say, when loss was caused by </span>[D&amp;T’s breach of its duty to detect Leeson’s deceit]<span style="font-style:italic">, that the loss was caused by the breach of duty</span>”, not by the deceit. </p>

Mr Brindle relied on Mr Swinson’s evidence that, on discovering the credit of the ¥670m to the 88888 account, D&amp;T should have asked the purpose of the account. If they were told it was an error account, as they were on 20 October, that should have caused them to investigate the account, as ¥670m would represent an amazing level of errors after three months floor trading.

Secondly, Miss Koo conducted the test in question when carrying out the regulatory audit.

Thirdly, it is now common ground that D&amp;T were under no duty to review error accounts as a matter of audit routine.

It is therefore not surprising that the House rejected the solicitor’s argument that the client’s claim should fail altogether because, if the client had pieced together various facts of which he had known 18 months before, he might have realised the truth.

This question has generated a vast amount of legal literature.  I take as my starting point the commonly accepted approach that the extent of a defendant’s liability for the plaintiff’s loss calls for a twofold enquiry: whether the wrongful conduct causally contributed to the loss and, if it did, what is the extent of the loss for which the defendant ought to be held liable.  The first of these enquiries widely undertaken as a simple “but for” test, is predominately a factual enquiry. …</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">70<marker name="tab"/>The second enquiry, although this is not always openly acknowledged by the courts, involves a value judgment (“ought to be held liable”).  Written large, the second enquiry concerns the extent of the loss for which the defendant ought fairly or reasonably or justly to be held liable (the epithets are interchangeable).  To adopt the language of Jane Stapleton in her article… the enquiry is whether the plaintiff’s harm or loss should be within the scope of the defendant’s liability, given the reasons why the law has recognised the cause of action in question.  The law has to set a limit to the causally connected losses for which a defendant is to be held responsible.  In the ordinary language of lawyers losses outside the limit may bear one of several labels. They may be described as too remote because the wrongful conduct was not a substantial or proximate cause, or because the loss was the product of an intervening cause.  The defendant’s responsibility may be excluded because the plaintiff failed to mitigate his loss.  Familiar principles, such as foreseeability, assist in promoting some consistency of general approach.  These are guidelines, some are more helpful than others, but they are never more than this.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">71<marker name="tab"/>In most cases how far the responsibility of the defendant ought fairly to extend evokes an immediate intuitive response. This is informed commonsense by another name. Usually there is no difficulty in selecting, from the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff’s loss, the happening which should be regarded as the cause of the loss for the purpose of allocating responsibility. In other cases, when the outcome of the second enquiry is not obvious, it is of crucial importance to identify the purpose of the relevant cause of action and the nature and scope of the defendant’s obligation in the particular circumstances.  What was the ambit of the defendant’s duty?  In respect of what risks or damage does the law seek to afford protection by means of the particular tort?  Recent decisions of this House have highlighted the point.  When evaluating the extent of the losses for which a negligent valuer should be responsible the scope of the valuer’s duty might first be identified see <span style="font-style:normal">Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Company Ltd</span> [1997] AC 191. In <span style="font-style:normal">Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</span> [2001] AC 360 the free, deliberate and informed act of a human being, there committing suicide, did not negative responsibility to his dependants when the defendant’s duty was to guard against that very act.</p>

It may also arise at the earlier stage of the “but for” test, to which I now return.  This guideline principle is concerned to identify and exclude losses lacking a causal connection with the wrongful conduct.  Expressed in its simplest form, the principle poses the question whether the plaintiff would have suffered the loss without (“but for”) the defendant’s wrongdoing.  If he would not, the wrongful conduct was a cause of the loss.  If the loss would have arisen even without the defendant’s wrongdoing, normally it does not give rise to legal liability. … of course, even if the plaintiff’s loss passes this exclusionary threshold test, it by no means follows that the defendant should be legally responsible for the loss.”</p>

They thus failed to alert BFS and BSL, its controlling shareholder, to the unauthorised trading of Leeson. In consequence Leeson was able to continue that unauthorised trading, with consequent loss to BFS. Because the management of BFS was not alerted, Leeson’s unauthorised trading continued through 1994 until he fled shortly before the collapse of the Barings group on 26 February 1995. The question therefore arises whether, subject to questions of whether BFS’ claim for damages should be reduced by its own contributory negligence or should be contributed to by other parties, D&amp;T are liable for the entirety of BFS’ loss caused by Leeson’s unauthorised trading.</p>

No logical explanation has been given for why that date was selected. It was suggested on behalf of BFS that, notwithstanding that its claim as pleaded claimed damages representing losses resulting from Leeson’s unauthorised trading up to the date of collapse, D&amp;T’s liability for their negligence in 1992 and 1993 was spent as a result of C&amp;LS taking over as auditors of BFS’ accounts for 1994. However that cannot explain the 31 December date: C&amp;LS’ audit work started in October 1994 and they did not, in fact, sign off the accounts before the collapse. </p>

It seems to me that the appointment of fresh auditors, who themselves do not discover the cause of the continuing loss, cannot break the chain of causation of that loss flowing from the original auditor’s negligence, although the fresh auditors may become liable to contribute to any claim for damages by the audit client. Undoubtedly there will come a time when an auditor’s negligence will be held to cease to be causative of such continuing loss, as a result, usually, of an accumulation of acts or defaults of the client’s management over time.

Earlier in this judgment, at paragraph 330 and following, I have described how the Dollar Funding started. BFS accepted that the provision on demand of substantial unreconciled funding in the manner which I have described constituted serious management fault. It was the unchallenged evidence of Dr Fitzgerald, D&amp;T’s business management expert, that, whereas it might have been appropriate in order to avoid default to pay the first request for funding of this type, that request should have triggered an investigation which should have led to the second request being refused.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The earliest written requests by Leeson for Dollar Funding have not survived and there is no other direct evidence of how those payments came to be made. Therefore it is only possible to come to a conclusion as to when, precisely, the Dollar Funding (in the sense of payments made in dollars as a result of Leeson’s initiative, as compared with payments resulting from the initiative of clients) started, by looking at the nature of the payments themselves. Doing so, it seems to me that the first payment, which it is reasonably clear was made without any client initiative, was the payment of $32 million on 9 February 1994. It seems probable from the contemporary fax from Mr Jones to Mr Hawes, quoted at paragraph 331, that Mr Jones may have played a part in procuring this payment to be made.  That factor does not seem to me to make any difference to the conclusion that this was probably the first of the unreconciled dollar payments. It follows from the evidence of Dr Fitzgerald that that request, although it could have been paid, should have triggered enquiry which would have led to the next request for Dollar Funding being refused.  </p>

	      </authorialNote>. From those, it emerges that Leeson asked for Dollar Funding as a last resort. He did so when all other sources of funding (the overdraft facility and the margin surplus) had been exhausted and it was necessary to find money to fund margin calls (both maintenance margin and settlement variation) in respect of transactions which had already been undertaken. This is what one would expect, given the risks involved in asking for the Dollar Funding. If it was needed to meet margin calls on transactions which had already been undertaken, refusal of the Funding would have led to BFS defaulting on its obligations to SIMEX and immediate investigation. </p>

Instead of being primarily an execution-only operation executing on SIMEX the instructions of related Barings securities trading companies, it became a trader with access to unlimited amounts of unreconciled and uncontrolled funding. This permitted a whole new order of losses on that market and Japanese markets to be incurred. As a result of the Dollar Funding, Leeson was able to exploit a source of funds to finance his unauthorised trading, without limit (or only such limit as was imposed by the extent of the assets of the Barings group), so placing at his disposal the whole of Barings’ capital. The resulting losses, in particular those which were suffered as a result of the massive increase in unauthorised trading which occurred between November 1994 and the end of February 1995, led to the collapse.</p>

What he must show is that he is worse off as a lender than he would have been if the security had been worth what the valuer said. … it was accepted that the whole loss suffered by reason of the fall in the property market was, as a matter of causation, properly attributable to the lender having entered into the transaction and that, but for the negligent valuation, he would not have done so. It was not suggested that the possibility of a fall in the market was unforeseeable or that there was any other factor which negatived the causal connection between the lending and losing the money. …the essence of the decision was that this is not where one starts and that the valuer is responsible only for the consequences of the lender having too little security.”</p>

In the present case the negligent certification by the auditors of BFS’ 1992 and 1993 financial statements was one of the causes which allowed Leeson to continue his unauthorised trading until a few days before the bank collapsed.  Had the financial statements truly reflected the results of Leeson’s trading, they would have shown BFS to have been loss-making in both years and, by December 1993, substantially insolvent. Other causes of Leeson being allowed to continue his fraudulent activities were the failure of the management of BFS so to organise its affairs as to prevent this happening and that of the Barings group as a whole to detect that it was happening. One of the principal reasons why Leeson was enabled to continue his unauthorised trading and to cover the losses from past unauthorised trading was the provision of the Dollar Funding from early 1994 until the collapse.</p>

It is conceded that loss caused by unauthorised trading was foreseeable, and such loss does not cease to be foreseeable merely because the trading was funded from an unforeseeable source. As Mr Brindle, for BFS, submitted, until the beginning of 1994, Leeson had been financing his unauthorised trading in a number of illicit ways which continued after the Dollar Funding started. The Dollar Funding was just another form of such funding, the facilitation of which by BSL was particularly improvident. </p>

One of the issues considered by Millett J was whether the auditors of the company owed a duty of care to those banks which were existing creditors of the company when the auditors carried out their audit. Having concluded that no such duty existed because of lack of proximity between the auditors and the banks, Millett J’s judgment continues at page 337:-</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“This makes it unnecessary to consider whether, if the requirement of proximity was satisfied it would be just and reasonable to impose a duty of care to the existing bank creditors.  But in case the matter goes further I ought to indicate my own views. In my judgment, it would not. Caparo’s case <span style="font-style:normal">[which had only reached the Court of Appeal at this time]</span> shows that even if the duty of care is confined to the creditors whose existence was known to the defendants, the potential liability is not restricted to the amount of existing indebtedness.  The defendants will be liable to a bank which made an additional facility available to the company in reliance on the audited accounts. Accordingly though there is no danger of exposing the defendants to a liability to an indeterminate class, they will be exposed to liability for an indeterminate amount. Moreover, this is potentially a far greater exposure than in Caparo’s case where the company was solvent though overvalued in the accounts. In the worst case the maximum liability would be measured by the amount by which the value of the company was overstated. Where the value of a company is negligently overstated or understood in the accounts, the auditors liability to investors and shareholders would be measured by or at least related to, the extent of their own negligence. That is not so where creditors are concerned and the company is alleged to have been insolvent. In the case of a subsequent and irrecoverable advance, the auditors’ maximum liability would fall to be measured by the amount of the advance, which would be unknown to the auditors and could not be foreseen by them. It would bear no necessary relationship to, and could be many times greater than, the value of the company as shown by its published accounts.  In the present case the company had a paid share capital of £325,000. The 1982 accounts showed net assets of just under £800,000 and bank borrowings of £6.4M.  They could have been used to support further borrowings of many millions of pounds. Even if the requirement of proximity was satisfied, I would not for my own part, unless constrained by authority, extend the duty of care to a prospective lender, unless the amount or at least the scale of the proposed loan was known to the defendant.”</p>

However that does not, it seems to me, make any difference to whether Millett J’s reasoning is capable of application to the facts of the present case. Nor does it seem to me to make any difference that the liability argued to be outside the scope of duty was loss from transactions made possible by advances obtained from the claimant’s parent company, at the instance of a fraudulent general manager of the claimant, over whom no controls of any kind appear to have been exercised by the management of the claimant or by that of the lending parent. </p>

Did the intervening event “isolate” or “insulate” or “eclipse” the defendant’s conduct so that it was merely the occasion of the harm rather than the cause of it?  Was the intervening act “no mere conduit pipe through which consequences flow from defendant to claimant, no mere part of a transmission gear set in motion by the defendant”? The proliferation of expressions indicates that there is no simple test and, though common sense may point the way, the language of causation tends to obscure the evaluative nature of the decisions that the courts must inevitably make.”</p>

The question of a novus actus “can only be answered on a consideration of all the circumstances and, in particular, the quality of that later act or event.”  Four issues need to be addressed. Was the intervening conduct of the third party such as to render the original wrongdoing merely a part of the history of the events? Was the third party’s conduct either deliberate or wholly unreasonable?  Was the intervention foreseeable? Is the conduct of the third party wholly independent of the defendant, i.e. does the defendant owe the claimant any responsibility for the conduct of that intervening third party? In practice in most cases of novus actus more than one of the above issues will have to be considered together.</p>

Of the two witnesses from BSL settlements, Mr Bowser had left by the time the Dollar Funding started and Mr Railton was relatively junior. Mr Hawes was head of BSL treasury and such steps as were taken to uncover the reason for the Dollar Funding were taken by him. He can therefore be seen as the directing mind of the company in that area. I am conscious that this may create an impression which may be unfair to Mr Hawes, since he was by no means the only individual who ought to have been concerned about these issues and to have investigated them.

He said that he formed the view then that the delay in sending yen from BSJ to BFS was a potential reason for the K2/P4 line. However when, later in his evidence, it was put to Mr Hawes that he came to associate the K2/P4 balance with Singapore in January or February 1994, Mr Hawes said that it was later, in March or April 1994:</p>

That showed that Leeson was running an overnight, and therefore unauthorised, overdraft. On the face of the balance sheet this was apparently caused by BFS having more funds deposited with SIMEX than it held for customers. Secondly, Mr Hawes had seen a letter from Mr Stanley of Citibank of 18 February 1994 complaining about the abuse of the overdraft by Leeson (and had met Mr Stanley in Singapore a week later). Thirdly, BSL was receiving daily reports showing the state of all its subsidiaries’ bank accounts, and those showed the state of BFS’ overdraft. </p>

Indeed Mr Hawes visited BFS in February 1994 to discuss, among other things, its need for funding. One would have expected Mr Jones to explain the relative levels of margin, paid by customers to BFS and by BFS to the exchange, as a basis of that discussion. That he did not, was no doubt the result of Mr Jones’ even more inexcusable failure to master the basic financial principles underlying the business of which he was the Finance Director. </p>

I have found that the first request for dollar payments made by Leeson which should have been refused was the payment of $40 million on 1 March 1994, two months after the close of the period of the 1993 audit and after D&amp;T had signed off the 1993 financial statements. Therefore it could be no reason for Barings not to investigate the reasons for the Dollar Funding that D&amp;T had given a clean audit certificate for the year to December 1993. The Dollar Funding was a problem that had arisen wholly since that date.</p>

Given the state of knowledge of Mr Hawes in late April 1994, or what it should have been, even if he was not himself able to deduce that unauthorised trading was being undertaken on SIMEX through BFS, he should have instituted an investigation. That investigation would inevitably have led to the uncovering of Leeson’s unauthorised trading. His failure, or that of his superiors, so to act had the effect of subsuming D&amp;T's negligence as a cause of the loss resulting from Leeson’s unauthorised trading which took place after 30 April 1994. </p>

That shows the accumulated loss to be temporarily on a downward trend, presumably as a result of a brief period of successful unauthorised trading by Leeson, to stand at £27,564,128, down from a peak of £49,968,630 on 11 April 1994.

Profitable trading had the result of reducing, i.e. mitigating, BFS’ loss and resulted from a continuation of the pattern of trading which gave rise to the previous losses, which were caused by D&amp;T's negligence.

Why should D&amp;T have to pay twice as much in damages to BFS, if they could establish that BFS became solely responsible for the loss resulting from Leeson’s unauthorised trading at mid-June 1994, than they would have to pay if they could only establish that fact later, at the beginning of September?

I reluctantly accept that he was correct to do so. The profitable trading, though undertaken by BFS, was not undertaken as a result of BFS (as opposed to Leeson) being aware that it had incurred substantial loss as a result of being procured to embark on trading which it was not authorised to do and so at its own risk. Thus it cannot be said that the continuation of trading, which for a time produced profits, was a deliberate act of mitigation, though its effect was to mitigate the loss. (In fact it appears that the initial motive for Leeson’s unauthorised trading may have been an ill-conceived attempt, fraudulent because unauthorised, to conceal ill-advised transactions in the early days of BFS trading by realising sufficient profits to subsume the resulting losses.) The profitable trading cannot be said to be the result of a <span style="font-style:italic">“reasonable and prudent course quite naturally arising out of the circumstances in which [BFS] was placed by the [damage]”</span>, i.e. the accumulated losses at that point (see per Lord Haldane in <span style="font-style:italic">British Westinghouse Electric v Underground Electric Railways Co</span> [1912] AC 673, at page 691). In <span style="font-style:italic">Hussey v Eels </span>[1990] 2 QB 227, at page 241, Mustill LJ put the decisive question as being “<span style="font-style:italic">Did the negligence which caused the damage also cause the profit?</span>” As I have decided that D&amp;T’s negligence had no causal effect after 30 April 1994, the answer in respect of profits after that date has to be no. Nor can any of the transactions which constituted the profitable trading be said to be <span style="font-style:italic">“part of a continuous transaction”</span> (as Mustill LJ put it in that case) with the loss-making transactions which preceded them: each trading transaction was separate.</p>

In the alternative he contended that, in the exercise of the Singapore equivalent of section 727 of the Companies Act 1985, the court had power to give partial relief to D&amp;T so as to nullify the consequences of the apparent injustices which I have described. As will be seen from paragraphs 1146 to 1148 below, I accept that the court has power under section 727 to give partial relief to an auditor and that it should do so, if necessary, in this instance. However both the solutions proposed by Mr Gaisman seem to me intrinsically unsatisfactory. The first is arbitrary and not apparently based on any principle. The second permits the court to grant relief only to a limited class of defendants - officers and auditors under section 727 of the Companies Act and trustees under section 61 of the Trustee Act 1925. Why should the court have power to relieve auditors but not, for example, investigating accountants?</p>

On day two, by reason of supervening events, the defendant’s negligence ceases to be a cause of that continued trading. The trading continues profitably until day three, when it ceases. Subsequently action is brought, claiming against the defendant damages for negligence. It seems clear that the measure of damage will be the amount of the net loss on day three. Plainly in those circumstances the defendant is obtaining the benefit of accrued profits from the course of trading which occurred after his negligence ceased to be a cause. Equally plainly, if the profitable trend ceases and losses restart in the course of trading, for the continuation of which only the claimant can be responsible, the defendant cannot be made liable for the result of those losses. </p>

It had its own General Manager and board of directors, albeit the board delegated many of their supervisory functions to others outside the company. BFS had a distinct function within the Barings group. It maintained its own accounts of its operations, which it employed auditors to audit. BFS’ function, and thus its business, were those of a broker on SIMEX, primarily for customers within the group but also for one external customer. It is true that BSL guaranteed BFS’ bank facilities and provided funding when needed, and that BFS’ profits were managed so as to ensure the most favourable tax treatment for the group as a whole. Those factors demonstrated that the relationship between the two companies was not purely one of broker and customer, but also one of parent and subsidiary. They did not mean that BFS was not an entity with its own business. </p>

The customer receives the profits and suffers the losses. But that does not mean that competent management of the broker is uninterested in the broker’s trading, or can ignore surprisingly high profits or losses resulting from it. High losses even on execution-only trades may raise concerns as to the customer’s credit. Losses on discretionary trading for a customer must raise an immediate concern that the customer may claim against the broker for negligence. </p>

The trader may be trading in unauthorised securities or exceeding his trading limits, or the trader may be front-running other customers, which may result in civil liability and regulatory penalties. It must be remembered that a member of the SIMEX market, such as BFS, trades as a principal and is liable for the performance of trades if its customer defaults. To the extent that losses are attributable to unauthorised or excess trading, the member is liable for any loss without the possibility of reimbursement by a customer. </p>

When BSL used external brokers, it reconciled their margin demands against trades from just that motive. Likewise, BFS pointed out that BNP paid margin to BFS.

It might therefore seem surprising that it contended that other aspects of the risk control function were part of BFS’ customers’ businesses, not BFS’. However BFS contended that risk control is primarily concerned with the control of market risk. That is borne in most circumstances by the customer, whose capital and trading profits are at risk, and therefore it constitutes part of the customer’s business.

This is partly for the same reasons as I have already set out in the context of monitoring profits. Profits may be the customer’s, but trading in excess of limits, whether set by the broker or the customer, creates risk for the broker. Furthermore, market risk is not the only type of risk to which Dr Fitzgerald explained futures brokers to be subject. Credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk all apply to a greater or lesser extent to a broker trading on behalf of customers. Operational risk in particular is clearly a risk which cannot be passed on to the customer.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“This is most easily illustrated by taking an extreme case from a type of litigation which is tried daily in the courts. A dangerous machine is unfenced and a workman gets his hand caught in it. So far as causation alone is concerned it may be fair to say that at least half the cause of the accident is the fact that the workman put his hand into the danger. But so far as "fault" (and therefore liability) is concerned the answer may be very different. Suppose that the workman was a normally careful person who, by a pardonable but foolish reaction, wanted to save an obstruction from blocking the machine and so put his hand within the danger area. Suppose further that the factory owner had known that the machine was dangerous and ought to be fenced, that he had been previously warned on several occasions but through dilatoriness or on the grounds of economy failed to rectify the fault and preferred to take a chance. In such a case the judge, weighing the fault of one party against the other, the deliberate negligence against the foolish reaction, would not assess the workman's fault at anything approaching the proportion which mere causation alone would indicate.”</p>

I need to have regard to the warning signs that should have prompted action, the explanations given and the reasons why the company failed to take action. However where, for example, the decision of one or other of two Barings employees was the cause of the fault, in most cases it is not necessary to reach a conclusion as to which it was.</p>

BFS’ formulation does not anyway express adequately the various faults which, in the light of my decisions as to attribution, are to be taken into account. But since I am looking at blameworthiness, it matters little how one aggregates or sub-divides the management failings. What matters is their gravity in total. In that context, it adds little to the fault to say that, for example, Mr Baker, Ms Walz and Mr Gueler all had the responsibility to question Leeson’s profits and did not do so adequately, rather than to say just that BFS failed to do it. But it is relevant to consider how improbable the profits should have seemed to an experienced derivatives trader, the period of time involved, the apparent reasons for the profits, and whether concerns were raised and ignored.</p>

Again, the case assists BFS only to the extent that D&amp;T were negligent in not detecting the claimant’s fault which is relied upon to found a deduction for contributory negligence. As I have held, an example was D&amp;T’s failure to detect the falsity of Leeson’s representations as to the ¥670m. The fault attributable to BFS in relation to those representations, and other failings which D&amp;T should have detected, is to be assessed with regard to the <span style="font-style:italic">Reeves</span> principle.

However, as I have stated at paragraph 708 above, Thomas J’s view that fraud which amounts to “<span style="font-style:italic">bilking the company</span>” is not attributable to the company as contributory fault does not in my view represent English law.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">BFS accepted that Mr Jones should have supervised BFS’ back office and exercised a financial control function. It attributed his failure to do so effectively to his trust in Leeson and an over-reliance on outside controls on Leeson’s activities. Mr Jones did not appreciate that Leeson had available excess margins to fund unauthorised trading and he believed BSL was reconciling all margin requests before paying them. He failed to appreciate that Leeson might use BFS’ other cash resources and that he might manipulate BFS’ systems to conceal his activities.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already summarised at paragraph 520 above Mr Jones’ evidence as to his own position in BFS. He admitted in evidence that he did not take any steps to supervise the running of the BFS back office. He did not try to understand the procedures followed, so as to be able to check for deviations from what would be expected. Mr Jones was responsible for BFS’ reporting to London but he did not check that the feeds to London were working correctly. Nor did he make any attempt to establish contacts with the staff which would have encouraged them to bring concerns to him. He did not discuss with them what they were doing and why. He simply abdicated responsibility, so that Leeson was able to persuade the back office staff to assist him in corrupting the information sent to London and to falsify BFS’ records on a daily basis.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jones’ answer to these criticisms in his evidence before me was that he did not regard himself as being under any duty to exercise day-to-day supervision of Leeson. He relied on the controls which were put in place when BFS was set up to control Leeson: the feeds to BSL, the reconciliation of margin by BSL and the bar on taking money out of the Citibank account<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="512">
		<p class="EndnoteText"> T14.2.02 page 108, 222</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Like Mr Bax, however, this did not excuse him from any responsibility for the supervision of Leeson and BFS. Mr Jones was the only other executive director of BFS besides Mr Bax. He must have known of Mr Bax’s role, or lack of it, and that no one else of any seniority was supervising Leeson from day to day. Mr Jones’ excuses might have been persuasive if he had taken any steps at all to satisfy himself that the controls upon which he relied were working, or even existed. He did not. As the evidence showed, the feeds were not working correctly and no effective reconciliation by BSL ever took place. Nor could Mr Jones have expected the staff to act as a control, firstly because of their inexperience but secondly because he never spoke to them so as to be able to assess whether they would. </p>

Dr Fitzgerald gave unchallenged evidence as to the financial controls that should have operated in the derivatives business of a well-run investment bank in the early 1990s. He stated that a trading operation such as BFS should have as a matter of course carried out regular reconciliations of trades on SIMEX against margin requests, and reconciled all cash flows<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="514">

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly Mr Jones should have understood the mechanism for calling margin from clients and checked regularly that it was operating as it should. He should have ensured that all margin coming in to BFS was reconciled with positions at SIMEX. He should have asked questions if that reconciliation showed that BFS was calling large amounts of margin outside the established mechanism and holding it as collateral. He should have asked if that collateral was reflected in the regular margin calls which BFS was making. </p>

On even a superficial review of the monthly financial statements, he should have been concerned if that excess was not present, as it was not at the end of 1993. He should therefore have questioned the state of the December 1993 balance sheet revealed by the 1993 audit. A finance director should have kept BFS’ daylight overdraft facility under regular review and should certainly have asked questions if BFS was constantly overdrawn, as it was for most of the period September 1993 to May 1994. </p>

Mr Jones was not negligent in believing that Mr Killian and Mr Gueler were supervising Leeson’s trading; but that does not diminish the effect of their negligence in failing to supervise, which is equally attributable to BFS. Likewise, Mr Jones was negligent in confirming that there were no material irregularities, undisclosed liabilities, etc in the accounts. But that adds nothing to his negligence in supervising BFS’ operations which allowed those irregularities and liabilities to exist and to be concealed. </p>

The staff seem to have had no training at all, which rendered it more likely that they would obey Leeson’s instructions without realising them to be irregular. Mr Jones must bear some responsibility for that, as he must for their failure to question the instructions or raise concerns with management. Had he performed his supervisory duties properly, he would have elicited from the staff what they were doing, whether or not they regarded it as suspicious, and there would have been a realistic possibility that they might have come to him with their concerns.</p>

It affords no defence to such a charge of negligence that BSL actually made the payment, thereby giving substance to the explanation apparently given to Miss Koo that this sum represented a balance actually due from BSL to BFS.

Without these payments Leeson would have been unable to conceal the “hole” in BFS’ accounts caused by his unauthorised trading at the 1992 accounts reporting date and, less importantly, at the December 1992 month-end. This was fault by BFS in failing adequately to look after its own interests. However it arose from circumstances which D&amp;T should have investigated and from the consequences of which D&amp;T as BFS’ auditors were under a duty to protect BFS. I have found that they did not discharge that duty with due care. It follows that the <span style="font-style:italic">Reeves</span> principle applies to reduce the impact of this fault.</p>

The Settlements Department checked that the figure agreed with the figure for margin required in the London Gross Report, but that was simply checking BFS data against BFS data, and neither report showed a calculation of margin by reference to individual trades. For calculating margin calls from BSL’s customers, the Department simply fed into First Futures the trade and margin data generated by BFS.

The decision which Mr Bowser took when BFS was activated seems a logical one. BSL did not have SPAN, and at that time did not need it for any other exchange. Therefore BFS’ systems would be set up so that it could calculate margin at the level of BSL’s customers and send the figures direct to BSL’s system via a margin feed. Whereas BSL had to calculate margin on BSJ’s trades because BSJ could only calculate margin as a gross amount, not at the customer level, BFS’ systems would be set up so that it could do both calculations.</p>

All parties agreed that the yen margin demands in 1992 and 1993 were correctly calculated, so a recalculation by BSL would have revealed nothing. In January 1994 Leeson started abusing the transmission of genuine client US dollar collateral by BSL, by failing to take account of it on the Funding Spreadsheet. Soon afterwards he began calling for Dollar Funding himself. Both abuses could have been detected if BSL had recalculated the margin due on its SIMEX positions. But in fact both caused immediate warning flags to be raised, of just the kind described by Mr Norris as requiring a recalculation and investigation on an exceptions basis. </p>

But it was not shown on the collateral line in the section for the trading account, denominated in yen.

Neither BFS nor D&amp;T carried out such a reconciliation in Singapore, as between margins called from customers and margins deposited on SIMEX, and D&amp;T’s case was that it was not realistic to expect D&amp;T to do it. </p>

This was confirmed by the Enclosure B reports (BFS’ daily reports to BSL of its deposits with banks and SIMEX for large exposure reporting purposes) and, as late as December 1994, by Mr Stunt’s investigation (see paragraph 382)<span style="font-weight:bold">. </span>The problem did not appear to be one of disappearing funding, but just one of understanding why BFS needed so much. The actual explanation was that Leeson was selling ever larger numbers of options to raise premium to meet his losses. He used the Dollar Funding to provide the margin on those options (see paragraph 795 above). If options made losses, he sold more options to cover them, so the margin appeared to be there throughout, but increasing.</p>

As I have remarked, it is upon such directors and officers that the primary duty to protect the company from loss occasioned by fraud rests. I would draw attention again to the passages quoted from the judgment of Lucas CJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bily</span> case cited at paragraphs 822 and 823 above. The authorities establish that the auditor’s duty is to report to the shareholders, in particular, on the conduct of the company’s management. But the shareholders cannot escape responsibility for the conduct of those directors and officers whom they have been instrumental in appointing, directly or indirectly. The comparison here is between the degree of blameworthiness of the auditors for the negligence which I have found and that of the management of BFS for the fault, some accepted and some contested, but which I have also found to be established.</p>

However discovery of Leeson’s fraud in early 1994 would have struck at the heart of the rationale for BFS’ existence and would have shown all its apparent profits to be bogus. The public impact and the damage to BFS’ reputation among agency clients would have been significant. By that time BFS was wholly identified with Leeson: as a result almost entirely of his trading, it had been the number one trader on SIMEX by volume in December 1993 and January and February 1994<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="569">

I accept D&amp;T’s points about both BSL’s and BFS’ difficult financial positions at that time. However by 30 September BFS had been active for only four months, and executing trades for only three. BFS was not yet identified with Leeson. The motive for its activation (the need to service agency clients wishing to use SIMEX rather than the Japanese exchanges) still applied. The incident could probably have been kept out of the public eye and, if not, damage to Barings’ reputation would have been relatively small. SIMEX’s concerns could have been met by either reverting to the original plan of BFS ceasing to execute trades on SIMEX and providing a back office function only or introducing independent supervision of front and back offices. The loss of £3.6 million was significant, but had to be paid anyway. Mr Baylis, who had played a leading role in the decision to activate BFS and only a month or two previously had persuaded Mr Norris that it should not be closed down, was still in charge of the derivatives business. It seems probable that he would have seen the underlying logic which caused BSL to activate BFS as unaffected by Leeson’s fraud, even if the measures needed to prevent a recurrence weakened the short-term financial case.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">D&amp;T’s response was that Leeson’s unauthorised trading, and therefore D&amp;T’s failure to detect and stop it, did cause or contribute to the profits BFS received from authorised trading. They pointed out that BFS accepted that Leeson used the 88888 account to make his trades on behalf of BFS’ customers appear more successful than they were. Leeson incurred losses on the 88888 account before he started doing any proprietary trading at all, and his losses in the first ten months of 1993 far exceeded the apparent profits from switching. Therefore he must have been using the 88888 account to improve the results of his agency trading for other Barings companies and their customers. Furthermore Leeson’s reputation as an agency trader was helped greatly by BFS being the biggest trader on SIMEX, and that was attributable to the unauthorised trading.</p>

Leeson’s unauthorised trading had the side-effect of increasing his reputation as a trader and thus the volume of BFS’ authorised trading, both by turning him into the most important trader on the exchange and by improving the apparent results he could achieve for BFS’ customers. Therefore the profits from such agency trading were related to D&amp;T’s negligent failure to detect Leeson’s unauthorised trading and are to be taken into account in assessing D&amp;T’s liability.</p>

Clearly there must be a connection between the profits paid out and the losses which are claimed before credit should be given. It is not enough for D&amp;T to say that BSL’s profits and BFS’ losses arose out of the same unauthorised trading: if some of the profits of Leeson’s unauthorised trading had been paid out to BNP, it is not obvious that BFS should give credit for them, and in <span style="font-style:italic">Panatown</span> it was not enough for A to say that its claim and C’s loss all arose out of the same transaction.

So A could recover damages only if it would use them to remedy C’s loss. In the present case, the issue is whether A must give credit for profits received by C. The analogous condition to that applied in <span style="font-style:italic">Panatown</span> is that A (that is, BFS) can only be required to give credit for those profits if it received or will receive the benefit of them; </p>

It allowed A to sue for its own loss in not receiving the benefit for which it contracted (that is, performance of the contract), whoever in the group suffered the financial loss. The analogous argument in our situation would be that A (BFS) has to give credit for the profits if it received the benefit of them. It is also worth noting that Lords Goff and Millett required A’s intention to spend the damages in remedying the breach to be taken into account when assessing its right to substantial damages.

Whether it is carried out directly or indirectly by or at the expense of Panatown itself or of another member of the group is not material. What matters is that the work will be done and that doing it will enable Panatown to obtain whatever benefit it sought to obtain as a member of the Unex Group by entering into the building contract.

Normally a broker does not benefit from paying to its customers the profits made from its trading on their behalves, other than in reputational terms. I have considered whether the situation was different here, on the basis that BFS was effectively taking money from the 88888 account and giving it to its customers. To fund the margins on both its authorised and its unauthorised trading, BFS borrowed money from its customers, giving rise to a debt owed to them. The apparent profits taken from the 88888 account reduced BFS’ margin calls, and therefore its debt to its customers. It might be argued that to that extent they benefited BFS.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However that contention does not accord with the facts. Leeson created profits in the customers’ trading accounts by, for example, selling futures on their behalves to the 88888 account at above the market price. That created a profit in the trading account and a realised or unrealised loss in the 88888 account. That loss had to be met by funding from BFS’ customers (excess margins, double-counting the US dollar collateral and the Dollar Funding) or from BFS’ overdraft. Either increased BFS’ debt. Therefore an apparent profit credited to BSL may have reduced BFS’ next margin call on BSL’s trading account, but it increased BFS’ indebtedness to other sources of funding.</p>

Therefore there was no overlap between recovery from the Coopers defendants and the claims now brought against D&amp;T. D&amp;T responded that it was not open to the recipient unilaterally to appropriate the settlement monies to particular claims. That was for the court to do. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, BFS contended that, if it were necessary to go behind its appropriation, BFS made no claims against the Coopers defendants in respect of the pre-31 December 1994 period, so again there could be no overlap. D&amp;T responded that it was not enough to look at BFS’ claims against the Coopers defendants. Plc’s and BSL’s claims were reflective of BFS’ claims. Therefore, if any part of the settlement monies related to the pre-31 December 1994 period, D&amp;T should be given credit for it. BFS replied that, in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">Gould v Vaggelas </span>[1983-1985. 157 CLR 215], such an overlap would not prevent recovery in full by BFS. Double-recovery was prevented by subrogation, or by BSL having to give credit, in its claim against C&amp;LL, for the value of the debt owed to it by BFS.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, BFS accepted that it could not appropriate the settlement monies to claims which were obviously unsustainable. However it contended that the court could not be required to try the settled claims in their entirety in order to decide whether they would have succeeded. It should adopt the approach of section 1(4) of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 and ask only whether the Coopers defendants “<span style="font-style:italic">would have been liable assuming that the factual basis of the claim against [them would have been] established</span>.” In any event, BFS’ claims against C&amp;LS were not just sustainable, but clearly well-founded, unlike the overlapping claims. D&amp;T responded that the court should appropriate monies to a non-overlapping claim only if the recipient were able to establish that that claim would have succeeded at trial, to at least the amount of the settlement monies sought to be appropriated to it. Given the degree of management fault present in 1995, the claims against C&amp;LS were actually very weak. </p>

However I have concluded that D&amp;T are not liable for losses incurred after the end of April 1994.

The payment had not been appropriated between claims that were only against D1, those that were only against D2 and those that were against both. In the absence of any material indicating how the apportionment should be made, the court assessed the true value of the claims and compared them with the amount of the payment. It concluded that the payment exceeded the value of both the claims against D1 only and the overlapping claims. So the claimant’s entitlement to pursue D2 in relation to the overlapping claims was extinguished by the payment in. The Court of Appeal approved that approach. Purchas LJ said at page 53:</p>

By contrast, the general rule, where a creditor is owed two debts by a debtor and receives a payment which is not appropriated between them, is that the creditor may appropriate the payment between the debts as he thinks fit.   </p>

That would be conclusive, as long as the apportionment were not collusive or not made bona fide (per Oliver LJ at page 41). In the case of a negotiated settlement, it seems to me that the normal rule allowing appropriation by the recipient should apply (Halsbury’s Laws, 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed., volume 9(1) paragraph 956), subject to the sort of low-level threshold indicated by Oliver LJ. One of Mr Brindle’s formulations of that threshold was whether the claims were obviously unsustainable. That seems to me a preferable approach to his alternative approach, by analogy to the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978, which would pay no regard at all to the chances of the claimant making out his claim at trial.</p>

Part of BSL’s claim against C&amp;LL was for losses which were conceded in the strike-out application to be reflective of those claimed by BFS against D&amp;T. That reflective element was, given the limit BFS has placed on its claims against D&amp;T, the Dollar Funding up to 31 December 1994. However Plc and BSL had other claims, for the Dollar Funding after that date, the loss of their respective groups and overpaid bonuses. BFS had claims against C&amp;LS in relation to its losses after 31 December 1994. I have concluded that it was open to the Barings parties to allocate their recovery under the Coopers settlement to the non-overlapping claims. Therefore, whether or not BFS would have had to give credit for an earlier recovery by BSL in respect of reflective loss, in fact the recovery could be, and was, allocated to non-reflective loss.</p>

Having found that D&amp;T were negligent, I should not use the section to relieve them from liability merely because the negligence was not particularly gross (to use Hoffmann LJ’s term).

Perusal of their working files shows that their audits were conducted (as summarised in Schedule F to this judgment) with great thoroughness, for very low fees. Of the many allegations of negligence originally made by BFS, only two were proved. Of those, D&amp;T’s negligence in relation to the ¥670m was of a somewhat technical nature. Miss Koo was given, by duly-authorised BFS staff, a fraudulent explanation for a reconciling item. I have held that she should have checked the explanation more thoroughly than she did, but she did carry out some checks and, in the view of Mr Spence, the least partial of the audit experts, those checks were sufficient.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">D&amp;T’s third argument was to invoke section 727. They pointed out that Barings was run as a single group, with profits booked to whichever company it was most advantageous to book them to, for the purpose of putting the Barings group in the best fiscal position achievable and minimising the obligation to pay margin to exchanges. The profits were booked to companies which are the sole creditors in BFS’ liquidation. Therefore, to the extent that their proofs of debt are met, they will receive payment in respect of the profits twice over if BFS enforces its claim in full. The profits were in most cases artificial and were the other side of the coin to the losses, made in the course of the same trading and at the expense of the 88888 account: Leeson generated profits for BSL and BSJ by effectively transferring money into their trading accounts from the 88888 account. If D&amp;T had detected Leeson’s unauthorised trading, the profits would have been stopped as well as the losses. It would be quite unfair to make D&amp;T liable for the losses but to give them no credit for the profits.</p>

If BFS had not incurred those losses, it would have been able to claim only for the loss after giving credit for the profitable trading. Why should that position be affected by the fact that later still BFS suffered further losses, which were caused solely by BFS, not by D&amp;T, and for which D&amp;T are not liable?
