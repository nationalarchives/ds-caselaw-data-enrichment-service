This was purportedly effected by IBM pursuant to the exercise of a power to direct that any specified person or class of persons shall cease to be a member. There is an issue about whether that power was validly introduced into the Main Plan and there is an issue about whether the powers in both the Main Plan (assuming it was properly introduced) and the I Plan were validly exercised. Although neither power contains the word "exclude" or similar words they have been referred to as "<span style="font-weight:bold">the Exclusion Powers</span>" and that, or its singular, is the expression I will use.

I will explain later in this judgment the detailed provisions of the Rules of the DB Plans, but, in summary, under the Rules of the C and N Plans, early retirement pensions for active members were reduced by 0.25% for each month between the commencement date of the pension and the member's 60th birthday, <span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>an ERDF of 3% pa taken back from age 60 for retirements from active status before age 60, and no reduction for such retirements from age 60.

However, under the Rules of the C and N Plans as they stood at the time Project Waltz was announced in 2009 (and for some DSL Plan DB members), retirement of active members before NRD was subject to Holdings' consent.

The effect of this was that, after the closure of the early retirement window, an active DB member wishing to "retire" early without having been able to obtain Holdings' consent (insofar as consent was needed under the Rules applicable to him) would have to leave service and take early payment of his deferred benefit: this would involve the application of a less generous discount factor than the ERDF that would apply to an early retirement with consent from active membership.</p>

It relates to section 91 Pensions Act 1995.

Issues 1 to 3 raise what are essentially legal arguments or, at least, arguments where the facts are not a matter of any real contention. Issues 4 and 4B are concerned with the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty of good faith and the contractual duty of trust and confidence owed by an employer and an employee to each other; they raise many issues of fact on which I have heard a large amount of evidence over a number of weeks, including disputed expert evidence from accountants and actuaries.</p>

The Trustee's concerns arose partly as a result of the previous history of the Plans and in particular the Ocean and Soto projects, matters which I will come to later in this judgment. In a letter dated 18 June 2009, the Trustee informed Holdings of the legal advice it had received (from Leading Counsel) raising its concerns over a number of issues which are now encapsulated in the List of Issues.</p>

As of October or November 2009, Holdings was seekingto initiate the early retirement window (Element 3) as well as inviting members to enter into the 2009 NonPensionability Agreements (Element 2). In addition, an issue of rectification of the C Plan arose. This was the subject matter of the Rectification Action (see paragraph 35 above), in which I gave judgment last year. In that case, it was asserted that members who joined the C Plan when it was created in 1983 had done so on the basis of announcements promising them a right of "flexible retirement", <span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> a right to retire from active status at any age from 60 to 63 at the member's election on an unreduced pension.</p>

Holdings did, however, make a qualified concession on or about 4 December 2009 in relation to certain C Plan members, namely that employees who joined the C Plan at its inception on 6 July 1983 would, once they reached age 60, be given consent to retire early with an unreduced pension, other than in the most exceptional, business critical, circumstances (this concession was slightly widened in early 2010 to those who joined the C Plan up to 30 November 1983 when the November 1983 update to the Employee Handbook was published).</p>

Following that, the Trustee requested Holdings to postpone the implementation date. Ignoring the warning of Irving Berlin that there may be trouble ahead, Holdings decided to dance. It declined the Trustee's request; and, in the face of what it perceived as a threat by IBM putting at risk the availability of hybrid deferred status or M Plan membership for former DB employees, the Trustee, under protest, agreed to implement Project Waltz on an interim basis. This was on the footing that the steps taken would be unravelled if the Court ruled that the project was unlawful. And so the Waltz had begun.</p>

In fact, the I Plan Deed and Rules (prepared in 1994) were closely modelled on the then current Main Plan Definitive Trust Deed and Rules (the 1993 version) and adopted an identical drafting structure. Thus many of the standard provisions of both the Main Plan and the I Plan are the same. In particular, in both the Main Plan and the I Plan, "<span style="font-weight:bold">Member</span>" is defined as meaning, broadly, active members, that is to say current employees, and deferred members are described in both Plans as "<span style="font-weight:bold">Deferred Retirees</span>".

Watson Wyatt's previous advice (see above) had been that a cessation of accrual might lead to a very material de-risking, and they gave similar advice following the announcement of Project Waltz.</p>

During the subsequent discussions about the AVR as at 31 December 2009, Holdings argued against de-risking in the shortterm, whereas the Trustee proposed a substantial de-risking.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Further, it is in my judgement implicit in the definitions of "Service" and "Eligible Employee" that the name of aperson who was in Service and who was in fact a permanent employee would appear in the Participating Employer's register of permanent employees. The Principal Employer could not, in my judgement, exclude from membership of the Scheme (or exclude an entitlement to become a member) a person who was in fact a permanent employee in Service by the simple expedient of declining to place his name on the register. If the Principal Employer was able to exclude a person from membership of the Scheme by, in effect, making a decision to that effect, I would expect to see such a power clearly expressed which it was not. Thus, if Rule 3(A)(1) had referred to a "a register of such of its participating employees as it determines to admit to the Scheme", the position would be clear. But the Rule did not make that provision or anything like it. Instead, it referred to a list of persons capable of identification by reference to a given criterion, namely status as a permanent employee. In cases of doubt about whether an individual was a permanent employee, the Principal Employer was given the function of resolving the doubt; but where there was no doubt, it had no function to perform. It would, in any case, be a remarkable situation if the Principal Employer had been able to dictate the names which appear on the register of permanent employees of each Participating Employer: that register and the names to be placed on it was surely a matter for the Participating Employer concerned, subject to resolution, by the Principal Employer, in cases of doubt.</p>

Previously, termination of contributions would have involved a total or partial winding up, on which event the Members concerned would have been entitled to augmentation of benefits out of surplus (if there was any) after the making of provision for benefits.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The abandonment by IBM of the arguments based on the absence of a negative opinion from the Actuary greatlyreduces the area of contention based on the break in the final salary link. The difference now is this. The RBs contend that the exercise of the Exclusion Power in a way which broke that link is wholly invalid. IBM's contention is that the amendment was valid <span style="font-style:italic">pro tanto</span> and should be given effect to in relation to service after the date of the amendment whilst preserving the final salary link in relation to service prior to the amendment. But the acceptance of that result by IBM relates only to the exercise of the Exclusion Power itself and will, in practice, have little impact because, on IBM's case, the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements will have restricted the part of pay which is pensionable to a figure less than the definition of Final Pensionable Earnings would suggest. The loss of opportunity to benefit from augmentation remains, however, an area of contention.</p>

I do not need to address his submissions in support of that point since it is common ground: Mr Simmonds concedes, as I have said, that the retirement benefits referred to in proviso (e) to the 1983 Amendment Power do embrace a link between accrued service and future salary increases. The same is true of proviso (d) but, in IBM's submission, that proviso is subsumed by proviso (e) and, accordingly, there is no need to deal with it separately.

The draftsman appears to have used the word"value" to connote sums which cannot be mechanistically determined but require valuation (usually by an actuary). From that, it follows that the Actuary would have to form an opinion as to whether the amendment had an adverse effect on the value of the benefit taking account of potential salary increases making appropriate assumptions in order to derive a predicted Final Pensionable Salary. This in turn suggests that proviso (e) is not concerned narrowly with the "amount" of presently accrued pension (calculated by reference to current Pensionable Service and Salary as at the date of amendment).

He says "would" because such an opinion was given in relation to the amendments under Project Soto implementing partial non-pensionability of further pay rises. Those amendments were only rendered valid by the consent of the affected members. Those are bold submissions in the light of the absence of any expert evidence directed at the question whether the fetters were infringed, not by the Soto changes but by the making of the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules.</p>

The issue was whether it was possible to amend the winding up clause to provide for any surplus to be paid to the employers rather than applied to augment benefits. The Court unanimously held that this fetter precluded an amendment, because the possibility of augmentation constituted part of a "Member's interest in the Fund at the date of alteration".

He accepts that the prospective right to a pension based on final salary is part of the interest of a Member. It follows that the elimination of this interest would prejudice the interests of a person who is an active member at the time of the exercise of the Exclusion Clause and would thus be a breach of proviso (d) to the extent that it is "in respect of contributions received by the Trustee prior to 1 January 1973".

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The second point to note is that proviso (e) does not use the word "interests" at all; rather it relates to the"retirement benefits payable under the Scheme to any Member" and what is protected is the aggregate value of all such benefits. The idea behind that, it seems to me, is that the Actuary will be able to identify the benefits which the Scheme provides and will be able to place a value on them making appropriate assumptions as he would do in an actuarial valuation of the Scheme as a whole. It is the aggregate value which has to be maintained, but that does not mean that some benefits may not be reduced provided that others are increased. That does not fit at all comfortably with that idea that the prospect of sharing in surplus, if there is one, on a winding-up, if there is one, is somehow part of the retirement benefits which have to be valued under the Scheme.</p>

If Mr Stallworthy is correct in his construction of provisos (d) and (e), the result is that the opportunity for a deferred pensioner to share in surplus is protected as an "interest" under proviso (d) or as part of "the retirement benefits payable" under proviso (e). But, for reasons already given, proviso (c) does not extend to the protection of that opportunity to pensioners. In other words, deferred pensioners obtain a protection which pensioners do not. That would be a very surprising result.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">In my judgement, Mr Simmonds' approach is more coherent and leads to a more sensible result. The protectionafforded to pensioners relates to their actual benefits in payment and extends to contingent benefits in respect of pensioners. Active members and deferred members are treated together because their benefits are not in payment and the eventual amounts payable are not known and indeed a particular benefit (<span style="font-style:italic">eg</span> a pension) may not even come into payment, for instance in the event of death before the pension comes into payment. Instead protection is afforded under proviso (e) in respect of the retirement benefits which will become payable under the scheme in different events (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>surviving to normal pension age or dying prematurely); those benefits can be ascertained and a value can be placed on them. It is not clear why a different formulation is found in proviso (d) nor why the majority can bind the minority by giving consent to an amendment in contrast with the position in relation to proviso (e). Proviso (d) would appear to afford protection in relation to each interest under the Scheme separately, whereas proviso (e) is expressly directed at the aggregate value of all retirement benefits.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The second distinction is that both provisos (d) and (e) contain a temporal limit to the protection, either 1 January 1973 (proviso (d)) or the date of the amendment (proviso (e)). Mr Stallworthy has drawn attention to the fact that the protection is given in relation to interests or benefits payable "in respect of contributions received by 1 January 1973" (or "already received"). The protection is not expressed to be given by reference to benefits earned by service up to those times. I find the actual wording of the provisos in that regard curious. I suspect that it was a form of words adopted many years ago which has found its way into common usage. It seems to me, however, that it can be referring only to interests or benefits arising under the Scheme in respect of periods for which the contributions (by employer and member) have been paid. In practical terms, there should be little, if any, difference in the result from a formulation based on benefits earned by service up to 1 January 1973 (or the date of the amendment). But I suppose that if contributions are paid in advance so that the Trustee has received contributions in respect of benefits accruing for a period after the date or payment, there could be a difference. But that is fine distinction and I do not consider that it has a material effect on the argument.</p>

A member, of course, had no right under the 1983 Trust Deed and Rules to put the scheme into winding-up, nor could the members collectively, or the Trustee do so. But if the scheme does go into windingup, the opportunity to access surplus remains precisely what it always was.</p>

Quite clearly, future service benefits could be adversely affected: there could be no objection, as a matter of construction of the 1983 Trust Deed and Rules, to IBM and the Trustee agreeing to reduce the accrual rate for future service. Whether the Trustee could properly agree to such a reduction would, of course, depend on the particular facts of the case at the time of the amendment. Such an amendment would be likely to have an impact on how surplus would in fact be distributed in the event of a subsequent winding-up but it cannot seriously be suggested that it would infringe the fetters on the power of amendment.</p>

The rate of future service accrual is clearly not an entrenched provision so that an amendment which adversely affects future service accrual is not to be ruled out as a possibility; such an amendment does not raise the sorts of issue which arise when an amendment is sought to be made to an amendment provision which is hedged about with restrictions so as to remove those restrictions, with the amended power subsequently being used to do something which would have been prevented under the original amendment power.</p>

The structure of those provisions did not, it is true, include a power for IBM unilaterally to reduce future accrual to nil or indeed at all, although IBM did have power to terminate contributions (and thus accrual of benefits) either in relation to a specified category of member or in relation to a Participating Employer, in the latter case bringing about a partial winding-up. I see no reason to think that that part of the structure was a necessary and enduring part of the architecture. I do not consider that the provisos to the power of amendment preclude a new way of dealing with what is to happen in the event of the termination of contributions. Thus, had an amendment been agreed by the Trustee (again, the facts would have to justify the Trustee acting in this way) under which the default position was changed so that, instead of termination of contributions resulting in a total winding-up with an option for the Trustee to continue the scheme as a closed scheme, the scheme was to continue as a closed scheme with the Trustee having an option to place the scheme into winding-up, I do not see why this should be seen as infringing the fetters on the amending power. The amendment will give rise to a change in the structure but will not compromise the essential architecture of the scheme.</p>

That principle must not be pushed too far. As Millett J recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Courage</span>, a series of perfectly valid amendments over a period of time may, at least where not all planned as a single scheme of amendments, result in an end-point which it would not have been possible to reach by a single amendment at the beginning: see his reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Thellusson v Viscount Valentia</span> [1907] 2 Ch. 1 and the Hurlingham Club at p 506. That is not the present case, however, because the question is whether the first (and only relevant) amendment, the introduction of the Exclusion Power, was valid. It does not seem to me that the proposition that you cannot do in two steps what you cannot do in one has any scope for application. An amendment in 1990 to terminate future accrual would have been valid provided that the final salary link had been preserved. So too the introduction of the Exclusion Clause would have been valid if it had contained an express override preserving that link.</p>

If these agreements are valid, the final salary link will have been broken by agreement. Whether those agreements are in fact valid is a different question, but the answer to that is not relevant to the issues now under consideration.

The winding-up rule provided for the purchases of "Paidup Policies securing benefits", that is to say the purchase of annuities and deferred annuities, for pensioners, deferred pensioners and active members (and their dependants): see Rule 57(d)(1) to (5).

The schedule of deficit contributions agreed in 2011 contemplated that the scheme would not be restored to balance even on an ongoing basis until 2020. I agree with Mr Simmonds when he says that it is fanciful to think that there was any surplus which would have been available on a winding-up in 2009 or 2011 or any time in between and therefore fanciful to think that the members were deprived of any opportunity to share in that surplus on the alternative view now under</p>

Both parties agree that the same answer should be given to Issue 2 in the case of both Plans. But they say so for very different reasons. Mr Stallworthy starts with his interpretation of the Exclusion Power in the Main Plan and says that the Exclusion Power in the I Plan should be given the same restrictive interpretation. Mr Simmonds originally submitted that the Exclusion Power in the Main Plan was entirely valid; it was only in his oral closing submissions that he realistically accepted, having heard Mr Stallworthy's submissions, that there had to be an implied limitation on the Main Plan Exclusion Power to reflect the fetters on the 1983 Amendment Power. If his original submission had been correct, then there would clearly have been no reason to apply a different interpretation to the Exclusion Clause in the I Plan. The concession which he made in relation to the Main Plan does not need to be made in relation to the I Plan because the I Plan contained, from its inception, the Exclusion Power. It is still open to him to argue that the Exclusion Power in the I Plan has the wide meaning for which he contends and that the meaning of the Exclusion Power in the Main Plan is precisely the same but, in order to reflect the fetters, is partially invalid. Partial invalidity does not affect the <span style="text-decoration:underline">meaning</span> of the provision: indeed, it only makes sense to speak of invalidity in the context of a provision which, according to its true construction, infringes the fetters.</p>

Thus he asks in his written closing submissions: Would a class comprising the entire membership less one person be a specified class of persons? Or less ten? Or less one hundred? Given that it must be accepted that Holdings had the power to terminate future accrual in respect of any given person by means of the service of a notice to the Trustee directing that such person should cease to be a member, why can Holdings not serve several separate notices in respect of several specified persons? If so, why can Holdings not serve as many notices as there are active members of the Plans, each directing that the person specified in the notice should cease to be a member? And once one reaches that point, what possible reason is there why Holdings cannot do by one step (<span style="font-style:italic">viz</span> a single notice in respect of each of the Plans) that which it could do by several thousand individual notices?</p>

The important words, for present purposes, are "in any particular case" since Morgan J's judgment focused to a considerable extent on the difference between a particular case (or a number of particular cases) and a class. In the present case, there is no similar limitation. Both Mr Stallworthy and Mr Simmonds cite [37] in their written closing submissions:</p>

The definition, as I have emphasised, expressly refers to 'any particular case' and the words suggest an important limitation on the type of case which will fall within the power. If the power is available to be used in a particular case, it is of course hard to avoid the conclusion that it can also be used in two particular cases or several particular cases. Nonetheless, it seems to me that there is difference in kind, and not just a difference in number, between a particular case of a Member or particular cases of Members (on the one hand) and a class of Members, or all Members</p>

In my judgement, the alteration of the Rules intended to have effect, as per the Announcement, falls squarely with Rule 41 and does not fall squarely within the definition of NRD in Rule 3. In that case, one should not construe the power in the definition in Rule 3 more widely than it clearly provides (that is, confined to a particular case or particular cases) because one would thereby produce a power to alter the Rules in a most important respect, that is the NRD for Members, without complying with the safeguards expressly laid down in Rule 41.</p>

Where a scheme-wide amendment to the rules is in issue, one expects to find that certain formalities have to be complied with, and it is to the amendment clause that one turns in order to find out what those formalities are. In the present case, the formalities are a deed or (in the case of the Rules) a deed or a board resolution. In either case, there will be a formal document setting out the changes and evidencing the requisite consent to them of the Trustees. It is inherently most improbable that the parties ever contemplated the possibility of making changes, across the board, to something as basic as NRD for all members, without having to comply with the formalities prescribed by clause 21. Furthermore, a definition in the Rules is not where one would expect to look to find a general power of that nature. I am satisfied, therefore, that the power in the definition should be construed as confined in its scope to special arrangements made in relation to individual members, and that it was not wide enough to authorise a general equalisation of NRD in respect of all future service. What is the point, one may ask, of having a circumscribed power of amendment, if it does not apply to something as fundamental as that?"</p>

I have said that I doubt the admissibility of that factor in relation to the exercise of interpretation in contrast with rectification. But even if it is admissible, it is still important to discover what the plain English used means and to start with its ordinary meaning. If it does not mean what the Trustee and IBM intended it to mean, the remedy is rectification and not to give the words a meaning which they cannot bear. Further, Mr Stallworthy's submission has to start with the proposition that everyone concerned knew what the old provisions meant. It is possible that the draftsman of the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules intended them to mean what IBM says they mean because he thought that that was what the old provisions meant. That, however, is speculation. What I must do is interpret the words used in their context. This is, ultimately, why I do not consider that it makes any difference to the point of interpretation whether one admits the Nabarro instructions or not. It is for similar reasons that I would also reject Mr Stallworthy's submission based on what one would or would not expect to see unannounced as a significant new power. In any case, Mr Tennet accepted in his reply (in the absence of Mr Stallworthy) that Rules 5 to 7 were no more than a replication in plain English of what had gone before.</p>

Hesubmits that on any objective basis, the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules are unlikely to have been intended and understood by its parties as having an effect that would (unless the Actuary made an error of law and therefore failed to express appropriate opinions under provisos (c)-(e)) engage the fetters on the amendment power and invalidate the offending provisions of the 1990 Rules. That is to say that, if an interpretation which results in the fetters not being breached is possible, it is the one which should be adopted in preference to one which does. He puts it rather higher: absent unequivocal terms which cannot be given any other meaning, the provisions of the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules ought to be interpreted on a basis consistent with the restrictions which the Actuary was required to police; and thus on the basis that the Actuary was correct in giving no opinion engaging those provisos.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>The reasonable person with all the background knowledge available to the parties would have understood them to be producing amendments falling within the ambit of the restrictions which the Actuary was required to police. In other words, one should search for a construction which complies with the fetters rather than imposes a limitation to give partial validity to an otherwise invalid provision, which is IBM's solution.

Even accepting that the fetters are engaged so far as concerns preservation of the final salary link, the correct way of continuing the link is by the introduction of the implied limitation which I have discussed at length under Issue 1. This has no bearing, it is said, on the question whether a single notice exercising the Exclusion Power can specify a class of persons comprising the whole of the membership of the Main Plan. I agree with that last proposition. Mr Stallworthy's argument based on the fetters applies as much to an exercise of the Exclusion Power in relation to a group of persons who undoubtedly do form a specified class as much as it does to an exercise of the power in relation to the whole active membership.</p>

Suppose that the Exclusion Power had been drafted in such a way which made the RBs' construction unarguable and IBM's construction obviously correct, would the informed reader respond by saying "What a strange place to find this provision"? I venture to say that the answer would be "No". Having expressed that view, I ought to note that the implied limitation necessary to preserve the final salary link would have an impact on other provisions of the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules because, somewhere, one would need to find a provision (implied) qualifying the level of benefit of a Member who ceased to be a Member as a result of the exercise of the Exclusion Power rather than as the result of, for instance, ceasing employment with IBM to take a job outside IBM. That consideration does not, however, mean that the Exclusion Power itself is found in a surprising location.</p>

The first point is thatwhat has been referred to as the Exclusion Power does not, in fact, include the words "exclude" or "exclusion" in its text. The heading does so, but the Rules contain the common provision that "headings are for ease of reference only, and do not form part of the Rules". Mr Stallworthy says that, since the heading is not part of the Rules, it does not inform or affect their interpretation. I do not derive much from that observation since, even on the construction which Mr Stallworthy invites me to adopt, the result is a power to exclude certain people from membership: it is simply that the circumstances and manner in which such power can be exercised are narrower on the RBs' case than on IBM's case.</p>

Rule 7 would be superfluous if Rule 6 conferred a generalised power to render them ineligible; which makes it even more improbable that Rule 6 was wide enough to terminate accrual by all existing Members. The fact that a separate and explicit power was needed to permit closure to new entrants surely means that a separate and explicit power would likewise have been needed to permit closure to all accrual by existing Members.

The Exclusion Power can be used in relation to an individual member or specified members in circumstances where the termination power would not apply. In any event, the focus is entirely different. The powers to which Mr Stallworthy refers in this part of his argument relate to one or more Participating Employers whereas the Exclusion Power relates to members. The consequence of the exercise of those two powers may, in some circumstances, be similar, namely the cessation of benefit accrual for a group of members and the end of a contribution obligation in respect of future service.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Quite apart from that, Mr Simmonds says that the conclusion which the RBs seek to draw from all of the aboveis to circumscribe the scope of the Exclusion Power in a manner which goes beyond the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used. It is difficult not agree with Mr Simmonds, even taking his acceptance of the broader scope of Rule 6 on its face, when he says that it is by no means unheard of for the governing documentation of a pension scheme to contain superfluous provisions. Such superfluity is particularly unsurprising given that the governing provisions of pension schemes are the product of amendment and restatement over an extended period. And that is as true of the "plain English" exercise as of any other amendment. Mr Simmonds points to a (small) example of incorrect drafting in Rule 2(2)(e) which refers to a member who is "precluded from continued membership of the Plan by the Employers under Rule 5, 6 or 7 of this Schedule". Rule 7, he correctly points out, has nothing to do with <span style="text-decoration:underline">continued</span> membership. It is clear what it means but such less than perfect drafting is only to be expected and no criticism can really be made.</p>

An employee becomes a member of the Money Purchase Section under Rule 1(2)(b) unless he is precluded from membership <span style="text-decoration:underline">of the Plan</span> by an employer under Clause 4 of Part V (that is to say the Exclusion Clause) among other matters. And Rule 2(1)(e) provides that a Member (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>of the Money Purchase Section) shall cease to be a Member if he is precluded from continued membership under that same provision. And so it is said a person can only become a Member or resume Membership with the consent of the Trustee.

He notes, as the RBs have themselves noted, that the words"exclude" and "exclusion" do not feature in the text of the Exclusion Power. The Exclusion Power contains two limbs: a power to direct that a person or class "shall not be eligible for membership" and a power to direct that a person or class "shall cease to be" a Member or Members. It is therefore possible, he says, for IBM to direct that a member shall cease to be a Member without thereby rendering him ineligible for membership. That, according to him, is exactly what the Exclusion Notices did, in the case of the Main Plan expressly stating that it did not constitute a direction that the persons so ceasing to be members of the Main Plan should be ineligible to join the M Plan.</p>

The difficulty with Mr Simmonds' primary position is this: If a Member ceases to be a Member as the result of a notice under the Exclusion Power but is not subject to a direction that he is ineligible for membership, what is it that precludes an entitlement immediately to rejoin the Plan without any consent at all, whether from IBM or the Trustee? On the facts of the present case, IBM might be content to say that there is nothing to prevent that but since the C Plan is closed, the individual would only be able to join the M Plan. But suppose that IBM had simply wanted to exclude employees working at a particular location from membership of the C Plan, wishing them to join the M Plan and had served a notice to that effect, what would there be to stop the members concerned from rejoining the scheme? The solution would be for IBM to serve a notice precluding the affected employees from eligibility. But if that is necessary, what then, one might ask, is the content of the power to bring about a cessation of membership?</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Simmonds explains why the Exclusion Notices took the form which they did. The explanation is that IBMwanted former DB members to have the choice between joining the M Plan or entering into the IBM UK PPP arrangement. At that time, given the Trustee's concerns regarding the lawfulness of the Project Waltz changes, it was not prepared to consent to anything. IBM considered it arguable that, in the absence of a direction that relevant members were not eligible to join the M Plan, those members had the right (without requiring Trustee consent) to join the M Plan under Rule 1(1) of Schedule B to the 1997 Money Purchase Rules. I do not propose to go into the merits of that argument other than to say it draws a distinction between being "precluded from membership" and being "precluded from continuing membership" in two different rules, namely Rule 1(2)(b) and Rule 2(1)(e) of Schedule B to the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules. It was to leave that option open as a possibility to the Members concerned â that is to say, to join the M Plan without the need for the consent of the Trustee â that this proviso was inserted into the Exclusion Notice. The argument may be a good one, it may be a bad one: I do not need to decide. If it is a bad one, then Trustee consent is required, but it does not impact on the validity or otherwise of the Exclusion Notice in terms of improper purpose, although it may have an impact in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

For my part, I have found it helpful to consider a slightly different scenario in assessing the validity of the exercise of the Exclusion Power. Suppose that, instead of offering membership of a DC section of the Main Plan, IBM had created a new, free-standing, money purchase arrangement and given Members precisely the same option of joining such new arrangements as was given in relation to joining the M Plan. The fact, if it be a fact, that the Exclusion Power was being used to bring about a situation where Members would, it was hoped, join the new arrangements does not mean that the Exclusion Power was being used for an improper purpose. The Exclusion Power, again assuming it was validly introduced, would surely be being used for precisely the purpose for which it was given, namely to bring about an end to membership of the Main Plan or I Plan and, in consequence, to bring about a cessation of further benefit accrual. If that is right, then I do not see why it would be improper to achieve the same result by providing benefits through the M Plan.</p>

I perceive that limitation as one to be implied into the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules (and subsequent iterations) so that the benefits applicable on the exercise of the Exclusion Power are the greater of (i) the ordinary leaving service benefits (based on salary at the date of exercise of the Exclusion Power and carrying statutory or scheme revaluation) and (ii) an underpin based on salary at the date when the Member concerned actually leaves service or reaches NRD but not carrying revaluation between the time of the exercise of the Exclusion Power and the date just referred to.</p>

I express this caveat to those conclusions namely that they are subject always to any challenge on the basis of the "good faith" challenge to the whole of Project Waltz or any of its elements.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">In reaching the first three of those conclusions, I have formed the firm view that the narrowest interpretation forwhich Mr Stallworthy contends cannot be right. It is, in effect, to treat the 1990 Trust Deed and Rules as reflecting precisely the provisions of the 1983 Trust Deed and Rules save where Nabarro's instructions were to the contrary. In my judgement, it is not possible to arrive at that conclusion in the light of the language actually used. Whatever the strengths of the arguments in favour of the view that the Exclusion Power does not extend to the exclusion from membership of the whole of the active membership of the Main Plan (other than the Postponed Retirees), I can see no justification for excluding an exercise of the Exclusion Power in relation to a class of persons (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>employees at a particular location).</p>

Since the amendment introducing the Exclusion Power is subject to the implied limitation which I have discussed, the result of the exercise will be to preserve the final salary link.

I only comment at this stage that it is difficult to see how some, indeed most, of the questions which the experts have, on instructions, dealt with are of other than peripheral, if any, relevance to those issues.

There was a conference call about pensions on 23 March 2009 which he says in his witness statement that he participated in, although he was not listed as an attendee in the minutes. I consider that it is clear from all the evidence that his involvement in pension matters was peripheral even at this stage.

Mr Koppl, as I have said, is and was Director of Pension Analytics within the Finance function at CHQ in Armonk. I think it is fair to say from an assessment of all the evidence that he was pivotal in (Mr Tennet would say the mastermind behind) the development of the Soto changes and that he was heavily relied on by CHQ and by the UK teams in the formulation of Project Waltz.</p>

He consults with those who work under him and around him but he clearly "calls the shots" in his own area of responsibility and the extent to which he hears, rather than simply listens to, those he consults is perhaps not always clear. I do not question his honesty and integrity. But having said that, I have to say that in some areas his evidence is really based on reconstruction rather than recollection. That he has no actual recollection of some matters is no surprise; the events took place quite some time ago and Mr MacDonald is a senior manager whom one would not expect to be involved in the detail of implementation of pension changes.</p>

Mr MacDonald was, by his own admission, not a "pensions man" to use my phrase; nor was his expertise in finance or accounting. His evidence showed that he was heavily reliant on others (such as Mr Koppl). His lack of financial/pensions expertise led him into error: for example, his witness statement stated that after Soto "costs continued to increase year on year" but, having been shown a document in cross-examination, he accepted that it demonstrated that pension costs would decrease.</p>

It is clear that both Ms Jennifer Bell of Nabarro and Mr Alexander of Watson Wyatt, on behalf of the Trustee, were present at the meeting, although Mr MacDonald could not remember their presence. Some of those attending that meeting have given evidence. All of them apart from Mr MacDonald himself say that the impression given by Mr MacDonald was that he would resist any future changes to pension provision in the UK: that is what they thought he meant in saying that he would "push back" if anyone sought to re-visit the UK pension issues. Mr MacDonald alone has a different recollection. This, however, is a case where I am sure that the recollection is really no more than reconstruction and I cannot take this part of his evidence as establishing what he actually meant to communicate let alone the impression he actually created.

Mr Tennet gives one example concerning his "sametime" exchange with Mr Chrystie on 17 March 2009. He initially denied having warned Mr Chrystie not to speak to Mr Wilson about pensions issues. But when shown this "sametime" exchange, he accepted that he could well have told Mr Chrystie that he was not to discuss Project Waltz with Mr Wilson. I do not suggest there was any dishonesty here; indeed, in that relevant exchange, Mr Riley sought to explain what his understanding had been and why he had given the earlier answer which he had.</p>

But he made no mention at all of one business reason, namely a directive from CHQ that retirement related costs savings be made as a matter of urgency to fix NPPC and ensure that the 2010 EPS Roadmap was met. And yet, in cross-examination, he not only accepted that this was a reason, but he also accepted that it was an important motivation for the changes.</p>

To the extent that the evidence of individuals about what they understood is relevant at all, the issue for me is not so much what they might reasonably have understood if a tutor, such as Mr Simmonds, had been whispering in their ears, inviting them to ask themselves the right questions, but rather the issue is the impression which they actually gained from the Webcast as a whole. In making that assessment, I must, of course recognise that there may be elements of reconstruction, especially in the light of the resentment which Mr Simmonds has identified, and perhaps elements of wishful thinking.</p>

To some extent he succeeded in that because, on a sentence by sentence analysis, each witness broadly accepted many of the propositions put to them. He did put to each of them that there was nothing in the Webcast or the guarantee to justify the conclusion that IBM was undertaking that future service accrual in the DB Plans would continue for any period, but he did not suggest that they were making up their evidence about what they understood at the time.</p>

Instead: (1) in cross-examination, he plumped for a period of ten years, which happened to be roughly the same length as the guarantee; but (2) in re-examination, he had moved to ten years as a minimum, the period now being ten to twenty years.</p>

However far the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty may go or not go, it is right to conclude that an employer must not act in an "empty or irrational" way. The word "empty" is not mine but has been used on several occasions and denotes, to my mind, an absence of any reason. I think the words "empty" and "irrational" inform each other so that the composite "empty or irrational" has a pretty clear meaning. But this has nothing to do with fairness and little, if anything, to do with objective reasonableness. As Newey J put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Prudential</span>, assessing whether a decision is irrational or perverse (in the sense in which he was using those words) is not to be equated with the application of an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>

I do not consider that there can be any doubt that the test is not one of fairness. The essential reason is that appeals to fairness do not solve the problem. What is fair to one person may seem unfair to another; both the employer and the employees may have perfectly reasonable views even though those views are diametrically opposed. It is not for the court to take on the mantle of arbiter of fairness. Some other test has to be found.</p>

But what it cannot do is put itself in the chairs of the employees who attended meetings (save where videos are available). To learn what was actually said, the evidence of those attending is relevant. Further, it is relevant not only to what was actually said, but also to the way in which it was said and the impressions which, objectively, might reasonably have been gained. And it is relevant to establishing what IBM could reasonably have considered the level of understanding of the target audience might be. I do not consider that such evidence is irrelevant.</p>

Browne-Wilkinson V-C recognised that, in exercising the discretionary powers under consideration in that case and, I would say, in exercising IBM's powers in the present case, the employer is entitled to take account of its own financial and other interests subject to any constraint imposed by a requirement (if one exists) of consistency with any expectations on the part of the members. The employer's financial and other interests are factors to be taken into account in assessing whether there had been any breach of the employer's duty of good faith. Other authorities have adopted the same approach: see for instance Robert Walker J in <span style="font-style:italic">National Grid Company plc v Laws </span>[1997] PLR 157 at [88], Pumfrey J in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoover Ltd v Hetherington </span>[2002] PLR 297 at [53] and my own decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bradbury </span>at [103]. Other things being equal, an employer is therefore entitled, quite clearly in my view, to prefer his own economic interests to those of his employees. By doing so, he may create all sorts of problems in terms of workforce motivation even leading to strikes and the like, but that is a matter for his commercial judgment. If a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is to be established, there has to be more than a decision which the employees consider to be unreasonable: there has to be something more substantial. That is no doubt why the RBs in the present case place so much reliance on what was said to the members in the implementation of Ocean and Soto and do not simply rely on the terms of Project Waltz being in themselves so monstrous, to use my own word, that taken in isolation they breach the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

Both of these duties are admitted as matters of principle and it is also admitted that they apply to IBM's powers under, and in relation to, the Plans. Both strands are relevant in the present case, because not all of the Project Waltz proposals were to be implemented under powers in the Plans. They involved other aspects, such as the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements and the alleged pressure placed on members to enter into them.</p>

Everything is taken into account but the ultimate question is whether the employer has acted irrationally or perversely. His key point is that it is "simply not appropriate to enter into an analysis, an evaluation of the merits of the employer's decisions by reference to criteria that are essentially designed to answer the question: was this a reasonable thing to do?". He could make the same points even if a two-pronged approach is to be adopted, but on the basis that the "reasonable and proper cause" prong is satisfied provided that the employer can at least demonstrate a rational reason for his decision.</p>

But, to repeat, the words of Browne-Wilkinson V-C are not legislation and he was simply attempting to articulate, at the very beginning of the development of the duty, its core elements. Logically, if an employer has a reasonable cause or excuse to conduct himself in a way which might give rise to a question as to whether what he is doing is proper because on the face of it the result looks surprising, then he is not in breach of duty. Indeed, whether Mr Tennet is right or Mr Simmonds is right on this issue, the result will be, if there is a reasonable cause or excuse, that the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is not breached at all; it is not that there has been a breach of duty which the Court then goes on to treat as no breach or as a breach which carries no remedy.</p>

If the allegation turns out to be true, the relationship of trust and confidence is likely, nonetheless, to have been seriously undermined if not altogether destroyed. But there will have been no breach of the implied duty of good faith on the part of the employer because his conduct (the making of the accusation) would have been with proper cause (unless, for instance, made unnecessarily public until proven).</p>

Mr Spink is correct, in my view, when he says that Owen J did not make a finding that the relationship of trust and confidence was damaged until he had been through all aspects of the matter, including the question whether or not the offending contractual clause was inserted with reasonable or proper cause. And I agree with him when he suggests that Owen J's decision is not a clear authority for the requirement that there must be a formal two-stage test. It was not until [223], having been through the evidence, that Owen J was able to say that the introduction of the offending clause was regarded at the time as likely seriously to damage the relationship of trust and confidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.66in;margin-right:0.01in">Reasonable expectations are relevant. Mr Tennet adopts the terminology of "reasonable expectation" in orderto distinguish it from what he calls a "mere expectation". By "reasonable expectation" he means an expectation as to what will happen in the future engendered by the employer's own actions (and in relation to matters over which the employer has some control), which gives employees a positive reason to believe that things <span style="text-decoration:underline">will</span> take a certain course.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>A "mere expectation" is one which an employee may have in fact as to the future, in the sense that they anticipate, assume or expect that something (<span style="font-style:italic">eg</span> a discretionary increase) will happen in the ordinary course of events <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> things "carry on as they are". Employees may have a mere expectation independently of any encouragement by the employer. Since "reasonable expectation" is being used as a term of art, I propose to use the words "Reasonable Expectation" with upper case leading letters; otherwise, there is a danger that, by repeated use, anything which is reasonable will be seen as a "Reasonable Expectation". Thus, a mere expectation may be perfectly reasonably held by an employee but that will not turn it into a Reasonable Expectation, and use of those words without upper case leading letters can only cause confusion. I consider the correct approach to Reasonable Expectations later in the next section of my judgment starting at paragraph 450. In particular, I address Mr Simmonds' arguments to the effect that a merely negligent statement cannot give rise to any breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

Representations giving rise to expectations certainly have a part to play in the present case; indeed, the issue is of central importance. But that is not the beginning and end of the matter since serious challenges are made by the RBs to the alleged justifications for Project Waltz which they say are no justifications at all. If that is right, then the purported reliance on such matters is at the very least a factor to be taken into account in assessing whether or not a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is established. Further, the RBs say that IBM's statements about the sustainability of the Plans means that IBM must have believed, on the basis of the information available to it at the time, that its statements were true. Or, if IBM did not believe those statements or had no justification for making those statements because it had not taken steps to confirm them, it would be a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty to act in a way that is inconsistent with the truth of those statements: in other words, if there was no significant change in financial circumstances between the time when the statements were made and the time of Project Waltz, IBM cannot, according to the RBs, rely on non-sustainability as justification for the later changes.</p>

As I have mentioned, the RBs rely on some of the employment law cases to identify the scope of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty but IBM submits that these cases do not assist. Mr Simmonds' position is that the bar has been set very high â he would say at the level of perversity or irrationality â and that the RBs seek to lower the bar by reference to the employment law authorities which do not admit of sensible application in the context of a pension scheme.</p>

It has to be recognised that it was a new duty whose justification and rationale was the parallel employment law duty. But what Browne-Wilkinson V-C did not do, at least expressly, was to import lock, stock and barrel, into the new duty all of the attributes of the established employment law duty. Had he done so, he would no doubt have explained in more detail than he did the parallels which could properly be drawn.</p>

As I remarked in my judgement in <span style="font-style:italic">Bradbury</span>, Browne-Wilkinson V-C gave his judgment under considerable time-pressure and, against his inclination, gave some guidance about how the new principle would work in practice. And just as some of those examples are not entirely easy to understand as fitting within the new principle, perhaps because thought of in some haste, so too his statement of the new principle cannot be taken as a rigorous articulation of the scope of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. Moreover, even in an employment law context, there is support for the conclusion that, in some cases, the test of irrationality or perversity is the correct test: see <span style="font-style:italic">Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald International </span>[2005] ICR 402 ("<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Horkulak</span>") and <span style="font-style:italic">Clark v Nomura International plc </span>[200] IRLR 766 ("<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Clark v Nomura</span>").

It is certainly true that the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is not contractual not least because otherwise it would not be owed to persons (such as a member's dependants) who had never been in an employment relationship with the employer.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Further, as Mr Simmonds points out, there cannot be a complete elision between the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and the duty of good faith in an employment context for two other reasons. First, the latter comes to an end when the employment relationship comes to an end: see for instance Lord Millett in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v Unisys Ltd </span>[2003] 1 AC 518 ("<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Johnson v Unisys</span>") at [78].</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The second reason is that, in an employment law context, express and unrestricted powers cannot in the ordinaryway be circumscribed by an implied qualification; and that applies as much to the implied duty of good faith as to any other provision. In that context, Mr Simmonds relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Reda v Flag Ltd.</span> [2002] IRLR 747 ("<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Reda</span>") where the Privy Council refused to apply the implied term to constrain the exercise by the employer of its express and unqualified right to terminate an employee's employment without cause. He submits that assimilation of the employment law duty and the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty would prove too much because, in a pensions context, the employer's powers are nearly always unrestricted or restricted in specific ways. On the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Reda</span>, such unrestricted (or specifically restricted) powers would not be subject to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty which would then be of very limited scope indeed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">In my view, that last submission goes too far. The point which was being made in <span style="font-style:italic">Reda </span>was that the implied term would not constrain the exercise of the power in a way which went against its express terms: in effect, a power to dismiss without cause could not be subject to a constraint which required cause to be shown. In the case of an ordinary power of amendment in a pension scheme, the power is unrestricted only in the sense that, on a literal reading, there are either no express constraints or express constraints usually imposed to protect members' accrued rights. It would not be inconsistent, in the sense that the question was addressed in <span style="font-style:italic">Reda</span>, to subject the amendment power to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

There was an application by the trustees of the relevant scheme for directions as to whether or not it could give consent to a determination by the employer to reclassify existing DB members as DC members. In the absence of consent, the employer had indicated that it would wind up the scheme. The purported justification for the changes (which have parallels in the present case) were (i) to eliminate fluctuations in the employer's financial results directly due to the uncertainty of funding DB arrangements (ii) to reduce administration costs (iii) to ensure that all employees enjoyed consistent employment conditions and (v) to align the scheme with "global best practice, both within KC [the employer group] and elsewhere, in providing [DC] arrangements<span style="font-style:italic">"</span>.

And when asking oneself whether the term which is to be implied in a particular case has a content which precludes action which falls within the literal meaning of the power being taken, the nature of the power is, it seems to me, of central importance when it comes to establishing the scope of an implied restraint on its exercise. Thus I agree with Mr Simmonds when he says that the nature of the power is relevant. Further the fact that the employer's power is otherwise unfettered, either by an express constraint on the power or by making the exercise of that power subject to another's consent, is, as he submits, a relevant factor to take into account in determining the fetter imposed by the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in that context. The terms on which the employees became members of the scheme, contained in the trust deed and rules and notified to them by way of employee handbooks, are also I consider relevant to the scope of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. Newey J clearly took this view when giving his reasons for saying that Prudential had not acted irrationally or perversely or otherwise in breach of duty. One reason (see at [186]) was "crucially, [the relevant rule] conferred on Prudential a discretion which was not subject to any express restrictions".

But that is also putting matters too high because it may very well be the end as well as the start of the enquiry. It is for the employee to show that the employer is in breach of his <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty so the enquiry does not even begin unless and until the employee shows an arguable case that a breach of duty is involved. So although I agree with the principle articulated by Mr Tennet as stated above, it remains for the employee to show that an exercise of the power which, on its face, is compliant with the power gives rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. In assessing whether there is in fact a breach, the court will take account of the nature of the power and the absence of any fetters on the power.

The duty is not, however, a statutory duty and one must be very careful about construing the words of a Judge, however eminent, as if they were legislation. But even if one were to take the words "seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence" as a quasistatutory reference point, it tells one nothing about how to assess whether the conduct complained of can be seen, objectively, as doing so. Instead, it is necessary to turn to again Judge-made criteria. Mr Tennet is right, no doubt, that it is not universally the case that there has to be irrationality or perversity in an employment law context as a matter of contract. <span style="font-style:italic">Malik </span>may be an example of that.

He relies on the reference in [143] (see paragraph 361 above) to "a genuine and rational, as opposed to an empty or irrational, exercise of discretion".

There could potentially be cases in which, say, a decision to override expectations which an employer had engendered would be irrational or perverse. On the other hand, it is important to remember that powers such as that at issue in the present case are not fiduciary. As a result, the donee of the power is, as Mr Tennet pointed out, entitled to have regard to his own interests when making decisions (see paragraphs 121 and 124 above).

In other words, if expectations have been engendered by an employer, that may have been done in such a way that to disappoint those expectations would, absent some special change in circumstances, involve the employer acting in a way that no reasonable employer would act; in which case, irrationality or perversity, as those concepts are to be understood in this context, is established.

These considerations support, in my view, the conclusion which I have reached about the test to apply and the rejection of Mr Tennet's two-pronged approach to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

The conclusion which IBM draws is that there can have been no breach of duty on the part of Holdings since it cannot sensibly be said that Holdings' decisions, in the light of its own knowledge, could be seen by the members as amounting to conduct which would destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between them.</p>

Those statements and presentations were, in turn, relied on by the Trustee in making its decision to agree to the amendments required to give effect to Ocean and Soto. More importantly for present purposes, much of the content of those statements and presentations was communicated to the employees: to the extent that content gave rise to Reasonable Expectations, they are, in my judgement, to be attributed to Holdings just as much as statements made directly on behalf of Holdings, for instance in the Webcast and in roadshows. I can see no relevant difference in principle in the context of the engendering of expectation between statements made directly to the members and statements made directly only to the Trustee but which were then communicated by the Trustee to the members with the knowledge and approval of CHQ. <span style="font-weight:bold">Reasonable Expectations</span></p>

His case is that an employer's failure to act consistently with Reasonable Expectations which the employer himself has engendered, in relation to a matter as central to the employment relationship as pension provision, is a paradigm example of a situation that is likely to impact on the relationship of trust and confidence. This is particularly so in the circumstances in which employees are relying on the employer to guide and inform their decision making in relation to future pension arrangements as in the present case. Dishonesty or recklessness is not needed to establish breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in relation to statements made; there is no reason in principle why trust and confidence cannot be undermined by making a false or misleading statement without reasonable cause or negligently.</p>

In that case, Mr French had been asked by his employer, the bank, to relocate and had accepted an interest-free "bridging loan" to enable him to move before his old house could be sold. After 6 months (and at a point where he could not sell his old house save at a substantial loss) the bank sought to charge interest. It was held that the attempt to require interest to be paid while Mr French was genuinely attempting to market his former home was a breach of the loan contract. But quite apart from this, it decided that the attempt to withdraw the interest free loan and charge interest was a breach of the bank's duty to maintain trust and confidence under Mr French's contract of employment. This was because of Mr French's expectations as to the nature of the loan transaction in the context of the bank's relocation request. Waller LJ said this at [46]:</p>

In principle, I do not see why the member should not have a claim although the issue will be heavily fact-dependent depending, for instance, on the precise nature of the representation, on the time at which the member learned of it, on whether he would in fact have made a different choice if there had not been a misrepresentation and on the scope of the new changes. This, however, has nothing to do with expectations, reasonable or otherwise, about what the employer will do in the future; rather, if there is a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, it arises from the consideration (in accordance with my view of the appropriate test applicable in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty) that no reasonable employer would make the changes proposed in the light of the misrepresentation it had previously made.</p>

This is more so where, as he says in the present case, the statement of intention is coupled with an express disavowal of any commitment or guarantee. I do not expect that Mr Tennet would dispute the proposition that a statement of intention, if that is all that is established, cannot be treated as a commitment, promise or guarantee. However, he does take a very different view of what the statements made actually amounted to, saying that they go far beyond a mere expression of present intention and give rise to Reasonable Expectations including one to the effect that future accrual of benefits would not be curtailed for a period which had not expired by the time Project Waltz was implemented.

There would be no point in implying the duty if it only applied in situations in which there was already a cause of action. Mr Simmonds' riposte to that answer is to say that it is not an answer at all to the question why statements made to employees should be actionable, where they would not be actionable if made to anyone else, by reason of a duty to maintain trust and confidence which plainly would still have a purpose in many other situations even if it did not extend to statements which were otherwise non-actionable.</p>

Moreover, how it was reasonable for a member to assimilate and react to the communications must also be viewed in the context of the importance of the subject matter of the communications and the communications themselves. It is obviously correct that pensions are an important part of remuneration. If it is said, as it is by the RBs, that IBM engendered Reasonable Expectations of such importance that to disappoint those Expectations breaches the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty (thus <span style="text-decoration:underline">destroying</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline">significantly undermining</span> the relationship of trust and confidence), I would expect members to have given serious consideration to the communications.

However, in relation to the issue of Reasonable Expectations, it is what the hypothetical reasonable member would have done which is relevant. That member must, it seems to me, be a person who is concerned to inform himself about the content of communications about pensions and the impact on him for the future. He would listen to (perhaps more than once) the Webcast; he would read written communications devoting enough time and attention to form an understanding of them. He would not simply skim though them saying to himself that he had no time understand them properly. Further, even if he thought that he understood the key documents, he would know that there was ancillary material (such as the Q&amp;As).

"Evidence of what members actually thought helps" he says "to recalibrate the Court's interpretation to the level of lay members. And if so many members plainly <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> have such expectations, how, objectively, could they all be unreasonable?" I am not in sympathy with the view that Judges are "out of touch" with ordinary people, but I understand Mr Tennet's point. Certainly, were I to find that the evidence which the members actually gave is inconsistent with the conclusions which I would otherwise reach about the understanding of the reasonable member, it would cause me to pause for thought. But such evidence is not conclusive and, indeed, it needs to be examined critically to see precisely what the witnesses are saying.

It is based on the actual asset allocation of the fund. This means that, assuming a plan fund invested in return-seeking assets of equal value to the PBO, the figure for EROA (which is based on return-seeking yields) should always be larger than the figure for Interest Cost (which is based on corporate bond yields) assuming of course that the former are actually assumed to produce a higher return than the latter. It also means that a change in asset allocation will change the figure for EROA (and therefore potentially increase NPPC). An alteration in the Trustee's investment policy for the Plans could therefore potentially lead to a reduction in the EROA assumption and in turn to an increase in NPPC and a reduction in corporate earnings. This would be irrespective of any cash contributions paid to the Plan.</p>

So, one of the reasons why IBM in 2007 was able to predict falling pension costs, on the basis of static ("flat") assumptions, was that it could see that past asset gains were due to feed into the calculation of NPPC over the next few years. Equally, it was foreseeable in 2008/2009 that the losses of 2008 would affect NPPC for some years to come.</p>

In the case of the Project Soto changes, the benefits were initially amortised for the period after Project Soto, but the cessation of accrual in the Plans as a result of Project Waltz meant that most of the PBO credit had to be recognised in a single year.

The accounts for the Plans show a running tallyof unrecognised actuarial losses and gains. The phrase "actuarial gains and losses" is correct but misleading: the tally is not confined to changes in actuarial assumptions but includes what are in practice real world changes (such as falls in the Plans' assets), as measured against the way they have been recognised for the purposes of the calculation. For the purposes of this case, the most significant additions to the tally are: falls and gains in the value of the Plans' funds; increases in PBO due to movements in the corporate bond market (and therefore the applicable discount rate) and any changes to actuarial assumptions (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>potential changes in longevity assumptions or similar). Where the running tally exceeds 10% of the greater of PBO or MRVA (known as "the corridor"), the quantum of the tally in excess of the corridor is amortised and recognised in the accounts.

It is in essence as follows, although more detail can be found in paragraph 290 of his written closing submissions and the footnote references.

The appropriate difference between bond yields and equity yields may clearly vary from time to time and the translation of this difference into an EROA assumption for the whole fund will depend on the fund asset allocation. However, although there are a number of variables in the calculation, the simple arithmetic of the process dictates that a well-funded fund which carries a substantial holding of equities will tend to produce a substantial income before deduction of service cost. If the fund is mature, the cost may not make a significant dent in that income (and if the fund is closed, it will make no dent).</p>

In this case, as the actuarial experts accept, there was a mismatch between liabilities and asset allocation, which was nevertheless within the spectrum for UK funds. In those circumstances, any statement that "you might expect NPPC to be at least equal to service cost" or "service cost was a bargain" or the various statements of that nature made on behalf of the RBs should properly be viewed as unfounded assertions masquerading as common sense. Whether it is right, as Mr Simmonds suggests, that to the contrary you would 'expect' a mature scheme invested with this mismatch to produce an NPPC profit, I do not need to decide. But what I do conclude is that the arguments raised by the RBs based on the proposition that NPPC cost can be expected to equal or exceed service cost over a period are unsound. The argument that NPPC should only become a problem for Holdings if it were consistently greater than its share of service cost does not address the relationship discussed in the preceding paragraph.</p>

That is even more so the case in relation to its use from time to time in various contexts â by CHQ and in its communications, by the Trustee and the UK team and in their communications with members. The word itself is not difficult to understand: it means, for present purposes, being likely to change suddenly and unexpectedly or unpredictably. The lack of clarity in the present case comes not from the word itself but from what it is being applied to. There are at least three different relevant aspects to which it has been applied. First, to the value of scheme assets and the amount of scheme liabilities; secondly to the gap between that value and that amount (sometimes referred to as "breadth of variance volatility"); and thirdly to NPPC. The second, the deficit, was a matter of concern to the Trustee. Volatility of that sort could, to some extent at least, be managed by appropriate investment policies and in particular matching (although in the real world, 100% matching is impossible). The third was the matter of greatest concern to CHQ because of the impact NPPC would have on EPS.</p>

But that is not the sense in which volatility (of a type capable of being brought under some sort of control) is being used. As used within CHQ and in the communications between CHQ and the Trustee, volatility was always (there may be exceptions, but if so they are few and far between) used as referring to NPPC volatility. The UK team's paper prepared for the presentation to the Trustee on 8 December 2005 focused on NPPC volatility. Thereafter, my impression of all of the material is that everyone involved in preparing communications was using the word in the sense of NPPC volatility. As I have said, whether the reasonable member reading or hearing the few references to volatility would have appreciated the reference seems to me to be unlikely.</p>

The challenge was to explain why, if the Reasonable Expectations relied on by the RBs had not been engendered by IBM in the course of Ocean and Soto, there was a widespread and firmly held understanding among the workforce that DB accrual would continue. IBM does not accept that there was such a widespread understanding, but to the extent that there was an understanding at all, he suggests that it arose, not because IBM engendered an expectation in the course of Ocean and Soto, but because some members were clinging to values of a past era.</p>

At that time, the new CEO, Louis V. Gerstner, Jr, began to change IBM's corporate culture: employment costs were reined in, and IBM's corporate values were redefined, with a recognition that increased shareholder value was a key indicator of success. One can see his philosophy set out in his book "Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?" (he at least may have approved of the Waltz of the Pachyderms). One also gets a flavour of the commercial challenge facing IBM from the following details which he gives. The book is not, I appreciate, evidence and I do not rely on it for detail, but only to demonstrate something about his thinking and to show the (unchallenged) scale of the economic hurdles facing IBM in the 1990s.</p>

Between 1992 and 1994 the number of employees fell from roughly 300,000 to about 220,000. From 1994 onwards there was, on any basis, a substantial turn-around. The share price increased under his stewardship: it stood at $12.72 in 1993, and during the course of the 1990s rose until it stood at $120 by 2001. I think that Mr Simmonds is entitled to rely (as he does) on those figures to illustrate that IBM was in very serious trouble in the early 1990s and to show that there was a substantial turn around in the rest of the 1990s, a proposition with which Mr Johnson agreed.</p>

Before him, a pension scheme was designed to encourage the employee into a lifetime contract with IBM. With Gerstner, the pendulum swung very strongly away from the employee and towards Gerstner and his small cadre of executives who were prepared to follow his demand that they spend two years' worth of salary to buy IBM shares. Pension schemes became just a cost, and happy retired employees were of no commercial value. Single status went out the window as Gerstner arranged for his lifetime use of IBM's corporate jets. Palmisano largely followed Gerstner's example. Aided by the internet and cheap telecommunications, he could reduce employment in the West, switch to much cheaper employees in the East, and still keep customers in the West happy. Again the matters of lifetime employment and pensions seemed irrelevant."</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.83in;margin-right:0.01in">And so, Mr Simmonds explains, IBM remains very tough on managing the bottom line, including employeecosts, which is partly a product of the disastrous experience of the early 1990s. Mr MacDonald's unchallenged evidence was that this affected the mind-set of senior IBM executives, many of whom survived the near-death experience of the early 1990s; and even in an era of greater profitability, it still affected that mind-set. Thus, by 2008, IBM was determined that it would be proactive in taking a variety of measures (not simply in relation to retirement) to minimise the impact of the financial crisis and to ensure that IBM as a business remained competitive and could continue to deliver value to its shareholders, including by meeting its commitments under the 2010 EPS Roadmap. In that context, it is not surprising, he suggests, that the long-serving employees who formed the majority of the DB members reacted so strongly to the pension changes; but the strength of their reaction is a response in part to the change in the corporate culture which took place during their employment with IBM.</p>

From the extracts from Mr Gerstner's bookand from the example â I am sure he is not alone â of Mr Gavin Wilson's email, can be seen the irresolvable clash of cultures. It is not difficult to see that those who share Mr Gavin Wilson's thinking would see the Gerstner approach as destructive of their hopes and aspirations and indeed what, for some of them, had become expectations. But those expectations, led by the culture which Mr Gerstner deprecated in the then new harsh commercial world for IBM, were not necessarily expectations which employees could assert as legal rights, disappointment of which would result, in England, in a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. The questions are whether IBM could properly propose and implement Project Waltz and to what extent the new culture can properly be invoked to override any such Reasonable Expectations as can be established.</p>

The answer to that apparent conundrum is that rationality and <span style="font-style:italic">bona fides</span> are being assessed by different criteria in each case. The business case in favour of a pension change to the detriment of members may rest solely on financial and economic considerations and may, on that basis, be strong and one which an employer, untrammelled by commitments to its workforce, could perfectly properly make: the change would be coherent and rational in that way. In contrast, the test of irrationality and perversity under the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is focused on a course of conduct which no reasonable employer would pursue.

In 2003, there was the start of a recovery: the Main Plan began to make actuarial gains as ROA well exceeded EROA. These losses for 2000-2002 were, however, smoothed over the coming years, delaying their effects.

This prompted the UK management team (led, at that time, by Mr Hirst, then the UK general manager) to put together a business recovery plan. As part of the review that this entailed, UK management began, in February 2004, to consider making changes to the design of the UK DB Plans. A "pensions project" team, led by Kevin Waller and also including Mr Wilson, Mr Newman and Mr Heath was set up to consider pension policy changes, including changes required by new Government legislation, increases to employee contributions, a policy for increases in pensions in payment and cost of living adjustments ("<span style="font-weight:bold">PIP</span>" and "<span style="font-weight:bold">COLA</span>") and questions of long term funding.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">Given the system of "powers reserved" to IBM Corporation which I described in detail in my judgement in theRectification Action, CHQ became involved in the formulation of these possible changes at an early stage. The RBs put this rather higher than mere involvement. They say that even though the pensions project was initiated by the UK team, CHQ retained ultimate control over any pensions design changes. It is clear, in my view, that there was more than simple involvement. The "powers reserved" meant that CHQ had to approve rather than merely be consulted. In that sense, the RBs are correct to say that CHQ retained ultimate control; but it is also the case that CHQ did not impose its view in the sense of compelling UK management to take particular action. In practice, this was never an issue because UK management knew where the ultimate power lay and would follow CHQ policy and directions: there was no occasion on which they were faced with implementing something which they considered was wrong, in the sense of being against the interests of the UK companies, although I am bound to say that matters came pretty close to that later on in relation to Project Waltz. The practical recognition of this power structure is reflected in the meeting of the UK Pensions Project Team on 28 June 2004 where it was noted that approval from CHQ <span style="font-style:italic">via</span> Damian Glendinning (Director of treasury operations and pensions strategy in the Corporate Treasury Department at CHQ), and review by Paul Michaud (Program Manager, Global Benefits, CHQ), would be required for any proposals the UK team made, which might take some time.</p>

The reassurance given by Mr Hirst related to funding, not to any future accrual of benefits. Moreover, Mr Hirst expressly stated that it was IBM's <span style="text-decoration:underline">current</span> intention to continue to support the Plan through the payment of contributions. No doubt the Trust Deed and Rules (together with statutory provisions) would have imposed some obligations on IBM from which it could not escape. But that does not lead the conclusion that IBM was obliged to keep the Plan open. I can detect nothing in the correspondence which could reasonably be taken as a commitment to keep the Plan open to accrual of future benefits either at the then current rate of accrual or at any other rate. To the extent that IBM could properly bring about a closure of the Plan to future accrual before this correspondence and the September meeting, it continued to be able to do so; the correspondence and the meeting did not constrain IBM's behaviour in that respect. I ought to note, in any case, that there is nothing to suggest that this correspondence or the contents of the meeting were communicated to members: it cannot therefore have engendered directly any expectation, reasonable or otherwise, in them. That is not to say that it had no impact on the members. The subsequent communications from the Trustee to the members were based on what the Trustee had been told and was capable of giving rise to expectations on the part of the members.</p>

[The sense here is that everyone knew IBM would never say never but a literal reading is to the opposite effect.] There was clearly concern on the part of IBM not to give a commitment that the Plan would not be closed and a reluctance even to give an assurance that there was no current proposal to do so. Perhaps, at that time, IBM could not truthfully have given such an assurance. Closure of the Plan was certainly one of the options which IBM considered when developing the Project Ocean proposals although it was, in the event, rejected. Precisely when it was rejected is not clear. Nonetheless, I agree with Mr Simmonds' submission that this email was not addressing the ongoing future of the Plans: the focus was on ensuring that IBM would stand behind the Plans notwithstanding that substantial deficit which existed. In relation to the future, it was saying no more, at most, than that IBM had no current plans to wind-up the plan so that, without commenting on media reports, the message could be taken home that those reports were inaccurate.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">At a meeting of the Investment Committee held on 2 May 2002, it was decided (following expert advice) that,although there was no need for major action, the asset split ought to be changed â by way of a de-risking strategy whereby a greater proportion of the fund was invested in bonds â in order to reflect the increasing maturity of the Main Plan. In particular, it was decided to implement a 5% move from equities to index-linked bonds by means of a 1% move per quarter for five quarters. After the first 1% movement, however, it was decided (at the meeting of the Investment Committee held on 25 July 2002) to delay the next switch pending further examination of the appropriate ratio in the light of a volatile, declining investment market. The asset allocation policy as at 31 December 2002 was, therefore, a 79%/21% split. In 2003, further consideration was given by the Investment Committee to the appropriate split and it was intended that a full asset/liability modelling (<span style="font-weight:bold">'ALM'</span>) study would be carried out in 2004 following the valuation as at 31 December 2003. At the end of 2003, the policy remained a 79%/21% (although the actual split as at 31 December 2003 was 81%/19%).</p>

The first major task for Mr Alexander, and of Watson Wyatt as the Trustee's new actuarial adviser, was to prepare the formal triennial valuation as at 31 December 2003. It was during the preparation of this valuation that IBM and the Trustee became aware that the Plans were likely to show the substantial deficit which I have referred to and which, in turn, was a primary impetus for the Project Ocean changes, not least because of the effect it was likely to have on IBM's future contributions to the Plans.</p>

As at that date, the asset allocation mix was 75%/25%. At about that time, Watson Wyatt had also produced a draft valuation as at 31 December 2003 that, contrary to AON's previous approach to such valuations, was based on (1) the market value of assets and (2) more conservative investment return assumptions. This draft valuation projected a deficit of some Â£1.2bn which Mr Simmonds describes as "alarming". Given this projected deficit, one of Watson Wyatt's concerns was the restoration of the Plans' solvency, which would require, in particular, significantly increased contributions from Holdings which, in turn, would require the Trustee to assess the strength of Holdings' covenant.</p>

UK management addressed this by deciding that the proposals should include the guarantee and significant deficit repair contributions by IBM of Â£200m pa for three years. The guarantee would enable the scheme actuary to adopt a so-called "best estimate" approach to the actuarial valuation. The provision of the guarantee would also enable the Trustee to set a date on which the target portfolio of the Plans should be achieved â that is to say, a date on which the move from equities to bonds to reflect the increasing maturity of the Plans should be completed â later than the date that would otherwise have been adopted. It was also proposed that any future costs of DB accrual would be shared 50/50 between IBM and the members (excluding any increase in cost that resulted from a change in the average age of active employees).</p>

The email contained a suggested draft which explained that the new actuary's approach represented a "fundamental shift in the planning for, and funding of, pension plans" and that the effect of the actuary's conservative approach reduced EROA from IBM's current assumption of 8% to 6.025%.</p>

I agree that CHQ was, indeed, concerned to keep NPPC and contributions down and, consistently with that, wanted to see what it regarded as more realistic assumptions and a less conservative investment strategy. This was an approach driven by commercial considerations and not, of itself, improper. I do not accept that this approach is to be categorised as a refusal, or even disinclination, to listen to the advice of the Scheme Actuary. Indeed, the advice of the Scheme Actuary was not only listened to but heard. What he said was not welcome. But there was nothing improper about IBM adopting the approach which it then did and to seek to persuade, provided it did so without improper pressure and without making misleading statements or providing false information, the Trustee to act in a particular way.</p>

There is nothing to suggest that Holdings (I shall come to CHQ later) had given any thought to what would happen if their aggressive investment strategy failed to deliver in the short term any more than Mr Lamb had done so. In any case, the Trustee was secured in relation to past service, even if the Plans were closed or wound-up, as a result of the guarantee. I accept, nonetheless, Mr Lamb's evidence about what the Trustee would have done if it had realised that the Plans might be closed if the anticipated returns did not transpire.

That letter was designed to inform the members about the Trustee's decision in relation to the proposals and why it had decided to support them. The fact that the Trustee supported the proposals would clearly have been a factor to be taken into account by the members in making their decisions and in their approach to the Plans for the future.

And suppose that the Webcast (as to which see paragraph 613 below) and Mr Lamb's letter had taken precisely the form which they did. Can it be said that the assurance is simply to be ignored because (i) the Trustee itself has no cause of action based on it and (ii) the members were not told about it, so that the assurance could not have engendered any reasonable expectations? The answer to that question is, in my judgement, a resounding "No". To fly in the face of an assurance of that sort is, in my judgement, relevant to the issue of breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in the same</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Expanding on what Mr Simmonds said about formulation of the proposals and the rejection of any suggestionthat the Plans should be closed, I note the following. Mr Waller presented the UK pension project team's proposals for changes to scheme design to Mr Hirst on or about 18 August 2004. Holdings' proposal was to increase employee contribution rates to the C Plan and I Plan and to reduce the accrual rate in the N Plan. The UK team dismissed the option of restricting pensionable earnings on the basis that it would not have a uniform effect on all members. Further, although it was actively considered, closing the plans to future accrual was not recommended by the team for a number of reasons. One reason, as Mr Simmonds himself acknowledged, was that such a course would be controversial amongst employees and detrimental to IBM from an employeerelations perspective.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Waller's paper expressly relied upon Watson Wyatt's note of 12 July 2004 to show that the cost of accrualhad increased. That paper calculated the increase in the costs of accrual explaining that the reasons for the increase included allowance for more members to retire early. Further, there is nothing to suggest that COLA increases had been treated any differently from the past in ascertaining the contribution rate. Accordingly, Mr Tennet argues that the proposal to increase employee contribution rates, namely because the costs of accrual had increased, implicitly assumed that IBM would maintain its COLA and early retirement terms and practice. That must be correct; and it is certainly the case that everyone was proceeding on the basis that the Plans would not close and would provide further benefit accrual at the current rates. But that cannot be taken as a commitment that things would not change.</p>

Towers Perrin, it must be emphasised, were retained by IBM; they were not advising the Trustee. Although they were asked to consider a whole range of redesign options, they were not instructed to provide advice "as if" they were the Scheme actuary. It had been Mr Glendinning's suggestion that they should provide "as if" advice, but Towers Perrin had said that this "would force them to be more conservative than is useful for our purpose", as Diane Gherson (Vice-President, Compensation and Benefits) told Mr MacDonald in an email dated 1 October 2004. Mr Tennet is right, I consider, to identify CHQ's aim as being to find a way to encourage Watson Wyatt and the Trustee to adopt a stance which was less conservative than the Scheme Actuary would ordinarily recommend.</p>

It would also, as Mr Tennet correctly noted, have a significant effect on company contributions by (i) encouraging the Trustee to adopt a more risky investment strategy and (ii) the removal of the margin for prudence in the assumptions used; but those two results came with an increased risk to IBM which carried the ultimate funding obligation (<span style="font-style:italic">via </span>IBM WTC), if matters did not turn out as hoped for.</p>

In its submissions to the Pensions Ombudsman, Holdings had rejected the proposition that there was any link between surplus and its policy in relation to pension increases, pointing out that benefit increases had been awarded in the past even when there was an actuarial deficit and arguing that the decision to meet DC contributions out of surplus did not reduce pension costs but dealt merely with the question of cash flow.</p>

In that respect, there can be no doubt that one element of the funding discussion related to the deficit in respect of past service.

He cannot, in my view, be read as speaking only of the contributions needed to fund the past service deficit or, in my view, of contributions to some hitherto unmentioned reduced accrual rate. I think Mr Hirst must have appreciated that that was the basis on which Mr Lamb was proceeding. Indeed, Holdings itself had no intention at that stage to reduce benefits, even if it had been discussed within CHQ as a possibility.</p>

That is consistent with the second paragraph just quoted from Mr Lamb's letter. In that paragraph, his reference to "ongoing contributions" must be read as contributions to reflect precisely the same obligation as the Â£289 million was required to meet: that is to say a contribution which included an amount in respect of the relevant year's future benefit accrual.</p>

Had Holdings been willing and able to pay, however, there would have been no need for a funding agreement with the Trustee. Nor would there have been any question of a <span style="text-decoration:underline">binding </span>commitment that future accrual would remain unchanged (although, of course, any changes to the Plans in the future would have to be effected within the constraints of the Trust Deed and Rules). Whatever may have been Mr Lamb's assumption, I do not consider that it was implicit in Mr Lamb's proposal that IBM would <span style="text-decoration:underline">guarantee </span>not seek to change the accrual rate in the future either at all or for some defined period. The proposal, insofar as it can be ascertained from the letter and the attachments (which I come to in a moment), was to replace one funding proposal (namely the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary) in relation to the deficit and an assumed future accrual rate with another funding proposal (namely that proposed by Mr Lamb as a satisfactory middle ground between the extremes of the Scheme Actuary's recommendation and CHQ's wishes). Each proposal was based on the same (assumed) future accrual rate. There is nothing in Mr Lamb's proposal to give rise to a commitment by IBM that the sort of changes for the future which could have been made had the Scheme Actuary's recommendations been adopted would not be made.</p>

In addition we know that should we be fortunate enough to end up over funded we can shift assets to bonds to reduce risk, something we should do over time anyway as the plan is very mature. My conclusion is to hold at the 200M mark. The UK can fund that level with some adjustments to its financial model, the total WW company is in outstanding financial shape with strong cash balance and strong cash flows expected going forward which put us in a good position to get some of these deficits behind us in an orderly manner.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">IBM's full package of proposals, including both the guarantee and the changes in respect of future accrual, wasset out in an attachment to a letter from Mr Hirst to Mr Lamb dated 15 October 2004, replying to the latter's letter of 4 October 2004. It is important to record what Mr Hirst did and did not say in that letter. First, he referred to the 4 October letter referring to Mr Lamb's indication that the Scheme Actuary would agree to recommend a contribution of Â£200m pa for the next three years if IBM Corporation was able to provide an acceptable commitment to support the plans. Mr Hirst then stated that there had been extensive consultation within IBM and was able to confirm that "we are willing to agree in principle to such an arrangement in a form which I believe should be acceptable to the Trustee and the Scheme Actuary". He attached a summary of the principles which would be passed to the lawyers to produce an agreed document for signature. What he did not do was go any further than that and in particular he did not say anything about the ongoing accrual rate in the Plans. It seems to me, therefore, that the position at that stage was that Mr Lamb and Mr Hirst had discussed certain proposals; that those proposals had been considered within IBM; and that the proposal on the table for acceptance by the Trustee ("â¦.should be acceptable to the Trustee and the Scheme Actuary") was that contained in the attachment. Mr Lamb could breathe a sigh of relief but he would not, in my view, have been entitled to perceive the arrangements as amounting to any sort of assurance about future benefit accrual other, perhaps, than an implicit assurance that IBM had no current plans to reduce benefits. Nonetheless, he continued to believe â and nothing was said by Mr Hirst or anyone else to disabuse him of the belief â that the basis of their earlier communications and the messages to be taken from them had not in any way altered.</p>

On the guarantee, the Scheme Actuary (who was present) explained its function and that it would allow him to remove the margin of prudence in the valuation assumptions. I interpose here to note that nothing can be inferred from the existence of the margin of prudence about future accrual. That margin was included at the rate actually adopted to reflect the assumed accrual rate. But if the accrual rate reduced or if the Plans were closed, that margin would be reduced (as an absolute number but remaining at the same percentage perhaps) or, on closure, cease to be payable. Accordingly, what the Scheme Actuary said about the margin is not relevant, in my view, to the issue of commitment to the Plans.</p>

Mr Greene added that "from the Corporation's point of view there was a desire to see improved investment returns and it was hoped that the Guarantee would enable the Trustee to achieve this through its bond strategy and long term approach to its equity strategy".

The stated aim, as recorded in the paper, was to strike a "fair balance between the rights and expectations of pension plan members and affordability on the part of the company." Mr Heath emphasised to the Trustee that employees were only "being asked to take a share of additional costs for future service and were not being asked to contribute towards either the deficit or their accrued rights." Mr Lamb explained "the increased contributions levels would have the effect of making it a safer environment for all members."</p>

Quite reasonably, members instead focused on the overall message, and did not pick through the language as if they were lawyers construing a commercial contract, looking for nuance and inconsistencies. Those are, in principle, perfectly fair submissions. I take account of the point in assessing what the reasonable member would take from the Webcast. I have read and re-read the transcript of the Webcast (it might be said that the re-reading is unfortunate for, in doing so, I have put myself in a very different position from the reasonable member) and been addressed about it. It might have been better if I had been asked to read and record my impressions before being treated to the detailed analysis. I have done my best to imagine what the hearer of the Webcast would have taken away from it and to take account of the fact that the impact of the written text, read and re-read and subjected to analysis, may be different. It is nonetheless inevitable that I must carry out just the sort of close textual analysis that Mr Tennet says is not the correct approach: I need to do so to deal with Mr Simmonds' submissions as well as to see whether Mr Tennet's case might succeed even on this close analysis.</p>

I think that all of the witnesses agreed with that, although they had an idea of what "sustainability" entailed somewhat different from Mr Simmonds' idea. It was, however, common ground that some sort of bargain was struck between Holdings and the members, using the word bargain in a very loose sense. Thus Holdings would take certain actions (increase its contributions, take responsibility for the past service deficit, provide a guarantee (<span style="font-style:italic">via </span>IBM WTC) under which it would take responsibility for contributions including deficit contributions until 2014); members would pay increased contributions (or, in the case of the N Plan, members could instead suffer a reduced accrual rate) and any change in the cost of future benefits would be shared equally between Holdings and the members (an aspect which became known as "the Evergreen Agreement").</p>

Secondly, I do not consider that Holdings is able to shelter behind the good faith of Mr Heath (and other UK executives) in the attribution of knowledge to Holdings: it may be that what CHQ knew is to be attributed to Holdings: see paragraphs 999<span style="font-style:italic">ff</span> below where I consider this point in the context of the Project Waltz changes.</p>

The word "sustainability" is being used here in a more specific or nuanced way than in Webcast [10]. The message it is conveying is that pension provision has become more expensive and that this has a key impact on the ability of employers and the State to continue to make provision at this level. It is not a statement which has anything to do with security for past service benefits. The main focus of this part of the Webcast is on future provision. That is made clear by Webcast [11] and [12] which demonstrate that Mr Heath is talking in this part of the Webcast (down to Webcast [34]) about provision in respect of future service. He is explaining how the Plans will continue in a way which is sustainable. For the C Plan and the I Plan, this would be achieved by increased member contributions. The N Plan would remain non-contributory, but the members' share of the cost would be reflected by a reduction in the future accrual rate. And, as Webcast [33] explains, a periodic review of member contributions would be carried out every three years, with an intention that any change in cost of future should be shared "as appropriate, <span style="font-weight:bold">up or down</span>, based on the results of future actuarial valuations".

It is true that it follows on immediately from the section of the Webcast dealing with past service, but earlier in the Webcast (see Webcast [17] and [18]) reference is made to a sharing of the increased cost (so that Holdings will bear a share) and to the fact that Holdings will continue to bear the lion's share of the contributions. That is the conclusion which I reached after having taken the opportunity to read, several times, the hard copy of the Webcast. It is also the impression which I think I would have taken from listening to the Webcast on a single or number of occasions (had it been possible to do so) without the benefit of a hard copy. My assessment is that the overwhelming overall impression is that the reasonable listener to the Webcast would understand that the guarantee would relate to all contributions payable by Holdings to the Plans. I reject Mr Simmonds' submission that the guarantee as described in the Webcast (in contrast with how it actually appeared in the Funding Agreement) was restricted to the same territory as the increased employer contributions referred to in Webcast [39] which is what I understand him to submit.</p>

To my mind, it is the natural reading, at least of the transcript of the Webcast, that the guarantee would relate to all contributions falling due during the course of the guarantee (until 2014 by which time Holdings hoped the deficit would have been eliminated). But it does not necessarily follow that any particular level of further benefit accrual (or any accrual at all) is guaranteed: all that is guaranteed is the payment of such contributions as actually fall due in accordance with whatever accrual rate is in force from time to time. I agree with Mr Simmonds that there was no <span style="text-decoration:underline">guarantee</span> of any particular rate of future accrual. However, the RBs do not assert, as I have said, that the Webcast amounted to a promise or legally binding guarantee. Their case, rather, is that a departure from the "commitment" displayed by the Webcast resulted, in all the circumstances, in a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty which is something very different.</p>

These alternatives were not adopted because, at least in Mr Heath's view, the proposals actually put forward represented the right initiatives which "balance the need to ask you to take a share of increased future costs with long term security". The balance he is identifying in that statement is, it seems to me, the balance in what it is that the members and Holdings each bring to the overall package: members pay increased contributions (or in the N Plan receive less benefits) whilst Holdings makes its cash injection and procures the guarantee (thus increasing the security of benefit).</p>

But that, in my view, is to diminish inappropriately the message which was also being conveyed in relation to future service by those same paragraphs. Thus Webcast [48] refers to "the changes we are proposing to make" which can only be a reference to increased contributions in the C and I Plans and the reduced accrual rate in the N Plan. And the "commitment" in Webcast [49] is a commitment to sustainability which must include looking at the Plans as ongoing Plans. The natural assumption would be that the Plans would continue to provide further benefits: Holdings could not have intended, and a reasonable member would certainly not have understood, the Webcast to be contemplating sustainability as drawing a distinction simply between an unsustainable scheme (which would have to be put into winding-up) and a sustainable scheme (which could continue as a closed scheme with no further accrual). Such a sophisticated distinction is not one which I would expect the reasonable member â even as rational and intelligent as the Holdings workforce â not skilled in arcane matters of pensions law and practice to understand from listening to the Webcast.</p>

So, he says, a commitment to fund did not necessarily presuppose any particular level of benefits for future service. It is, however, clear that the proposals were proceeding on the basis that the Plans would continue unaltered: or to put it simply another way (as is Holdings' own case) no further changes to the Plans were being considered by Holdings. This is the only conclusion consistent with the basis on which the Trustee agreed to the proposals and with Mr Heath's own observation that he was not expecting "a further change 2 years down the line". I regard that (inevitable) conclusion as consistent only with the further conclusion that Holdings hoped that there would be no further changes in the foreseeable future. I accordingly reject the suggestion identified at the beginning of this paragraph.</p>

The understandable expectation, he says, was that if contributions in respect of future accrual to 2014 were guaranteed, there would be no reason to stop accrual. He suggests (although I do not know the evidential basis for this, but shall assume for the moment that it is correct) that many (although not all) members did not differentiate between different IBM entities and assumed that IBM as a global business would stand and fall together. Many never expected that Holdings would ever be permitted by CHQ to become insolvent. The value of a funding guarantee would not necessarily have been apparent to them. It was therefore perfectly reasonable for members to think that the guarantee did something beyond merely providing security for Holdings existing funding obligations in the event that it was unable to pay.</p>

First, I do not agree that the reasonable member would have consideredthat there would be no reason to stop accrual if the guarantee was in place. The reasonable member may not be an expert in the law of guarantees, but he might well have known â I have not been addressed with argument either way on this point â that a principal debtor will usually remain responsible for indemnifying his guarantor; thus Holdings would end up with an inter-company obligation if IBM WTC were called on under its guarantee. Even Mr Tennet does not appear to suggest that the reasonable member (in contrast with many although not all members) saw IBM globally as a business which would stand or fall together. It is hard to think that that was the view of UK management who were acutely aware of the internal competition for investment from Armonk. And even if it was reasonable for some members to think that the guarantee did more than simply guarantee Holdings' contribution obligation, Mr Tennet's argument does not establish that the reasonable member would have thought this way. Nor does the argument lead to the conclusion that the "something beyond" went all the way to an expectation that the Plans would remain open until 2014.</p>

The second implication is that, in making these assurances as to sustainability and statements of commitment, Holdings implied that it had reasonable grounds to believe that the assurances were true.</p>

A Reasonable Expectation, as I have coined that expression for the purposes of this judgment, is an expectation as to future conduct. An expectation that someone is telling the truth is of a different type. An incorrect statement may give rise to a remedy, for instance based on misrepresentation or estoppel, but that is because it is incorrect and was acted upon, not because the recipient believed it was true. An incorrect statement, for instance one made dishonestly or recklessly, may give rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty but that is not because it gives rise to a Reasonable Expectation.</p>

If, as I consider it does, sustainability refers to sustainability of the Plans in their current form, the Webcast cannot reasonably be read as looking further ahead than, at longest, the period to 2014. There is some merit in taking that period because, according to the Webcast, it was anticipated that the deficit would, at the contribution rates then proposed, be eliminated by 2014 which would suggest that Holdings at least had some material to suggest that the Plans would remain viable with their current structure until then.</p>

At most, in my view, a member would be able to take away from the Webcast the message that Holdings considered that continued accrual at the current rate would be affordable by Holdings in accordance with current cost projections and in the light of its own current financial circumstances. I use the word affordable rather than sustainable deliberately. From Holdings' perspective, once the members' contributions were increased, there would be no difference between sustainability and affordability by Holdings of its obligations.</p>

One of his submissions is that the members were entitled to think that IBM had taken reasonable steps to understand the present circumstances of the UK DB Plans and what might happen in the future and had reasonably assessed the possibility, and possible consequences, of unfavourable market performance in the future: see paragraphs 661<span style="font-style:italic">ff </span>below. The reasonable steps, assuming the submission to be correct, are essentially obtaining financial information and advice and turning those into projections. There is a limit about the distance into the future for which it is reasonable to expect projections to be made.

I might add, in this context by way of aside, that, even if the subjective understanding of the members were relevant, I would attach no weight in this context to the evidence about the palpable relief felt by members when the Webcast was released as support for the Reasonable Expectations asserted. The relief manifested was that the Plans were not to be wound up: there had been rumour that this was to happen. The Webcast demonstrated â perfectly accurately as it turned out â that the Plans were not being wound up and that a solution to the problem (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>of immediate wind-up) had been avoided.

The RBs' written closing does not, however, include the next part of his answer: "In the circumstances at the time". That is an important part of the answer: it makes clear that Mr Heath saw the proposals as providing the necessary stability in the circumstances at the time. Significant changes in financial and economic conditions would not, therefore, preclude a subsequent change in the terms of the Plans. It is also important to note that the part of his answer which was quoted did not suggest that Holdings was making a statement about absolute sustainability.

I understand this to mean that even if markets moved adversely, the reasonable member could expect that benefits would remain unchanged so that pension practice would continue and the DB Plans would remain open to future accrual at the current rate.</p>

In fact, even Mr Tennet accepts that a really serious, unexpected and unpredictable change in financial and economic circumstances which put the very existence of Holdings at risk might justify changes to the DB Plans even in the short term. But suppose that the Trustee had been allowed to continue with its planned shift to bonds. The funds would still have remained invested significantly in equities and other return-seeking assets. I do not consider that the reasonable member could understand the statements in the Webcast about sustainability and commitment as creating an expectation that, even if the value of the funds fell significantly, the DB Plans would continue unchanged whether in relation to future service benefits or in relation to pension practice.</p>

The resulting investment spread, although different from that which the Trustee would otherwise have adopted, was within the range of reasonable and responsible investments given the existence of the guarantee (and perhaps even without it). There is no justifiable criticism of the Trustee for having adopted the policy which it did given the existence of the guarantee.</p>

For instance, the members would justifiably be shocked if, the day after the Ocean changes had been implemented, Holdings had announced that it was reviewing the level of future benefit accrual and its early retirement policy. They would be justified in feeling shocked because the Webcast certainly gives the impression that there is a problem to be addressed and that the initiatives which it explains provide at least some fix to that problem. If Holdings had embarked on a review of DB Pension provision very soon after the implementation of the Ocean changes, this would require an explanation, otherwise its good faith in presenting the changes may be brought into question. It is not as though the Webcast had said: here is a problem which requires immediate treatment; here is an immediate fix to that problem; but it cannot be seen as a final solution and we will be embarking on a review of the DB Plans in the near future. Quite the reverse: it stated that the DB Plans were sustainable and that Holdings was committed to underpinning their security.</p>

The latter element was assessed on the basis of the current benefit structure. In my judgement, the reasonable member would understand that this annual contribution would be made for 3 years (see Webcast [39]) and that the DB Plans would therefore remain open for at least that period.</p>

However, I disagree with the submission insofar as it relates to a period beyond which reasonable projections could be made, for reasons already given. Further, the assurances and expressions of commitment are not worthless even if Holdings could, other than in the short term, change its mind and act contrary to them. As well as the factors identified at paragraph 671 above, there are these additional factors. First, they gave the members comfort that the DB Plans were not about to be wound up or closed to further accrual. Secondly, they could be taken as an indication that there were no current plans (or even discussions on foot) to take such action. That would be so, it seems to me, even if Mr Heath had added, at the end of the Webcast, that although Holdings had no current intention to close the DB Plans or make any changes to accrual or pension practice, it reserved its right to do so: the addition of those words would not bring about an internal inconsistency.</p>

In contrast, there was to be an immediate increase in contributions to reflect increased costs due to factors such as increased longevity and any further increase in the costs of future service would be shared. It is not possible, subject to one qualification, to quarrel with either of those propositions. The acceptance of responsibility for past service benefits can be seen in Webcast [12], [18], [34]; and this is emphasised by the action Holdings was taking to deal with the deficit as set out in Webcast [39] (the Â£200m pa cash injection), [40] (later cash contributions to be based on subsequent valuations), and [42] (the guarantee until 2014).</p>

On that approach, there is nothing in the argument that responsibility for the past included a commitment to future accrual on the basis that that is how the final salary link would be preserved.

But what is clear, I think, is that even in 2004 there was a widely-held perception on the part of members that they would be able to retire before NRD if they wished to do so and that in practice, even if consent was formally required, it would ordinarily not be refused; that was a perception engendered by Holdings which knew that the perception was widely held. It was a Reasonable Expectation. Action by Holdings contrary to that Reasonable Expectation is at least capable of engaging the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. The Expectation was, however, the result of a policy and a practice. Policy and practice can obviously be changed for the future in respect of future service. Whether it can be changed in respect of past service is a different question. I do not think that it could be said that the expectation in respect of past service can never be changed without a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. For instance, it would be surprising if Holdings was unable to revise its policy and practice on early retirement in relation to a 35-year-old man with 4 years' pensionable service in the DB Plans. In contrast, it could well give rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty to change the practice with only a month's warning in relation to a 58-yearold man with 20 years' pensionable service in the DB Plans. <span style="font-weight:bold">Communication with members (continued)</span></p>

What can and cannot be done is laid down by the Plans' amendment powers under which accrued rights are protected to the extent set out in the fetters which I have discussed in relation to Issues 1 to 3. So far as the final salary link is concerned, nothing now turns on that in the light of my decision on Issues 1 and 2 (although an issue remains, in the context of Project Waltz, about the validity of the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements).</p>

A reasonable member hearing the Webcast would, I have no doubt, see confirmation and reinforcement of that Reasonable Expectation. In particular, although he may have appreciated before the Webcast that policy and practice might change, he would, in my judgement, take from the Webcast the message that the deficit attributable to all the benefits (in respect of past service) provided by the DB Plans <span style="text-decoration:underline">including those arising under the early retirement policy and practice</span> was guaranteed up to the first quarter of 2014.

I do not need to decide whether that is so since the Plans have not been put into winding-up.</p>

The members' report tells the reader nothing relevant to the proposed changes; quite clearly, the Webcast and other communications supersede anything said in that report. The explanatory material does refer to Holdings' power to amend the Trust Deed and Rules, but the hearer of the Webcast was not reminded of that and is entitled to take the message about the future of the DB Plans from the Webcast. In any case, so far as early retirement policy and practice is concerned, Holdings must, in relying on the reference to the Trust Deed and Rules, take the rough with the smooth; if a change to policy and practice is to be seen as an amendment within the scope of the reservation in the explanatory material, it should be seen as subject to the same fetters as an actual amendment, in which case the practice and policy could not be changed <span style="text-decoration:underline">even in the face of</span> a significant change of financial and economic circumstances.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">A separate, but related issue is this. Mr Tennet submits that Holdings' acceptance of responsibility for any deficitalso necessarily meant that the reasonable member could expect that Holdings was doing more than taking responsibility for the funding of any deficit: it was also taking responsibility for any increase in the accounting cost of the UK DB Plans (<span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> NPPC) consequent on an increase in the deficit (to the extent that they even contemplated the possibility of a difference between the two). Accounting and funding were in effect two sides of the same coin; it would be artificial to suggest that Holdings accepted responsibility for funding, but not for the effects of the DB Plans on its I&amp;E account. I do not agree with that submission. The Webcast said nothing about accounting aspects or the consequences of a continuing, perhaps increasing, deficit. Everything in the Webcast was, as I read the transcript, directed at English concepts and consequences. In my view, NPPC does not come into the picture in relation to expectations at all. Rather, it comes into play as one factor in the assessment of whether a change in benefits (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>the change in pension policy and practice) gives rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. The issue may turn on whether producing a particular NPPC result is a justification for the change. Applying the test which I have identified, the question is whether achieving that result by making the relevant change is something which no reasonable employer would do.</p>

I need now to carry out a reality check by standing back to consider the Webcast as a whole through the ears of the reasonable member hearing it on one or two occasions. The conclusions which I reach are, inevitably, impressionistic. But my conclusion is the same as that which I have already reached. I can assure the parties that this is not a "he would say that wouldn't he" assessment. I have given this the most anxious consideration. My assessment is that the central message in relation to past service is that nothing is changing <span style="text-decoration:underline">or will change</span> without justification at least prior to 2014: I do not need to say anything about changes after that. The central message in relation to future service is that benefits will continue to accrue. But the reasonable member could not properly hear a message that Holdings had committed itself (albeit in a way not amounting to a legal promise) to future accrual until 2014 although I consider that the reasonable member, reflecting on what he had heard, would be justified in reaching the conclusion that benefits would continue to accrue for at least 3 years. I do not propose to say where the cut-off date for the continuing commitment is, at least at this stage.</p>

His expectation would be qualified by an acceptance that such changes in financial and economic circumstances could justify a change. Whether one categorises that situation as one where the extent of the Reasonable Expectation is circumscribed by the qualification or as one where a disappointment of that Expectation has no consequence does not matter much, if at all.</p>

In my judgement, the reasonable reader of Mr Lamb's letter would not have taken the guarantee as relating to anything other than funding. Whether IBM's later invocation of the guarantee as being part of what made the Plans sustainable is another matter.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The RBs, however, say that it was fanciful to think that IBM Corporation would allow Holdings to enter into aninsolvency process and that in practice Holdings would meet its contribution liability. There was no need, therefore, for a purely financial guarantee, so that the guarantee must have carried with it an implication that there would be future accrual at the current rate. One difficulty with that argument is that the major financial problem with the Plans related to the past service deficit. If, as is the RBs' case, Holdings would not have been allowed to default then the past service hole would have been plugged without a guarantee. Why then, I ask, would not exactly the same occur if Holdings had agreed to commit itself to future accrual without a guarantee? Surely, in practice, IBM Corporation would be expected to stand behind Holdings as much in the latter situation as in the former. The reality, it seems to me, is that the guarantee was put in place because this was a requirement of the Scheme Actuary if he was to advise the Trustee to agree to IBM's proposed contribution rate. The guarantee gave legal effect to what the RBs say would have happened in any case. But it was a real benefit to them, as Mr Lamb communicated. And he was able to communicate that message because he knew that the guarantee was essential to IBM's funding commitment and that without the guarantee, there was a fear that IBM would take unpalatable action, even closing the scheme altogether or placing it into winding-up. In other words, the real benefit was precisely to ensure that the Plans <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> continue albeit without a commitment that they would do so for any particular period.</p>

The first and second reasons given were (i) returns on plan assets were lower than assumed; and (ii) the assumptions about future investment returns in the 2003 valuation were overall lower than assumed in the 2000 valuation. The third reason was the assumption made for life expectancy which had "a significant effect" on the financial position of the Plans. Mr Tennet relies on the first two reasons and submits that, since those were the present causes of the deficit, members could expect that if further asset falls or changes in asset assumptions increased the past service deficit in future, IBM would continue to meet its responsibilities for any such increase in the deficit.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Tennet relies on the statement in section 11.1 set out above. He acknowledges that to a pensions lawyer, thatexplanation indicates that the guarantee was merely a funding guarantee. However, he says, it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that, as "future funding payments" covered funding for any future accrual, such future accrual would in fact occur. Again, this is a point made in relation to the Webcast and I have, again, already dealt with it. Taking section 11.1 in isolation, I would reject Mr Tennet's submission for the same reason as I have rejected it in relation to the Webcast and Mr Lamb's letter. But the point is now made in a different context, a context where the very same document contains the explanation in sections 11.2 and 11.4 stating clearly that the contribution promised by Holdings, and guaranteed by IBM WTC, includes the cost of future service benefits. In context, there can be no doubt that the future service benefits are those accruing under the then current provisions of the Plans.</p>

It is not open, in my view, for IBM to take any point that members would read and rely on the Webcast and Mr Lamb's letter, but pay scant attention to the Q&amp;As; indeed, that is not Mr Simmonds' submission.</p>

They can take advantage of theQ&amp;As in their favour but they are also to be taken as having a general understanding of the Q&amp;As and in particular of the explanation of the guarantee. I do not detect in the Q&amp;As any support for the view that there is an assurance or commitment of any sort concerning benefit accrual after 2007. It might be said that the fact that the Q&amp;As clearly contemplate further accrual up to 2007 is an indicator that nothing is to change thereafter. If it said that accrual is assured after 2007, the immediate question is, for how long? There is no reason to select 2014. 2014 is relevant to the period of the guarantee but not to the period of a commitment to further accrual on the basis that nothing is to change. The logic of the argument is that accrual is to continue unchanged indefinitely absent a serious change of circumstances: but that is a conclusion which cannot be right. In any case, the contrary argument is that a clear commitment to continued accrual until 2007 is an indication of precisely the opposite result: an express â or at least necessarily implicit â conclusion that accrual is to continue through to 2007 can be said to be an indication that, after that time, there is to be no commitment and that there is certainly no guarantee or assurance.</p>

This goes further than my conclusion in relation to the Webcast. Even in relation to that, my inclination was to say that the reasonable member would have not seen a commitment to continue accrual after 2007, although he/she (and indeed Holdings) might have hoped that it would. If it did then the Evergreen Agreement would take effect. But I do not see the Evergreen Agreement as inconsistent with termination of future accrual. That inclination is confirmed by Mr Lamb's letter and the Q&amp;A's which make no reference to the Evergreen Agreement.</p>

The reasonable member's expectation from the Webcast and reading Mr Heath's letter cannot, therefore, have been seen as influenced by the Trustee's assumption.

Subject to that amendment, IBM decided that it wished to proceed with the proposals. They were approved by the Trustee at the TMM held on 9 December 2004 just referred to and were implemented with effect from 6 April 2005.

But they were not entitled on the basis of what they had been told to conclude that the issue would not be revisited. They were not entitled to think that the Plans would remain open for the long term and not even, in my view, in the medium term. members may well have hoped that what they were told would turn out to be a longterm solution and that the Plans would remain open for the foreseeable future. And they may well have felt disappointed (many certainly were) and even angry when the Project Waltz proposals were presented. They may well have felt equally disappointed and angry if the Ocean proposals had never seen the light of day and Project Waltz had been the first change. The issue is not whether they were disappointed and angry; nor, indeed, is it whether they believed, rather than merely hoped, that the Plans would remain open, although that is a prerequisite to their claim.

That paper identified the "overwhelming amount of risk" as originating from the equity holdings so that changes made within the bond portfolio would have a minimal impact on risk. But since a switch to bonds was anticipated (albeit at a slower pace than contemplated before the adoption of the Ocean proposals) the issue of how the bonds were structured would become more significant. The paper reminded the Trustee that the "Duration of the bond portfolio is, generally speaking, just as important a source of risk, ie a mismatch to the characteristics of the liabilities, as the proportion of inflation sensitive bonds held."</p>

Watson Wyatt advised that the "duration of the bond assets in the Fundâ¦is significantly lower than the duration of the liabilities". The duration of the total bond portfolio was about 8 years, whereas the duration of the liabilities was around 16 years: if interest rates were to fall by 1%, the Plans' liabilities would increase by around 16%, whereas the value of the bonds (which were under 30% of the total assets) would rise only by around 8%. In other words, there was not a matching of assets and liabilities. CHQ were, I have no doubt, aware of this issue. Watson Wyatt also advised that a significant proportion of the liabilities were inflation linked, meaning that, since much of the income from the bond portfolio was fixed, the Plans were exposed not only to interest rate changes (via the mismatch in duration), but also to inflation rate changes.</p>

And, as Mr Martin Jack (Director, IBM Retirement Funds, EMEA) told the Trustee at the 20 October 2005 meeting: "the purpose of the GBF is not intended to match liabilities but is to maximize alpha." As Mr Tennet correctly observes: "In other words, IBM did not view the GBF as designed to match the Plans' liabilities, but instead it viewed it as an opportunity to seek outperformance".</p>

According to Mr Tennet, it is plain from that that the Trustee's approach was entirely founded upon its assumption that if the risk did not pay off IBM would not withdraw its support of the DB Plans by ceasing future accrual. That goes too far: I agree with what he says but only with the omission of the words "by ceasing future accrual". The benefit of the guarantee was not dependent in any way upon future benefit accrual. It was not even dependent on the Plans staying out of wind-up and continuing as closed schemes since the Funding Agreement provided protection in that event.</p>

The presentation included a slide entitled "2006 Retirement Related Expenses Risk/Roadmap". The presentation gave a worldwide forecast of NPPC costs for the non-US DB plans; these costs were projected to increase/decrease from $252m in 2004 and $793m in 2005 to $1,044m, $1,121m and $954m in the years 2006 to 2008 respectively. One slide showed that the NPPC increase was worldwide and not unique to the UK. After 2007, the cumulative loss is shown as decreasing. It would appear that the effects of the 2002-02 world financial problems would have worked their way through the NPPC figure. The increases in NPPC had been described in internal CHQ material as the "perfect storm" in the sense that it was the result of the combination of market falls (reducing ROA) and falls in bond yields (reducing the discount rate). As Mr Tennet points out, this did highlight the mismatch of investments with the way that liabilities were valued for the purposes of US GAAP.</p>

The aim was stated as simply being "to reduce 2006 expense"; reference to volatility had disappeared. Perhaps Mr Koppl did not know what had been said to employees in the UK.

But Mr Stark had a different takeon Mr Wilson's email in his response to Ms Salinaro on 17 September 2005: "You were right when you said that setting a # could distract focusâ¦ we have a unique opportunity now to address the costs of pensions â both the level and the volatility â to solve this for the long term once and for allâ¦..". Further, at this time, there was a communication, for the first time to anyone in the UK, that the Soto target was not simply the year-on-year increase for 2006 but a different objective, the long-term overall cost of the Plan: see Mr DeAngelo's email to Mr Wilson on 19 September 2005.</p>

The slides also state that a communication plan to members would be developed. It would convey a key message that the changes would "Allow continued necessary investment in other compensation programs, salary, variable pay". One might think that the message here was to be that changes to the Plans would be followed by more money being made available for pay increases, something which did not happen.</p>

CHQ therefore wanted to keep control of the Project Soto Pension Briefing presentation: as Ms Salinaro put it, it was better if CHQ were controlling the document so that it could be directed appropriately. By 25 September 2005, Mr Greene and Ms Salinaro were discussing whether to express their "concerns about UK management" to other managers. There was frustration on the part of Ms Salinaro, expressed in her email to Mr MacDonald dated 28 September 2005, that "the UK team does not seem to feel the same sense of urgency" [the comparator country has been redacted from the trial bundle] and in her email of the same date to Mr Burkhardt where she complained that:</p>

It also recommended that further work be done on COLA: the UK management's then recommendation was to restrict such adjustments in respect of pre-April 1997 service to 50% of UK RPI (subject to a cap of 5%). In an email dated 7 October 2005 following that meeting to Mr Castellanos, VP CHQ HR, concerned in large part with the time by which the proposed changes could be implemented, Mr Heath again explained the difficulties that the Ocean changes had created, but that he thought the UK's proposal was achievable:</p>

Accordingly, the UK management was asked to continue its work in order to identify other options that would save $92m, to consider alternatives that would reduce longand short-term cost and volatility, and to consider an acceleration of the timetable for implementation. The RBs' written opening submissions contend that the effect of such changes would have been to reduce NPPC by $100m for a full year, and up to $88.5m for 2006, depending on when the changes were implemented, and thus it would have been enough to meet IBM's $92m requirement.</p>

The type of volatility being mentioned here was volatility which has an impact of IBM's P&amp;L account, that is to say NPPC volatility. It is also recognition that such volatility was related to the past. Mr Koppl agreed with that, adding that the service cost only added about 1% each year to the liabilities. His evidence was that NPPC volatility was the result of the large size of the pension funds and the large amount of the PBO. And yet we have Mr Heath saying that the proposals following on from the first review session were seen as reducing volatility and thus meeting one of CHQ's objectives. I am sure that he genuinely did perceive the proposals as having that result, but perhaps he was focusing less on past service benefits and more on reducing any further volatility arising from yet more defined benefits accruing in the future.</p>

More significantly, Mr Greene suggested that the proposals were being put forward because the fundamental problem was not an accounting one but was related to other factors such as longevity: but, as Mr Lamb pointed out, longevity had been addressed under the Ocean proposals by increased contribution rates and the sharing of future increased costs 50/50 between IBM and members. Mr Greene also argued that there had been a cost which had been built up over time, but here Mr Lamb pointed out that Ocean had been explicit about IBM's commitment to take responsibility for the past service deficit. I agree with Mr Lamb's ripostes. I also agree to this extent with Mr Tennet when he says that CHQ was attempting to resile from statements made just one year before: the purported justification given by Mr Greene was no justification (if one were needed) at all.</p>

What is more contentious about what Mr MacDonald is alleged to have said relates to his use of the phrase "push back" and references to "sustainable". In a later email to Mr Heath, Mr Lamb described Mr MacDonald as telling him, at the Marriott Hotel meeting, that "he had no plans for change and would push back on anyone who wanted to revisit this topic during his watch".</p>

I do not need to decide what it was that Mr MacDonald actually meant at the time. What is clear, as I have said, is that the impression which he gave and which the other people at the meeting were entitled to gain was that Mr MacDonald would resist any future changes which were inconsistent with his understanding of sustainability. Mr Lamb and the others present were entitled to understand Mr MacDonald as giving an assurance â not a guarantee â that the Plans would remain open in the current form for longer than merely in the short term.

It is intended to reflect the test which I have explained in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. A minor change in the business environment could not be relied on as justification for a change to the pension provision in the short or even medium term.

The RBs contend that the Soto changes, like the Ocean changes, were approved by the Trustee on the basis that the Plans would have a sustainable long-term future: Mr Simmonds' response to that is that was indeed the expectation of IBM's management at the time. One must be careful about that response. It was, I accept, the expectation of UK management that the Plans would have a sustainable long-term future and that there was no hidden agenda to make further changes in the foreseeable future. But whether that was CHQ's perspective is a different question. It is difficult to believe that Mr Koppl or Ms Salinaro, for instance, thought that the DB Plans had a long-term future.

MrMacDonald's response to Mr Heath, Mr Wilson, Mr Hirst, and copying in Sam Palmisano, was "you did a terrific job. We teamed well too. The three of you made a huge difference to IBM UK and IBM too. It was a <span style="font-weight:bold">total</span> pleasure working with you and your leadership was quite evident every moment." CHQ, at least, was apparently very pleased with the outcome.</p>

A number of factors would, IBMbelieved, "mitigate the current volatility" (namely transfers to the DC plans, a one-off cash injection further securing the Plans and a reduced, but guaranteed COLA commitment). The proposals formed part of a broader set of changes "developed by IBM Corporation to address pension costs and volatility across a number of countries". There one sees confirmation, again if it were needed, that it was CHQ which was driving the reforms and which was giving assurances. The proposals were seen by IBM as having an enduring effect:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Simmonds has a different take on this exchange. He submits that what Mr Hirst actually made clear was thatIBM was not precluding itself from making further changes <span style="text-decoration:underline">even as early as the next year</span>; after all, his statement that there was no guarantee was in response to a question about the need to "return to this next year". He goes further, saying this: not only does this mean that it did not preclude itself at the time of Project Soto from announcing the Project Waltz changes in 2009 but also it indicates that IBM did not consider itself to have precluded itself from making such changes at the time of Project Ocean. And he points out that there is nothing in the minutes to indicate that anyone raised the suggestion that IBM was in 2006 precluded from doing what it then proposed to do by reason of anything it had said or done in 2004 or 2005. In particular, nobody is recorded as relying on the guarantee (and what the members had been told about it) as an objection to the proposed Soto changes. Mr Simmonds goes as far as to submit that the very fact that the question was asked suggests that the questioner, for her part, did not consider that the Project Ocean precluded the proposals or further changes in the future.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Hirst's answer was, of course, given in the context of the presentation as a whole, where it is interesting, Ithink, to note the use of the words "sustainable" and "volatility". In the context of this presentation and meeting, "sustainability" can surely only mean an ongoing scheme for future service; and that one problem in relation to sustainability, namely "volatility" had, been addressed (in spite of what Mr MacDonald says about what <span style="text-decoration:underline">he </span>thought the proposals were about). In saying that, I do not suggest that Mr Hirst's caveat about nothing being guaranteed has no content: a significant change in the financial and trading environment might lead to further changes having to be made.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Although Mr Hirst was making absolutely clear that IBM was not giving a guarantee, there was, to my mind, aclear representation about IBM's belief, namely that the Plans were thought to be sustainable and that volatility had been addressed. There was, at least, an implied representation that IBM considered that the Plans would not represent an unacceptable drain on IBM's resources in cash terms or give rise to unacceptable consequences for accountancy purposes. The message, it seems to me, is "We can afford to keep these Plans going" but no guarantee could be given because in reality all sorts of things might change. It was also implicit in the message that IBM was not, at the time, considering yet further changes in the future.</p>

I need you guys to help me explain why that perception and what we are doing is still in place that we had a deal. The increased costs going forward as opposed to historic costs were what we asked for a contribution for. That's what we asked for - of an increase to six to eight. And in return the IBM company over a nine year period would fill the hole that currently sits in the pension plan. That bargain is still in place and I'm going to pause on that point because David is going to talk about it when he speaks towards the end of his presentation and I'm going to come back- you can ask any questions that you like.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.88in;margin-right:0.39in">"And the final element â component â within the proposals is to address funding. The company has agreed to fully fund â fully fund â the current deficit and to inject cash to the tune of close to $1 billion into the UK pension plans by the 31st March 2006. That in and of itself gives us a much greater stability, fully funds the plan and it enables us to move forward with much greater confidence.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.88in;margin-right:0.41in">The next question that might be asked is okay well so the company is going to do this; but wasn't one of the criteria in terms of setting up the guarantee over 9 years last year that we were in deficit and if the company ever did balance the plan that the company could then pull out of that guarantee? Yes it was but what we have negotiated with the company is to maintain the World Trade Guarantee for the period through to 2014. I am just going to go into what we agreed last year because I think it is important, as Larry said.</p>
	  </content>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.88in;margin-right:0.42in">So the corporation will maintain the guarantee that was put in place last year through to 2014, irrespective of the funding status of the plan. Employee contributions will remain unchanged. We are not planning any changes in employee contributions as part of this package. However we did say as part of the package that we put last year, that every 3 years, the triennial valuation of the plan, we would look again at the cost of future service benefits and we would then look to increase or decrease employee and employer contributions on the basis of a 50-50 sharing dependent upon whether that was increased, whether future service costs continue to increase or whether there is a change of future service costs decreases. We are hoping that the package and measures we have put in place puts us on a better footing in relation to the triennial valuation but that's not due for another, I guess, another year or so yet. But that deal that we did last year, the agreement we put in place last year remains intact; no change, World Trade Corporation guarantee in place, and will remain in place supporting the UK company until 2014."</p>

I do not agree that it necessarily follows in the sense that a change would be inconsistent with the statement.

The first, found at the beginning of thequotation above, was "increase your contributions" and then IBM "will guarantee the pension fund". The second was that the bargain involved merely an increase in contribution from members in exchange for IBM agreeing to fund the deficit over a 9-year period: it was in relation to that that he said the "bargain is still in place" or "is still on the table". Mr Heath referred principally to the funding guarantee, although what he said about review of contributions on each triennial review only makes sense on the hypothesis that benefit accrual is still taking place.</p>

Mr Wilson told the gathering that "we constructed this package very carefully to be quite robust in terms of the financial dynamics and quite neutral to the number of people that actually transferâ¦so that we wouldn't be overly concerned about having to hit a particular number or not". From that answer, Mr Tennet submits that the listener could reasonably expect that IBM was content to allow DB members to continue with DB accrual on the post-Soto modified basis. That is almost certainly true. But it does not answer the question about how long a member could expect accrual to continue on that basis or in what circumstances it would be proper for IBM to change the accrual rate or even close the DB Plans to further accrual altogether.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Simmonds has a different take on this presentation. He recognizes that Mr Hirst addressed the perceptionwhich might have been held by some people that IBM was about to break the "bargain" or "deal" that had been reached in 2004. But he says it is clear, and I agree, that Mr Hirst was saying that the perception which he had identified was wrong and that he was suggesting that the bargain had not been broken. Mr Simmonds goes further and submits that it was clear from Mr Hirst's description of the bargain that it consisted, on IBM's part, of a commitment to eliminate the Plans' funding deficits â or, as Mr Hirst put it, to "fill the hole". Regardless of what impression members of the audience might previously have had, Mr Hirst explained that the statement (in the first paragraph quoted above) that "for nine years the IBM Company will guarantee the pension fund" meant (as is made clear in the second paragraph) that the IBM Company over a nine-year period would fill the hole that currently sits in the pension plan. Nothing in Mr Hirst's comments says anything about a commitment to maintain benefit levels until 2014. In this regard, Mr Hirst's comments must have served to clarify in the minds of the audience the true nature of the guarantee and disabused them of the impression (if they had held such an impression) that the maintenance of future benefit levels formed part of the Project Ocean bargain.</p>

His description of the guarantee â and, in particular, his observation that people might ask: "but wasn't one of the criteria in terms of setting up the guarantee over 9 years last year that we were in deficit and if the company ever did balance the plan that the company could then pull out of that guarantee?" â indicates that he considered that his audience would have understood a provision for early termination to have been one of the terms of the guarantee, showing that they would have had a fairly detailed understanding of the nature of the guarantee. It is said, in any event, that after listening to the passages of Mr Heath's presentation which I have set out, nobody in the audience could have been under any misconception as to the nature of the guarantee, <span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> that it was a funding guarantee and moreover that it did not amount to a commitment to maintain future benefit levels through to 2014.</p>

Further, the reasonable employee hearing Mr Heath's presentation would, in my view, have understood the relevant line of the slide ("Meets employees objectives of protecting the pension fund and offers a choice for those impacted") as referring to protection of accrued benefits. However, I do not see where that gets IBM's case. The slide as a whole is clearly referring to much more than the employees' objective referred to. It is referring to a balanced package which also addressed IBM's long-term cost and volatility objective and met the Trustee's long term stability and funding objectives. And Mr Heath's presentation did the same. It is not right to say that, because the relevant line refers to accrued benefits, the slide as a whole, understood in accordance with the oral presentation, was saying nothing about the future.</p>

But it was the role of managers (as acknowledged by Mr Johnson, a manager who did attend the presentation) to pass on faithfully the information that they had received at this briefing to their employees. Mr Simmonds says that it is to be expected that, when explaining the proposals to the workforce at large, the attendees at the all-managers meetings would have done so on the basis of an accurate understanding as to the nature and effect of the guarantee and, in particular, would have said nothing to suggest that the guarantee amounted to a commitment to maintain the existing benefit structure until 2014. I consider that that is putting matters too high. What managers ought to have explained to the workforce was precisely that which had been presented to them at the presentations. To the extent that there was ambiguity in what was presented, managers could not be blamed if they then failed to convey the message which Mr Simmonds now submits they should have conveyed.</p>

But, in my judgement, it is actually of very little assistance. Of itself, I do not consider that the presentation makes clear one way or the other what IBM's commitment to future benefit accrual was: subject to two related caveats, I agree with Mr Heath who accepted, in his oral evidence, that for a person who mistakenly, as he would say, believed as a result of the Ocean communications that IBM was guaranteeing further benefit accrual to 2014 or some other date, this presentation would have done nothing to dispel that misunderstanding. So one is thrown back to the Ocean communications to discover what it is that the reasonable manager attending this presentation would have understood.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The first caveat is this. There is some support for IBM's position to be derived from the reaction (or rather lackof reaction) from those attending the presentation. As with the Webcast, the extended guarantee and the alleged commitment to continue to allow benefit accrual are separate matters. Even if it is correct that the guarantee does not of itself have anything to say about accrual, that does not mean that the presentation given by Mr Hirst and Mr Heath taken as a whole had nothing to say about accrual. In fact, it did say <span style="text-decoration:underline">something,</span> namely that, for those making the relevant election, only part of future salary increase would be pensionable. Although that is not inconsistent with a commitment to future accrual <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, it is inconsistent with accrual at the then current rates. Yet no-one at the presentation to managers appears to have suggested that the proposal was inconsistent with what IBM had, as is now alleged by the RBs, committed to such a short time before. If the message given by the Ocean proposals had been so strong â giving rise to the Reasonable Expectations alleged by the RBs and forming the central plank of their claim in these proceedings â it is remarkable that the presentation to managers provoked not a single question on the topic.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">The second caveat is this, and lends some support to the RBs' position at least to some extent.

A member electing to remain in a DB Plan would have an expectation that he would be able to continue to accrue benefits in that Plan, albeit that part of his salary increases would be non-pensionable. Although he could, if things turned out unexpectedly, transfer to the DC Plan later on, he would not be able to obtain the enhanced terms on offer in June 2006. I do not consider that a reasonable member who elected to remain in his DB arrangement could form an expectation that, for the rest of his working life, or indeed until 2014, the DB Plans would remain open to future accrual in accordance with the Soto proposals or, indeed, that it would not be put into winding-up. The issues here are essentially the same as those which arise in relation to Project Ocean and there is nothing I can usefully add at this stage to the discussion which I have carried out.</p>

I accept, as Mr Simmondssubmits, that this was a response to rumours (to which Mr Hirst had alluded in his presentation to managers) circulating amongst the workforce and the press following the announcement earlier in the month of the closure of the DB plan in the United States. I also accept that the statement was entirely correct as a matter of fact: when Mr Hirst sent his e-mail, Holdings was not proposing to close the DB sections of the Plans and such closure formed no part of the Project Soto proposals. Moreover, closure was not even on the discussion agenda within the UK management team, although what CHQ were thinking about at this time is more open to question. The statement cannot, in my view, and here I agree with Mr Simmonds, on any reasonable reading of the e-mail be construed as a promise by Mr Hirst that IBM would never close the Plans to DB accrual or even as a statement that IBM's current intention was never to end DB accrual.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">That reference to the support agreement can only be to the guarantee in the Funding Agreement. It providesfurther confirmation that the guarantee is to do only with funding. This paragraph of the letter gives no support at all to a suggestion that IBM was guaranteeing future accrual. Indeed, it lends support to IBM's case. This is because the earlier part of the letter, in accurately explaining the proposals, discloses that only base salary increase will be pensionable, and that the so-called salary supplement will not be. That is clearly something different from the then current position. If it is said that there was a guarantee of future accrual under Ocean (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>at the then current accrual rate), then that guarantee is clearly <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> being continued under the Soto proposals. But the paragraph quoted above records that "the support agreement", that is to say, the Funding Agreement including the guarantee, will remain in place. This results in an inconsistency: the guarantee which the RBs assert in relation to Ocean (and which they say was to continue until 2014) related to future accrual at the then current rate; but the ongoing guarantee clearly does not do so and could at most relate to a guarantee at the reduced accrual rate with only part of salary increases being pensionable. And yet Mr Lamb's letter stated that the support agreement "will remain in place".</p>

The period to 2014 includes, of course, the first 5 years and also 3 of the next 10 years. Mr Lamb wrote: "If the plan is wound up the pension in payment guarantee will fall way". That, it seems to me, is a possibility which is entirely inconsistent with the plan guaranteeing future accrual at the then current rate or at all and is not easy to reconcile with a long term commitment to keep the Plans open. The reasonable active member reading the letter would not focus only on the material under the heading "Changes for Employees" but, as a future pensioner, would have the material under the heading "Changes for Retirees".

As to the Ocean commitment, it was recognised by Mr Lamb that the Trustee had not been able secure the position where the members' "pension benefits remain at least in line with their expectations" but that the best deal possible in the circumstances had been obtained. He did not suggest that IBM was acting in breach of any agreement which it had made or even of a commitment falling short of a promise or guarantee. I agree to some extent with Mr Simmonds when he says that any reasonable member reading this letter who was under the impression that IBM was committed to maintaining the benefit structure would have been caused, at the very least, to question that impression in view of the fact that the Trustee was accepting (albeit reluctantly) a change to the benefit structure: I say "to some extent" because, in my view, it is only in relation to future benefit accrual that he is right.

With regard to no current plans Randy McDonald told me he had no plans for change and would push back on anyone who wanted to revisit this topic during his watch."</p>

Although members would not have seen this letter, it informs what the Trustee and Holdings meant by use of the word; and it goes to emphasise the importance to the Trustee's decision of the fact that there were no plans to alter the DB Plans in the future. Mr Lamb clearly did not distinguish between Holdings and IBM Corporation/CHQ in this thinking not least because the message was coming from Mr MacDonald. Mr Hirst cannot have made such a distinction either.</p>

There are three aspects: personal pressure on senior UK executives, a threat to withhold SIP from the UK if it did not make the changes required and a confrontational stance adopted by CHQ. As to the first of those there is nothing wrong with putting pressure on people providing that it is not improper pressure. As Mr MacDonald said:</p>

CHQ had the power to control not just the future progression of their careers within IBM, but also whether they would continue to work in the Company at all. It is true that CHQ had that power; indeed, as Mr MacDonald confirmed, anyone who was perceived as not performing his job properly could be removed from post. But whether CHQ would use that power so as to put pressure on any of the UK team to take a decision which they did not believe was in the interests of Holdings (in contrast with IBM Corporation) or a decision contrary to what they regarded as a commitment to employees and members, is a different matter.</p>

In an email of 18 December 2005 from Mr Greene to Mr MacDonald and Ms Salinaro, cc'd to Mr Loughridge, Mr Greene asked what he should tell Mr Wilson: "I can say we haven't decided anything or I can go silent and leave it to you. How would you like me to respond?" Ms Salinaro's reply was that Mr Greene should tell Mr Wilson that "no decisions have been made". In Court, Mr MacDonald said that "The word "no" [in Ms Salinaro's email] is inappropriate".

And it is certainly the case that Mr Greene informed Mr Wilson that no decision had been made on funding levels. In a sense, what Mr Greene wrote was true, although disingenuous, because CHQ had not decided whether to make a larger cash injection.

Either it did not consider itself committed to do so (whether as the result of a binding promise or otherwise) by the Ocean changes and communications; or it did consider itself committed but decided to ignore its commitments and any assurances which had been given. Either way, it was clear that IBM was not willing to offer any sort of <span style="text-decoration:underline">guarantee</span> for the future. If a reasonable member was previously under the impression that the Plans were guaranteed to remain open for benefit accrual at current rates until 2014, he could not have thought that that was the position after reading this passage of the Q&amp;As. The expression of belief in the second sentence of the answer cannot detract from that conclusion; and it is to be noted that this belief only relates to <span style="text-decoration:underline">reducing</span> the expense and volatility.

No reasonable reading of this Q&amp;A is consistent with a commitment as to the long term. Any reasonable reader would understand that, in the absence of a guarantee that there will be no further changes, the possibility must remain that there will be such changes (even if that is not what either IBM or the members hope or expect): to seek to dismiss the obvious meaning of this and other similar questions by saying, as Mr Turner did in crossexamination, that "timetable and context are paramount" is no answer to the clear and unambiguous message that IBM is conveying in its answer.

The answer explained that those changes were implemented to address underfunding in respect of past service and a predicted increase in future service costs. The reference to "volatile economic forces" cannot, I think, be a reference to NPPC volatility. Rather, the reference is to the volatility of markets, particularly equity and bond markets. In relation to that volatility, I consider that this answer is rather mealy-mouthed. Surely, I ask rhetorically, this market volatility is relevant to the Ocean changes because of its impact (in an English context) of the funding of the DB Plans which it was an aim of Ocean to address? The reference to pensions expense, however, may well be intended to subsume the impact on NPPC of the volatile economic forces referred to although, if that is so, it is hard to think that the questioner would have had any understanding of the point. Be all that as it may, it must be accepted by the RBs that this answer is only expressing a <span style="text-decoration:underline">hope</span> (the word actually used) that the Plans are being put on a sustainable footing.

Instead, it deliberately reassured members that the DB Plans were sustainable, and that volatility and cost issues had been addressed. Members were given a wholly false impression as to the extent to which (i) the changes addressed cost volatility; and (ii) IBM was prepared to live with whatever level of volatility it allowed to remain in future. In that context, he relies on IBM's statements about improving "our competitive position" by reducing long-term pensions expense and volatility.</p>

The short term volatility which has impacted the Company's pension expense <span style="font-weight:bold">primarily relates to falling long term interest rates</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.01in">(for the first time so far as I am aware). If nothing else, it demonstrates that Holdings clearly knew that the US GAAP impact of the changes was a relevant factor in establishing the need for the changes. Indeed, it is entirely consistent with the reality which is that these changes were being driven by CHQ with a view to achieving results from the UK which would impact to the extent required on IBM Corporation's I&amp;E account. Once that is recognised, the fall in interest rates is, in fact, the most significant factor since that is what produced the major impact on NPPC.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.45in;margin-right:0.01in">Quite apart from that, I do not understand what Mr Tennet seeks to draw from this. On his case, Holdings hasgiven a misleading answer and failed (perhaps even deliberately) to reveal the whole reason for the increased costs. But this misleading answer could not, so it seems to me, have engendered any expectation about Holdings' future conduct. What it might have done is to have influenced the decision which the member was taking; and it would then be arguable, even if there was no actionable misrepresentation, that the giving of the answer was a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. It is not, however, part of the RBs' case that the Soto changes gave rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and it is not, in any case, clear what, if any, remedies would be available if it were. He can throw the point into the forensic melting pot to show, if the point were a good one, how Holdings was prepared to treat the members, but it cannot, as I see it, give rise to any Reasonable Expectation about either future changes to benefits or future cessation of accrual. It is irrelevant, in my view, to the claims in relation to Project Waltz. It is a separate question whether IBM actually <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> responsible for the problem by reason of its investment policies; and a further question, if so, whether it could justify, if justification is needed to avoid a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, the Project Waltz changes by actions needed to solve the problem which it had created.</p>

Mr Simmonds suggests that there is no reason to think that KPMG did not repeat, if not emphasise, this point in the one-to-one meetings with individual members that followed the roadshows. He finds support for that proposition in a summary by KPMG where it was reported as follows: "There was a general expectation that IBM would amend/close the DB Plan in the future". But that quotation was immediately followed by this: "However, many were of the view that they would rather accrue another 5-10 years in the DB Plan rather than switch to the M-Plan." The entire passage therefore shows that there was a general expectation of closure in the future but at least a hope that that would not happen within the 5 to 10 year period.</p>

His case is that, as IBM well understood, the DB Plans were incompatible with the drive for yearon-year delivery of NPPC savings in order to deliver on its commitment to investors of an ever-increasing EPS. Further, IBM (or at least those in CHQ) did not believe, or could not reasonably have believed, that the Soto changes would bring about sustainability even if the then current financial and economic conditions continued. Still less could it have held that belief in pursuing its preferred return-seeking investment strategy. It is said that, whatever UK management may have believed, CHQ knew that NPPC volatility would not be solved by the Soto changes. Accordingly, the Soto communications presented a wholly misleading picture.</p>

I have already saidsomething about the different uses of the word "volatility" (see paragraph 518<span style="font-style:italic">ff</span> above). Mr Tennet is here using the word in the sense of NPPC volatility. Mr Koppl, who, as I have said, was head of pension analytics and thus responsible for advising about the management of NPPC volatility, explained what this type of "volatility" was by reference to future pension assumptions or actual returns deviating from what was expected at the discount rate. He said that it amounted to a "lack of predictability" which was causing IBM to move away from DB plans; for CHQ, the "issue for us was the year-to-year change. The primary issue". I asked Mr Koppl when deviating from what was expected became sufficiently serious to be seen as volatility or, as he rephrased my question, when does it become material. A small deviation, he said, could be volatile and a large one could be volatile. So when speaking of NPPC, his view was that it came down to this: "Is it material to the Corporation from an earning standpoint?" I think this description of volatility gives a sufficient understanding for present purposes and I accept it as broadly correct.</p>

His projections at the time showed that a 0.5% reduction in the discount rate at the time of the upcoming remeasurement would reduce the NPPC savings for 2006 alone from Â£109m to Â£44m. He accepted that this same volatility applied with equal force to all NPPC predictions. As he said:</p>

The other elements of NPPC â interest cost, EROA, amortisation of gains and losses, and prior service credits/costs and curtailments â all related to accrued benefits, and depended mainly upon market performance.</p>

IBM each period, each quarter and each year, is reporting externally our results, in terms of profit and earnings per share, so while it is true that these plans can deliver profit in periods, prospectively each coming year the amounts can change, they can change up or down; that is the volatility element. So in the event that even if earning a profit, it is a smaller profit going into the next year. Then the issue is that the Company has to figure out a way to offset it in order to deliver what it otherwise would have without the pension in terms of profit growth. So the volatility is an issue that, without the ability to predict which direction those costs go based on movements in the financial markets, that the Company could be faced with adverse conditions that would cause it to operationally have to take actions that it otherwise wouldn'tâ¦â¦ Here, DB Plans can deliver either a cost or a profit, and in spite of that we are choosing to move away from them, for the lack of predictability." 950.

Global NPPC in 2004 was $94m,which, as Mr Koppl stated was "a small absolute number in the context of the Company", in the context of a global Service Cost of around $1.25bn: "we are thinking of this from an investor perspective, and they look primarily at year-to-year performance. So we don't think about 2004 [NPPC] as having been low in a relative sense; the issue for us was the year-to-year change. The primary issue". Mr Tennet also made the point that the $94m figure was small in relation to the cost of accrual in that year. That point must, however, be put in context. Mr Koppl went on to say this:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.88in;margin-right:0.42in">"I have to say to you, I understand the point about accruals, benefit accruals, but we don't think about it that way. It is clear that benefit accruals represent the value of the benefit being earned. We think about it in the total context. We are required under US GAAP to report six lines of cost, including with the ones that are made volatile by financial market performance, how the assets are invested and so forth. So from our standpoint we don't have a baseline that says the one true line of cost is the benefit the participants earned. Even though I can understand from the members' standpoint that may be how they think about it, from our standpoint we think about the total, and we have to deal with the total. If we could just deal with that one line, our life would be easy. DB Plans would be DC Plans and we wouldn't be in such a mode of trying to move away from them."</p>

It seems to me that that is not quite the right way of expressing matters. It is not the expenses targets which resulted in an intolerance of excess NPPC. Rather, it was the target for EPS which drove overall cost levels, of which NPPC was one. If changing financial circumstances resulted in an increase in NPPC, then that increase would have to be countered by steps which decreased NPPC and/or decreased operational costs if EPS was to be maintained. These expense targets do not of themselves demonstrate that IBM could not tolerate NPPC in excess of projections: it is the imperative to maintain EPS which might produce such intolerance. The evidence of such an imperative is not found in the expense targets: the targets were the effect, rather than the cause, of a particular EPS requirement and it was only if that EPS requirement had to be maintained, come what may, that expense targets had to be reviewed.</p>

He submits that when the propositions â truths he would say â that (i) the DB Plans' NPPC was inherently volatile and hard to predict and (ii) IBM could not tolerate any year-on-year increases in NPPC, are viewed together, it is apparent that the DB Plans were wholly unsustainable, because over a period of time some year-on-year increase in NPPC was practically inevitable. Stated in that way, that reasoning begs an issue, namely whether an increase in NPPC was necessarily, over a period of time, incompatible with the sustainability of the Plans.

In that sense, they were doomed as a method of delivery of pensions and this was why IBM and many others employers were moving away from DB plans. I do not consider that he was saying that the DB Plans operated by IBM were necessarily doomed (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>incapable of remaining in place as a viable vehicle for providing pensions to their existing members) or that they were unsustainable in the sense which I have already discussed.

He put to Mr Koppl that they were made because of a decline in discount rates of just 0.25% in 2005 (which returned to 5.75% in 2006). Mr Koppl accepted that, but it was because "we are dealing with the year-to-year issue that gets updated each year based on the financial market performance in that year". But Mr Koppl did agree that if IBM was "looking to cut benefits each time bond yields fall annually over a 20 or 30 year period" it would be "making a lot of cuts". In a similar vein, Mr MacDonald accepted that, if the 2006 targets for pensions were not met, IBM would have to "look" at the level of pensions benefits being paid.</p>

I accept that evidence. It seems to me that he must have seen the Soto changes as addressing the concerns which he had so that he, the expert in this area, could not have perceived continuance of the DB Plans as incompatible with IBM's business model in the sense that they would need to be drastically altered or even closed to future accrual. He did, as his evidence shows, recognise the problems associated with the DB Plans in terms of the effect of NPPC on EPS and was alive to the risks inherent in the DB Plans. His preference may well have been to have only DC plans â I am sure it was â but that is not to say that he considered the continued existence of the DB Plans as impossible to reconcile with IBM's commitment to its investors at the time of Ocean and Soto â a commitment to achieve EPS of $10.</p>

While we have been focussed on the 2006 P&amp;L impact, in most countries we have also come across opportunities to reduce ongoing P&amp;L and get IBM out from further long terms exposure &amp; variability. In each case this comes with one time cost on the P&amp;L and also cash implications. At this stage in each country we are trying to make changes that will involve a lot of effort and noise and we are not really solving our future volatility in each case (related to the past). If the changes don't add up to enough to get out of the P&amp;L hole in 2006 I think we should consider the "nuclear" option i.e. wind up where possible, push/buy conversion to DC and settle as much liability as possible."</p>

Further, it is hardly a ringing endorsement of the proposition that IBM saw the DB Plans as sustainable at that time; it even makes questionable the proposition that IBM had no current intention to make further changes in the near or even foreseeable future. And it clearly shows that CHQ's thoughts were not to be shared with UK management, something which Mr Koppl accepted. That requirement for secrecy was, it seems to me, a reflection of the fact that CHQ knew things that it did not want UK management to know because it would undermine the message which CHQ was sending out about addressing volatility and sustainability.</p>

The total service cost in the years 2006-2008 was Â£183.6m, Â£20m greater than the Â£163m PBO reduction arising from Project Soto. Therefore, it was clear, he says, that, all things being equal, within 3 years volatility would be back to the level that necessitated the Soto changes in the first place: the Main Plan was just as volatile just 3 years after Soto. That may be so. But again, the comparison surely needs to be â when asking whether volatility had been addressed rather than solved â between the positions (i) following Soto and (ii) if the Soto changes had not taken place. PBO would inevitably been higher than it in fact was and to that extent, volatility would have been greater that it in fact was.</p>

MrWilson noted that Mr Robbins, in his report and the joint report, had "not defined what he characterises as material". But it became apparent at the end of the cross-examination of both witnesses that they were not talking the same language. Mr Wilson explained that he was referring to materiality in an audit context. Mr Robbins was obviously rather surprised by this. In answer to a question from me about a possible difference of approach, he said that the audit materiality was not something that he referenced in his report and it had certainly not been mentioned in the joint report or in the discussions which the two experts had held. So although Mr Wilson might have been referring to audit materiality, Mr Robbins meant something different:</p>

Mr Wilson considered that "downside risk" was not a measure of volatility. It was Mr Koppl's view that volatility referred to the spread of outcomes. This is all a matter of language, it seems to me, and of what the use of the word "volatility" means in the context of that use. Although Mr Tennet asked Mr Robbins a number of questions about the downside risk, and took him to some graphs and tables to illustrate the points he was making in his questions, Mr Robbins was never actually asked â at least, I have not found it in the transcript and will no doubt be corrected if I am wrong when this judgment is considered by the parties in draft â why he disagreed with Mr Wilson about whether downside risk could sensibly be described as volatility.</p>

In that context, it is clear to my mind that the references to volatility included breadth of variation "volatility"; whether they included the downside risk must be very open to question. The reasonable member reading or hearing the communications would, I consider, apply the ordinary meaning of the word "volatility". What the reasonable member would have expected is that the proposals addressed (even if they did not solve) the unpredictable variations in pension costs and in the gap between assets and liabilities.</p>

We need to understand that sensitivity and how far off our estimates could be. What will the UK business do, if the estimates turn out to be off and are producing lower savings than anticipated?

Since both Mr Tennet and MrSimmonds rely on what he said in his oral evidence, I think that I need to set out a somewhat lengthy interchange between him and Mr Simmonds. This was directed at a slide in which a number of factors are identified as an explanation of how expense and volatility was being addressed, namely anticipated transfer of employees to the enhanced DC plans, restriction on pensionability of future salary increases for DB members, one-off cash injection by IBM further securing the pension scheme and reduced, but guaranteed future Pension in Payment Increases for a fixed period. The exchange went like this:</p>

I think it at some times meant the volatility that could occur in IBM's net periodic pension cost in absolute terms; in other words, the swings and the ups and downs in pension cost. I think in other contexts it was taken to mean just reducing the extent to which the DB liability would grow in the future, and that therefore this could damp down future volatility because the DB liability would be smaller than it otherwise would have been, and would grow less slowly.</p>

Those things, I think, have a beneficial effect on the level of variability, to use a different word, that could occur in NPPC but they would not eliminate that variability, because you have large assets and large liabilities which are still subject to the amount you ascribe to the return on assets and what is happening to discount rates and inflation rates and other financial market conditions."</p>

If there is a justifiable business case for preferring the attainment of EPS targets over other desiderata, such as increased employee remuneration or indeed continued pension provision, Holdings can be required to play its part. In essence, (and this is a point made by Mr Simmonds in his oral closing) IBM Corporation is simply the (ultimate) shareholder of Holdings and is entitled to act, as any shareholder, in a way in which it considers is in its best commercial interests.</p>

He suggests that such a contention would mean that Mr Wilson had approved communications which he knew to be wrong and so had knowingly misled the members: no such case is put forward by the RBs: indeed, they could hardly impugn their own witness in that way.</p>

His first point on thisaspect of the case is that, even if there were no reasonable grounds for what was said, that cannot, as a matter of law, give rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. I have already dealt with the competing submissions in relation to negligent statements giving rise to a breach of duty. I refer back to paragraphs 450<span style="font-style:italic">ff</span> above. From that discussion, it will be apparent that the issue in the present case, as I perceive it, is not whether Holdings was in breach of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in making the statements which it did but whether its actions in implementing Project Waltz gave rise to a breach of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty taking into account those statements.</p>

I agree with that. First of all, such a case was not put to Mr Heath or to Mr Wilson; indeed, their own individual good faith is not challenged. Mr Hirst's witness statement said nothing about this: he was the RBs' witness and if they were to make a case based on a suggestion that Mr Hirst could not reasonably have made the statements which he did they should have explained that in the witness statements. But neither he, nor Mr Wilson nor Mr Heath, would of course have been likely to accept that they could not reasonably have made the statements which they did on the basis of what they knew at the time; and whether they could have made those statements if they had known what they know now is not to the point. Secondly, UK management was largely dependent on CHQ in assessing the financial position of the Plans and their future viability. It was reasonable, in my view, for them to take their lead from CHQ. Moreover, CHQ was content with the Ocean and Soto proposals â hardly surprisingly since they had promoted them. And Mr MacDonald was happy with the Soto proposals. I do not consider that any criticism can properly be made of UK management for making the decisions which it did in relation to Ocean and Soto.</p>

The most important area to deal with is the extent of any Reasonable Expectations engendered by Holdings or CHQ in the course of the Ocean and Soto changes. Mr Simmonds has focused on the Reasonable Expectations (or rather lack of them as he would say) which the members held after the Soto changes had been agreed. His case is that, whatever may have been the members' expectations after Ocean, by the time the Soto changes had been agreed, members could no longer have had any expectation that further changes would not be made in the future. By proposing and implementing the Soto changes, Holdings had shown absolutely clearly that it did not regard what it had said at the time of Ocean from preventing it proceeding with the further Soto changes: the members were disabused of any (mistaken on Holdings' case) expectations which they had about the future. As I understand the submission, that is not limited to future benefit accrual, but applies equally to any change to the structure of the DB Plans and in particular to any change in early retirement policy.</p>

Whether they do give rise to a breach of duty falls to be assessed in the context of the entire history including the Soto changes and the communications surrounding Soto.

If the Ocean communications gave rise to Reasonable Expectations, disappointment of which could amount to breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, I do not see why Project Soto has to be seen as a licence to take actions which, absent the Soto changes, would have been a breach of that duty. A statement by IBM in the course of the Soto communications that further changes were not ruled out cannot, by itself, be taken as extinguishing a preexisting Reasonable Expectation. Rather, the question whether Project Waltz gives rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty must be answered in the context of the whole history from the start of Project Ocean and take account of how Reasonable Expectations engendered as part of Project Ocean might endure through Project Soto. Of course, in addition to that, account must be taken of any fresh Reasonable Expectation engendered by the Soto communications themselves. It must, however, be appreciated that, on my analysis, the disappointment of Reasonable Expectations is only the start of the assessment; the issue always comes back, under the test which I have identified, to whether particular actions taken by Holdings were such that no reasonable employer would have taken them.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">As my review of the history shows, there were many representations about the Soto changes being long-termand producing sustainability, and statements to the effect that volatility and cost had been addressed. There is also the important, to my mind, an email from Mr Lamb to Mr Heath (see paragraph 888 above<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span> to which there does not appear to have been a response with the result that the words "long term" remained in Mr Lamb's letter to members. And there is the famous "push back" promise by Mr MacDonald. Although neither the letter nor a report of the "push back" conversation would have been known to members, they are relevant in two ways: first, they illustrate Holdings' and CHQ's thinking and secondly they gave the Trustee reassurance which was in turn reflected in the message given by Mr Lamb to the members. And then there is Mr Heath's evidence that the January 2006 presentation to managers sent the message that the Soto changes would result in a long term sustainable competitive position for Holdings.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">On the other hand, there are statements which show that Holdings was not entering into any commitment aboutthe future: its statements were carefully hedged to ensure there were no guarantees or promises. The speaking notes from one-to-one sessions with KMPG also show that benefits were not guaranteed and that "it is possible for the terms of the pension promise for future service to be changed at any time in the futureâ¦â¦". The possibility of a change "at any time" is antithetical to any sort of Reasonable Expectation (in contrast with hope) that things would not in fact change. The Q&amp;As on which IBM relies make clear that there was no guarantee not to change the Plans, so that benefit accrual could change or even cease. However, it is unsurprising that Holdings did not provide answers to the questions (all querying whether IBM would keep the Plans open) simply stating "We reserve the right to amend Plans at any time, including changing future accrual and even closing the Plans".</p>

Even if the Soto communications themselves do not justify my conclusion, they do not wholly displace the similar message given by the Ocean communications concerning future benefit accrual (although, of course, the rate of accrual after Soto would be different).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">As to how far into the future that Reasonable Expectation is to last, it is relevant to note that, under ProjectWaltz, the actual termination of future accrual did not take place until closure of the Plans in April 2011, some 6 years after the Ocean changes were brought into effect and longer than that from the date of the Webcast. Although the reasonable member was entitled to hold a Reasonable Expectation derived from the Ocean communications concerning future accrual, I do not consider that such an expectation could have endured past 6 April 2011 if Soto had not intervened. That may not matter because a similar Reasonable Expectation is to be derived from the Soto communications but with a different starting point from which to measure the appropriate time. The starting point here is sometime in the first half of 2006 when the proposals were approved by the Trustee and communicated to the members. In my judgement, the reasonable member was entitled to expect (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>to hold a Reasonable Expectation) that benefit accrual would continue at least until April 2011. The reasonable member would have been right to see Project Waltz as conduct contrary to his Reasonable Expectation concerning future benefit accrual (absent a change of circumstances).</p>

For thereasons I have already given, the reasonable member was entitled to hold a Reasonable Expectation that, in relation to his service up to the time of the implementation of the Ocean proposals, he would be able to take advantage of Holdings' then current early retirement policy until 2014 unless there was a relevant justification for a change in policy. The Soto communications do not, so far as I am aware, mention early retirement policy; nor was a change in that policy discussed by Holdings with the Trustee. Indeed, there is nothing to suggest that, at this stage, even CHQ had a change in such policy in its mind as even of remote possibility.</p>

But read in context, it seems to me that the answers in the Q&amp;A are mostly directed at questions concerning future accrual. Perhaps the most supportive answer from Holdings' point of view is the one which I have repeated at paragraph 1049 above. But even that answer is premised on a review of Holdings' requirement to remain competitive particularly in regard to the total reward package it offered compared with that offered by its competitors.</p>

MrHirst said, referring to the guarantee, that "the bargain we signed is still on the table"; and Mr Heath explained that Holdings had "agreed to fully fund â fully fund â the current deficitâ¦" and "what we have negotiated with the company is to maintain the World Trade Guarantee for the period through to 2014". He also referred to the guarantee; "But that deal that we did last year, the agreement we put in place last year remains intact; no change, World Trade Corporation guarantee in place, and will remain in place supporting the UK company until 2014". For the same reasons which I have given in my discussion of the Ocean communications, I consider that these statements indicate the same commitment to preserving the early retirement policy as I identified in that discussion. But even if that is wrong, there is, in my view, nothing at all in the Soto communications which qualifies, or justifies a departure from, the message given by the Ocean communications in relation to early retirement policy.</p>

I accept that the Soto changes had some positive effect on volatility but the extent of the amelioration was only small in the context of the problem which IBM Corporation was facing. That CHQ knew a message was being given which was, at best, hugely optimistic, in all likelihood disingenuous and, on an extreme view, deliberately misleading, is underlined by its requirement for secrecy: CHQ knew things that it did not want UK management to know because it would undermine the message which CHQ was sending out about addressing volatility and sustainability.</p>

Watson Wyatt's accompanying papers emphasised the importance of the guarantee in supporting the investment strategy and valuation basis. Absent the guarantee, "the ongoing funding target would be on a "conservative" basis".

The reason was that the actual EROA based on the previous year's assumptions was calculated at 8.75%, but IBM was capped by accounting rules to using 8%. In essence, he was saying that a 20% allocation to bonds would not reduce accounting EROA to below 8%. He added; "In some ways it may benefit us to make this move because at the moment we take the additional equity risk but don't get the additional I&amp;E benefit." Mr Koppl's response was to say that this was "great news" and that he agreed and supported the change to 20% bonds, clearly being satisfied that there would be no accounting cost.</p>

A further slide contained a chart of retirement related plan income and (cost) which again showed the significant increases and decreases in income or cost concluding that "Substantial volatility continued for future years". The RBs' opening submissions remark dryly that these statements were in stark contrast to what IBM told UK members in 2006, namely that volatility was being addressed to IBM's satisfaction; but that was, perhaps, true in the sense that IBM was prepared to live with this volatility because of the perceived commercial benefits its policies engendered.</p>

As Mr Koppl later explained to Mr Scott in an email dated 16 September 2008, there was a concern that if the savings flowed to unit measurements, any pricing done on a cost plus profit basis would pass the savings through to customers as lower prices. In other words, if not managed correctly, the Soto savings would flow through into reduced prices the UK set for its services to customers, and would not result in "incremental EPS improvement" which was the whole rationale for CHQ's strategy.</p>

Indeed, it followed on as part of the Ocean and Soto Changes that the Trustee adopted a policy in relation to de-risking (in particular, matching) which they would not have adopted if it had not been for the Funding Agreement in particular. The RBs do not now complain that the Trustee's investment decisions, reflecting IBM's desire to pursue an investment policy which slowed down the Trustee's de-risking programme, were improper: it is accepted that those decisions were within the range of acceptable decisions albeit that, according to Mr Tennet, the investment strategy was at the riskier end of the spectrum. I am happy that Mr Tennet has made that clear in the RBs written closing submissions since he spent some time in his cross-examination, of Mr Koppl in particular, that IBM would have been expected to be more cautious in its investment policy than a smaller company with a smaller pension scheme because of the greater volatility of a large scheme simply by virtue of its size. I do not propose to go into the questioning of Mr Koppl on this topic any further. It is sufficient to say that I accept his evidence that IBM made the decisions which it did for perfectly sound commercial reasons. If it is the case, as Mr Tennet suggests it is but Mr Simmonds says it is not, that this investment policy has resulted in the need for changes when there would otherwise have been no need, that is a factor to be brought into account in assessing whether Project Waltz gave rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

To describe the commitment as absolute may be slightly too strong but not much. The message given to the market was itself fairly strong and, whilst no investor could regard a presentation as a promise, a failure to deliver to the market that which it had been told it could expect might, I accept, have had a serious impact on IBM's share price. So keeping to the 2010 EPS Roadmap became a corporate imperative. A word of caution, however, is necessary. The commitment was to achieve "Double-Digit Earnings per Share Growth over the Long-Term"; the 2010 EPS Roadmap showed how this was to be achieved. Although the Roadmap showed various components going to that growth commitment, I do not think that each and every element of that target was itself an independent commitment, albeit that internally IBM considered that each component of the target had to be met. An above-expected achievement of one element coupled with an underexpected achievement in another would be consistent with the Roadmap commitment provided that the overall growth was as predicted. Further, the growth was to be achieved by 2010; CHQ may have wished to see a month by month improvement in EPS, but that was not the commitment to the market, at least in the 2010 EPS Roadmap. It is has not, of course, escaped the critical eyes of the RBs' legal team that IBM appears to have regarded the "commitment" to the market as more important that the "commitment" to the members</p>

The work you are embarking on is the natural next step of [what] was started a few years ago (2005/06/07 - first wave of Soto work). The majority of the cost and risk exposure for these large pension plans is related to the older active (but mostly inactive) participants. We understand that IBM has once again assembled a cross functional team (HR, Finance and Legal) to quickly look into country specific opportunities to help reduce risk exposure and reduce long term costs."</p>

Mr Koppl, in my assessment, is a straightforward professional person. He was looking into different ways of achieving the goal which his employers wished to achieve, namely to meet the EPS target and within that objective to produce a contribution from pensions worldwide of $0.90. To portray him as a gleeful slasher of costs â which I am afraid is the impression that I have of the submission â is not a fair portrayal.</p>

He says that "at this time of the decision to do something", the marketshad obviously fallen, but much more severe falls were to come, noting that market falls were particularly bad at the start of October 2008. Indeed, it was the severe falls which prompted Mr Loughridge to ask Mr Koppl to produce an update of the retirement related costs forecast overnight. Mr Tennet submits that the further falls in the market played no causative role in the decision to proceed with Project Waltz because the decision had already been taken prior to those falls. I reject that submission. First of all, Mr Tennet is clearly referring, when he says "at this time of the decision to do something", to the meeting on 26 August 2008 or, if not then, then at some later time when Towers Perrin were instructed. The fact that Mr Koppl, following that meeting, may have been taking steps to consider the impact of closure of the DB Plans and even to instruct Towers Perrin does not indicate that any decision had been made: indeed (i) Mr Koppl had no authority to make such a decision and (ii) clearly did not take such a decision.

In any case, even if a decision had been taken before the serious market falls and even if Mr Tennet could establish that such decision should not have been taken, it does not follow that the same decision could not properly have been taken after the falls. The same decision would, clearly I think, have been taken and I therefore see no reason why IBM should not be able to rely on that as a factor in justifying its actions. The question then is whether, even with such reliance, its actions can be justified.</p>

Mr Riley joined the meeting to give a presentation. There was no suggestion that Mr Riley's assessment of the state of the UK business necessitated any change to the DB pension arrangements agreed after Soto. He was aware of poor morale and that there had been major changes to the structure of the pension plans in recent years. According to the minutes, he stated that "there were currently no discussions going on as regards the IBM UK pension plans." I have no reason to think that Mr Riley thought that there were any such discussions under way.</p>

Initially there were just thoughts, then later (at least after the time of the TMM on 23 October 2008) options were discussed and developed. His oral testimony included this:</p>

Matters were more developed than an idea in the sky that "we need to have a talk about pensions".

For instance, Ms Roin told him that Towers Perrin had been engaged to produce "initial country scans for each of the six Soto countries that we will use to develop our action items"; but in the future (what she referred to as "the second phase of the project during which we narrow down the potential action items to the actual proposals we wish to bring forward") local UK consultants (KPMG or Hewitt) would be engaged for more detailed analysis. Proposals would first be reviewed by Mr Castellanos and then by CHQ senior management. CHQ would fund the consultants. The aim was to hold initial UK workshop meetings in the week of 17 November 2008. She would send Mr Ferrar non-disclosure agreements for both internal and external use.

Mr MacDonald described it in his witness statement: UKI Transformation addressed costs, problems and a plethora of issues with a view to turning the business around. The strategy behind the project (on which work was started a few months before its formal announcement) was centred on five areas, <span style="font-style:italic">viz</span>. (1) focus on clients; (2) creating an environment to allow IBM to succeed through its people; (3) enhancing productivity by managing operational efficiency to optimise revenue and profit performance; (4) identifying, prioritising and executing opportunities for growth; and (5) enhancing IBM's reputation. I accept that as a fair summary of the strategy. But whether that included pensions at the early stage is a matter of contention. As we will see, the RBs' position is that pensions did not feature in the UKI Transformation at the beginning and only came into consideration when CHQ began to insist on the reduction of DB costs in order to achieve the 2010 EPS Roadmap. As I have already said, Mr Riley and Mr Wilson were only told about Project Sapporo in late October 2008.</p>

IBM say that the suggestion made by the RBs in the Amended Voluntary Particulars ("<span style="font-weight:bold">AVPs</span>") that UKI Transformation was "a pure 'fig leaf', which IBM UK and IBM CHQ cynically used to try to 'sell' the proposals", is utterly without foundation. Again as it is put in IBM's written opening, Project Waltz was part and parcel of UKI Transformation: the cost savings sought as part of Project Waltz (for, it is accepted, reasons primarily connected with the commitments made by IBM Corporation in the 2010 EPS Roadmap) were entirely consistent with the broader attempt through the UKI Transformation to increase the profitability and competitiveness of the UK business. Therefore, whilst also assisting in meeting the commitments made by IBM Corporation in the 2010 EPS Roadmap, the proposals were also of central importance to IBM UK's business strategy under the leadership of Mr Riley and, in particular, its strategy to increase profitability (not least because the profitability and budgetary targets that UKI</p>

Mr MacDonald's own reaction shows that he was not himself pushing back on any proposals. Even on his own terms, that is pretty surprising since, far from communicating to others in CHQ the concerns of the UK management as concerns which needed to be addressed rather than overridden and far from challenging (his own view of what was required by the need to "push back") with CHQ the need for changes, he reacted against Mr Wilson's concerns as negativity when, had he pushed back, Mr MacDonald ought to have supported him in making his concerns heard.</p>

His written closing submissions state that on 8 January 2006 Mr MacDonald promised the Trustee that the UK DB Plans would receive special protection (whatever the meaning of "push back" was). I can find no reference anywhere in the evidence to "special protection": Mr MacDonald did not use those words or anything like them in his witness statement nor did Mr Tennet use those words or anything like them in the questions which he asked Mr MacDonald. The only "special protection" which I can detect from the evidence is the protection which would be afforded by Mr MacDonald's assurance that he would "push back" on any proposals for further change on his watch. I remind myself (and the reader) at this point that even that assurance must be treated as qualified in that it can only reasonably be considered to apply in the absence of any significant change of circumstance.</p>

I should not, in any case, be taken as accepting that what Mr MacDonald actually did was to fail to keep his word. His undertaking to "push back" cannot be taken, on any view, as an absolute commitment: changed circumstances might justify Mr MacDonald in deciding that he should not "push back" at all. When he gave the commitment, he was not as fully informed as he might have been and he did not appreciate that the Soto changes would not solve a problem (NPPC volatility) different from those which he thought he was addressing (cost and funding). Nonetheless, even a change of circumstance would not have absolved him from arguing strongly the case for no further changes to the UK DB Plans. I would have expected him to say to those with whom he was discussing the future of the UK DB Plans that he had given Mr Lamb and the Trustee certain assurances and his own personal commitment so that at the least Mr Koppl and Mr Loughridge could be given the chance to come up with a solution which ameliorated the proposals eventually imposed on the UK.

His statement that <span style="text-decoration:underline">he</span> would "push back" cannot be taken as casting some obligation on IBM: indeed, quite the reverse is the case because any obligation to push back would only arise when others in IBM were proposing changes which IBM might go on to implement. At most, he was saying that he personally would resist proposals to make any further changes to the DB Plans which might be detrimental to the interests of members; in saying that, he was clearly not giving an undertaking on behalf of IBM that further changes would not be proposed or, even if proposed, implemented, "on my watch" let alone after he had ceased to have any relevant input (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>after leaving IBM's service).</p>

If he perceived it to be essential that further changes should be made, or if he perceived such changes as being the course of action which was in the best interests of IBM, I find it difficult to see how Mr MacDonald could properly make a decision which he did not perceive as being in the best interests of IBM simply because he had given a personal commitment not to "push back".

He could hardly have given his personal commitment if he had thought it was inconsistent with what he was saying on behalf of IBM.

On cost, his summary said there would be a curtailment loss of $60m to I&amp;E, and that the basic savings were projected to be only $5m pa with a "Risk that trustee lowers equity mix costing up to $75m p.a.". Closure to future accrual "Removes future service liability worth 1% of total liabilities p.a.". That percentage might be thought to be of little significance in the overall scheme of a reduction in NPPC.</p>

There was no consideration of changes to investment strategy (nor, indeed, of the consequences of simply doing nothing). They noted the savings of replacing DB accrual with Enhanced M Plan accrual â a modest Â£3m pa â and with ordinary M Plan accrual â about Â£17m pa. They noted that closure could result in an increase in past service liabilities "due to the changes introduced in 2006. Active members would most likely become deferred and would receive RPI revaluation in the period up to retirement (capped at 5% pa) which is expected to be higher than increases of 2/3rds of actual salary growth".</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.66in;margin-right:0.01in">The first slide recognised that "Most (86%) of the dollars of liability [in IBM's DB plans] are attributable tothose who are no longer earning service credit under the DB plans - 70% is attributable to those who have left IBM". Similarly, slide 32 explained that "74% of participants no longer earn service cost but have 86% of liability and drive volatility". The percentages for the UK were different. The slide does not show the percentage of participants who are actives, but it shows a liability for participants no longer earning service of under 70%. Accordingly, Mr Tennet says that by making changes to the accrual of DB benefits in order to address volatility and overall cost, IBM would be placing the burden of volatility on a comparatively small percentage of (active) members. I agree with that as a matter of fact.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.66in;margin-right:0.01in">The first slide also noted that Lazard had said "Essentially when an investor buys IBM he buys an operatingunit and an investment unit". No-one has suggested that that is unrealistic. It showed that Wall Street appreciated the pensions schemes could be capable of generating income for investors: they would expect IBM to achieve returns if that were possible. Certainly, investors would take account of investor presentations so that, if such a presentation projected a contribution from the pension plans of a particular level of contribution to EPS, that would inform an investor's investment decision. Further, as a matter of fact, the size of IBM's pension funds meant that they played a significant role in IBM's performance. As slide 50 showed, IBM's pensions assets were worth 66% of its market value and its pension equity assets were worth 34% of its market value.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.66in;margin-right:0.01in">The importance of IBM's pensions plans overall was well recognised: thus in slide 1, which relates to thethen current state of affairs, one finds this: "The pronounced volatility of the massive liability and related assets has a profound impact on the financial performance of the business". And in slide 2 setting out the November 2008 forecast of retirement related costs: "DB is volatile but contributes income to earnings" in contrast with DC which has "steady cost and cash". Of course, things can change; the DB Plans could not go on producing income for ever but they could be managed in such a way that NPPC was kept to a minimum and EPS was thus maintained and increased.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.66in;margin-right:0.01in">DB accrual would not, at that time, have played a major part in cost volatility. Slide 3 explains: "Each yearservice cost increases the pension liability by 0.8%. Ending service cost would cap the liabilityâ¦ The large liability and supporting assets is the source of pension cost volatility". What the RBs seek to draw from this is that ending DB accrual was not the rational way to address the underlying investment issues. I would not disagree that it could not be seen as the complete solution but I do not understand why it can be said to be irrational to seek to contain every element of cost not least because of the volatility in the cost of funding future DB accrual however small a percentage that may be. Subject to the impact of the statements on which the RBs rely in their case on the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, it seems to me to be a perfectly rational (in contrast with fair) approach to seek to contain pension costs if there is a commercial agenda which dictates that course. Whether a rational approach would also have dictated an entirely different investment strategy is another question; but the need for a different investment strategy, if that need can be demonstrated, does not make irrational a policy of reducing the continuing cost of accrual.</p>

It also considered what the effect of a change in investment strategy, prompted by such measures, would be. The tables prepared show that, adding the I Plan and the Main Plan together, UK NPPC was still projected to be below IBM's service cost until 2012 and would generate a net profit for IBM up to 2012.</p>

Given KPMG's projections about NPPC and service cost, and given the (asserted) view of CHQ about equity recovery, it is submitted that it is hard to see how CHQ could have seen the pensions costs of the UK DB Plans as unsustainable either in the short term or the longer term.

There were only three options: (i) "Mandatory move to DC"; (ii) "Voluntary move via pensionable earnings freeze (+ ER [early retirement] subsidies + DC offered)"; and (iii) "Voluntary move via Total Comp approach (+ ER subsidies + DC offered)". Doing nothing was not an option; indeed, there was considerable pressure with "Design implementation team (20 Jan through 9 Feb) â prepare to launch formal 'Sapporo implementation' 12 Feb (HR, finance, legal, comms etc)".</p>

But whatis relevant to note is that the drive was towards implementation of one of the options (or a combination). The options were not tempered by any consideration of local conditions. In the UK, the drive for pension changes at this stage had nothing to do with the performance of the business of IBM UK or with any need to address IBM UK's own financial position whether in relation to its PTI, PTI margins or otherwise. Instead, according to the RBs, there was a global drive for pensions change targeted on IBM's largest DB schemes, irrespective of the performance of each of the regional businesses, in order to make global savings to meet EPS targets. The only question that remained was what IBM could in fact implement in the UK, taking into account legal and administrative considerations. Although, ultimately, I agree with that assessment, the story so far is not the end of the story and I must continue.</p>

As that opening explains, the chart, using the figures in the presentation of 3 March 2009, plots the projected post-Waltz pension income and expense as a black line (together with actual NPPC for previous years). The light green shading shows the extent to which NPPC was already lower than IBM's Service Cost (with the red shading showing those instances where IBM's Service Cost exceeded NPPC).

He said that one reason for this beneficial treatment was that "this group made a voluntary choice in support of IBM's direction for pension and that their deal was contractually agreed".

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">On 10 March 2009, IBM received from KPMG their paper "Early retirement analysis". This showed, for the firsttime, the real impact of these changes on individual members of the Main Plan. One of the figures it gave was the approximate value of the expected loss (<span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> a capital value) as a percentage of income (with the loss varying significantly by individual depending of age, service, earnings and section of the Plan). Members could lose over twice as much as their annual earnings (in the case of N plan members in the upper quartile) with a minimum of 73% (in the case of C plan members in the lower quartile). This analysis does not appear to have caused CHQ to review the appropriateness of the proposed early retirement changes (although it is not difficult to conclude that it would have not led to any change in the proposals even if CHQ had done so).</p>

Accordingly, how to handle negotiations with the Trustee needed to be addressed. As part of that process, KPMG prepared a presentation on 11 March 2009 sent under cover of an email the following day titled "Waltz â straw man trustee engagement". Mr Tennet submits that the contents of this document provide only an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> rationalisation for the decisions made and not the reasons for those decisions. The real reason for the change was IBM's concern over its NPPC and EPS targets. The paper, however, obscures the real reason and sought to engineer an entirely different perception.

So far as I can see, that did not relate to a board meeting; it related to a suggested leadership team meeting, the composition of the board and the team being different. Thus, the slides which were sent with that email for the leadership meeting were different (although there was some overlap) from the slides forming the presentation of the board meeting.</p>

By concentrating on what he saw as the UK aspects â the business case for change which he saw as the CFO of Holdings - he may have lost sight of what was really (on one view, exclusively) driving the changes (that is the commitment to the 2010 EPS Roadmap and the need to reduce NPPC) and in doing so may have failed to question and challenge the need for CHQ to take the line which it was taking. He may be criticised by the RBs for taking the approach which he did. But in my view, it is not fair to say that his evidence was incredible. As evidence, I think it was true: it shows what Mr Chrystie did and explains why he did it. His reasoning may, to some extent, not stand up to the close scrutiny to which Mr Tennet has subjected it; but that it was genuinely believed by him at the time, I do not doubt.</p>

In the event, and without any further involvement of the board, CHQ (in the person of Mr MacDonald) gave approval to proceed with the "plan to close Waltz" on a conference call on 9 September 2009 which I will come to. This, he submits, shows that the board had no decision-making function in the eyes of CHQ at this time and is a further demonstration that its "decision" at the board meeting on 29 April 2009 was no more than a slavish following of CHQ's directive and not, in reality, the exercise of its decision-making function at all.</p>

In any event, no case is raised by the RBs that the decision on 29 April was invalid or that there was no decision at all binding on Holdings in September.

It is reasonable to think that this reflected the reality that the implementation of the proposals would proceed more smoothly with Trustee agreement; and the fact that IBM had been aware throughout the whole of Project Waltz that, as we have already seen, an adverse reaction to its proposals could give rise to potential problems, for instance in relation to (1) bond allocation and (2) the bringing forward of the next actuarial valuation to 2008.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">IBM says that these risks were carefully addressed and the negotiating strategy was a response to them. MrSimmonds' submission is that IBM's approach anticipated the reality, which was that the Trustee would treat any discussions over Project Waltz as an opportunity for negotiation. Therefore, IBM had given consideration to the strategy that it ought to adopt in relation to these negotiations. It is in the light of those considerations that KPMG's paper (see paragraph 1196 above), which identified in advance of the negotiations the potential concessions that IBM might offer in the course of those negotiations and its ultimate target position, is properly to be viewed. As I have already observed, there is nothing wrong in that provided that IBM does not so mis-state its position as to give rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>(or perhaps some other) duty.</p>

On that day, the Trustee asked under what power IBM proposed re-admitting the affected members (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>those excluded from the C and N Plans) to the M Plan. IBM replied the next day, arguing that the rule permitted IBM to give notice of cessation of membership "for the purposes of the DB Section". It was on that basis that IBM thereafter proceeded. But I have held, under Issue 2, that that is not correct unless the Trustee consents to readmission.</p>

It was not, however, acknowledged that the Project Waltz proposals reflected any need to meet the 2010 EPS Roadmap and the requirement to reduce NPPC or that the cause of the difficulties facing IBM in relation to its DB Plans in the UK had little to do with ongoing DB accrual and a great deal to do with past service liabilities, which I consider to be incontrovertibly established by the evidence. The RBs say that there was also an omission to explain that NPPC was not, in fact, currently rising but was falling, the rise merely being forecast for some time in the future.</p>

At that time, the employer contribution was 8% of pensionable salary and the member contribution was 3%. Under the revised proposal, if a member made an additional 2% contribution (making a total of 5%), the employer would contribute 10%. In addition, IBM proposed deferring the cessation of DB accrual by one year to 6 April 2011. These revisions to the proposals were subject to the Trustee's agreement not to alter the asset allocations of the Plans' investments and not to bring forward the triennial actuarial valuation to 2008 (as had been threatened by the Trustee). The offers were what the RBs describe as the "pre-planned" concessions and which they say were not genuine concessions at all, at least so far as concerned the move to 6 April 2011.</p>

Some of the figures are startling. In their written opening submissions, the RBs record some examples. I do not propose to repeat them but they show capitalised losses in the high Â£100k's (over Â£1m in one case) in respect of pension at expected retirement age of 57 and figures of several Â£100k's at NRD.

A letter from Mr Riley was then circulated to all affected employees. IBM says that the proposals that were announced to the employees included a cessation of DB accrual from 6 April 2010 because the suggestion that this be deferred by a year had not been accepted by the Trustee. That seems to me to be disingenuous when (a) it was not IBM's intention in fact to cease accrual until 2011 and (b) the Trustee had only rejected the 2011 date because the "change" from 2010 to 2011 was offered by IBM only as part of a package which, taken as a whole, was not acceptable to the Trustee.</p>

I have been presentedwith a mass of material which demonstrates, as the RBs put it, bewilderment and outrage. I cannot, of course, say that that sort of reaction was universal but there can be no doubt that it was widespread. There were clearly strong feelings of betrayal, in particular because people made decisions based on what they had been told by Mr Hirst which they took as implied commitments, with members saying that they had been lied to. IBM was in a stronger financial position than in 2006, so why, it was asked, were the changes necessary? Some regarded IBM's behaviour as cynical opportunism. Many expressed themselves as ashamed of IBM and disgusted. In their opening written submissions, the RBs have quoted many responses from angry and disappointed employees. They are representative of the sort of comments which I have heard from the witnesses who actually gave evidence. They do not add to or detract from the strength or otherwise of the case made by the RBs on the evidence, but they do, perhaps, go to confirm the real sense of, to use the word again, betrayal. Very few of the quoted examples, however, actually address precisely what was said in relation to Ocean and Soto at the time but, instead, give an impressionistic response to an unexpected and unwelcome proposal. I must decide this case on the basis of what was actually presented, an analysis which I have already carried out in great detail. <span style="font-weight:bold">Consultation</span></p>

It did not comply with the letter or the spirit of the Consultation Regulations. They say that IBM had been intending since at least 16 March 2009 to close the plans with effect from April 2011 (indeed the only other choice was April 2012 not 2010). The cost implications of 2010 closure had not even been modelled by the time of the meeting on 3 March 2009 when the basic form of the Project Waltz Proposals was agreed with CHQ; modelling had been carried out only for 2011 and 2012.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">The initial response of the employee representatives was one of considerable disappointment. The minutesrecorded that IBM was asked for clarity about who decided that the closure of the Plans should occur in 2011 rather than 2012 or 2013: was this a UK decision or a decision of IBM Corporation (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>of CHQ)? The response minuted was that "it was not financially viable for IBM UK to extend the schemes beyond 2011 or the step down to occur over a greater period than 2 years". From what I have seen, that is a highly misleading answer. It was not that it was not financially viable for <span style="text-decoration:underline">IBM UK</span> to permit that course (save, perhaps, in response to a threat from CHQ that corporate investment in the UK business would suffer); it would have been more accurate to say that it was not financially viable for IBM Corporation to permit IBM UK to take that course and an open and transparent answer would have indicated that this financial viability stemmed from the imperative of keeping to the 2010 EPS Roadmap and producing the required NPPC results. It is interesting, also, to note Mr Ferrar's statement that the employee representatives had made "a significant contribution to the process as a result of feedback and suggestions presented and the modifications constituted a significant financial move for the Corporationâ¦." As to moving the relevant date for ending accrual to 2011, that was simply not correct. And none of these changes were, in cost terms, financially significant to IBM; they cost not a great deal. What was significant was that they allowed IBM to stick to the 2010 EPS Roadmap.</p>

IBM gave its response to the request set out above.The main objectives were stated to be to mitigate the increasing cost and volatility associated with the provision of DB pensions to an increasingly small proportion of its UK workforce. Economic conditions had put tremendous cost pressure on companies operating DB pension plans, in addition to the longer term trend of increasing life expectancy and lower interest rates which continued to increase the costs and risks associated with providing this type of pension plan. IBM declined to give financial information over and above that provided in the first PCC session in the light of its commercially sensitive nature.</p>

IBM was thus confirming the business case to be that which had already been presented to the employee representatives: details had been given of the PTI problem, the scale of DB liability as compared with IBM's competitors and an indication of the pension dynamics over the coming years and what it was doing to IBM's cost base. Mr Riley had presented on a) cost and competitiveness b) risk and size of DB liability and c) the need to lead in the marketplace and move to DC.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">I would comment that, even on IBM's own case, a major driver for the Project Waltz changes was thecommitment to investors in relation to EPS and the need to keep to the 2010 EPS Roadmap. But not a hint of that was given anywhere in the discussions with the Trustee or the PCC employee representatives. Further, funding and life expectancy issues had little, if anything to do, with Holdings' decisions in relation to Project Waltz. The origin of this rationale for the changes, according to Mr Tennet, seems to have come straight from the KPMG "storyboard", a proposition with which I find it hard to disagree. Moreover, in 2006, Holdings had accepted that it was responsible for, and should itself meet, the past service liabilities. It may be the case that the beneficial early retirement factors for which the Plans provided were not immutable, but members would have had good reason for disappointment and surprise to be told that they were being denied access to early retirement at all by the new ER policy. One might have expected IBM to give some sort of explanation for that. Whether this is an appropriate way of dealing with HR relations in the US, which is the culture with which CHQ, Mr Ferrar and Mr Chrystie were imbued, I do not know. I do not find it an attractive or acceptable way to deal with matters in England.</p>

Thisoverview appeared on a single slide which did not reveal the essential elements. It was in vague and general terms which gave no indication of the financial impact for any individuals. Something more was said in the oral presentation. The minutes record IBM as explaining that the new early retirement policy would have significant restrictions on granting favourable early retirement terms with Holdings trying to move away from the perception that employees would be granted favourable early retirement terms in the future. <span style="font-weight:bold">Rectification</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">It was at this time that the concerns which led to the Rectification Action were identified. On 5 October 2009,Tony Ford, a long-serving lawyer in IBM's legal department, sent an email to Mr Ferguson (to remind the reader, he was then IBM UK Holdings Company Secretary), copied to Ms Middleton, Mr Ferrar, Mr Pinder (Chairman of the PCC) and Mr Newman. He wrote to draw attention to what he described as "a fundamental flaw or error in the drafting of one aspect of the rules of the Pensions Deed which gave effect to the C Plan ('the 1983 Definitive Trust Deed &amp; Rules')". He considered that it affected the current consultation process in general, believing it to vitiate the process in respect of a whole class of pension beneficiaries, of whom he was one. His measured, lawyerly, letter made a number of suggestions about how IBM might properly proceed, including pausing the consultation process while it considered the facts, and adjusting any message that it planned to send to pension beneficiaries appropriately. IBM should "modify or delay the issuing of its proposals to affected recipients in the light of this new information".</p>

I am sure that we all agree that it would be morally wrong, and also practically very unwise, to put perhaps over a thousand employees (who by definition have given over a quarter of a century of service to IBM since the inception of the C Plan) under pressure quickly to make a decision affecting their future and their retirement planning, when there is a significant inaccuracy in the underlying original Trust Deed and Rules and therefore in the terms they are offered."</p>

At that time and on the evidence then available â and notwithstanding the subsequent outcome of the Rectification Action â IBM says that it did not consider that the then merely putative rectification claim had a real prospect of success.

The question which IBM clearly asked itself was how that closure could be achieved. It did not stand back and ask itself whether the issue actually had an impact on whether the Project Waltz proposals remained appropriate.</p>

If they receive an offer to retire early from the Company, they have until 11th December to accept it.

Mr Riley used words, in introducing the draft,describing the existing position as one of "entitlement" to early retirement when, in IBM's view, it should not be, but should only be agreed where the business could afford it. The employee representatives wanted this recorded in the minutes but IBM refused to allow this. There is no dispute that Mr Riley actually did say what the employee representatives wanted recorded. I would only comment that I have always thought that minutes of any meeting, whether commercial, trustee, government committee or quango, were meant to be a record of discussions not a document to set out what people wish had been said or to suppress what actually had been said. Be that as it may, internal IBM emails reveal that IBM's position was "we cannot document this verbatim as it backs up their custom &amp; practice argument against ERDFs &amp; one which the Enhanced M plan may still use against IBMâ¦ Even if we could make some reference to 'perceived' automatic entitlement we'd be in a stronger position but documenting the quote as is puts us in a weak position."

Mr Riley toldthe PCC that, although IBM UK had a right to amend its early retirement 'policy' with immediate effect, doing so had not been thought to be "fair" so the window was necessary to give employees an opportunity to retire early before the new ER policy came into effect. The reality is that fairness was not considered: at least, I have seen nothing in the material which suggests that it formed any part of CHQ's thinking. Rather, it was, according to the RBs, part of a strategy being pursued by IBM UK to encourage 700 or more members immediately to leave employment so as to reduce both Holdings' NPPC and its employment costs.

Mr Ferrar recounts in his second witness statement that in the course of that meeting the view was reached that the implementation of Project Waltz should proceed as planned "whilst we conducted a fuller investigation into the 1983 issue". The Trustee reiterated its concerns in a letter dated 14 October 2009 noting in particular that the issue required a "speedy resolution" as it was relevant to the Trustee's consideration of the proposals and to consideration by individual members who may be considering retiring early following IBM's early retirement window.</p>

Notwithstanding those indications, it appears that the final decision had been made on 13 October 2009 as just explained. Further, on 15 October 2009, IBM Corporation announced some results in its third quarterly earnings presentation for 2009. The presentation reported that IBM expected, in the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:15pt">th</span> quarter "a one-time curtailment gain of over $100M due to a change we're making in our non-US plans." As Mr Ferrar explained in his second witness statement, this presentation was originally drafted to "to be even more explicit" by referring to the UK Plans rather than the non-US Plans but Mr Riley objected that UK employees would be annoyed to know that IBM Corporation was making a $100m saving from the Project Waltz proposals. As the RBs remark, indeed they would have been (had they ever been told); and the fact that IBM felt able to include this material in its quarterly presentation demonstrates, they say, the reality that the decision had already been made.

He was keen to stress that the announcement did not affect the outcome of the consultation. By that stage, UK management had decided in principle on the framework of the plan which was to be adopted. Their hands were not forced by the announcement: no further information became available after the announcement (or was likely to do so) and they would have come to the same conclusion whether or not the announcement had been made. Quite so: but the RBs' complaint has nothing to do with the making of the announcement but with the fact that the decision had been made before the consultation had finished and before the earliest time when Mr Riley had previously said it would be made.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Riley's email informing members of the Final Proposals (see paragraph 1309 above) told DB members thatIBM UK would implement its new ER policy with effect from 6 April 2010 which would apply in circumstances where Company consent was required to draw a pension prior to Normal Retirement Age and informed them of the intended early retirement window through which the vast majority of members would be permitted to retire before it came into effect. The next morning, Mr Ferrar told members that to be considered for early retirement through the Early Retirement Window they would have to register their interest via an online registration tool between 21 October and 16 November 2009. This was a period of less than 4 weeks to register their interest, a period which Mr Ferrar regarded as "a reasonable time that gives all people the opportunity to make a decision". The draft of the New ER Policy on the "wiki" told members that consent to early retirement would only be given in "exceptional circumstances". It is to be remembered that retirement during the early retirement window would preserve a benefit calculated on the basis of a 3% ERDF below age 60; in contrast, under the new arrangements, the ERDF would be in the order of 6-8% below NRD. Mr Ferrar might consider under 4 weeks to be a reasonable period; others might disagree with the proposition that a long-serving IBMer should have to make a life-changing decision of this nature â a decision he had not anticipated he would have to make â within that timescale. It seems more likely to my mind that IBM was being driven, again, by the imperative of achieving savings in 2009 rather than by any consideration of what would be a reasonable time within which to require members to make their decision. Sight should not be lost, either, of the fact that by this time IBM knew of the possible error in the 1983 Trust Deed and Rules having received and digested Mr Ford's email. Even at that</p>

The rate would reduce from the 6-7% p.a. then applicable to a lower figure. It was therefore important that, when communicating the imposition of the new ER policy, IBM should not mislead members by an implicit threat of discount factors as high as 7% but should explain that the figure would be lower â and why. This point was never made by IBM in its communication with members, whether in written communications or at the various roadshows which were held to explain Project Waltz where ERDFs of 6%, and sometimes 6-8%, were suggested. It seems to me that this point could have been an important one to some members in making their decisions.</p>

IBM can have been left in no doubt that the rectification claim had real merit. Nor can it have been left in any doubt that the Trustee, at least, regarded the actual communication exercise as defective in failing to put across to members the message which IBM itself was intending to put across. In particular, Mr Newman noted, in an email dated 12 November, that in his view a significant number of members simply did not understand precisely and completely what IBM was attempting to achieve: in particular, they were making decisions on the basis that by not signifying their agreement they were only foregoing pensionable increases for the period up to April 2011 and that "for many of them they may conclude that this is a risk well worth taking in the current low inflation/low ESP plan environment". The Trustee's legal advice was communicated to IBM by Nabarro on 13 November. Concern was again expressed that members might request early retirement during the window "in the erroneous belief that, if they do not opt for early retirement at this stage, they may not be able to retire until age 63â¦.". IBM was asked to delay closure of the Early Retirement Window until these issues had been resolved, but it did not do so.</p>

IBM sent a further email on this aspect on 9 December 2009, 2 days before the deadline for accepting any offer of early retirement through the Early Retirement Window. The concession would apply not only to those who transferred from N Plan but also to those who joined C Plan at its inception on 6 July 1983. Whether this was clarification, as the email stated, or whether it was an extension of the class, as the RBs now contend, does not much matter for the point in hand, namely that this group of people would have been uncertain about their position and would have received the clarification very late indeed in the day. As Mr Tennet puts it, these members were given 2 days in which "to change the life-changing decision with which they had been struggling". IBM has no answer to that which I find satisfactory.</p>

For my part, I do not think that there is necessarily an inconsistency between IBM's asserted business justification and the RBs identification of the reasons, or motives, for the Waltz changes. At this point, I turn to IBM's case, making some observations as I go along. I will then consider the RBs' criticism of the business case (so far as not already dealt with) together with IBM's riposte.</p>

The answer to these problems was UKI Transformation under which it was sought to transform the UK business to increase its profit margin (and, hence, its contribution to the earnings of the global business) from 23% to 34% by the end of 2012. The Project Waltz changes served to assist in meeting the objectives of this project.

Dealing with that point first to get it out of the way, there was evidence from IBM that it wished to see greater parity between various groups of employees but that, as I perceive it, was because of IBM's philosophical preference for DC rather than DB provision. There was also some evidence about concern on the part of DC members that they were being penalised for a benefit accruing only to DB members. This evidence was, however, rather speculative and consisted of (i) a report (by email dated 31 August 2005) to Mr Heath by Mr Gavin Wilson of "the argument that I'm hearing on the street" and (ii) Mr Ferrar's evidence that he had a perception that there was dissatisfaction. Mr Gavin' Wilsons's email was forwarded to Mr Stephen Wilson by Mr Heath with the comment "The oher [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] side of the coin". On the other side, Mr Newton, a member of the M Plan, said in his witness statement that he was not aware of any ill-feeling amongst his fellow DC members. In cross-examination, it turned out that he worked with a maximum of 25 members of the M Plan. In the light of the limited evidence each way, it can only be a matter of speculation whether or not the DC members were or were not resentful of the benefits accruing to DB members. I do not accept that concern about the disparity as a cause of dissatisfaction formed any part of IBM's thinking. I do, however, accept that a concern for parity did</p>

He states in his witness statement that one of the reasons for the proposed changes was that, if nothing was done, future increases in NPPC were likely to have a significant impact on the business, leaving the details to be dealt with by Mr Chrystie and Mr Koppl in their evidence. It is not entirely clear from that evidence how much Mr Riley himself knew at the time about future increases in NPPC and Mr Koppl's projections although as his oral testimony made clear he did, by then at least, appreciate that pension costs were being looked at as a way of seeking to ensure that the 2010 EPS Roadmap was kept on track. He also said that he appreciated that NPPC was an important part of what he understood to be the driver. In this context, there was an interesting interchange with Mr Stallworthy in the context of questions being asked about the selection of six countries (including the UK) as warranting particular attention in delivering NPPC savings:</p>

Thus in preparing for his presentations of matters to the board of Holdings on 29 April 2009 and later to the Trustee, he described his task as building the cohesive document to present to the board and the Trustee.

Other commitments could not, however, be ignored. IBM would not, for instance, have been able simply to ignore its contractual commitments. Thus if it had had in place contractual bonus schemes, it would have had to meet its contractual obligations or, if it chose, or was forced, to breach those obligations it would have to suffer the consequences in terms of damages claims. Similarly, if IBM had made statements which, contrary to its position on the facts of the present case, gave rise to Reasonable Expectations, then IBM would need to show that the commercial imperative of meeting the 2010 EPS Roadmap enabled it (on the unitary approach which I have adopted) to override those expectations and that doing so would not, objectively, destroy or seriously undermine the relationship of trust and confidence which lies at the root of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty; or (on the two-pronged approach) that it was justified in acting contrary to those expectations.

IBM itself described this effect as a "perfect storm": see a note prepared by Ms Roin (Director of Pension Benefits, CHQ) on 30 June 2005. The effects of market falls in 2008 were not compounded by falling discount rates in a similar way.</p>

Rather than being either unexpected or unprecedented, a significant fall in asset values at some point would have been reasonably foreseen by IBM in adopting a strategy heavily weighted to equities.</p>

Whether the causes of the 2000 â 2002 crash and the 2008 crash had much, if anything, in common would be a matter for expert evidence of a nature I have not received and so I cannot make any assessment of the relevance of that part of the submission. As to the other part of the submission, it may be a fact of life that a crash occurs from time to time in an investment cycle, although markets and regulators attempt to avoid such occurrences. But to say that this particular crash, with its particular severity and unpredictable consequences, was foreseeable strikes me as a rather startling proposition. It should not be forgotten that there were real fears about a collapse of the international banking system and concerns that market falls might continue, far outstripping the actual falls which were seen. I do not believe that anyone would have regarded this sort of crash as predictable except, perhaps, in the sense that disasters of this sort might be expected to occur very rarely â Watson Wyatt's 160 year event.</p>

It is an absurd proposition to say that by making a premature, and (assume for the sake of argument) invalid, decision in August 2008, IBM is precluded from making another decision in October 2008.</p>

As to that, I accept Mr Koppl's testimony that, in 2008, people thought that the financial crisis was going to deepen, and it was only in retrospect that the collapse of Lehman Brothers represented the darkest hour of the crisis. The FTSE reached its lowest point in February 2009 (33% down on its 2008 high) and [Main Plan]asset returns for 2009 were still negative until June 2009 (facts which I do not think are challenged and which I take respectively from a slide prepared by KPMG for a presentation on 16 April 2009 and from an IBM Retirement Cost Forecast for 10 July 2009, presumably prepared by Mr Koppl).</p>

I agree with Mr Simmonds' analysis that the facts demonstrate that the commitment to the 2010 EPS Roadmap was an entirely rational reason for the Project Waltz changes: it made perfect sense on the financial data available to IBM, as the savings made from the pension changes flowed into reductions in the NPPC, which in turn assisted in achieving the ultimate EPS target. But that is from the perspective of IBM Corporation. It is a different question whether Holdings could properly have implemented the Project Waltz changes given the Reasonable Expectations which have been established. Accordingly, the rationality of the commercial decision by IBM Corporation is not the end of the matter as Mr Simmonds submits that it is.</p>

I will be coming to the local strand in a moment. As to that, he submits that, although the evidence for the local strand is compelling, the Project Waltz changes would have been perfectly justified even if the global strand were the sole reason for the changes.

That those were the objectives, I do not doubt, although whether the need to improve current and future profitability locally has anything to do with Project Waltz is a different matter. The RBs have suggested that there was no evidence that the achievement of the 2010 EPS target depended on Holdings increasing its PTI <span style="text-decoration:underline">margin</span> (in contrast with its absolute levels). But the 2010 EPS Roadmap clearly did seek a contribution to EPS increases through margin improvement. And Mr Chrystie, in his evidence, explained how margin expansion could be achieved.

I have mentioned the TMM on 8 May2008 (see paragraph 1089 above) and the presentation by Mr Wilson about NPPC. For present purposes, the relevance is that reference is made in the minutes to NPPC having been cited by Holdings in 2006 as part of the reason for the Soto changes. Mr Simmonds cross-examined Mr Lamb about this and submits that Mr Lamb's approach at the TMM was consistent only with an understanding on his part that it was an option open to Holdings to make further changes if NPPC proved to be a problem: otherwise, he, Mr Lamb, would not have said at the TMM what he did. That is not fair to Mr Lamb who has consistently acknowledged that a significant change in circumstances might mean that there was a need to revisit the DB Plans; but he was adamant that a single year's poor NPPC figures would not justify Holdings doing so. I accept that what Mr Lamb said is confirmation â which is not needed in any case in the light of the way in which the RBs put their case â that Holdings was giving no guarantees about the future. But nothing which Mr Lamb said leads me to a different conclusion about the Reasonable Expectations which I have decided are established; indeed, this evidence was taken account of by me in reaching my conclusions. <span style="font-weight:bold">The local strand</span></p>

They were subjected to cross-examination on this aspect of their evidence and on UKI Transformation generally. Although the RBs did not, and do not accept, that the UK business case had anything to do with the decisions to plan and implement Project Waltz but had everything to do with an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> rationalisation of the decision made for the sole purpose of meeting EPS targets, I am satisfied that Mr Riley was entirely sincere in his perception of the need for UKI Transformation and in embarking on that voyage of change. After all, the transformation programme (or should it be program?) got under way before Mr Riley had been told about Project Waltz; and the fact that PTI (carrying with it in practice the imperative of NPPC savings and meeting EPS targets) came to dominate the thinking of UK management does not mean that UKI Transformation became nothing more than a fig-leaf justification for Project Waltz in the UK.</p>

He was pushed very hard by Mr Tennet to accept that his only concern was to deliver on the pensions savings and that the rest â the development of the business justification â was no more than an exercise in advocacy. He did not accept that. Mr Tennet had extracted from Mr MacDonald an acceptance (I will need to say something more about that later) of the proposition that the work-plan described in the presentation to him on 3 March 2009 was an exercise in advocacy and he attempted, without success, to get Mr Chrystie to agree with that.

This appears from one of the slides prepared for the presentation to the board of Holdings on 29 April 2009 (see paragraphs 1210 and 1211 above). There was no challenge to the comment on the slide that PTI growth was not in line with annual growth objectives; indeed Mr Wilson accepted that. Further, the PTI growth target for 2006 had not been met: only 93% of the profit plan was achieved. The CHQ model of 10%-12% annual PTI growth had formed part of the May 2007 roadmap presentation to investors. Holdings had serious issues with a number of its large services contracts, and urgent action was required to make its costs structures competitive. That is not to say that the UKI business had not been growing revenue successfully and slightly ahead of the other mature markets: in cross-examination, Mr Riley reiterated that there had been very positive signs of growth in the UKI business. However, the senior executives of IBM believed that IBM UK could be doing much better; the UK market generated more incremental market opportunity at this time than any other market in the world with the exception of the USA. As Mr Chrystie said in cross-examination, the definition of success in IBM is:</p>

This presentation was made to make out the case of "Changing our Pensions Strategy". The particular slide referred to demonstrates "UKI Performance vs Rest of World" taking account of the impact of DB costs (or perhaps more accurately, a failure of the DB Plans to deliver anticipated profits). Unless I have missed something, none of the slides in this presentation indicates relative performance of the underlying businesses of UKI and other regions. This presentation, at least, does not show a need for any significant changes to other aspects of the UK business in relation to which, as an earlier slide notes, "UKI revenue performance has been in line with business model". I do not understand, therefore, why it is said on the basis of this slide, or indeed the whole presentation, the UK business was not performing well other than as a restatement of the proposition that NPPC costs had to be reduced if the Plans were to deliver the necessary contribution to the EPS target.</p>

There can, I think, be no doubt about that last proposition; indeed the RBs rely on it in the sense that they say the objective of CHQ was NPPC reduction and meeting EPS targets. The threats to CHQ investment were they say not driven by operational issues and profits derived from the core business but were driven by that objective alone. The equation was simple: "Insufficient contribution to NPPC cost = No investment". CHQ saw that contribution as being boosted by the Project Waltz proposals.</p>

Thus, in his 29 April 2009 presentation to the UK board, Mr Chrystie raised the prospect of needing to consider unpaid leave or reduced working patterns for employees if UK profitability could not be improved. A slide to which Mr Simmonds refers asks "What are the implications if we do not make this change?", the change referred to being a change to the DB Plans. In other words, the prospect to which Mr Chrystie was referring would be eliminated if actions were taken in relation to DB pensions. But that does not detract, I consider, from the fact that the main driver for change was the need to reduce NPPC. And the same goes for the salary freeze.</p>

This could make a big difference in getting the DB projects done." That is a clear demonstration, to my mind, that the salary restrictions for 2009 to which Mr Simmonds refers were themselves driven by concerns about DB costs and designed to put pressure on UK management (and the management of other countries with DB schemes). That decision reflects, to my mind, the same view of the DB Plans by Mr MacDonald as that held by Ms Salinaro and expressed in her email dated 30 August 2005 (see paragraph 760 above).</p>

Mr Simmonds has referred to a part of Mr Chrystie's cross-examination on this point. He described Mr Tennet as being reduced to secondguessing the market analysis of IBM globally and the business analysis of one of its senior executives, <span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> Mr Chrystie. I do not think that that is wholly fair since Mr Chrystie and Mr Tennet were not on quite the same territory. Mr Tennet was trying to get Mr Chrystie to accept that he had not carried out an appropriate analysis of the profitability of IBM UK's businesses and that there was a prospect for growth. Mr Chrystie's point was that there was no prospect for growth which would provide enough profit to meet CHQ's requirements. Thus it may be that some PTI growth could be fuelled by revenue growth but not to the extent of satisfying CHQ. Mr Chrystie's position can be seen in this interchange in which he was addressing one of the slides ("IBM Global Market View â UKI") for the presentation to the board which I have just mentioned. The slide states "GMV suggests that business environment will be challenged at least through 2010" putting additional pressure on the ability to sustain top line performance and reinforcing the need to focus on productivity. The interchange was this:</p>

The way I looked at that is that would have been -- that would have had me solving, not a $700 million problem, that would have had me solving up to a $1 billion problem. The way I approached this was it was necessary to make those changes to the pension plans to help neutralise the effect of the growing year over year NPPC to allow us to go drill into 20 plus other things that we had to do to improve business performance. That was my thought process." [By "headwind" he meant, in effect, the impact of the year on year increase in NPPC cost on the improvement expected by CHQ in profitability performance.]</p>

He could not achieve that through revenue growth and had to find it through cutting costs. Nothing in any of the presentations demonstrates how a significant part of the growth in PTI was going to come from cutting costs (other than NPPC costs) to produce a leaner business.

IBM was faced with the pensionsheadwind which Mr Chrystie described (see paragraph 1361 above). The economic crisis beginning in 2008 had a massive adverse impact on the value of pension plan assets and the effects of this were yet to be felt because of the way pension costs were accounted for under US GAAP. They would be felt in coming years, however, and this would add significantly to the challenges which the UK business faced and would directly affect its ability to achieve its objectives. I am satisfied that Mr Chrystie did believe that there would be this headwind, relying on the materials with which he had been provided by CHQ, and that he saw it as a problem both globally and in the UK. The relevant material, in turn, is to be found in the modelling for this problem, produced by Mr Koppl and his team.

In his second witness statement, Mr Riley gave a detailed account of the transformation programme both before and after its launch as UKI Transformation. He said in his second witness statement that pension costs were always an obvious target for scrutiny and from the outset of the UKI Transformation program, he knew that they were a difficult issue and that they would need to be looked at. IBM accepts that Project Waltz was not initially part of the UKI Transformation process. Thus, in cross-examination, Mr Riley admitted that pensions were not a major element of UKI Transformation at the beginning of the exercise and in mid-2008, but that pensions became more prominent later in 2008 and before the launch of UKI Transformation in 2009.</p>

He was aware of caution on the part of Mr Wilson in initiating further changes to pensions whom he thought felt that the Project Soto changes were such that any further changes should be resisted. Mr Riley's own view was that the severity of the situation meant that all options for potential cost savings had to be looked at. I accept that evidence of what Mr Riley believed.</p>

I accept that all of them did believe in that case. But that is because they accepted the need to meet the targets which were being imposed on them. I do not accept that they believed there would have been a business case for these changes if they had been looking only at Holdings' business and its operational costs including pension costs impacting on its own, UK, profit rather than on IBM Corporation's NPPC line in its accounts. Indeed, I doubt that they ever considered matters from that perspective since CHQ had in fact imposed targets which made consideration of such a scenario irrelevant. Mr Wilson had, of course, considered that scenario and was unable to detect any business case from that perspective.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">I did not understand what he said and queried why the second motivation was not simply part of the first; towhich Mr Chrystie replied that it was, for the reason explained in paragraph 1362 above. I can understand that a business case for improvements in operational efficiency and matters of that sort within the UK can be described as a local case; there is always a case for such improvements quite apart from the demands of CHQ for such improvements to be made to increase local profitability. I can also understand the business case for Holdings to make changes to the DB Plans when CHQ demands it; and in that context, it must be remembered that CHQ was not simply demanding an increase in operating profit, it was demanding a contribution to PTI improvement and to NPPC which could only be achieved by making changes to the DB Plans. The reason, I would suggest the only reason, why UK management went along with CHQ's plan was because it saw no alternative. It must be questionable, to say the least, whether UKI Transformation by itself would have resulted in the sort of changes imposed by Project Waltz if CHQ had not been insisting on the contribution from Holdings to NPPC. I can, again, see that the case for improving operating profitability can be described as "local" but if one adds the word "strand" to that, the question immediately arises: "local strand of what?". It is difficult to see how the need to address operational matters, even if that is in order to help meet the EPS target, can be said to be a strand of any sort in relation to pension changes. And it is difficult to see how a purely local strand of pensions would take account of NPPC implications for IBM Corporation.</p>

Adopting the test in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty which I have explained, the question would be whether making changes to the terms of pension provision would be within the range of decisions which a reasonable employer could take. In this example, if IBM sought to close the Plans or change the ER policy on the basis that it needed to do so in order to achieve savings required to meet its commitment to investors, a close examination would be required of precisely what it had committed to investors and whether, in the light of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, it could properly have committed to what it did commit.

He regarded it as "a commitment to investors". This can be compared with his approach to what was said to the Trustee and the members at the time of Ocean and Soto where he saw no commitment at all, notwithstanding the actual use of the word "commitment" (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>"this series of initiatives demonstrates IBM's commitment to underpin the sustainability of the defined benefit plans in the UK": see the Webcast).</p>

Just as the severe financial conditions of 2008 led to the need, in IBM's eyes, to change the terms of the DB Plans, so too one might have thought that they would have led to a revision of the 2010 EPS Roadmap. But Mr Simmonds submits that the way in which IBM in fact responded was a reasonable business decision: it was one which IBM and Holdings could reasonably take and it is neither here nor there that a different decision might have been made by different decision makers. That is a submission which I deal with in detail later.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.46in;margin-right:0.01in">As to paragraph iii), I do not think that it is correct to say that IBM treated the forecast as a promise. It did, ofcourse, regard it as a very important statement. IBM's business, commercial, decision was that the target should be adhered to; that was a matter of judgment for CHQ/Holdings. It is not suggested by the RBs (subject to one point I will mention in a moment) that the decision was taken in bad faith. The decision may or may not have amounted to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty. But it does not assist, in my judgement, in assessing whether there was such a breach of duty to argue that IBM treated the commitment to investors as a promise and that therefore inevitably changes to the DB Plans would follow. The issue is not whether IBM treated it as a promise but whether making the choice in the way it did was a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, because it went against the Reasonable Expectations of members and because no reasonable employer could have acted in the way in which Holdings did.</p>

He says that the Project Waltz changes were not driven by a concern that the DB Plans had become too expensive; rather they were driven by a concern that the Plans should produce (greater) profits in order to reduce NPPC, with the profit being used to meet future DB Service Cost and to subsidise future DC cost. One might expect, he suggests, that the ongoing cost of the DB Plans should approximate to the Service Cost. Instead, IBM was using the DB Plans as an instrument to achieve EPS targets and in doing so was expecting members to pay to achieve that objective. And, as Mr MacDonald acknowledged, the annual costs of pension accrual were effectively the annual cost of employing staff; an employer could not expect to employ people for nothing.</p>

The suggestion that comes through is that somehow Service Cost and NPPC ought to stand in a relationship to each other whereby NPPC should not be lower than service cost and that IBM Corporation should therefore expect, and plan on the basis that the NPPC line in its accounts should not be less than Service Cost. On that basis Mr Tennet makes submissions which effectively come to this: it is offensive that actions should be taken in relation to the Plans to reduce the amount of an accounting concept (NPPC) to produce a profit when the real cost of the Plans to IBM was the Service Cost: it is wrong that an accounting profit should be used to reduce the payment which one might expect to be made to meet the actual cost.</p>

That is the reality of US GAAP principles. If it is proper to arrange the business in perfectly legal ways in order to improve EPS (which it is) there is nothing objectionable in principle in attempting to reduce NPPC even if that means that the cost in any particular year of supporting the DB Plans is less than the Service Cost.</p>

By making the Waltz Changes, IBM effectively put the interests of its investors ahead of its members. On that logic any changes to employee compensation could be made, simply because IBM wanted to return a greater profit to investors. The point depends critically on the existence of a competition between competing expressed commitments. If the RBs are unable to establish any Reasonable Expectations engendered by IBM, there is no competition.</p>

If marketperformance was good, IBM (and thus the investors) stood to gain, with NPPC falling (or rising less fast than would otherwise be the case) and the required money contributions to the DB Plans being reduced. In contrast, a poor market performance would lead, as it did under Project Waltz, to changes detrimental to the members in order to keep the 2010 EPS Roadmap on route. This is true susbstituting "might" for "would". But it is true of any attempt to stick to a target, whether it is a commitment to a third party or not.

There is no evidential basis for the assertion that bonuses would be retained. But even assuming they would be maintained, there is no evidence at all to suggest that any senior executive involved in the decisionmaking process gave any weight at all to his or her personal position. These points were not put to IBM's witnesses in cross-examination. At the end of Mr Riley's oral evidence, he was asked by me whether he or any other of the senior executives had a financial interest in the outcome of Project Waltz. His response indicated that there was no direct interest relating to Project Waltz; his only interest was in a long-term incentive scheme based on overall improvements in the performance of IBM Corporation. I reject Mr Tennet's suggestions and whatever it might have been justifiable to speculate before the hearing, I do not consider that this suggestion should have been maintained in closing submissions.</p>

He submits that the Main Plan has in fact done spectacularly well if a long-term view is taken. I agree with him that the evidence shows that, from 2009, NPPC was set to rise, but the likelihood is that it would fall again in due course. This is because, following market falls, the expected return on equities in the future takes account of those large falls: it is then expected that in later years there will be significant (positive) out-performance of EROA, which, together with the previous falls, would provide an overall return broadly in line with EROA. Mr Tennet's proposition is that, by taking 2010 as an arbitrary target date for pensions returns, IBM was effectively shutting its eyes to the natural rise and fall of pensions costs, and it was making itself susceptible to short term movements, when it had adopted an investment strategy that needed to be viewed in the long term. As Mr Clare said "â¦.what can be positive over the long term can be negative over the short term and it is important that all these factors are taken into account when setting and monitoring investment strategy."</p>

The fact of the matter is that IBM's management did what it did. That may or may not be seen as unfair or unreasonable by the RBs. It may or may not have been what they would have done if they had found themselves (or, indeed, what the Court would have done if it had found itself) in the position of a senior IBM executive at the relevant time. So it may be true, as the RBs assert, that IBM put the interests of its investors ahead of those of the members of the Plans. But that was the business decision that was reached and it is not part of the court's function when considering the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty to second-guess that decision.

The savings contributed from retirement plans was in the event only $0.55, with the result that the EPS target was met only by achieving additional contributions from other areas of the business. Thus, in terms of the 2010 EPS Roadmap forecast, the pain was shared. I do not know the source of the figures. If the source was identified during the hearing, I have been unable to track it down.

But since there is a competition between competing commitments, then IBM's decision must at least take full account of the competition. By that I mean that IBM had to recognise that the members did indeed have legal rights arising from their Reasonable Expectations as a result of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty owed to them, and not simply to recognise that members would be disappointed, angry, feel betrayed â choose whatever words or phrases you will.

If performance had tumbled, it might be arguable that there was a business need to recover. However, since 2006, UK performance had in fact improved slightly, and pensions were contributing to the UK's PTI.

Mr Chrystie's analysis did not reflect the Measurement Adjustment; perhaps this was, to use his own words, because he "did not understand<span style="font-style:italic">"</span> it.

The RBs have addressed this aspect of "headwinds" in their written closing under three headings: (i) What long term projections did IBM actually rely on?

So far as the evidence discloses, the projections on which IBM relied were those prepared by KPMG which went only as far as 2013. These were the projections on which the presentations on 3 March 2009 and 23 March 2009 (see paragraphs 1190<span style="font-style:italic">ff </span>and 1199<span style="font-style:italic">ff </span>above) were prepared and delivered. The point is made that NPPC would exceed Service Cost in 2013 by only Â£100m which, in context, is not a huge sum of money and is described by Mr Tennet as "scarcely disastrous". Moreover, for 2008 to 2011, NPPC was projected to total Â£17m with a Service Cost of Â£214m. And for the whole period 2008 to 2013, NPPC was projected to be Â£256m, and IBM's Service Cost was to be Â£310m. Thus, over the whole of that period, IBM would, on those projections, still not have to pay the full operational costs of DB accrual. I do not understand those figures to be challenged.</p>

That, if I may say so, seems to me to be no more than an assertion of the result for which he contends. It may be that other managers in CHQ and Holdings would have considered that NPPC was within acceptable levels (whatever those words may mean). But that does not mean that even those managers would consider that anyone who disagreed with them was irrational. There is, I think, no absolute level of what is or is not rationally acceptable: it all depends on the facts. In any case, the question is not what any rational employer may consider to be within acceptable levels; the question is whether the decision which IBM actually made fell outside what a reasonable employer could properly decide.</p>

This it seems to me, lends support to the view, favourable to IBM, that the members' Reasonable Expectations could not be projected into the long-term.</p>

In my view they all suffer from the same flaws in that they fail to address the fact that any changes which did turn out to be necessary could not have retrospective effect. The first point to make is that, if markets did not recover or deteriorated so that the changes had to be made at the end of the "wait and see" period, benefits would have had to be provided in the interim on the current basis. Perhaps not much turns on that point because the absolute sums involved would be likely to be small in the context of the Plans' liabilities. The second point is that whatever may have happened, IBM needed to book the savings in 2009. If Project Waltz was justified at all, it was justified in 2009.</p>

It is said that it was always within IBM's power to take the measures it did to cut costs. This could have been timed for 2012 just as easily as 2009, and so fas as headwinds were concerned, 2012 would have been the more obvious time.

That would be one fair approach, but that is not where Mr Koppl and CHQ were coming from. Mr Koppl was focusing on projections to deliver the required savings from the DB Plans and was not concerned with whether the different Plans should have been treated differently. There is, accordingly, less force in the point which Mr Tennet makes, but it is not without merit and it is certainly to be brought into account in assessing the validity of Project Waltz in relation to the I Plan.

That is certainly one of the RBs' criticisms, but it is an equally important criticism that the alleged business case had no firm foundation. With no business justification, there was no reason to disappoint the Reasonable Expectations which the members were entitled to have, the extent of which I have already decided.

If the answer to that question is yes, it is irrelevant whether the detailed analysis to build up the UK business reasons for the changes was actually done after the decision in principle was taken. I do not think that that is quite the right question. The question is whether the conduct of Holdings in deciding to make the Project Waltz proposals and then implementing the proposals gave rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.

Suppose that the changes were then challenged but that Holdings was then able to formulate a UK business case which would have justified the proposals had it been articulated before the decision had been made and the proposals implemented. In order to succeed in their challenge, the RBs would then have to establish conduct on the part of Holdings contrary to the members' Reasonable Expectations. The conduct relied on â the decision to make the proposals and their implementation â is either such as to destroy or seriously undermine the relationship of trust and confidence or it is not. On one view, the answer to the question whether the conduct is that serious cannot depend on whether Holdings might subsequently be able to formulate a justification for the changes which it had not previously thought of. On another view, an assessment of the seriousness of the conduct can only be made in the light of the subsequent justification: members may have a justifiable complaint that Holdings had made a decision which was not justified by what it did know, but that is not enough, of itself, to give rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

Part of the enquiry into the appropriate remedy would be what detriment the members have suffered as the result of the implementation of changes which, on the hypothesis under consideration, could have been justified when they were made. Assuming, without deciding, that it is in principle possible to award damages or equitable compensation for breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, the result might be only a nominal award.</p>

This is because,before the time when the final decision to make the changes was made (by Mr MacDonald in September 2009) and thus before the consultation had been concluded and before any changes were implemented, the UK business case, such as it was, had been formulated. Until that time, IBM could have withdrawn the proposals or have confirmed its decision by a further express resolution. It did not do so but I see no reason in principle why it should not be entitled to rely on the business case which it had developed by then as justification for proceeding. Further, even if the decision in principle on 4 February 2009 (not communicated to members) to make the Project Waltz changes had given rise to a breach of some duty, it is not easy to see how the members would have suffered any detriment and thus why that breach should carry any substantive remedy. I accept, of course, that the position might be different â and this particular reasoning would not apply â if the UK business case had not been addressed until after this litigation had started.</p>

Without any sense of irony, IBM says that, were it not for the absence of Mr Wilson's involvement, the business case would have been prepared earlier and would not have had to await the appointment of Mr Chrystie. It is suggested that it is clear from the slides and the notes of the meetings in November 2008 that the intention was that the UK business case would be developed in parallel with the global strand, before any firm decisions had been taken on the Project Waltz changes. If one replaces "firm" with "formal", I would agree. But the reality is that by this time CHQ had developed its thinking to such an extent that there was no realistic prospect of it or Holdings concluding other than that the worldwide DB changes should be made. The CFO's job was to find the reasons for going to the chosen destination not to challenge the direction of travel. If Mr Wilson would not do it, then someone else would have to take on the role. Mr Chrystie took on the role but only in April 2009; IBM accepts that this meant that there was no detailed analysis of that</p>

Those targets themselves could only be met in practice by making the proposed changes to the DB Plans; there was no way in which the other matters addressed in UKI Transformation could, by themselves, have produced the necessary contribution to PTI. In contrast, what Mr Wilson meant by a business justification was one which did not depend on meeting the increases in NPPC which IBM was facing. If NPPC was taken out of the equation, he was unable to see a business case to justify the pension changes under Project Waltz, and that was why he found it difficult to have been tasked with the creation of a business justification for the options being considered.

He saw meeting those targets as his objective; the Project Waltz changes were the appropriate way of meeting those targets (and realistically, I would add, there was no way in which the targets could have been met without serious changes to the DB Plans). He did, however, see the pensions aspect of the local strand as effectively part of the global plan.</p>

What I have recorded in my witness statement is that, at that time, in that meeting, I was having difficulty coming up with a reason that I found intellectually satisfying as a justification.

I did not come to a point of being able to clearly see a rationale that did not just go back to the fact that we had an NPPC problem that was going to come at us because of the falling financial markets.

The only different outcome arises if the policy had been adopted during the "sweet spot" for switching in 2007. I agree with the way it is put in IBM's written closing submissions (see at paragraph 288) and by Mr Legge in his closing oral submissions: the modelling shows that the high levels of NPPC cannot properly be attributed to IBM's preferred asset allocation and that the true reasons for there being a high NPPC after the date of the asset falls was because there had not been a switch at the critical time in 2007.</p>

The contractual duty can be expressed differently: an employer must treat his employees fairly in his conduct of his business, and in his treatment of his employees, an employer must act responsibly and in good faith; he must act with due regard to trust and confidence (or fairness): see paragraph 407 above. But as I have explained, to confound a Reasonable Expectation may, on the facts, be something that no reasonable employer would do in the way that is has been done. There may, accordingly, be no significant difference in the application of the two different tests to a particular set of closely related facts.</p>

So far as the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements are concerned, it seems to me that the focus ought to be on the contractual duty. Those Agreements do not involve any exercise by Holdings of its powers under the DB Plans. Indeed the Agreements, if effective, are as relevant to hybrid deferred members as they are to members remaining (until exercise of the Exclusion Power in 2011) in the DB Plans: hybrid deferred status conferred a final salary link in respect of the earlier period of service during which the member was accruing benefits under the DB Plans. Although the Agreements relate to pensions, they are nonetheless purely contractual arrangements between Holdings and the members concerned; the entering into of those Agreements could not, it seems to me, engage the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty rather than the contractual duty as a matter of employment law.</p>

Enhanced M Plan members would also be subject to (iii). In relation to (ii), this was focused as a result of the limitation just mentioned, on 2009 to 2011.

It is right, in my view and as Mr Tennet submits, to view the changes as a whole in addressing the issue of a breach of duty. Indeed one of his submissions is that the severity of the changes taken as a whole is a factor demonstrating a breach of duty. Having said that, the individual elements of the changes must be considered separately. That is for two, related reasons. The first is that one or more of the individual elements may of themselves give rise to a breach of duty. It is important to know whether that is so. The second is that it is important, when it comes to considering any remedy, to know what Holdings could properly have done to avoid a breach of duty if it has committed one, and in that context it is important to know what, if any, individual element would have given rise to a breach of duty taken by itself. I will say a little about remedies later, but that whole aspect of the case is raised by issues which were not dealt with at the trial and which can only be properly addressed once my decision in principle is known.</p>

It is unrealistic to separate these Agreements from the other elements of Project Waltz and to suggest that, because members made their own decision to sign the Agreement, there can be no breach of duty. The 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements have been described as "no-brainers" both by IBM and by some of the RBs' representatives. It was, of course, a "no-brainer" in the sense that a non-pensionable pay increase was better than no pay increase at all.

This is the scenariodescribed in paragraph 1012 above, applying IBM's approach to the way in which Holdings was entitled to take into account the targets set by CHQ. On that approach, the global strand starts with the position that IBM Corporation/CHQ's decision and conduct in deciding to put forward and promote the Project Waltz changes was not constrained in any way by any Reasonable Expectations. And in assessing whether Holdings itself is in breach of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, the question is whether, given that the changes were required by CHQ, Holdings would be acting perversely and irrationally (in the sense which I have described) by agreeing to the changes (to which IBM says, of course, that the answer is obviously that Holdings would not be acting in that way) notwithstanding that the changes would disappoint the RBs' Reasonable Expectations. In my judgement, it cannot be said that Holdings would have been acting perversely or irrationally in those circumstances. Given that UK management, and in particular Mr Wilson, Mr Heath and Mr Hirst were all acting in good faith and believing what they said in promulgating the Ocean and Soto communications, it is not possible, on the approach now under consideration, to say that Holdings itself was acting other than in good faith and in the belief that the communications were true. Accordingly, when new targets were set by CHQ, even if those targets were set in order to remain on the course of the 2010 EPS Roadmap, it cannot be said that the adoption of the Project Waltz changes by Holdings was a course which no reasonable employer would have taken. Project Waltz would not, therefore, have given rise to any breach of duty on the part of Holdings.</p>

The central question is whether the global strand and the local strand lead to the result that Project Waltz did not give rise to a breach of Holdings' <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty or of its contractual duty of trust and confidence.

I am wholly unconvinced that proposals could not have been developed which would have met those twin objectives; indeed, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they could have been. In the first place, the necessary savings to meet the EPS target (in contrast with the savings in NPPC cost) did not need to come from DB Pension plans, let alone from the UK DB Plans. If pension cost was an essential element, DC Plans could have been targeted: as the evidence (particularly from Mr Koppl) shows, that was an option and would have provided an easier solution. Another option might have been to impose heavier burdens on other DB Plans in countries where members had no similar Reasonable Expectations or no remedies arising out of them.</p>

If they had a free hand, they may well have been entitled to act as they did; even Mr Tennet accepts that, absent Reasonable Expectations, the Project Waltz changes would not have given rise to a breach of duty even though many people would regard them as unfair. The point is that they did not have a free hand; so that if they went beyond such freedom as they did have, the court can say that there has been a breach of duty. I am guilty of some slightly truncated language there: IBM Corporation and CHQ did, of course, have a free hand in the sense that this court cannot control their actions; but they did not have a free hand in the sense (see paragraphs 1007<span style="font-style:italic">ff</span> above) that their actions and decisions can have no impact on Holdings' own position and whether it has acted in breach of its duties.</p>

I have rejected that view. Holdings clearly knew of its duties (both its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and its contractual duty) to employees and members. But equally clearly, it did not take into account any Reasonable Expectations held by members when implementing Project Waltz just as it did not take account of â perhaps no-one at CHQ other than Mr MacDonald himself knew â the "push-back" promise. I say "equally clearly" because it would be entirely inconsistent for Holdings to say that it took into account Reasonable Expectations which it argued before me did not exist (and, I might add, not only inconsistent but probably further conduct designed to destroy its relationship of trust and confidence with the members). To fail to take into account such an important matter is, I consider, itself a factor which falls to be taken into account when considering whether Holdings has acted perversely or irrationally. I do not need to rely on that factor to reach the conclusion which I have; and the point not having been relied on by Mr Tennet, I do not do so.

It might therefore be argued that the correct remedy would be to achieve a situation under which accrual continued until the appropriate long-stop date which might be 2014 or perhaps even earlier. How this might affect members who transferred to the Hybid M Plan (or to the IBM UK PPPor to pension arrangements outside IBM) under Waltz who might otherwise have elected to remain in the DB Plan is a matter for debate.</p>

Another remedymight be to set aside â on a member by member basis - the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements.

A more difficult issue might relate to members who could establish that they signed the 2009 NonPensionability Agreements on the basis of the original statement that no future pay increases would be pensionable and that they would not have done so had they known that this would apply only to years 2009-11 with the matter being reviewed in 2011.

Members who made their election prior to becoming aware of Mr Ferrar's qualification of the original announcement may have a claim for breach of duty which may well be restricted to a damages claim. Members who made their election after knowing that the non-pensionability would subsist only until 2011 may have felt disappointed or even aggrieved: for those members, however, I do not consider that Holdings' conduct in relation to the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements was such as to breach the implied contractual duty of trust and confidence.

Further, in context, the early retirement window was unreasonably short. However, if the early retirement window is viewed in isolation, the position is different. In using the phrase "viewed in isolation", I envisage a situation under which there had been no communications giving rise to Reasonable Expectations and, in particular, no suggestion in the communications that the conditions under which a member could take early retirement might change. In that situation, the members' only complaint could be that they were not given enough time to consider their positions and not that the new ER policy could not be implemented within a reasonable time. Although the time given to members for them to take their decision was short, and may even properly be seen as unfairly short, I do not consider that Holdings' actions satisfy the test of irrationality and perversity as I have explained it.</p>

He says that it had been thought that an agreed position between Holdings and the Trustee would have been arrived at before the consultation began, but that did not happen. I do not know the evidential base for that, but I am prepared to proceed on that basis for the moment. And so, Mr Simmonds explains, IBM could hardly undermine its own negotiating position by saying something different in the consultation from that which it was asserting to the Trustee.

In any case, Mr Lamb accepted that it was reasonable for IBM to treat discussions with the Trustee as negotiations. It is correct that the proposition that this was done to scare the members was not put to Mr Ferrar or Mr Riley. But what was put was that IBM "deliberately misrepresented the position to members" (Mr Ferrar) and that it "simply wasn't true" (Mr Riley). Mr Ferrar did not accept the proposition put to him since he considered, in the light of the (undisclosed) advice received that it was appropriate to consult as they did. It would have been pretty pointless for Mr Tennet then to go on to suggest that it was done to scare the employees since Mr Ferrar could only have answered "No" consistently with what he had already said. Mr Riley had to accept that the 2010 date was not on the table by the time the consultation process began: in other words he in effect accepted the proposition that it "simply wasn't true". Similarly, Mr Riley would surely have answered "No" because his perception was that the 2010 date was included simply because that had been the proposal originally put to the Trustee and IBM's position, absent an agreement, would be undermined if that date had not been maintained.</p>

Iam not assisted by the use of emotive words such as "scare". The reality is that IBM was using the prospect of closure in 2010 as a tactic to persuade the Trustee and the members to accept the package which was on offer. If that is to be seen as a scare tactic, so be it; it was certainly part of IBM's approach, to use the phrase again, to play hardball.</p>

But whether or not they have such a cause of action, I see no reason why the contractual duty should not be capable of being invoked in such a situation. If that is correct, then the position should, in my view, be no different if the changes proposed by the employer include one or more listed changes in respect of which the employer <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> obliged to consult.

But I fail to see how the members of the PCC can reasonably be said to have had sufficient information to understand the commercial imperative of meeting a roadmap the details of which they had not been informed about. I remind myself, and the reader, of (i) the repeated requests made by the members of the PCC for details of the business rationale behind Project Waltz and (ii) the references made at the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:15pt">th</span> PCC session on 23 September 2009 referred to at paragraph 1282 above. It is a bit rich for IBM now to come along and argue that the PCC had the necessary information all along.

It would have been preferable if his announcement had been delayed until after the consultation had formally closed, but Mr Riley stressed that the announcement did not affect the outcome of the consultation. By that stage, UK management had decided in principle on the framework of the plan which was to be adopted, and the final meeting of the PCC had been held (on 8 October 2009), which had not raised any issues which would affect the overall scheme of the proposal. UK Management's hands were not forced by the announcement: no further information became available after the announcement (or was likely to do so) and Holdings would have come to the same conclusion whether or not the announcement had been made.</p>

The main criticism appears to him to be that, because the global strand was not sufficiently disclosed, the PCC was hampered in its attempts to advance suitable alternatives to the Project Waltz changes. Quite apart from the fact that consultation is not negotiation, he submits that it is not clear how knowledge of the global strand would have led the PCC to develop different alternatives that would have stood a better chance of being accepted. No such alternatives have in fact been advanced by the RBs. For example, one aim of the PCC was to defer the proposed changes for as long as possible; knowledge that such a deferral was not acceptable because of the 2010 EPS Roadmap would not have helped them.</p>

There is, therefore, at least an onus on the RBs to suggest why it may not be futile and simply to say it cannot be assumed that the same conclusion would follow is, he says, not good enough. The only point in re-running the consultation process is if the PCC, or however they are constituted, those representing the members, can put forward a viable counter-proposal to achieve the aims of Project Waltz. Surely, he asks, if there were such a counter-proposal, it would have been suggested by now? After all, the RBs have had plenty of time to think of a different way of doing it, and lots of criticisms are made in the written closings about the severity of Project Waltz and its disproportionality: nobody on the RBs side has actually suggested a different way of doing things that would nevertheless achieve the objectives as they are now known to be.</p>

Mr Simmonds' position is that, if IBM has succeeded on the substantive elements of the claim but fallen short on this procedural aspect, whatever order is made must ensure that, if the decision following a further consultation remains the same, then the Project Waltz changes should take effect as from their original date.

That argument, of course, depends on acceptance of the proposition, which I have held to be correct, that the statement to the effect "no salary increases if you don't sign up" meant no increases during the remainder of the member's career. But that argument, in turn, does not meet another of my conclusions on the substantive claim namely that it was a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty to rule out altogether for the future the prospect of any salary increase. I appreciate that the actual 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements only ran until 2011 but the original communication was not to that effect, and by the time the position was modified (or clarified as IBM, but not I myself, prefer to say), some members would already have made their decisions.</p>

That includes knowledge of my decision in the Rectification Action. As to the Rectification Action, it is now known that C Plan members have a right to early retirement (without consent) after age 60 with an unreduced pension. It is again not obvious to me that all members who entered into the 2009 Non-Pensionability Agreements would have made the same choice as they actually made if they had known that they could retire after age 60 without consent on an unreduced pension.</p>

Further, the driver of the changes â to meet the 2010 EPS Roadmap by reducing NPPC costs â is now history. The NPPC savings were booked in IBM Corporation's accounts in 2009 as a result of the adoption of the Project Waltz changes and they will remain booked even if Project Waltz were to be unravelled; at least, the contrary has not, so far, been suggested. And the share price in 2009 and thereafter was what it was: that history cannot be changed. I do not know whether, today, there would be a business case, whether global or local, which would justify a departure from any Reasonable Expectations which the members were entitled to hold in 2009 and which, absent Project Waltz, they would still be entitled to hold.</p>

The latest actuarial valuation shows that, since the last report which was published in 2001, increased life expectancy (including an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy) has added around Â£235 million to the cost of benefits already earned. Of this, Â£105 million relates to employees, with the balance relating to pensioners and deferred members who have left the company but are not yet drawing a pension. This is being addressed by the company, as I shall explain later.</p>
