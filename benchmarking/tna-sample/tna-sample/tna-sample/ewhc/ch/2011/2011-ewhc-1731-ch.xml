As a group it offers a wide range of financial products and services.  Unsurprisingly, F&amp;C attaches great importance to its client relationships in order to retain clients and keep their assets under F&amp;C management.  F&amp;C devotes considerable effort to maintaining its relationships with clients on a long-term basis, in particular by seeking to understand and respond to their investment needs.  To retain the trust and confidence of its clients, F&amp;C’s client account managers and marketing staff seek to ensure that clients are given sound advice appropriate to their needs about what assets and investment products they should invest in.  F&amp;C has an obvious interest to attract its clients to invest in its financial products to earn the fees associated with that, but it also has a long-term interest to retain the confidence of its clients which tempers the extent to which its personnel advising clients will seek to press them to invest in particular F&amp;C products.   </p>

A FoHF is a managed fund investing in a portfolio of hedge funds.  Hedge funds are investment funds set up to pursue specialised trading strategies, including hedging transactions, short selling of investments to benefit from market movements and so forth.  An investment in a hedge fund (or in a FoHF) is not a standardised investment product and there can be considerable differences between hedge funds and the particular investment strategies they pursue.  Hedge funds are thus to be distinguished from investment funds, sometimes referred to as “long only” funds, which hold shares or bonds in the hope that they will rise in price.  Hedge funds hold themselves out as being able to generate high returns for investors above general market movements, on the basis of the financial skill and acumen of those managing them. They generally charge high fees each year of the order of 2% of the value of assets under management (“AUM”), plus 20% of the increase in value of those assets (which may be contrasted with, for example, the far lower fees charged in relation to investment in financial products which simply aim to track particular market indices).   </p>

As is common for FoHFs, the LLP charged annual management fees of the order of 1% of the value of AUM plus 10% of the increase of the value of those assets over the year. These fees are levied by FoHFs in addition to the fees levied by the underlying hedge funds in which they invest.  Investment in FoHF products is thus a relatively expensive form of investment in financial products. </p>

The LLP held its funds out as absolute return products.  The objective of an absolute return product is to increase the value of the investment whatever may be happening to the general equity or bond markets.  An absolute return investment product is thus to be distinguished from a relative return investment product, where the investor understands that the performance of the investment is to be assessed by comparison with movements in the general markets or indices to which it is linked.   </p>

On the contrary, there may be substantial risks associated with the trading strategies adopted.  Nonetheless, the aim and hope is that the strategies adopted by hedge funds will allow for a degree of de-coupling or non-correlation of their investment performance with the general trends of equity and bond markets.  This feature of hedge funds can make them attractive to large institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies, since it affords them an option to diversify their basket of investments in managing their overall risk and liability profile </p>

But a cash holding is fundamentally different from an absolute return product in the form of an investment in a hedge fund or FoHF, in that it does not carry with it the significant risk of a decrease in its nominal value which is associated with hedge fund investments and, as the other side of the same coin, it does not carry with it (as hedge fund or FoHF investments do) the prospect of a significant increase in its nominal value above the rate of inflation and bank lending rates.   </p>

Single strategy hedge funds are funds invested in a particular specialised area following a specific investment strategy.  The nature of expertise in running a FoHF is to have a reasonable understanding of and knowledge about a range of hedge funds so as to be able to select a basket of hedge funds which offer good performance overall (as distinct from being expert in the implementation of any particular hedge fund strategy). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Clause 22.6 refers to the respective voting rights for Holdings (60%), Mr Barthelemy (20%) and Mr Culligan (20%) set out in the First Schedule to the Agreement.  It indicates that members in a Members’ meeting are entitled to vote on the basis of the extent of their respective interests in the LLP (the same division of interests between the Defendants and Holdings in the First Schedule also governs profit entitlements under clause 9.3.5 and capital entitlements under clause 10.1).  In my view, the parties to the Agreement intended a meeting of Members under clause 22 to operate in a way similar to a general meeting of members of a Companies Act company, where votes may be cast according to the extent of the shareholdings of the respective shareholders in the company: see paragraphs [207]-[216] below. I was informed by Miss Newman QC in her closing oral submissions that it may be that there is no statutory requirement which makes a meeting of Members “necessary”, to use the language of clause 22.2. No-one had raised this question previously in the trial; nothing appeared to turn on this point so far as her submissions were concerned; and in light of the way in which events developed I do not think this is a significant matter. </p>

Regulation 4 of and Schedule 2 to the 2001 Regulations made provision for the application to limited liability partnerships of provisions of the Companies Act 1985, including sections 459 to 461 (now sections 994 to 996 of the Companies Act 2006) with certain amendments. By virtue of Regulation 4 of and Schedule 2 to the 2001 Regulations the parties to an agreement creating a limited liability partnership were entitled to agree to opt out of the Companies Act unfair prejudice provisions, but the parties to the Agreement did not do this. Accordingly, sections 994 to 996 apply to the LLP in the same way as they would to a company. This result is now, as from 1 October 2009, achieved by regulation 48 of the Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2009, which have in this respect replaced the 2001 Regulations.   </p>

Conduct which is perfectly fair between competing businessmen may not be fair between members of a family.  In some sports it may require, at best, observance of the rules, in others (“it’s not cricket”) it may be unfair in some circumstances to take advantage of them.  All is said to be fair in love and war.  So the context and background are very important. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">In the case of section 459, the background has the following two features.  First, a company is an association of persons for an economic purpose, usually entered into with legal advice and some degree of formality.  The terms of the association are contained in the articles of association and sometimes in collateral agreements between the shareholders.  Thus the manner in which the affairs of the company may be conducted is closely regulated by rules to which the shareholders have agreed.  Secondly, company law has developed seamlessly from the law of partnership, which was treated by equity, like the Roman societas, as a contract of good faith.  One of the traditional roles of equity, as a separate jurisdiction, was to restrain the exercise of strict legal rights in certain relationships in which it considered that his would be contrary to good faith.  These principles have, with appropriate modification, been carried over into company law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The first of these two features leads to the conclusion that a member of a company will not ordinarily be entitled to complain of unfairness unless there has been some breach of the terms on which he agreed that the affairs of the company should be conducted.  But the second leads to the conclusion that there will be cases in which equitable considerations make it unfair for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict legal powers.  Thus unfairness may consist in a breach of the rules or in using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good faith.” </p>

In this case, the Defendants’ complaints under section 994 are directed against both F&amp;C Holdings and F&amp;C plc. F&amp;C plc was not a party to the Agreement and played no direct role in the management of the LLP. Even if the affairs of the LLP had been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the Defendants, F&amp;C plc denied that it was responsible for such conduct and denied that it could be held liable to them under section 994(1).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">F&amp;C IT policies were formulated with their focus on operation within companies which were wholly-owned subsidiaries of F&amp;C plc within the F&amp;C Group.  They were not tailored to address the specific needs of an entity such as the LLP which was only partly owned by F&amp;C.  Thus, for example, where F&amp;C IT policies made reference to decision-making procedures to allow for various actions in relation to computer systems, they typically provided for authority to be granted through F&amp;C Group management structures. This presupposed the application of F&amp;C Group decision-making authority which was simply inappropriate in the context of the LLP, which had its own governance structures for taking relevant decisions which, by the terms of the Agreement and in accordance with the regulatory context in which it operated, were intended to have responsibility for the conduct of the LLP’s affairs and to act independently and not at the dictation of F&amp;C Group management. On an objective approach, it could not plausibly be thought that the LLP had somehow delegated important decision-making functions and responsibilities - which under the Agreement and in the regulatory context in which it operated were assigned to its own governance structures - to persons or bodies external to the LLP, such as the senior management or the Board of F&amp;C plc.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">An example of particular importance in this case relates to the authority for a manager to have access to the e-mail correspondence of an employee, as Mr Culligan had access to the e-mail correspondence of Mr Brian Tilson (“Mr Tilson”, the Chief Financial Officer – “CFO” – of the LLP) and others at a certain point in the development of the dispute.  The F&amp;C Group IT policies contemplated that where necessary (e.g. to check whether an employee had been guilty of misconduct), senior management could authorise access to what would otherwise be regarded as the private e-mail records of employees, where such authorisation would be given by a member of the Management Committee of the Group (a body which became the Executive Committee, a small group of very senior managers at Group level: I will refer to both the Group Management Committee and the Executive Committee as “Execom”), or a member of the Board of F&amp;C plc.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">But in the context of the LLP, requirement for authorisation by F&amp;C Group management is misplaced.  The LLP is subject to regulatory responsibilities  (see paras. [93]ff below) and duties to clients and has its own management, distinct from the management of F&amp;C, which is responsible for taking action to ensure compliance with such responsibilities and duties.  In relation to the LLP’s affairs it should, in accordance with ordinary expectations, be the LLP’s own governance structures which make provision for such matters as authorisation for scrutinising employees’ emails where that might be relevant to the fulfilment of the LLP’s and its management’s responsibilities and duties.  There is thus an uneasy tension inherent in the application of the F&amp;C Group’s IT policies to the LLP which was not fully recognised and resolved in the various IT and operating policy documents promulgated at LLP and F&amp;C Group levels. In my view, that tension falls to be resolved by construing the relevant policies in light of the background regulatory and legal context of responsibilities imposed on the management of the LLP.</p>

Mr Culligan very properly took his regulatory responsibilities as the CF3 approved person for the LLP seriously, and that affected his reaction to what he regarded as attempts by Mr Ribeiro, an unapproved person, to subvert the proper conduct of the business of the LLP in communications with Mr Tilson and affected his reaction to Mr Mackay’s investigation of his own conduct in running the business of the LLP by covert review of staff e-mails and installation of the LLP’s own discrete IT network.   </p>

This principle required such a person to take reasonable steps to ensure that responsibilities within the firm were apportioned appropriately, i.e. including by ensuring that properly approved individuals carried out relevant functions within the firm and subject to the prescribed lines of authority in the firm, leading back to its senior managers at Management Committee and Board.  The F&amp;C Group Compliance Manual stated that it was not its purpose “to deal with the different operating procedures that exist for the different businesses” in the group, which would be covered in the detailed Procedures Manual for each business (paragraphs 1.2 and 4.7 of the December 2008 version of the Manual made the same point).   </p>

As a general approach, I can see that this had the merit of minimising cost and effort in running the LLP, but it had the disadvantage of leaving the interface between F&amp;C Group policies and LLP practices vague and rather uncertain.  In many cases, however, it was tolerably clear how F&amp;C Group policies might best be adapted to the circumstances of the LLP. Although the LLP’s approach in not completing and updating its own Operations Manual and policies fell below best practice, I do not think it was unreasonable in the context of a small operation like the LLP, embedded in a close relationship (albeit not fully spelled out in the various policies and manuals) with the general F&amp;C Group. </p>

Likewise, Mr Mackay, as Compliance Officer for both the F&amp;C Group and the LLP, did not press the LLP to produce a final and complete version of the Operations Manual which F&amp;C Group policies contemplated it should have.

However, over the years of operation of the LLP the requirement that equipment used should be entered in the register was not applied by the LLP or F&amp;C’s IT Department (“F&amp;C IT”) in relation to the LLP.  The LLP would purchase its own IT equipment using its own resources, though often placing the purchase orders through F&amp;C IT, and the equipment would not be entered on F&amp;C’s asset register.  Also, although the policy contemplated that there should be an annual asset audit by F&amp;C IT against the register, that does not seem to have been carried out in relation to the LLP.  This was one of the areas in which both F&amp;C and the LLP seem to have treated the applicability and operation of F&amp;C’s IT policies in relation to the LLP as a grey and uncertain area.  At paragraph 2.17 the policy prohibited employees from installing software onto any F&amp;C asset without the approval of F&amp;C IT, since such activity might compromise the security of the F&amp;C IT network.  However, as F&amp;C was aware, the LLP regularly developed and installed its own bespoke software on the computers used in the LLP’s business, which were connected to F&amp;C’s computer network, without obtaining the approval of F&amp;C IT.   </p>

Since the LLP was not a wholly-owned subsidiary of F&amp;C plc and had its own management and governance structure, it could not reasonably be thought that covert monitoring within the LLP’s own business either required authorisation by or could be authorised by the Management Committee or Board of a distinct entity, F&amp;C plc (see also paras. [90]-[92] above).  In the absence of a more precise policy applicable to the LLP, I agree with the Defendants that on an objective approach the proper interpretation of this policy so far as concerned the LLP was to read it <span style="font-style:italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, so that covert monitoring required to be authorised by a member of the equivalent corporate governance bodies in the LLP, namely the LLP’s ManCom or its Board. </p>

In section 3.4, the Code deals with Covert Monitoring, stating that it should only be used in exceptional circumstances; should normally be authorised by senior management; and that senior management “should satisfy themselves that there are grounds for suspecting criminal activity or equivalent malpractice and that notifying individuals about the monitoring would prejudice its prevention or detection” (it appears that the guidance in F&amp;C’s Group Information Security Policy at  para. [126(iv)] above was drawn from this). The Code also advises that employers should undertake impact assessments before embarking on monitoring of employees’ e-mails: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Two points may be made at this stage regarding the operation of the Employment Practices Code and the F&amp;C Group Information Policy in relation to the covert review of employee e-mails at the LLP conducted by Mr Culligan. First, one criticism made of him by F&amp;C at trial was that he did not have a sufficient justification for carrying out such a review, in that there were no exceptional circumstances equivalent to suspecting Mr Ribeiro and Mr Tilson of engaging in criminal activity. I reject that criticism. In my view, the Code and the Policy do not restrict the possibility of covert monitoring only to investigation of criminal activity or equivalent – that is only referred to as an example of relevant exceptional circumstances. I consider that a genuine concern based on objective grounds that the proper governance of a regulated entity is being improperly subverted may amount to exceptional circumstances for the purposes of both the Code and the Policy, and did so in this case: see paras. [821][825] below. Secondly, F&amp;C complain with some force that Mr Culligan did not undertake a distinct impact assessment before embarking on his investigation. However, in the highly unusual circumstances in which he was operating (where he suspected that the proper governance of the LLP was being subverted by F&amp;C) he had reasonable grounds for omitting to seek advice from F&amp;C HR or F&amp;C’s ARC department about the procedures to adopt, and in practice he did take care to minimise the intrusion upon the privacy of employees in the course of the investigation: para. [823] below.  His investigation was in line with his regulatory responsibilities under the FSA Handbook: paras. [108]-[113] above </p>

This dealt “with the key regulatory obligations applicable to the F&amp;C Group”, setting out group policy on such matters.  It stated: “Ultimate responsibility for compliance matters falls to the Chief Executive and the Board [i.e. of F&amp;C plc]…”.

The Manual and other F&amp;C Group policies were created against the background of the FSA Handbook and to give effect to the requirements set out in it, and fall to be construed taking into account that background. As applied to the business of the LLP the logic of this section and of the guidance in the FSA Handbook, therefore (as with other provisions in F&amp;C Group policies and in line with the Defendants’ submissions as to how they should be read), is that references to F&amp;C should be read as references to the LLP when translating the Manual as it fell to be applied in the context of the LLP.

The difference between them and F&amp;C about the significance of the personal declaration forms which they signed stems from the unconsidered use by F&amp;C of standardised Group policies and Group forms in relation to a non-standard entity (the LLP) and individuals (the Defendants, as partners in the LLP). I have explained above that although the position was unclear and unsatisfactory – a situation for which the Defendants bore part of the responsibility, but along with others, including F&amp;C’s ARC Department - on an objective reading of the various F&amp;C Group policies they did not apply in a simple and straightforward way to the LLP, but had to be read as subject to adaptations to take account of the distinct position of the LLP (see, in particular, paras. [90]-[92], [126(iv)], [127] and [129] above). For similar reasons, on an objective interpretation, the personal declaration forms could not be read as an acceptance by the Defendants that F&amp;C Group policies applied to them and the LLP other than in a limited fashion, with due modification to take account of the position of the LLP.  </p>

This is a further factor which tends to support the objective interpretation of the declaration forms to which I have referred.  These are points of significance when one comes to consider such matters as whether Mr Culligan had proper authority to conduct covert scrutiny of the e-mails of Mr Tilson (see paras.

Throughout the course of the dispute and, in particular, in relation to its complaints in the Cross-Petition about the Defendants’ conduct, F&amp;C went too far in trying to impose upon the LLP and upon the Defendants, as its managers, the standards and discipline to be derived from general statements of F&amp;C Group policy in relation to IT matters and failed to point to proper grounds in the Service Agreement for the complaints which it made about them.  Mr Culligan and Mr Barthelemy were therefore justified, in my view, at feeling aggrieved and distrustful as a result of F&amp;C’s attempts simply to treat them as subject to F&amp;C’s Group IT policies.  They were senior managers of a discrete legal entity, the LLP, which was not wholly owned by F&amp;C, and were entitled to exercise their own judgment about how the business of the LLP should be conducted.  </p>

In that regard, the LLP was on notice of the F&amp;C Group Information Security Policy, as it existed from time to time, and of the standards of careful conduct by users of the IT system which it laid down.  This is relevant to that part of F&amp;C’s case which involves complaint about the creation of what it says was an unacceptable security risk to F&amp;C’s IT network by the introduction by the LLP of its own discrete IT network in December 2008 and January 2009, which was joined to F&amp;C’s IT network via three dual-homed computers located in the LLP’s office, which were linked to both the LLP IT network and F&amp;C’s IT network: see paras.

That was a matter falling within the sole discretion of the LLP and the authority for any manager to conduct such a review is a matter to be determined by analysis of the distribution of authority within the LLP according to its constitution and relevant policies and practices.  The relevance of Mr Culligan’s covert review of the e-mails of Mr Tilson and others to F&amp;C’s position in these proceedings is therefore in doubt.  If Mr Culligan and Mr Barthelemy had proper authority from the LLP for what they did in that regard, the propriety of the action of F&amp;C in treating their conduct as improper is itself open to question.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For investment in the Select Fund, the LLP had a power to commit the investor to borrow money from certain banks – the leverage providers – with which the LLP had arranged borrowing facilities (Crédit Suisse, Rabobank and ABN Amro).  Although, according to the investment agreement for investors in the Select Fund, the LLP had a degree of discretion about the amount of leverage it could allocate to the investor, it was important for the LLP to maintain a reasonably constant rate of leverage in order to ensure that the Fund met the expectations of investors as to the degree of exposure and risk they accepted by investing in it and did not significantly vary such exposure and risk by changing the extent of leverage.  Accordingly, until it was wound down and the leveraging arrangements brought to an end in early 2009, leverage for investment in the Select Fund was maintained at a fairly constant rate at around 50% (that is to say, for each $1 of an investor’s own money invested in the fund an additional $1 was borrowed and was also invested in the Fund in that investor’s name).  An investor in the Select Fund therefore took on twice the exposure to the underlying hedge fund portfolio managed by the LLP for each $1 invested as an investor who invested directly in the Balanced Fund.  The effect of the leveraging in the Select Fund was broadly to multiply the risk taken and the good or poor performance of the underlying hedge fund portfolio for an investor who invested $1 of its own money by a factor of about two. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The way in which the leverage arrangements operated was also relevant to the way in which the fee income for the LLP was then divided up between the LLP and F&amp;C under the marketing fee provisions set out in the Agreement.  Where a client of the LLP wished to invest $1 of its own money in the Select Fund, with an additional $1 of leverage, the Select Fund would arrange for the client to pay $1 to the leverage provider and the leverage provider would invest that and an additional $1 in the Balanced Fund in its own name.  Contractual arrangements were in place to transfer any profit or loss on that investment from the leverage provider to the client and to ensure that the client bore the cost of all the LLP’s fees in relation to the full $2 investment and borrowing costs for the leverage.  However, as a matter of the LLP’s own internal accounting, the investment would be treated as an investment of $1 by the client and $1 by the leverage provider.  This affected the amount of the marketing fee payable by the LLP to F&amp;C in respect of that investment.  The leverage provider was treated as a new client for the purposes of the Fifth Schedule to the Agreement, so under paragraph 1.3.1 of that Schedule the LLP could keep the entirety of the fees attributable to the $1 of investment contributed by the leverage provider.  On the other hand if, say, the client who invested was a core client of F&amp;C, for the purposes of the Fifth Schedule the LLP would be obliged to pay to Holdings a significant proportion of the fees attributable to the $1 of investment contributed by the client, in accordance with paragraph 1.1 of that Schedule.     </p>

The Fund was created as a subsidiary of the Balanced Fund by grouping all the investments in hedge funds of that type held in the general Balanced Fund portfolio into a distinct portfolio within the general portfolio and transferring that distinct portfolio to the new Credit Alpha Fund corporate vehicle as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Balanced Fund.  The commercial object of this was to create a discrete FoHF portfolio in this specialised class of hedge fund which could generate an investment track record over time, which could then be used (if the performance were good) to market the Credit Alpha Fund to investors as an investment product distinct from the Balanced and Select Funds.  As it transpired, the business of the LLP and its funds never developed in a way that allowed for that.  On 29 April 2010 the directors of the Credit Alpha Fund resolved to place the fund into liquidation.

Since investments in hedge funds are typically denominated in US dollars, it is conventional to analyse FoHF performance in US dollars. That is typically the currency in which FoHF performance is marketed to investors.  Where an investment is made in a FoHF product denominated in another currency, such as euros, but invested in dollar-denominated hedge fund securities, it is usual for the FoHF to take out hedging transactions to minimise the risk of currency fluctuations which might have an impact on the investment performance of that nondollar denominated product.  Hedging was a feature of the Select and Balanced Funds until late 2008, when the LLP abandoned currency hedging on the euro-denominated funds as a cost-cutting measure.  There was, in fact, significant currency fluctuation in the highly volatile market conditions before the end of 2008 and it seems that the absence of currency hedging on the LLP’s euro-denominated FoHF hedge fund products may have contributed to the fact that their performance for 2008 was markedly worse than the (very bad) performance of the dollar-denominated funds for that year.   </p>

F&amp;C regarded the LLP’s funds as practically unsellable in the extreme market conditions in late 2008 and early 2009, both because of a shift in general sentiment among its clients (which switched at this time to becoming markedly more averse to risk and with a heightened appetite for liquidity and cash which made hedge fund investments unattractive for them) and because of the poor performance figures for the LLP’s Funds.  F&amp;C’s attitude was that the appropriate approach for the LLP was for it to hunker down while the economic storm passed, spend time rebuilding its investment track record by securing positive returns for its FoHF products over a period and then, on the basis of that restored track record and an eventual return of markets to something approaching normality, to return to marketing the products in an active way so as to build the AUM up once again.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On this strategy, since fee income would be down for a period and activity by the LLP would (F&amp;C thought) be comparatively reduced, F&amp;C considered it made sense for the LLP to budget to cut its costs significantly for 2009, including in particular by reducing the number of staff.  In an asset management business such as the LLP staff costs are typically one of the greatest cost elements, so to F&amp;C’s way of thinking it seemed that staff reductions should be a natural way of reducing the LLP’s costs for a period while it took steps to rebuild its investment performance.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, F&amp;C’s attitude was also influenced by the fact that under the terms of the Agreement, if the LLP sustained losses, it would be F&amp;C which would bear the brunt of that economic cost.  This was because the Defendants’ drawings in respect of the LLP’s profits were protected as to £150,000 per annum each under clauses 9.3.2 and 11.1 of the Agreement (even if the LLP made a loss), and where losses were sustained by the LLP, they would, in the first instance, be drawn down against the capital of the LLP (the bulk of which had been provided by F&amp;C and which F&amp;C was obliged to maintain at a satisfactory level for regulatory purposes under clause 8.3 of the Agreement).  The cost to F&amp;C might be recouped against profits in later years by virtue of the operation of the provisions on the allocation of profits set out in clause 9.3 of the Agreement, but that would, of course, depend on sufficient profits being made in those later years.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in my judgment, the business strategy favoured by Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C was a reasonable and legitimate one, proposed by F&amp;C in good faith. The way in which Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C were influenced in forming their views by F&amp;C’s financial interests was something which the Agreement contemplated could properly happen: Mr Ribeiro and the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board were not to be disqualified from acting by reason of the fact that F&amp;C’s commercial interests were engaged by a wide range of business judgments which would have to be made by the LLP Board and ManCom from time to time.  The fact that they favoured a strategy which tended to accord with F&amp;C’s own commercial interests in relation to the operation of the Agreement does not undermine the assessment that it was a reasonable and legitimate strategy for them to press for.  Businessmen’s views as to what it is best for a business to do quite often naturally reflect what they think is in their own best interests.  Their interests colour the way they see the world, but that does not necessarily mean that their assessment of what is the best way forward is not a genuine, <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> assessment.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Similar points can be made in relation to the Defendants’ reaction to the considerable stresses to which the business of the LLP was subject in late 2008 and 2009.  They genuinely and strongly believed that it would be detrimental to the business of the LLP to cut staff.  They considered that the LLP still had marketable products which (although they had performed very badly in absolute terms in 2008) had not performed particularly badly when compared with other F&amp;C investment funds, nor when compared with other hedge fund or FoHF businesses (whose results had also generally been very poor during the extreme market circumstances from late 2008). They believed that they needed to retain staff to ensure that they had a credible fund management team to attract business when markets recovered, as they felt they would do.  They were prepared to look at other ways of saving costs in the LLP’s business (which, for various reasons, were not attractive to F&amp;C) and wished to expand the LLP’s business to generate revenue by developing new products (which F&amp;C regarded as too costly and speculative to launch). </p>

This made them more willing than Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C to speculate that there would be an upswing in F&amp;C’s revenues in 2009 and to think that the LLP should take the risk that that might not prove to be the case. </p>

In a way similar to Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C, their views about the best way forward for the LLP in difficult circumstances were naturally influenced by their own commercial interests so far as concerned the operation of the Agreement, but this was something which the Agreement contemplated could properly happen. Like Mr Ribeiro and the F&amp;C representatives in relation to the financial interests of F&amp;C, they were not disqualified from participating in decision-making by the LLP Board and ManCom by the fact that their personal financial interests were engaged from time to time in relation to such decision-making. As with Mr Ribeiro and the F&amp;C representatives, that did not prevent their views from from being genuine and honest views about the best way forward for the LLP. As with F&amp;C and its representatives, I find that the business strategy of the Defendants for the LLP was proposed by them in good faith, genuinely believing it to be in the best interests of the LLP.   </p>

F&amp;C felt that the Defendants (who, F&amp;C emphasised, were part owners of the business) were unreasonable in refusing to face up to the need for significant cost savings at the LLP which, in F&amp;C’s view, realistically meant that staff should be cut.  The Defendants felt that F&amp;C was unreasonable in pressing for such a course (which they believed would be profoundly damaging to the LLP’s business prospects) and in blocking their proposals for new products for the LLP. They became deeply suspicious that F&amp;C had decided upon a strategy of driving the LLP out of business (so as to avoid having to buy out their interests under the call option provisions in paragraphs 1.9 and 1.10 of the Fourth Schedule), pursued by means which included arranging for F&amp;C clients to withdraw their funds from the LLP’s FoHF products and failing to market those products to persuade those clients to stay in the funds or to attract new investors.   </p>

There was no belief or concern on the part of the marketing team at F&amp;C Netherlands that there had been any mis-selling of the products by them and the fact that they did not, in late 2008 and early 2009, feel able to press F&amp;C’s clients in the Netherlands to invest or remain invested in the LLP’s products was due wholly to their clients’ distraught reactions to the general extreme fall in the values of all their investments, leading to a strong desire at the time to get out of risky products and a strong desire (backed up by domestic regulatory requirements) to invest in liquid assets.  The marketing team at F&amp;C Netherlands were in the middle of a storm of client anguish and recrimination as a result of the massive failure of investments to match their expectations and the catastrophic fall in the value of those investments, where their investments in the LLP’s Select Fund had done particularly badly against an expectation that the Fund would provide absolute returns.  For entirely legitimate reasons, the F&amp;C Netherlands marketing team did not consider it an opportune time at which to try to persuade clients to invest or remain invested in a comparatively unfamiliar, illiquid and risky set of FoHF products on offer from the LLP. </p>

It was as a result of efforts by F&amp;C to do this, in particular by threatening to cut off the Defendants’ income to which they were entitled under the Agreement, which led the Defendants to serve the First Put Option Notices on 25 February 2009, as I set out in detail below.

The Defendants say that Mr Mackay’s investigation and report were inadequate and unfair to them, and that the report was acted upon and sent to the FSA without them having a fair opportunity to respond to it first. I have come to the conclusion that this part of the Defendants’ case is made out. Although Mr Mackay was entitled to commence an investigation as he did, it was not conducted fairly and the LLP should not have treated his report as final, but rather as a statement of case against the Defendants to which they should have been permitted to respond before it was acted on and sent to the FSA. The Defendants did in fact have good answers to the criticisms of them in the report.  </p>

So far as concerned the LLP’s own business, the risk created was within acceptable and legitimate bounds. However, the risk created for F&amp;C’s IT system was, through inadvertence, outside what was acceptable - but this involved placing the LLP in breach of its obligations to F&amp;C under article 3.1 of the Service Agreement rather than conduct of the LLP’s own affairs in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its members.  By virtue of article 3.5 of the Service Agreement, this breach of article 3.1 did not expose the LLP to any damages claim by F&amp;C and the change in the LLP’s IT arrangements did not cause any significant prejudice to Holdings in the conduct of the affairs of the LLP. The fault in setting up such a system was Mr Culligan’s alone (Mr Barthelemy had no IT knowledge or expertise and was entitled to rely on the combined knowledge and expertise in that area of Mr Culligan and Nicholas Pennington – “Mr Pennington” - the LLP’s IT manager), and merely constituted a failure to fulfil his management responsibilities to a satisfactory standard in this one limited respect.  Mr Culligan acted from proper motives and without intention to harm the LLP or F&amp;C.  This isolated lapse below the standard of proper diligence to be expected of someone in Mr Culligan’s position is not sufficient to qualify as conduct occasioning significant prejudice to Holdings in relation to the conduct of the affairs of the LLP and does not justify the grant of any relief under section 994. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There were wide-ranging allegations of conspiracy and complaints of lying and deceptiveness made on each side of the dispute. In particular, a major part of the Defendants’ case was that F&amp;C had taken a decision to close the LLP without respecting their rights under the Agreement and then moved to implement that decision. A major part of F&amp;C’s case was that the Defendants decided in late 2008 or early 2009 that they wished to leave the LLP and hatched a plan to lure F&amp;C into committing breaches of the Agreement by reference to which they could serve Put Option notices requiring F&amp;C to buy out their interests at the enhanced price set out in paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule.   Assessment of the witnesses and of their honesty both in giving their evidence and in the course of their dealings with each other has therefore been important in forming the findings made in this judgment, and in particular in rejecting the main conspiracy allegations levelled by each side against the other. </p>

Each of them exhibited defensiveness at points in their evidence where they were not forthcoming or where I was left with a degree of scepticism about what they said. In relation to Mr Ribeiro, I was, in particular, left unpersuaded by his evidence about his state of mind in January and February 2009 regarding his understanding of the terms of the Agreement and in relation to the powers of a Members’ meeting. Having said this, however, it was not my assessment that any of these three witnesses made concerted efforts to lie in giving their evidence. Their emotions ran high in relation to the dispute, and in the case of each of them I consider there was a degree of reconstruction in their evidence in which they persuaded themselves of the truth of what they said, even when I found it to be unpersuasive and unreliable. As between them, in general terms I found Mr Culligan to be the better witness. He was not as slow and circumspect in giving answers as Mr Ribeiro, and tended to be clearer and more precise in his evidence; he was more restrained and careful than, and not as argumentative as, Mr Barthelemy in giving his evidence. </p>

As the parties fell out with each other in late 2008, it proved difficult to agree the minutes of meetings. From then on, Mr Barthelemy and Mr Tonkin both made manuscript notes at meetings. Mr Tonkin would draft minutes of the Board meetings and the Defendants would then propose amendments to them. I find that both Mr Tonkin and Mr Barthelemy tried in good faith to record what was said, subject to the pressure of time (as the meetings proceeded with often acrimonious debate), with each of them tending to note perhaps more carefully points which seemed of significance from F&amp;C’s or the Defendants’ point of view, respectively. To make findings about what happened at meetings, I have had regard to all versions of the notes and minutes available in relation to those meetings and the evidence given about them.

He was appointed to that position in July 2009 after his involvement in matters pertaining to the dispute had ceased. He has worked in senior positions at a series of leading firms in the asset management sector, in roles involving the design and implementation of business strategies. From 2001 Mr Moir was involved in a number of consultancy projects for the F&amp;C Group, and came to know the group well. In early 2008 he was engaged to assist F&amp;C in formulating its business strategy for operating in increasingly difficult market conditions. He recommended that the group take action to reduce its costs base. This developed into a group initiative to achieve that objective, called “Project Fitness”. For the most part, I assess that Mr Moir gave reliable evidence. However, while he was in the witness box it emerged that one of his handwritten notes made in the course of his work on Project Fitness in November 2008 had been altered in a material respect in the period after disclosure had been given of it (see paras. [478]ff below). The discovery that his notes had been tampered with in this way led to evidence being called from a handwriting expert and a careful examination of when and how that tampering might have occurred and how, why and when other notations in Mr Moir’s notebooks made at other times might have been made. The Defendants submitted that Mr Moir was responsible for the tampering and put this to him in cross-examination; he denied it. I have given very careful consideration to whether this submission is made out, including having regard to character evidence adduced by F&amp;C. I have come to the conclusion that Mr Moir did make one small but significant change in his notebook before going into the witness box by way of tampering with his notes, and that he lied when denying that he had done this (see paras. [475]-[486] below). In the light of that finding, I have in turn given careful consideration to my general assessment of his evidence and to what inferences should be drawn from that finding as regards other evidence called by F&amp;C and its overall case. For reasons given at paras. [487]ff below, I continue to assess that Mr Moir was otherwise honest in the evidence he gave. I reject the Defendants’ submissions that Mr Moir tampered with the evidence in his notebooks in any other way. It is also my view that no general adverse inference can properly be drawn from this action by Mr Moir which undermines other evidence given by F&amp;C’s witnesses; </p>

Mr Grisay and Mr Logan are the sole executive directors on the Board of F&amp;C plc. In turn, F&amp;C plc is one of the two directors of Holdings; the other is Mr Grisay. The Defendants maintained that Mr Grisay and Mr Logan had relevant evidence to give, and that I should draw inferences of fact adverse to F&amp;C from F&amp;C’s decision not to call them as witnesses.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There are three main areas in the case where it is particularly relevant to consider whether inferences should be drawn from the non-appearance of Mr Grisay and Mr Logan at trial. First, they were members of Execom who were parties to the discussions within Execom as part of Project Fitness in late 2008 regarding what steps should be taken in relation to the LLP. Should I infer that they would give evidence to the effect that F&amp;C’s Execom did indeed decide that the LLP should be closed, as the Defendants contend? In my view, it would not be appropriate to draw that conclusion. F&amp;C fielded a range of witnesses who gave evidence about what Execom decided, and who were cross-examined extensively on the topic (principally Mr Ribeiro, Mr Mendez de Vigo, Mr Moir and Ms Bomba). There is an abundance of evidence about this on the basis of which I am satisfied it is correct to proceed to make findings of fact. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there was an issue at trial whether Mr Ribeiro, in taking certain steps directed against the Defendants, acted with the authority of Holdings as its agent. This was important for the purposes of the Part 7 proceedings and evaluation of the submission of the Defendants that Holdings (the Corporate Member of the LLP) acted in breach of provisions of the Agreement so that they became entitled under para. 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule to exercise a put option against Holdings. There were a number of indicators that Mr Ribeiro did act as agent for Holdings (see, for example, the claims by Mr Ribeiro and Mr Mackay in correspondence that he did so: paras. [923] and [925] below), and the general impression from the whole of the evidence was that Holdings had authorised Mr Ribeiro to act as its representative for all its dealings with the LLP. If Holdings wished to challenge that impression, I think it was clearly incumbent on it to do so by calling the two natural persons who most obviously represented the corporate mind of Holdings, namely Mr Grisay (as director of Holdings in his personal capacity and as one of the two executive directors of the corporate director of Holdings, F&amp;C plc) and Mr Logan (the other of the two executive directors of F&amp;C plc). In my view it is appropriate to draw the inference in relation to this issue that Mr Grisay and Mr Logan would not have felt able to deny that Mr Ribeiro did indeed act as agent for Holdings in its dealings with the LLP. This inference supports the general impression from the rest of the evidence that Mr Ribeiro acted at relevant points as the agent for Holdings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, there was an issue at trial whether, for the purposes of the Defendants’ petition under section 994, F&amp;C plc could be treated as sufficiently responsible in a relevant sense for the actions of, in particular, Mr Ribeiro in relation to the management of the LLP and his conduct in eventually causing the Defendants to be expelled from their roles as executive managers of the LLP’s business, so as to justify an award of a remedy under section 996 for the Defendants against F&amp;C plc. Relevant factors in that assessment include whether F&amp;C plc was aware of the steps which Mr Ribeiro was arranging to be taken against the Defendants in the course of the dispute, whether F&amp;C plc acquiesced in or approved those steps being taken and whether F&amp;C plc regarded those steps as being for its benefit and was supportive of Mr Ribeiro in proceeding as he did.

The fact that they were not called as witnesses gives rise to the inference that they would not have felt able to deny these points in their evidence, and supports the conclusion that the general impression in that regard derived from the totality of the evidence which was before the court is indeed accurate. </p>

One area where the evidence of Mr Engineer and Mr Kermisch was helpful was in confirming the impression given by other parts of the evidence that once the Defendants served their First Put Option Notices on 25 February 2009 (and the dispute was not thereafter promptly resolved), the business of the LLP was bound to be very substantially affected in a detrimental way. By that action, the portfolio managers (the Defendants), whose abilities were the principal foundation for carrying on the LLP’s business and an important factor in persuading investors to invest in its products, had intimated that they intended to leave the business. It was clear from that point that the management of the business was riven by a very serious dispute, and it would not be feasible or proper to conceal this from investors. </p>

The main object of this submission was to enable the Defendants to hold Holdings directly responsible for all actions of its three “representatives”, in particular when they (according to the Defendants) acted in breach of fiduciary duties owed to Holdings and hence (so it might be said) caused Holdings to be in breach of its obligation of utmost good faith to the LLP under clause 13.6 of the Agreement.  </p>

Clause 18 of the Agreement established a Board for the LLP with responsibility for taking decisions for it across a range of important areas. Since they had the power of managing the LLP’s affairs in these areas, on ordinary principles the members of the Board would owe personal fiduciary duties to the LLP in relation to the exercise of their functions as Board members: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">White v Jones </span>[1995] 2 AC 207, 271E-G (Lord Browne-Wilkinson). Clause 21 of the Agreement indicated that the parties understood that the individual members of the Board and ManCom owed personal obligations to the LLP, including an obligation to act “in good faith in … the best interests of the LLP”. Since they owed personal fiduciary duties to the LLP in relation to decision-making in the course of conducting the LLP’s business, they could not reasonably be expected to owe Holdings the duties which an agent would owe his principal. For example, if one of the “representatives” of Holdings on the LLP Board formed the view that a particular action should be taken in the interests of the LLP he could not – in light of the fiduciary duty owed by him to the LLP - obey an instruction to him from Holdings to vote against it; </p>

Clause 18.2 does not contain any such language. It does not say that the three “representatives” are to be agents of Holdings. The use of the word “representatives” does not necessarily connote an agency relationship, and particularly does not do so in this context. The use of that word is explicable by reference to the intention of the parties that the three Board members appointed by Holdings should not be disabled from deliberating and deciding on matters affecting both the LLP and F&amp;C by virtue of any potential conflict of interest involved because of their relationship with F&amp;C. The fact that according to clause 18.2 they are appointed to the LLP Board as F&amp;C’s representatives is one of a number of indicators that they are not intended, in this respect, to be subject to the usual, very strict no conflict rule which may apply in other fiduciary contexts. By contrast, where Holdings wished to retain its own control over particular decisions of the LLP, it negotiated for a direct right to that effect for itself: see clause 19 of the Agreement; </p>

[221]ff below. Moreover, the inclusion in clause 13.6 of an express contractual duty of utmost good faith owed by Holdings (as the Corporate Member) to the LLP tends to support the view that it was not intended that the Corporate Member should owe, in addition, fiduciary duties to the LLP in relation to its management. This in turn suggests that the fiduciary duties that one would expect to be owed by persons exercising powers of management in relation to the LLP’s affairs are owed by those natural persons who are members of the LLP Board, to the exclusion of any agency relationship between them and the Corporate Member;   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendants sought to gain support for their submission from the fact that clause 18 of the Agreement has the heading, “The Board of Members”. Since the individual representatives of Holdings on the Board are not members of the LLP, so the argument ran, the intention must have been that they should act as agents for Holdings, which was the Corporate Member. A flaw in this argument is that clause 1.6 of the Agreement provides that “The headings in this document are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement” (another difficulty with the argument is that the heading to clause 18 involves a clear misnomer, since Holdings is not a member of the Board even though in principle it could be, since a corporate person may be a director of a company or a member of the Board of a limited liability partnership). Where the “Board” is defined in the body of the Agreement, in clause 1.1, it is simply said to mean “the board of the LLP, constituted in accordance with clause 18”. That definition supports an interpretation of the Agreement in which Board members are expected to owe duties and act in a way analogous to the way in which members on the Board of a company would act, owing their primary fiduciary duties to the company to the exclusion of any agency relationship with the person who appointed them. The same point may be made by reference to the operative part of clause 18, which simply states that the LLP “shall have a Board” (not a “Board of Members”) which shall be responsible for certain business decisions in relation to the LLP, and appears to invoke and rely upon the (obvious) analogy of a company’s Board of directors;  </p>

In particular, the logic for the Defendants making a presentation of their grievances against F&amp;C at the LLP Board meeting on 21 January 2009 (para.

In a novel legal context, where the question is how the conscience of an individual might be affected in relation to some matter, I think it is material to have regard to what the persons involved on the ground at the time believed or expected the position to be.  </p>

In view of the wide range of governance structures which parties are free to contract for, it is difficult to make generalisations about the circumstances in which a duty of good faith or other fiduciary duties as between the members in a limited liability partnership may arise. It is necessary to refer back to basic equitable principles in order to decide whether and what fiduciary obligations arise in the context of a limited liability partnership. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“The paradigm of the circumstances in which equity will find a fiduciary relationship is where one party, A, has assumed to act in relation to the property or affairs of another, B.  A, having assumed responsibility, pro tanto, for B’s affairs, is taken to have assumed certain duties in relation to the conduct of those affairs, including normally a duty of care.  Thus, a trustee assumes responsibility for the management of the property of the beneficiary, a company director for the affairs of the company and an agent for those of his principal.  By so assuming to act in B’s affairs, A comes under fiduciary duties to B.  Although the extent of those fiduciary duties (including duties of care) will vary from case to case some duties (including a duty of care) arise in each case.  The importance of these considerations for present purposes is that the special relationship (i.e. a fiduciary relationship) giving rise to the assumption of responsibility held to exist in <span style="font-style:italic">Nocton’s</span> case [<span style="font-style:italic">Nocton v Lord Ashburton </span>[1914] AC 932] does not depend on any mutual dealing between A and B, let alone on any relationship akin to contract.  Although such factors may be present, equity imposes the obligation because A has assumed to act in B’s affairs.  Thus, a trustee is under a duty of care to his beneficiary whether or not he has had any dealing with him: indeed he may be as yet unborn or unascertained and therefore any direct dealing would be impossible.” </p>

The drafting and subject matter of clause 19 indicates that it was intended to be a provision according rights to the Corporate Member for the safeguarding of its own private interests, which suggests that it was not intended that the Corporate Member should owe any duty of good faith in relation to its exercise of such rights (save the duty expressly stipulated in clause 13.6).  </p>

However, the phrase “joint venture” is not in my view a precise term of art which in itself has any particular significance for an analysis of the existence and content of fiduciary obligations. Rather, it is necessary to look at the specific roles and responsibilities arising in the particular context in question in order to assess whether and what fiduciary obligations might arise. Neither Holdings nor the Defendants in their capacity as Individual Members (as distinct from in their capacity as senior managers of the LLP’s business and as members of the LLP Board, ManCom and Compensation Committee) had direct control over the affairs or property of the LLP (or of each other) in a manner which could lead to the imposition in law of any general set of fiduciary obligations.  </p>

In particular, section 6(1) of the LLPA provides that every member of a limited liability partnership is its agent, and there is nothing in the Act to qualify the usual fiduciary obligations which an agent owes his principal in relation to the transactions which the agent enters into on the principal’s behalf. But Holdings did not purport to do anything of relevance as agent for the LLP, so section 6(1) does not take the Defendants anywhere in terms of their complaints.  </p>

I do not accept this. Regulation 7 does not provide expressly for there to be such a duty owed by members nor can such a duty be spelled out from it by implication. Regulation 7(9) and (10) implies that there are specific duties owed by members to the limited liability partnership (respectively, not to compete, unless the partnership gives its consent; and not to take benefits from transactions concerning the parthership, unless the partnership gives its consent), and does not imply that there is any more general duty of good faith as contended for by Mr Thompson.  </p>

However, there has always been scope for fiduciary duties to be found to arise in a range of other contexts which have important similarities to the paradigm cases, but also significant differences.

Very often, of course, a contract may lie at the heart of such a business relationship, and then a question arises about the way in which fiduciary obligations may be imposed alongside the obligations spelled out in the contract. In making their contract, the parties will have bargained for a distribution of risk and for the main standards of conduct to be applied between them. In commercial contexts, care has to be taken in identifying any fiduciary obligations which may arise that the court does not distort the bargain made by the parties: see the observation by Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury writing extra-judicially in “The Stuffing of Minerva’s Owl? Taxonomy and Taxidermy in Equity” [2009] CLJ 537, 543 and <span style="font-style:italic">Vercoe v Rutland Fund Management Ltd</span> [2010] EWHC 424 (Ch), [351]-[352].

In the case of estate agents, it is their business to act for numerous principals: where properties are of a similar description, there will be a conflict of interest between the principals each of whom will be concerned to attract potential purchasers to their property rather than that of another.  Yet, despite this conflict of interest, estate agents must be free to act for several competing principals otherwise they will be unable to perform their function.  Yet it is normally said that it is a breach of an agent’s duty to act for competing principals.  In the course of acting for each of their principals, estate agents will acquire information confidential to that principal.  It cannot be sensibly suggested that an estate agent is contractually bound to disclose to any one of his principals information which is confidential to another of his principals.  The position as to confidentiality is even clearer in the case of stockbrokers who cannot be contractually bound to disclose to their private clients inside information disclosed to the brokers in confidence by a company for which they also act.  Accordingly in such cases there must be an implied term of the contract with such an agent that he is entitled to act for other principals selling competing properties and to keep confidential the information obtained from each of his principals. </p>

Edelman, “When Do Fiduciary Duties Arise?” (2010) 126 LQR 302), albeit the two processes have traditionally been conceptualised as different. Fiduciary duties are obligations imposed by law as a reaction to particular circumstances of responsibility assumed by one person in respect of the conduct of the affairs of another. As between the parties to a contract, the existence of express or implied contractual terms may be directly inconsistent with the imposition of such duties, and hence exclude them; and that may also be true where a person who is not a party to the relevant contract (as, here, the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board were not parties to the Agreement) accepts appointment to carry out functions defined by the contract and on the basis of the terms set out in the contract. It may also be the case that the overall contextual framework created by the contract simply means that it is not appropriate for the law to impose the whole range of possible fiduciary duties or fiduciary duties of particular types in that specific context - in other words, it may be found that the parties could not reasonably expect that some particular duty of a fiduciary character should apply in the context of their particular relationship or in the context of their relationship with a person accepting appointment as a manager or board member.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Part of the difficulty in relation to (iii) arises from considering the statement by Millett LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Mothew </span>at p. 19D-H about the strictness of the obligation upon a fiduciary who acts for two principals not to allow the performance of his obligations to one principal to be influenced by his relationship with the other, and the consequent obligation to cease acting for one or both principals if an actual conflict of interest arises. That statement is readily understandable in the context with which Millett LJ was dealing in that case, namely a solicitor acting for two clients. The solicitor/client relationship involves a particularly strong degree of confidence and trust, and the content of the fiduciary duties associated with it is well established and demanding. It is also relevant that there is a ready supply of alternative solicitors who are able to act and can readily be substituted if an actual conflict of interest is perceived to arise. But in my view, read on its own, Millett LJ’s statement does not take full account of the wide and varied range of circumstances in which fiduciary obligations of different types and of greater or lesser force may arise. The paradigm cases of fiduciary relationships, such as those between solicitors and their clients, are at the centre of a family of such relationships sharing some but not necessarily all characteristics, where the force of the obligations to be identified as inhering in those relationships (what is reasonably to be expected of the person who has taken on the task of acting for another in those relationships) may vary and become weaker the further one moves from the those central cases.  </p>

Depending on the circumstances, the trustee may legitimately consider that his primary responsibility is to continue to act, as the settlor intended he should, rather than to step down to allow someone else, less wellqualified than him, to take over. If that is the case, the trustee’s conscience in continuing to act as trustee will not be affected by the fact that an actual conflict of interest has arisen, provided he seeks in good faith to take proper account of the interests to be promoted by the trust alongside his own interests. </p>

It is to exclude the purpose of securing such ulterior special and particular advantages that Lord Lindley [in <span style="font-style:italic">Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd </span>[1900] 1 Ch 656 at 671] used the phrase ‘bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole’. The reference to ‘benefit as a whole’ is but a very general expression negativing purposes foreign to the company’s operations, affairs and organisations. But unfortunately, as appears from the foregoing discussion, the use of the phrase has tended to cause misapprehension. If the challenged alteration relates to an article which does or may affect an individual, as, for instance, a director appointed for life or a shareholder whom it is desired to expropriate, or to an article affecting the mutual rights and liabilities <span style="font-style:italic">inter se</span> of shareholders or different classes or descriptions of shareholders, the very subject matter involves a conflict of interests and advantages.  To say that the shareholders forming the majority must consider the advantage of the company as a whole in relation to such a question seems inappropriate, if not meaningless, and at all events starts an impossible inquiry.  The “company as a whole” is a corporate entity consisting of all the shareholders.  If the proposal put forward is for a revision of any of the articles regulating the rights <span style="font-style:italic">inter se</span> of shareholders or classes of shareholders, the primary question must be how conflicting interests are to be adjusted, and the adjustment is left by law to the determination of those whose interests conflict, subject, however, to the condition that the existing provision can be altered only by a three-fourths majority.  Whether the matter be voting rights, the basis of distributing profits, the basis of dividing surplus assets on a winding up, preferential rights in relation to profits or to surplus assets, or any other question affecting mutual interests, it is apparent that though the subject matter is among the most conspicuous of those governed by articles and therefore of those to which the statutory power is directed yet it involves little if anything more than the redetermination of the rights and interests of those to whom the power is committed.  No-one supposes that in voting each shareholder is to assume an inhuman altruism and consider only the intangible notion of the benefit of the vague abstraction called by Lord <span style="font-style:italic">Robertson</span> in <span style="font-style:italic">Baily’s Case</span> ([1906] AC, at p. 39), “the company as an institution”.  An investigation of the thoughts and motives of each shareholder voting with the majority would be an impossible proceeding.  When the purpose of a resolution is spoken of, a phrase is used which refers rather to some characteristic implicit in the resolution in virtue of the circumstances or of some larger transaction of which it formed a part or step.  It is not far removed from what Lord <span style="font-style:italic">Sumner</span> called “one of those so-called intentions which the law imputes … the legal construction put on something done in fact” (<span style="font-style:italic">Inland Revenue Commissioners v Blott</span> [1921] 2 AC, at p. 218).  But, when the very question to be determined is a conflict of interests, unless the subject matter is held outside the power, the purpose of the resolution, as distinguished from the motives of the individuals, often must be to resolve the conflict in favour of one and against the other interest. </p>

This is because the interests of the Members of the LLP were brought so directly into consideration by those bodies by virtue of the fact that they were made up of people who either were the Individual Members (the Defendants) or were “representatives” of the Corporate Member (so that there was no radical separation of roles as between directors and shareholders as there may be in a company situation) and because the case was focused on the problem which arises here, of how to assess the content of fiduciary obligations owed to a notionally distinct corporate entity but where in reality one can see that behind that distinct entity a decision balancing the competing interests amalgamated in that entity is called for.  </p>

In that case, lenders under a loan facility agreement were divided into three separate classes with potentially differing interests. A term of the agreement provided that it could be amended by the vote of a two-thirds majority of the lenders by value. An amendment was voted through against the objections of certain minority lenders, who complained that it discriminated against them as a class by exposing them to an unfair degree of risk in relation to recovery of the lending. The court found that the power of amendment had been properly exercised. At para. [105] Rimer J said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“I derive from these two authorities that, at least in a case such as the present, where there is a clear potential for conflicting interests between the three classes of lenders, an assessment of the validity of a majority decision exclusively by reference to whether or not it is ‘for the benefit of the lenders as a whole’ is, at any rate if those words are applied according to their literal meaning, a misplaced one.  The vice against which control on the exercise of majority power is directed is the potential for a dishonest abuse of that power.  The starting point in assessing the validity of its exercise in any case must be to assess, by reference to all available evidence, whether the power is being exercised in good faith for the purpose for which it was conferred.  If it is, then the mere fact that it can be shown that a minority of those affected by it have been relatively disadvantaged by it as compared with the majority cannot automatically mean it has been exercised improperly.  Of course, if it can be shown that the power has been exercised for the purpose of conferring special collateral benefits on the majority, or if the obtaining of such collateral benefits can be shown to have been the motive for the exercise of the power, that will be likely to lead to a conclusion that the exercise has been bad.  It would not have been exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred, and its exercise in those circumstances would or might amount to a fraud on the minority.  Equally, if the exercise of the power can be shown to have been motivated by a malicious wish to damage or oppress the interests of the minority adversely affected by it, then that too will vitiate the exercise, since that too will clearly amount to the commission of fraud on the minority, which is also obviously outside the scope and purpose of the power.” </p>

Given the interests which the LLP was intended to serve and the way in which the parties intended those interests to be balanced within the governance structures of the LLP, there was no ready set of alternative Board members whose judgment of what the LLP should do would be uncontaminated by consideration of either self-interest or the interests of F&amp;C (so, for example, although in relation to the decision in early 2009 how a balance should be struck between salary and bonuses in the remuneration packages of LLP employees each side accused the other of having improper regard to their own self-interest, neither side suggested that the other should not play any part in taking the decision, knowing full well that the same objection could be levelled against their own involvement in taking it: see paras.

This is highly dependent on the particular factual circumstances in which the question what to do might arise. Whilst not being able to specify precisely in advance what they could or could not do is somewhat frustrating, that is simply a function of the blurring of roles which the parties intended should occur within the LLP and the usual flexibility of equitable standards of conscionable behaviour once one moves away from the clear paradigm fiduciary relationships, especially where those standards fall to be applied in relation to the management of a business in a relationship which was intended to continue over a substantial period of time and which would have to adapt to meeting a wide range of often unforeseen business situations. </p>

Both provisions required the Corporate Member to make additional capital contributions to the LLP “upon the request of the Board” where “in the reasonable opinion of the Board” certain circumstances had arisen. On one view, since F&amp;C was underwriting the capital of the LLP in this way, it might be said that LLP Board members should always have been willing to take adventurous business decisions, knowing that if they went wrong F&amp;C would have to provide a safety net and ensure that the LLP could continue to operate </p>

If it came to a decision of the LLP Board under these provisions, it might be said that from the point of view of the LLP it would always be in the interests of the LLP to have more of F&amp;C’s money. But I do not consider that these provisions were intended to create a form of blank cheque for the LLP to call for funds; rather, the parties contemplated that in making the assessment whether a demand for more funds should be made, the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board would be entitled to give weight to the interests of F&amp;C as a major interest holder in and the primary funder of the LLP so as, for example, to vote against making a demand for funds if they considered that they were likely to be wasted on loss making activities.  A similar point could also be made about the marketing fees payable by the LLP to Holdings in relation to the marketing services provided by F&amp;C: clause 13.7 of the Agreement provided that the fees could be amended by unanimous decision of the LLP Board, and the parties could not sensibly have thought that the F&amp;C representatives on the Board would be obliged to vote in favour of reducing or eliminating those fees (as exclusive reference to the interests of the LLP might suggest should happen), without having regard to the countervailing interest of F&amp;C that it should be paid for the marketing services it provided as the parties had agreed should happen. </p>

In my view, following on from the discussion above, the F&amp;C representatives on those bodies were entitled to take the interests of F&amp;C into account alongside those of the LLP as a distinct entity, but not so as wholly to subordinate the interests of the LLP to those of F&amp;C.  In practical terms this means that they were obliged to strive to maintain a fair balance between the distinct interests of the Defendants and F&amp;C bundled up collectively in the LLP. They were also entitled to give weight to the interests of the LLP in being linked to the F&amp;C Group, such that the LLP could be expected to benefit from being closely allied to a strong F&amp;C. In light of that, the view could legitimately be taken that sometimes a degree of restraint by the LLP in pursuing its interests, so as to assist F&amp;C in the pursuit of its wider interests, might overall be in the interests of the LLP.  </p>

In that case, in 1946 the appellant society, in conjunction with the respondents on the appeal, established a subsidiary company to carry on the manufacture and sale of rayon cloth. The involvement of the respondents was critical to the success of the business at that time, since it enabled the subsidiary to obtain licences for the production of rayon cloth when the industry was tightly and restrictively regulated. The respondents had a minority shareholding in the subsidiary company. The society appointed three directors of the company as its nominee directors. The business was a success, and as regulation of the industry was relaxed came to depend less on the involvement of the respondents. The society sought to buy out their interest in the company at a low value, which offer was refused. The society then decided on a policy to transfer the company’s business to a department of its own. The three nominee directors were aware of this policy, but did not inform the respondents about it and took steps to promote it. As a result, the business of the company came to a virtual standstill. This was held to be conduct by the society of the affairs of the company in a manner oppressive to part of the members, contrary to section 210 of the Companies Act 1948, and the society was therefore ordered to buy out the interest of the respondents in the company.  </p>

This formulation appeared to suggest that obligations of disclosure were confined to (iv), but it is not difficult to see that it might also be argued that some obligation of disclosure of information could arise under the obligation at (i).

The question is of practical significance, for example, in relation to consideration of the extent of the obligation of the F&amp;C representatives to inform the LLP acting by its Board or ManCom about matters bearing on the marketing of its products. A lot of information passed across Mr Ribeiro’s desk pertaining to the marketing of all F&amp;C branded products (including those of the LLP), such as reports by F&amp;C’s distribution personnel about discussions with clients about their investment plans and so forth. This information could have a bearing on the LLP, even when the LLP had not been discussed (since that would tend to indicate that no investments in LLP products might be forthcoming from particular clients). Apart from this, but still bearing on the marketing of the LLP’s products along with other F&amp;C branded products, was the policy decision taken by F&amp;C on 20 August 2008 to move to an “open architecture” distribution model (paras.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">According to the logic of Mr Thompson’s wide formulation of the duty of disclosure in relation to F&amp;C’s representatives in the LLP, all this material should have been disclosed by Mr Ribeiro to the LLP. The difficulty with this submission is that it does not take proper account of the context against which the content of the fiduciary obligations in this case falls to be assessed and it is out of touch with practical reality, as the parties understood the Agreement and how the LLP should operate from its inception. The Defendants never suggested during their involvement with the LLP from 2004 that they should be given a detailed account of F&amp;C’s dealings with its clients, for example by having all reports on client contacts copied to them (nor did they plead any such case). This is a relevant factor to be taken into account in gauging what was the reasonable expectation of the parties of the extent to which the conscience of the F&amp;C representatives would be engaged in terms of any requirement of disclosure of information. The Defendants did not bargain for themselves or the LLP to have a specific general right of disclosure of such information (contrast the right to information contained in clause 13.8 of the Agreement with the absence of any specific right to information relating to F&amp;C’s exercise of discretion in the marketing of the LLP’s products in clause 13.7). The contractually stipulated protection for the LLP was that Holdings would “show the utmost good faith” (clause 13.6), but this did not extend to include an obligation to provide a detailed account of F&amp;C’s dealings with its clients (see paras. [255]-[259 below). The marketing of the LLP’s products was a matter left to the discretion of F&amp;C (clause 13.7), rather than requiring decisions to be made by the LLP, and was not an area where F&amp;C or the F&amp;C representatives acted as agents or on behalf of the LLP (so as to be expected to give a detailed account to the LLP of what was being done with each client).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The point may be spelled out in this way in relation to Mr Ribeiro, by way of example. He was involved in the management of the LLP only because he was appointed as a representative of Holdings, and not by reason of any distinct personal capacity. His knowledge of matters affecting the LLP may properly be regarded as the knowledge of Holdings in its dealings with the LLP. The extent of Holdings’ relevant obligation to the LLP regarding disclosure of information (along with other matters) is the obligation of utmost good faith contained in clause 13.6 of the Agreement. It would be an adventitious addition to the LLP’s rights of disclosure of information if in this context Mr Ribeiro were found to have imposed upon him an obligation to disclose wider categories of information relating to F&amp;C than Holdings was obliged to disclose under clause 13.6. As regards the marketing of its products, the LLP’s reasonable expectations regarding disclosure of information were primarily framed by its rights under clause 13.6. It could expect to look to Holdings for disclosure of appropriate information under that provision, supplied usually via Mr Ribeiro, and could not reasonably expect him to be subject to a further obligation to supply more information than that. Since the LLP had been accorded suitable express contractual rights governing such matters, Mr Ribeiro could not reasonably be regarded as having a wider fiduciary role to account to it for information regarding such matters.    </p>

The same process of reasoning also indicates that Mr Ribeiro owed no fiduciary duty to inform the LLP of the detail of the internal debates within F&amp;C regarding how it might conduct its relationship with the LLP. I consider that the error in Mr Thompson’s approach is to assume at the start of the analysis that there is a fixed standard of disclosure required of all fiduciaries, and then to say that there is no basis for finding any implied term to cut down that standard; whereas in my opinion the proper approach here is to analyse what precise fiduciary obligations could reasonably be expected to apply in the particular context created by the Agreement, without making any assumption at the outset what they should be.  </p>

(There was virtually no analysis in the submissions or evidence relevant to the question of what obligations of confidentiality might have been owed in relation to any item of information; the relevant assessment of the confidentiality position could be complex in a multi-partite context, where the interests of the LLP, Holdings, the F&amp;C Group generally and its clients might all be relevant to working out the reasonable expectations of each party about what could be disclosed and to whom). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, Mr Thompson maintained a narrower alternative case, that even if Mr Ribeiro did not have a general fiduciary obligation to disclose all details of F&amp;C’s marketing efforts he did have an obligation to disclose the decision taken on 20 August 2009. I found this submission more persuasive. In my view Mr Ribeiro did have a fiduciary obligation as a member of the LLP Board and ManCom to inform the LLP acting by its Board and ManCom about the policy decision on 20 August 2008 to move to an “open architecture” distribution model. This was a policy decision with wide implications and of potentially profound significance for the LLP which went well beyond the ordinary day-to-day running of marketing to clients referred to above. It was recognised within F&amp;C and by Mr Ribeiro as a major change in F&amp;C’s approach to marketing F&amp;C branded products. In my judgment, such a decision going to the heart of the general marketing approach which the LLP could henceforth expect to be applied by F&amp;C in the exercise of its discretion under clause 13.7 of the Agreement, and which might have a general and substantial effect on the likelihood that investments would be made in the LLP’s products, was a matter which Mr Ribeiro could reasonably be expected to disclose to the LLP. By virtue of clause 13.6 of the Agreement there was also an obligation upon Holdings (acting by Mr Ribeiro) to disclose such information, with no expectation that it could be regarded by F&amp;C as confidential as against the LLP.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The parties themselves defined a principal obligation of the Corporate Member owed to the LLP as being an obligation of utmost good faith (clause 13.6 of the Agreement). This was a contractual duty analogous to a fiduciary duty, owed by Holdings as, in effect, representative of the F&amp;C Group. It is a form of contractual duty which requires the obligor to have regard to the interests of the obligee, while also being entitled to have regard to its own self-interest when acting: <span style="font-style:italic">Macquarie International Health Clinic Pty Ltd v Sydney South West Area Health Service </span>[2010] NSWCA 268, paras. [13] and [147]. Clause 13.6 represented the parties’ own statement of how the competing interests of F&amp;C and the LLP should be reconciled, and in my view provides a sound guide for the court in working out the practical content of the fiduciary obligation to be imposed on the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board so far as concerns the provision of information available to them from their involvement with F&amp;C and its decision-making processes. The Defendants did not bargain for and the Agreement did not provide for any obligation that specific categories of information should be provided by F&amp;C to the LLP (e.g. in the form of a running account of all marketing efforts with clients under clause 13.7 of the Agreement).  The Defendants could not reasonably expect that the F&amp;C representatives would disclose to the LLP every item of information about F&amp;C’s actions or decision-making which might affect the LLP. On the contrary, it was to be expected that F&amp;C should have some private space to consider its own interests internally before acting. What the Defendants could reasonably expect was that the F&amp;C representatives would disclose the sort of matters which the F&amp;C Group (represented by Holdings) was itself required to provide under clause 13.6. This expectation was also reinforced by the fact that everyone expected Mr Ribeiro, the main representative of F&amp;C on the LLP Board, to act as the agent for Holdings in its dealings with the LLP, so that his fiduciary obligation to the LLP in relation to provision of information could be expected to conform to the obligation of Holdings under clause 13.6 in that regard (see paras.

But in my opinion, when Area Health’s planning processes would make a substantial difference to what MHC and/or Macquarie could reasonably expect concerning the flow of persons between the hospitals or the creation of a campus concept, the obligation of utmost good faith would require that MHC and/or Macquarie be informed of this, at least to enable them to take account of it in the design and construction of the works contemplated by the HOA.” </p>

This was the essence of the bargain which they made, and it is appropriate that it should inform the content of the fiduciary obligations assumed by the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board, ManCom and Compensation Committee as set out above. The adoption of such a standard of conduct made sense in the context of an arrangement which sought to marry together the disparate strengths of the Defendants and F&amp;C through the vehicle of the LLP in a relationship intended to last a long time (and which therefore required considerable flexibility of application to cope with the wide range of unforeseeable business challenges which might arise), where they were each required to have regard to the legitimate interests of the other parties to the Agreement while at the same time being entitled to take into account their own self-interest.  </p>

The decision of 20 August 2008 was a major strategic decision which had the potential to make a substantial difference to what the LLP could reasonably expect concerning the flow of business to it, and so fell into a category of information which ought to have been disclosed by Holdings under clause 13.6 of the Agreement and by Mr Ribeiro under his fiduciary obligation of disclosure. </p>

As regards  the Defendants’ claim based on their Put Option Notices and the Fourth Schedule, the breach of obligation by Holdings was not of the requisite character (see para. [729] below). As regards the Defendants’ claim under section 994, the breach of fiduciary duty by Mr Ribeiro was inadvertent and not particularly serious; it had no practical impact on the business or business decisions of the LLP (the LLP had no right to prevent the more to “open architecture” relationships with clients, which fell within F&amp;C’s marketing discretion contained in clause 13.7, and the breach of duty by Mr Ribeiro was swiftly overtaken by events, as redemption notices were received from most of the LLP’s clients and any marketing opportunities, whether under “open architecture” arrangements or otherwise, were undermined by market conditions in late 2008, particularly as the markets went into free-fall after the collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September); the Defendants were already forewarned by Mr Niven in March and July 2008 that some such change was likely to be forthcoming and had been given an early opportunity to adapt to it; and if it had become relevant to the LLP’s position as marketing opportunities for its products revived, there is no doubt that the LLP would have had the position explained to it. Therefore, I consider that this aspect of the case adds nothing to the Defendants’ unfair prejudice claim.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept that submission. In my view, it is incumbent on a party who wishes to rely upon an implied term in a contract or an obligation said to arise in relation to the contract actually to plead that term or obligation. The basic function of a pleading is to inform the other side to litigation what case they have to meet in sufficient detail to enable that party to prepare to answer it (see, e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd</span>, unrep., Court of Appeal, 15 December 1994; Report and Recommendations of the Commercial Court Long Trials Working Party, December 2007, paras. 44-49, esp. at 44: “It is obviously imperative that in any litigation a claimant sets out the case it wishes to make so that the other parties to the litigation can see what issues they have to meet and defendants can set out their defences and counterclaims to the claimant’s points”). It is not consistent with that purpose for a party to leave an alleged implied term or any other obligation to be relied upon off the face of the pleadings only to bring forth an argument based upon such a term or obligation in closing submissions. It is nothing to the point that it may be contended that the term is to be implied or the obligation is said to arise as a matter of law (as distinct from by reference to the particular factual context in which the contract was made). The opposing party still needs to know that a case based on such a term or obligation is to be advanced, so as to be in a position to marshal any case it may have to dispute that such a term is to be implied or such obligation arises, to argue about its precise formulation and, as appropriate, to call evidence designed to meet the case being made as to how it may have been breached. I do not read <span style="font-style:italic">AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd</span> nor any of the other authorities referred to by Mr Thompson as diluting this basic function of pleadings where alleged implied terms or other specific obligations are to be relied upon. An express contractual term to be relied upon in proceedings needs to be pleaded; so does a duty of care in a claim in negligence; an implied contractual term or similar obligation to be relied upon should likewise be pleaded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Clause 11.1 is expressed in the passive voice (“There shall be paid to each Member …”), which in a multi-party contract of this kind is significant. The obligation in that provision was not expressed to be solely the obligation of the LLP - if that had been intended, it would have been a simple matter to say, “The LLP shall be under an obligation to pay [etc]”. This basic linguistic point is reinforced by consideration of the context surrounding clause 11.1. It appears in an agreement which provides for Holdings and its representatives to have a great deal of practical power in relation to how the LLP behaves; where the LLP was created as a corporate vehicle to carry on a joint venture between Holdings and the Defendants directed to providing each of them with the benefits stipulated in the Agreement; where it was contemplated that F&amp;C would in practical terms organise payments under clause 11.1 by virtue of its provision of payroll services to the LLP under the Service Agreement; and where, although the payments were stated to be drawings in anticipation of payment of Income Profits, they were still to be made even if there might be no expectation of such profits (cf clauses 9.3.2 and 11.6), if necessary out of the capital provided by Holdings (or to be provided by Holdings, under clauses 8.3 or 8.4). The affairs of the LLP were so bound up with the conduct of Holdings and funding provided by it that on an objective interpretation of clause 11.1 it falls to be construed as an obligation binding on all parties to the Agreement (including Holdings). It should be noted that on this wider interpretation of clause 11.1 for which the Defendants contend, the terms of paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule (requiring there to be a breach of contract involving gross misconduct or gross negligence) would afford Holdings a distinct degree of protection against being found liable to buy out the Defendants’ interests in the LLP under Put Option notices served under that provision. </p>

Mr Ribeiro took this step to put into effect a strategy he had devised on behalf of Holdings, to put pressure on the Defendants for the benefit of Holdings. In my view, Holdings was in breach of clause 11.1 of the Agreement when Mr Ribeiro arranged for the drawings to be withheld on that date. It then becomes relevant to examine the circumstances surrounding that breach in order to determine whether it was of a quality which entitled the Defendants to serve their First Put Option Notices on that date (see paras.

I do not think that is right. The authorities referred to above do not suggest that the implied term is to be formulated in this way. It is unusual for breach of contract to require a subjective mental element of this kind, since the law of contract generally involves adoption of an objective approach to the formation and interpretation of contracts, rather than a subjective approach, and that objective approach informs the meaning to be given to and content of contractual obligations. It is not an answer to an allegation of breach of contract for a party to say that he did not know he was acting in breach. These considerations all point against the limited formulation of the implied term proposed by F&amp;C. Judged on an objective basis, a party to a contract is reasonably entitled to expect that another party to the contract will not actively prevent performance of the contract, whether or not that other party knew that its actions would involve a breach of obligation. </p>

Traditionally, F&amp;C Netherlands’ advice and investment planning were restricted to F&amp;C Group products, which meant that F&amp;C’s own products competed with each other for a place in the investment plans for those clients, but did not have to compete with outside products.

It was proposed that the basis of the relationship would remain an obligation on F&amp;C Netherlands to offer the best investment advice it could, but this time in selecting from a far wide range of products.  This proposed shift to a wider fiduciary management role for F&amp;C Netherlands constituted a major change in the nature of its relationship with these clients.  The proposed change would mean that, under an “open architecture” relationship,  F&amp;C products would now have to compete not just with other F&amp;C products but also with other products in the general market in order to be included in client investment plans. </p>

It can refer to a standard used by an investment manager in constructing an investment portfolio for a client; it can refer to a target for the performance of an investment product (what it is hoped it will achieve); and it can refer to an objective standard of performance (which might be contractually agreed between the product manager and client, e.g. for use in a formula for determining fees to be paid in relation to the performance of the product) where the benchmark offers a suitable proxy for the risk/return profile of the investment product in question (what I will call a “proxy benchmark”).   </p>

Then, if the product’s performance beats its benchmark, it may be inferred that it is due to the investment skill of the manager.  Such benchmarks are typically adopted in relation to long only funds, where there is usually a market index (e.g. of equities within a particular class or sector) which provides a suitable representative standard appropriate for measuring the performance of such long only funds.  Conversely, if there is no straightforward market standard which corresponds to the risk/return profile of an investment product, a proxy benchmark is unlikely to be used.   </p>

The same is true for FoHFs which invest in hedge funds.  Part of the reason hedge funds are marketed as absolute return products is so that their managers are free to pursue their individual investment strategies rather than being obliged broadly to follow the general market.  There are some market indices for hedge funds, including the Credit Suisse First Boston Tremont index (“the CSFB Tremont index”), but because of the wide differentiation in investment strategies between hedge funds these can provide only a very rough and ready indication of how the hedge fund sector generally is performing.   </p>

There was nothing untoward about this.  As Mr Niven and Mr Kramer explained, other institutional investors for whom F&amp;C had no responsibility adopted the same practice when specifying benchmarks for their hedge fund or FoHF investments. Use of benchmarks based on bank interest rate figures is common for hedge funds and FoHFs: see the discussion in F-S Lhabitant, <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook of Hedge Funds</span> (2006), at para. 21.4.1, p. 509, and in the chapter entitled “Evaluating the Performance of Your Hedge Funds” by Vinh Q.

In particular, the Defendants complained that this led to an absence of proper marketing efforts by F&amp;C in relation to LLP products after redemption notices had been put in by clients in late 2008 to withdraw their money from the Select Fund. This was at a time when, according to the Defendants, there would have been a good prospect, if F&amp;C and F&amp;C Netherlands took proper marketing steps, to have persuaded at least some of the clients to withdraw those notices. The Defendants make a similar complaint in relation to the opportunity presented to clients in early December 2008 to switch their investments from the leveraged Select Fund into the comparatively less risky Balanced Fund. This was at a time when, according to the Defendants, there would have been a good prospect, if proper marketing had been undertaken, of persuading at least some of the clients to switch their investments into the Balanced Fund rather than withdrawing them from the LLP’s funds altogether.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the Defendants’ submission, F&amp;C and F&amp;C Netherlands chose to omit to market the LLP’s funds at this critical juncture because they feared that the Dutch investors would look back at the Euribor benchmark they had been advised by F&amp;C Netherlands to choose when investing in the Select Fund and would – if the true risk profile of the Balanced and Select Funds were now explained to them – suddenly realise that they had been led by F&amp;C Netherlands to invest in a risky investment product in the form of the Select Fund rather than a product as risk-free as holding cash.  The Defendants’ suggestion was that F&amp;C and F&amp;C Netherlands thought that advising the Dutch institutional investors to use the 3 month Euribor rate as the relevant benchmark could have led them to believe that investment in the Select Fund was as risk-free as investment in a bank deposit account and that to explain to them in late 2008 or 2009 that that was not the case and to explain in 2008 or 2009 the true risk associated with the Select and Balanced Funds might have galvanised the Dutch clients into bringing expensive mis-selling claims against F&amp;C Netherlands.  Therefore, so the argument ran, F&amp;C and F&amp;C Netherlands deliberately failed to market the LLP’s products to those clients at that time, in breach of the obligation under clause 13.7 of the Agreement.</p>

First, there had in fact been no mis-selling of the LLP’s products by F&amp;C Netherlands or any other F&amp;C entity to the Dutch clients when they invested in the Select Fund, and that was clear to F&amp;C and F&amp;C Netherlands. Therefore, they had no reason to be concerned about possible mis-selling and it is implausible to suppose that any such concern affected their choices as to how to proceed in relation to those clients in late 2008 and 2009.   </p>

They therefore had to seek advice from the LLP – in particular, from Mr Barthelemy – about its FoHF products, with a view to passing on the information to the clients by way of general explanation of the products or in answer to questions posed by particular clients.   </p>

Mr Barthelemy supplied detailed answers to the questionnaire as he had been asked to do.  In response to the question, “Is there a benchmark for this fund? If so, which?”, he wrote, “As we are absolute return, we don’t follow a benchmark but for performance measurement purposes there are a few available such as MSCI, HFR or Barclays Fund of HFs”.  He was there making the basic point referred to at para. [290] above.  In his answers he also explained the risk/return profiles of the Select Fund (“an expected return of 10% and an expected volatility of 10%”) and the Balanced Fund (for which the figures were 5% and 5% respectively).  It was thus expressly made clear that the risk/return profile for both Funds was very different from that of a cash deposit.   </p>

This fee structure again made it clear by implication that investment in the LLP’s FoHF products could not be regarded as equivalent to placing money in a cash deposit at bank.  The fees were very different in structure from, and in practice likely to be far greater than, any fees which would be charged by a bank for holding a cash deposit (usually, of course, a bank would pay interest to the fund holder on such a deposit and not expect a net payment from the fund holder).   </p>

Euribor is easy to get and is aligned with the absolute return of the fund but you are absolutely correct in pointing out that it will not be a good measure for an asset that will by definition experience some form of volatility.  Again, there are a few hedge fund indices available on Bloomberg such as the CSFB Tremont Investable index or the Hennessee Global hedge fund index.  Generally though it is important to keep in mind that the hedge fund universe does not lend itself to rigorous index calculations – as a result some qualitative analysis is required to understand the particular behaviour of any of the indices mentioned above.

He gave reasons why Euribor could appropriately be used as the benchmark for other purposes, since it was an objective figure readily available in the public domain and could be regarded as a simple measure of whether the funds had met their basic absolute return objective.  But he also correctly and clearly confirmed the clients’ view that it would not represent a proxy benchmark, precisely because the LLP’s funds would experience volatility (i.e. risk to which a cash deposit would not be exposed).

Their investments in the Select Fund were, in each case, only a small part of their overall portfolio, but their losses on the Select Fund had been particularly bad (as Mr Kramer put it, it was one of the worst “bleeders” within their portfolios). Moreover, the Select and Balanced Funds appeared to have completely failed to live up to their own stated fundamental investment objective of being funds which would generate absolute returns (there did not seem, in late 2008 or early 2009, to be the remotest prospect that they could recover the losses suffered in 2008 in the short or even medium term). F&amp;C Netherlands and their clients felt that the LLP Funds were a form of investment carrying significant risks, which had been exposed as not living up to their billing as absolute return products which would exhibit a lack of correlation with the performance of equity or bond markets. It was their supposed absolute return nature which had provided the principal justification for their inclusion in the general investment portfolio of an institutional client as a way of balancing the client’s portfolio and providing some protection against investment risks associated with those markets. That justification fell away with the poor performance of the LLP Funds in late 2008.   </p>

Having started 2008 with a healthy ratio of assets to future liabilities and good liquidity, so they could be confident of meeting their liabilities to make pension or insurance payments on a current basis and fully over the extended periods they had to plan for, the collapse in the markets in late 2008 played havoc with their ratios of assets to liabilities and ready liquidity to make ongoing payments as they accrued due disappeared.  The unsurprising reaction of these clients was to try desperately to limit the risks in their general portfolios by getting out of riskier products and to seek liquidity by selling or redeeming investments. These commercial factors were reinforced for Dutch pension funds by regulatory requirements of the Dutch authorities, requiring them to maintain stipulated assets to liability ratios and acceptable liquidity. F&amp;C Netherlands had to provide their clients with investment advice to assist them to pursue their new, pressing objectives in the market conditions which had arisen. </p>

It carried substantial risk (as had been shown by its precipitous fall in value in 2008), investment in it was illiquid (three months’ notice to withdraw was required to be given at set quarterly periods in the year), it had failed to meet its stated investment objective as an absolute return fund by a very substantial margin, it was a comparatively unfamiliar investment product (and so difficult to explain to the regulators, pensioners and the boards of pension funds) and it was comparatively expensive.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the judgment of F&amp;C Netherlands, based on hard experience of client reactions to the general market situation and client priorities emerging in light of that situation, the Dutch institutional clients were in no mood to consider product pitches by F&amp;C Netherlands to press them to consider remaining invested in the Select Fund or to consider switching to the Balanced Fund.  In the words of Mr De Groot, in the context of the market falls in late 2008, the great stress that had been placed upon F&amp;C Netherlands’ institutional clients and the particularly poor performance of the Select Fund in which they were invested, if he had tried to raise with them the possibility of remaining in the Select Fund or switching to another LLP FoHF product, the Balanced Fund, they would have regarded it as an insult. It was not remotely viable for F&amp;C Netherlands to seek to do that while retaining any credibility with and the respect of their clients.  </p>

As explained below, this involved no breach of obligation under clause 13.7 of the Agreement. </p>

They pointed out that if one took the Balanced Fund and compared its performance in 2008 with the performance of the range of the F&amp;C’s other funds (the great majority of which were long only funds), the Balanced Fund had performed better than most of those other funds.  Therefore, it was suggested, it would have been rational for investors to wish to invest in the Balanced Fund in late 2008 and early 2009, and the fact that they did not have such an argument put to them and did not invest showed that F&amp;C’s decision not to market at least the Balanced Fund actively had been taken improperly, with a view to harming the LLP’s business, and had in fact harmed its business.   </p>

His evidence was that the Balanced Fund was a marketable proposition in early 2009, in the period before the overt eruption of the dispute between the parties when the Defendants served their First Put Option Notices on 25 February 2009.   </p>

The Defendants’ comparison with the performance of the Balanced Fund in 2008 with the performance of other F&amp;C products fails to take account of the fundamental difference between products marketed as absolute return products (like the Balanced and Select Funds) and products marketed on the basis of their relative performance to certain benchmark indices (typically, long only investment funds where the index benchmark will frequently be a suitable proxy benchmark).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">When general markets fell steeply in 2008, clients expected F&amp;C’s relative performance products to fall with them, as they did. But one of the main arguments for investing in an expensive absolute return product such as the LLP Funds had been that they were supposed to produce absolute returns and not to fall along with general markets as relative performance funds would do.  The fact that the LLP’s absolute return products had failed to meet client expectations in that regard made it unsurprising that clients should have lost confidence in them and consequently unsurprising that F&amp;C Netherlands’ distribution team should assess that the time was not propitious for seeking to market the Balanced Fund to new investors or to persuade existing investors in the Select Fund (who had had their fingers badly burned by the LLP’s failure to meet their expectations in relation to the performance of that fund) to switch to another LLP FoHF product, albeit a less leveraged one.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The argument for new or continued investment in the Balanced Fund was not a strong one.  Even when times were good, between 2005 and 2007, the LLP itself had not had significant success in attracting investors who had no pre-existing connection with F&amp;C (and the only such investor in the Pushkin Fund had also withdrawn its investment in late 2008).  The F&amp;C clients who had been persuaded to invest in the LLP products up to 2008, now, in the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, had what they regarded as compelling reasons to withdraw from them as set out above.  The evidence is that they wished to withdraw from FoHFs and hedge funds altogether at that time, so the fact that the Balanced Fund could be regarded as having achieved average performance for that asset class would not have been an argument with any realistic prospect of success.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the context of these complaints by the Defendants, I should comment on the scope of F&amp;C’s obligation under clause 13.7 of the Agreement to provide marketing services to the LLP.  The obligation of Holdings (representing F&amp;C) was to provide “general marketing support as determined at the discretion of [Holdings] … using the existing marketing operations of the F&amp;C Group”.  F&amp;C’s existing marketing operations included the whole process of maintaining good links with its existing customers, including meeting with them from time to time to discuss their investment wishes and requirements and providing them with advice about F&amp;C products and (as F&amp;C’s relationship with their clients came to shift to an “open architecture” model with a greater element of fiduciary management) about other products in the market.   </p>

This provision allowed F&amp;C to balance what it regarded as the effective and proper handling of its relationship with its clients, including by ensuring that they were presented with advice appropriate for them, with the promotion of the LLP’s products according to its (F&amp;C’s) own judgment.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The provision did not give F&amp;C an absolute discretion to do what it liked – it could not act in bad faith or for reasons unrelated to the proper and effective handling of its relationship with any client and nor could it act in a wholly unreasonable way in deciding how to proceed in marketing in relation to the LLP’s products. However, it did allow F&amp;C to decide not to press clients to invest or remain invested in the LLP’s FoHF products at times when, in F&amp;C’s honest judgment, it would be inappropriate or counterproductive to do so, and allowed F&amp;C instead to wait until circumstances seemed more propitious before doing so.  F&amp;C was not obliged to try to engage in pressurised selling of the LLP’s products if that might, for example, jeopardize a client’s sense of trust and confidence in F&amp;C as an adviser and as a provider of appropriate investment strategies and products tailored to that client’s assessment of its own needs.  To proceed to market products in a way which might jeopardize the underlying client relationship would be counterproductive for F&amp;C and also the LLP.  The LLP’s interests were safeguarded to a degree by their alignment with F&amp;C’s in terms of the sharing of fee income under the Fifth Schedule to the Agreement, but F&amp;C retained the power to decide how its client relationships should be conducted and what investment products should be pushed most strongly at any particular time to satisfy its clients and meet their needs.   </p>

F&amp;C fund managers competed against each other for a place on F&amp;C Distribution’s list of “front foot products” – those investment products thought to be particularly appropriate to present to clients for their consideration.  As F&amp;C’s client relationships came to include a stronger fiduciary management element during 2008 and 2009, all F&amp;C branded products also had to compete with external investment products for a place in the recommendations made by F&amp;C’s distribution and strategy teams.   </p>

Once it was clear (as it was shortly thereafter, at least from early March 2009 when the Part 7 claim was commenced) that the matters giving rise to the service of that Notice were not going to be swiftly resolved and the Notice was not going to be withdrawn, it was no longer practicable for the LLP’s FoHF products to be marketed with any likelihood of success.  Any new investor would be likely to ask whether there was any litigation on foot affecting the LLP and would have to be told about the dispute. Indeed, in all probability they would have had to be told about the dispute even if they did not ask.  Moreover, on 12 April 2009 there was press coverage in <span style="font-style:italic">The Mail on Sunday</span> about the dispute.  It was not possible to suppress the information.   </p>

As explained above (para. [12]), it is central to a FoHF business that it has skilled management, good at selecting hedge funds to invest in and in adopting an effective investment strategy.  By their First Put Option Notices of 25 February 2009, the Defendants gave notice that they considered that F&amp;C was in serious breach of contract and was obliged to buy out their interest in the LLP, in which case there could be no realistic expectation that they would stay to manage the business.  There was no identified replacement management team on hand with a proven successful track record who could replace the Defendants to manage the LLP’s business.  To recruit a successful management team from another FoHF business would be very expensive and there was no-one in the frame likely to wish to move to the LLP.  To try to promote managers from within the LLP (such as Mr Sparks) or the F&amp;C Group would not have been attractive to investors, since they did not have the requisite experience nor a proven track record of success to persuade investors to put significant funds under their care in the specialist hedge fund market.   </p>

On any view, while they remained locked in such a serious dispute with F&amp;C regarding the running and ownership of the business, their attention was likely to be diverted from management of the LLP’s FoHF portfolio to arguing with F&amp;C.

In fact, Mr Sparks had been working on a CTA project for the LLP since about 2007, to develop a mathematical model which might be suitable as a foundation for a CTA trading strategy.

In his view, the proper location for any single strategy hedge fund to be offered as an F&amp;Cbranded product to clients would be in the Alternative Investments division of F&amp;C, headed by Ms Hall.  It was in that division that all F&amp;C’s single strategy hedge funds were located and managed.  Mr Ribeiro considered that the original arrangement with the Defendants was that they should run a FoHF under the F&amp;C brand, not single strategy hedge funds.  That was the expertise which they offered to F&amp;C at the outset and they had not acquired expertise in running single strategy hedge funds or a CTA fund since then. </p>

Although I do not accept that anything was said or done which qualified clause 4.1(4) of the Agreement, I do find that there were general discussions between F&amp;C and the Defendants at the time the Agreement was under negotiation in which the concern of F&amp;C to maintain coherence in the organisation and presentation of F&amp;C branded financial products by keeping single strategy hedge funds in Ms Hall’s separate Alternative Investments division was explained to the Defendants. This was a legitimate concern of F&amp;C. In the light of this concern and the way it had been brought to the attention of the Defendants before the Agreement was signed, I consider that Mr Ribeiro’s firm view that any single strategy hedge fund carrying the F&amp;C brand, including any new proposed CTA fund, should be located in Ms Hall’s unit and not as a new product in the LLP, was a reasonable one.   </p>

This remained a purely speculative idea.  The F&amp;C representatives were entitled to conclude in 2009, as they did, that the LLP should focus its efforts on trying to sustain its FoHF business.  That was its core business and the area in which the Defendants had proven expertise.  In fact, although the Defendants toyed with the idea of the LLP offering fiduciary services (i.e. an advisory service to clients to assist them to choose a hedge fund portfolio for themselves) – which would have made use of their skills – they themselves decided against a proposal in that form, and that was not a proposal that fell to be overruled or voted upon by F&amp;C’s representatives on the LLP Board or ManCom.  The Defendants concluded that the fees which the LLP could charge for such a service would be very much less than it could charge as the manager of a FoHF business and that to offer such a service would potentially provide clients with a cheaper alternative to investing in the LLP’s FoHF products and so could undermine that side of the business. On 20 May 2009 the Defendants’ proposal was to offer the services of the LLP to clients to help select a wider range of investment products, but the proposal was not worked up with any significant detail and suffered from the fact that the LLP had no particular skill or expertise in carrying on such a wider investment role.

In practical terms a QFII licence would have to be obtained by F&amp;C, and would not be available to the LLP itself. It would require significant investment of resources by F&amp;C to make an application for such a licence. Therefore, the availability of such a product for the LLP was dependent upon the Defendants persuading F&amp;C that it would be in its interests to assist the LLP to launch such a product.  At the outset, Mr Mendez de Vigo and F&amp;C were helpful in providing the LLP with a good deal of assistance to develop the idea for a QFII platform for its business.  However, the application for a QFII licence had not yet been made when the severe turbulence in the latter part of September 2008 hit the markets.  The QFII licence to be applied for from the Chinese authorities would allow for investment of $500 million.  F&amp;C pressed the Defendants for assurances that they would be able to achieve a level of $300 million initial investment from interested hedge funds to whom they had been speaking.   </p>

On the face of the English translation of the relevant regulations with which I was provided, it did not appear that that was a strict legal requirement.  Nonetheless, the making of a full application to the Chinese authorities would take up a great deal of time and effort on the part of F&amp;C and given the importance for any foreign investor of gaining acceptance by the Chinese regulatory authorities (whose confidence in the suitability of a licensee to be allowed a portal into the Chinese market might be undermined if a licence was applied for but not utilised to a very substantial degree), and given that the application was to be made in the name of an F&amp;C entity rather than the LLP itself, I am satisfied that F&amp;C’s concern to be assured that the QFII licence would be substantially utilised from the outset was a genuine and legitimate one.   </p>

They had become good friends while working together and in 2004 were looking to utilise their skills as FoHF managers by setting up a FoHF business of their own in partnership with an established asset management group.  They made approaches to a number of potential partners.  Their approach to F&amp;C bore fruit.  Mr Ribeiro at F&amp;C was looking to add FoHF products to the range of F&amp;C-branded investment products which F&amp;C could offer to its clients and the Defendants’ proposal offered an attractive means for F&amp;C to enter the FoHF market.   </p>

Within F&amp;C Mr Ribeiro was the champion of the LLP.  It was he who thought it was a good idea for F&amp;C to add F&amp;C-branded FoHF products to its range of products in order to provide additional investment options for its institutional clients and it was he who presented the idea for a partnership with the Defendants, in the form of the LLP, to the decision-makers within F&amp;C.

It also helps to explain the intense frustration he felt at that time when the Defendants did not adopt what he thought was a sensible (indeed, in his view, probably the only sensible) approach to enable the LLP’s business to survive, by cutting costs significantly by making staff redundant and hunkering down until the economic storm had passed and it could rebuild its fund performance and business again.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ribeiro explained that he sought ideas from Mr Tilson because F&amp;C was at this time considering whether to seek to buy out the Defendants’ interests in the LLP. I do not consider that that provides any justification for his actions, but rather supports the inference that he did ask Mr Tilson to provide ideas as to how the interests of the Defendants in respect of the LLP might be undermined and those of F&amp;C promoted. He did not seek to reprimand Mr Tilson for sending him the October 2006 confidential note. </p>

In my judgment, however, there were quite different and innocent reasons for what happened in late 2008 in terms of withdrawal of funds from the LLP’s FoHF products and it is not possible to infer from the circumstances in which the October 2006 confidential note was produced that the withdrawal of funds in late 2008 was affected by any improper motives on the part of those acting for F&amp;C at that time. </p>

F&amp;C was working on the group budgets for 2008 and Mr Ribeiro sought to check with Mr Mendez de Vigo, as the new Head of F&amp;C Distribution, that he was comfortable with the estimate of £600 million net inflow of investment from institutional clients for the LLP to be included in the 2008 budgets.  The LLP had provided this estimate based on figures agreed with F&amp;C Distribution the previous year, before Mr Mendez de Vigo took up his position.  Mr Mendez de Vigo queried the figure and wanted to know how much of the projected inflow was supposed to come from marketing efforts by the LLP itself and how much from efforts by his marketing team at F&amp;C Distribution.  Mr Barthelemy’s response was that most of the contribution was to come from Mr Mendez de Vigo’s marketing team, and he emphasised that they needed to push the Dutch clients to invest more in the LLP’s products.   </p>

The LLP had contractual rights against F&amp;C in relation to marketing its products and I think Mr Barthelemy calculated that, by being a difficult and demanding customer, the LLP could get better service and could press for advantage in the competition with other F&amp;C products for the attention of F&amp;C Distribution to adopt the LLP’s products to be promoted as “front foot” products with the Dutch institutional clients.   </p>

However, with the benefit of hindsight and standing back from the detail, I think it is fair to say that it may not have been an altogether wise strategy for Mr Barthelemy to pursue.

Mr Kramer pressed Mr Mendez de Vigo to open this area up for recommendation of external providers as part of a shift of F&amp;C strategy to a fiduciary service for clients (i.e. to move to open architecture relationships with the clients).  Mr Mendez de Vigo took that proposal forward within F&amp;C.  There was resistance within F&amp;C against the move towards open architecture relationships with its clients (since it would be likely to lead to lower AUM across a range of F&amp;C funds and hence lower overall fees for F&amp;C); but the risk of losing the confidence of clients (and hence of losing the clients altogether) was thought to be too great and eventually, in August 2008, the decision was taken to move in the direction of open architecture relationships with clients (paras.

This was the sort of pressure upon F&amp;C Netherlands about which Mr Niven had warned Mr Barthelemy in March 2008.   </p>

Neither Mr Redeker nor Mr Kramer copied to the Defendants Mr Redeker’s previous e-mail requesting permission for F&amp;C Netherlands to offer clients’ external FoHF products.  I do not think that this was unreasonable.  Mr Barthelemy had already been put on notice by Mr Niven of the risk that that might happen and at that stage no decision had been taken by F&amp;C to move to that model of client relationship.  The matter remained under consideration within F&amp;C.  Within F&amp;C, the LLP’s FoHF products were not being singled out for special treatment, but were considered alongside other problematic F&amp;C products where F&amp;C’s clients were dissatisfied with their performance (including, in particular, F&amp;C’s single strategy hedge funds).  Meanwhile, F&amp;C felt that the Defendants were not doing a good job in presenting a strong case for the LLP’s products. </p>

I reject that suggestion.  In my judgment, Mr Ribeiro was not making a threat but an (accurate) prediction, based upon the LLP’s poor performance and the weakness of the case for investing in its products which had been presented by Mr Barthelemy.  I find that there was no attempt by Mr Ribeiro to influence the behaviour of the F&amp;C Netherlands personnel who advised or exercised discretionary management functions for F&amp;C’s Dutch institutional clients, so as to induce them to issue notices of redemption from the Select Fund.  F&amp;C Netherlands’ advisory team took those decisions for legitimate business reasons, based on their own judgment of how best to proceed in the interests of their clients, in order to provide their clients with freedom of manoeuvre at a point where the LLP funds’ performance had been poor, the market was unsettled and it remained to be seen whether their performance would improve over the three months before the redemption notices took effect (so that clients might be persuaded to remain invested in them). </p>

The F&amp;C Strategy teams in London and F&amp;C Netherlands were to be given free rein to construct, or advise on the construction of, client portfolios for the coming year to include, as judged appropriate, non-F&amp;C competing investment products in these areas.  Where the F&amp;C Strategy teams recommended reallocation from F&amp;C-branded products, that was to be implemented for the whole range of clients.  In order to give the F&amp;C Strategy and Distribution teams the flexibility to reallocate from F&amp;C hedge fund and FoHF products to external or other products, as part of the thorough-going review of client portfolios which was to be undertaken, it was agreed at the meeting that notices of three months for redemption from the F&amp;C hedge fund and FoHF products should be put in place and that actual execution of the notices should depend on the results of those products over the coming months. If their results improved and the F&amp;C Strategy and Distribution teams decided the existing allocation in their clients’ portfolios should remain, they could simply withdraw the notices.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I reject these contentions.  The shift to open architecture arrangements with clients was driven by growing pressure from the Dutch clients themselves, to which F&amp;C felt it had to respond or risk losing those clients.  The shift was not directed at the LLP’s FoHF products specifically, though their poor performance was, along with the poor performance of certain other F&amp;C products, one reason the pressure for change from the Dutch clients had been growing.  The question of whether the Dutch clients should remain invested in the LLP’s products and other F&amp;C branded products was agreed at the meeting as something to be left for the judgment of F&amp;C Strategy, and Mr Ribeiro did not seek to direct them how to behave. The decision that redemption notices should be put in for F&amp;C-branded hedge fund and FoHF products was a natural consequence of the shift to open architecture relationships with clients, since the giving of such notices with a three month period before they could take effect was a necessary pre-condition for the F&amp;C Strategy and Distribution teams to have the flexibility to be able to reallocate the monies invested in those F&amp;C products into external products for the investment plans to be discussed with clients for 2009, if judged appropriate, when the notices expired. The decision at the meeting that F&amp;C Strategy should be free to recommend the putting in of redemption notices was not motivated by any scheme to deprive the LLP of business in order to damage it.  The shift to an open architecture relationship with clients was one which was, as between F&amp;C and the LLP, allowed by the discretion in marketing matters reserved to F&amp;C under clause 13.7 of the Agreement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This assessment of the factual position is powerfully reinforced by the evidence of Mr Kramer and Mr De Groot, to the effect that when decisions came to be made from late August 2008 into November 2008 whether to put in redemption notices for the Dutch clients, it was they who took the decisions (or, in the case of the Achmea own risk portfolios, Achmea itself which decided) without being directed to do so by Mr Ribeiro.  They took those decisions in good faith for commercial reasons to do with providing the best advice and investment strategies for the clients and were not motivated by any plan or desire to damage the LLP.   </p>

The Defendants called attention to this to suggest that Mr Ribeiro had in mind to cause redemption notices to be put in on behalf of clients in order to threaten the LLP’s business. Again, I do not accept that suggestion.  In my view, Mr Ribeiro merely called attention to the rather obvious fact that since the LLP’s funds were performing badly, there was a serious risk that decisions would be taken by clients to pull out of those funds which could, in turn, threaten the viability of the business.  This was not a new point, and Mr Ribeiro’s comment does not support the Defendants’ case that F&amp;C had a scheme to damage the LLP.   </p>

[251] and [258]-[259] above.  I think that he stayed quiet about that and confined himself to the more general statement, quoted above, out of a fear that to be more explicit at that stage might provoke anger and antagonism from the Defendants and put strain on relations between the LLP and F&amp;C at an increasingly difficult time.  I do not consider, however, that this was a reason which justified his suppressing information about the meeting of 20 August, which was of considerable potential significance for the business of the LLP.   </p>

Mr Tilson recorded that the intention was to review the position over a 60-month period (that being the period specified in the Credit Alpha Fund offering memorandum for the amortisation of launch costs).

However, by 7 October nothing had been forthcoming and Mr Ribeiro and Mr Mendez de Vigo agreed that in light of the state of the hedge fund and FoHF industry at that point support for the project was unlikely to be forthcoming from that source, so the QFII opportunity would be withdrawn from the LLP.  This was a decision taken in good faith for legitimate reasons.  The Defendants had been given a fair opportunity to satisfy F&amp;C that they could drum up sufficient investor support to make the venture worthwhile for F&amp;C, but had been unable to do so.  The LLP had no special rights in relation to the QFII project. In fact, the Defendants’ assessment about the difficulties of raising investor support from their contacts at this time was similarly pessimistic, and they did not continue to press for the involvement of the LLP in the QFII project at this stage. F&amp;C was left to develop the project in other ways without the Defendants’ assistance.  </p>

These e-mails support their evidence, in that they show clear contemporaneous reasons on the part of F&amp;C Netherlands and F&amp;C Strategy why redemption notices should be sent and a process of decision-making within F&amp;C Netherlands based on the assessment by F&amp;C Netherlands regarding their clients’ best interests without involvement by Mr Ribeiro (Mr De Groot did not even ask for Mr Ribeiro to be informed of what was to happen, notwithstanding its significance – it was Mr Niven who wanted to alert him, but then decided it was unnecessary). It is also significant that in his e-mail to Mr De Groot, Mr Niven thought that Mr Barthelemy would be after his (Mr Niven’s) blood, since it was he who bore the responsibility for the redemption notices which were now to be sent. </p>

Mr Ribeiro pointed out that if Mr De Groot waited until later in September, the clients would miss the quarterly contractual date for giving notice in September and would be unable to withdraw their funds until April/May the following year.  Contrary to the suggestion of the Defendants, there was nothing improper in Mr Ribeiro sending this e-mail.  In my view, given the decision (of which Mr De Groot had informed him) to withdraw funds from the Select Fund, it was plainly appropriate that Mr Ribeiro – having regard to the clients’ interests – should correct an error which Mr De Groot appeared to be making and provide him with accurate information as to the process which ought to be followed to give effect to that decision.   </p>

Mr Watts asked for Mr Ribeiro’s guidance how to proceed (in particular, if he advised Achmea to proceed with redemptions, he was concerned whether, by extension, F&amp;C Strategy would then have an obligation to give the same advice to Friends Provident, who also invested with the LLP).  Mr Watts later spoke to Mr Ribeiro and it was agreed that F&amp;C would not advise Achmea to put in redemption notices in relation to its own risk accounts.  Achmea was left to make its own decision without input from F&amp;C on this point.  Achmea chose for itself to put in protective redemption notices that day in respect of those accounts.   </p>

Again, it is very difficult to reconcile this stance by F&amp;C (represented by Mr Ribeiro in particular) with the Defendants’ contention that F&amp;C and Mr Ribeiro were determined to seek to damage the business of the LLP by arranging for redemption notices to be served. </p>

It made the point that in the extraordinary market falls at that time, hedge funds had outperformed other assets (as Mr Barthelemy put it: “amazingly, given their abysmal performance”), whilst also acknowledging: “On the negative side hedge funds are supposed to deliver returns irrespective of market behaviour.  But what do you do when markets behave in a way that makes no sense?”  He wrote, “…we don’t know if hedge funds have a future”, but argued that if things stabilised, hedge funds would “have a fantastic time”. He went on: “We believe going forward a lot of clients will be in risk reduction mood so the Balanced Fund will be the better choice for them”.  In his assessment that clients would wish to reduce the risk in their portfolios, Mr Barthelemy was correct, but he was unduly optimistic in thinking they would still have an appetite to remain in FoHF products, even of the less risky type offered by the Balanced Fund. </p>

It was agreed that Mr Ribeiro, Mr Tilson and Mr Culligan would have discussions with a view to producing a revised version.

This reflected the approach being adopted across the F&amp;C Group, which was trying to reduce its costs across all its businesses.  The LLP was by no means singled out for special treatment in this regard - painful cuts were being made elsewhere as well, as part of a group-wide exercise to cut costs developed as a result of the Project Fitness review. </p>

However, F&amp;C’s assessment was that still further major savings (about £15 million p.a.) needed to be achieved across the group. This led F&amp;C to embark upon a second phase of Project Fitness in early November 2008, with Mr Moir again acting as consultant to coordinate the project and help drive the implementation of the costs savings which were identified. The second phase of Project Fitness involved much more painful cutting of costs across the group, particularly by making staff redundant. It was the impact of this phase of Project Fitness in relation to the LLP that precipitated a serious confrontation between the Defendants and Mr Ribeiro for F&amp;C, which escalated quickly and resulted in these legal proceedings.   </p>

These were in the sum of about $98,000.  Mr Ribeiro’s authorisation was required for payment of part of this amount, which he gave.  At the same time, he told Mr Tilson that, pursuant to the arrangement whereby the LLP was to reimburse the Balanced Fund for those costs or some relevant part of them, the costs to be reimbursed should be fully amortised against the profit and loss account of the LLP for 2008 rather than spread over five years between the Balanced Fund and the LLP, as originally proposed, since “we cannot burden future years with this type of costs with such a reduced AUM base”.

He continued to act as champion of the LLP within F&amp;C.  The LLP had been a good source of revenue for F&amp;C and Mr Ribeiro thought it could achieve this again once the market settled down and a period had elapsed for it to rebuild its business.

The words “to liquidate” were then heavily scored out and the words “need agreement” were written underneath.  Mr Moir’s evidence was that the quoted text was a note to himself of a question that he wanted to ask Mr Ribeiro, namely whether a decision should be taken to liquidate the LLP and to tell the Defendants, and that at the meeting Mr Ribeiro answered that the LLP should not be liquidated since the agreement of the Defendants would be needed.

He prepared that from a copy of his notes taken from disclosure, where there was no question-mark type notation after the word “liquidate”.  But in his transcript he included a questionmark after the word “liquidate”, all shown as crossed out.  In the witness box he said that he added the question-mark in the transcript - although he accepted that none appeared in the copy of the document he was working from - because it was his recollection that he had gone to the meeting with Mr Ribeiro intending to ask a question.   </p>

She was unable to identify the person who added the question-mark type notation after the word “liquidate”.  Although handwriting had been added at different times in different pens on various pages of the main notebook and some pages had been extracted from it, assessing the evidence as a whole, I do not think that the notebook had been tampered with in any other respects after the various notes were made in the course of Project Fitness.  The pages which had been removed from the notebook did not interfere with the run of the notes and had probably been removed for some reason before the Project Fitness notes were written. The notes added in different inks on the same page were consistent with Mr Moir using a range of pens and making notes on pages before and at meetings and, indeed, reviewing them after meetings as he checked what items remained outstanding for action.   </p>

When he went into the witness box he did not explain to the court at the outset that he had added the question-mark in his transcript, even though it was not on the page, to reflect his recollection that he had made his note as a prompt to himself to ask a question.

Also, when I immediately pointed out to counsel, who questioned the presence of a question-mark, that the presence of a question-mark within the heavily scored out word “liquidate” was borne out by the presence of a question-mark in Mr Moir’s transcript, Mr Moir did not correct me to say that he had added that question-mark even though it was not in the copy of the notes he had transcribed.  Rather, he referred to the questionmark notation as supporting the evidence he was then giving that his note recorded a question he wanted to ask Mr Ribeiro.

On the other hand, Mr Moir was in the best position to interpret his own notes in an authoritative way and I think he did not foresee what a minute forensic examination would be undertaken of such an apparently trivial marking as the question-mark notation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, it does not lead to that conclusion.  I have considered carefully why Mr Moir should have tampered with the document and lied about it, running the risk that he might be caught out on something so serious.  In my view, it is likely that he did it because he was strongly identified with F&amp;C and the team of people who had come under criticism from the Defendants.  He was conscious that his note could be read as suggesting they were not telling the truth and he wished to insulate them from such a suggestion.  The change he made brought his note into line with his actual recollection of events (so perhaps it did not seem to him to be morally outrageous to make the change) and he thought the chances of his being caught out were low.  The basic thrust of Mr Moir’s evidence, that his note reflected a question he asked, that Mr Ribeiro resisted the suggestion that the LLP’s business should be liquidated and that there was no decision by F&amp;C to close the LLP, was strongly supported by evidence from others (in particular, Mr Ribeiro, Ms Bomba and Mr Mendez de Vigo) which I found credible.  Ms Bomba had attended the relevant meeting with Mr Ribeiro on 4 December 2008 and broadly corroborated Mr Moir’s account of it, as did Mr Ribeiro. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The other notes by Mr Moir on the same page also support this view.  They appear to record - and I find they are accurate in this respect - that Mr Ribeiro proposed three redundancies in relation to the LLP (this would have been an odd suggestion if his proposal was to close the business altogether) and that he said words to the effect “Do not close to new business” (indicating that the LLP’s business was to continue). Also, I consider that the words “need agreement” written below the scored out word “liquidate” reflect Mr Ribeiro informing Mr Moir that the LLP could not simply be closed, since that would require the agreement of the Defendants.   </p>

That is difficult to reconcile with the idea that F&amp;C had previously made a decision to close down, or withdraw from, the LLP (for example, at the meeting on 12 November 2008).  Mr Moir produced updated versions of this Project Fitness report thereafter, as a running document to keep a check on actions to be taken, or which had been completed, and the costs savings associated with them. </p>

An AAF report is by no means an indispensable marketing tool for a FoHF business. For example, most of the LLP’s AUM were attracted into the business in 2005, before it had an AAF report to show investors. F&amp;C’s representatives on the LLP Board reasonably held the view (especially in the context of an assessment that the LLP was unlikely to attract new investment in 2009 and should focus rather on rebuilding its performance track record) that the AAF report did not represent value for money and in the difficult times in which the LLP found itself was a cost which ought to be eliminated.  </p>

This also was a reasonable and legitimate view for them to hold.  It was partly influenced by their more optimistic assessment of and hopes for the potential prospects for the LLP in 2009.  The disagreement over whether to cancel the AAF report is one of the areas where the Defendants and F&amp;C fell out over reasonably held but conflicting business judgments.  The Defendants sought to rely on F&amp;C’s stance in cancelling the AAF report as a piece of a jigsaw which, they said, showed that F&amp;C wished to damage the LLP’s business and close it down.

Mr Moir’s evidence, which I accept, was that the item title (“Dissolve etc”) had simply been left unchanged from previous versions so that he could keep track of it as the document evolved, rather than because it reflected a decision by F&amp;C or Mr Ribeiro to dissolve the LLP.  This account is supported by the continued presence of the same note as before against this item (see para.

He told the Defendants that logically there was a fifth option, simply to close the LLP.  In my view, he said this in an attempt to inject a degree of what he regarded as realism into the discussion, to try to make the Defendants realise that they might be overplaying their hand, rather than as a bald threat.  In fact, he told them that he was not keen on this idea, but that it was an option.  It is also likely that Mr Ribeiro mentioned that there was a mood within F&amp;C’s Execom in favour of closing the LLP (reflecting the pressure he had felt himself under within Execom, as part of Project Fitness), to try to emphasise to the Defendants the seriousness of the situation. But, contrary to the evidence of the Defendants, I find that he did not say that Execom had already decided to close the LLP. In the stress of the meeting, however, the Defendants seem to have come away with the impression from Mr Ribeiro’s unspecific comments that some such a decision had been taken.  </p>

Mr Ribeiro emphasised to them the importance of cutting costs in the LLP and said that Ms Ross and LLP employees apart from Mr Pennington, Mr Sparks and Mr Tilson would have to be made redundant so that the LLP could be seen to be bearing its share of the costcutting pain across the F&amp;C Group. He said words to the effect that he did not want to pick a fight with others on Execom to try to retain these staff.  (Mr Ribeiro’s comments at this meeting implied an additional redundancy as compared with what he had discussed with Mr Moir within Project Fitness, i.e. Ms Rattigan, Mr Reynolds and Mr O’Hara, in addition to Ms Ross -  I think it is likely that he was setting out a more extreme position with the Defendants with an eye on what he thought would be a negotiation to come, in which he could give some ground so as to get back to the two redundancies of LLP employees which he had undertaken to try to deliver as part of Project Fitness). It is likely that, as the Defendants recalled, Mr Ribeiro said something along the lines that he was telling the Defendants this so that they could get used to the idea.

That network was protected against intrusive hacking or computer attacks by elaborate IT security arrangements including, in particular, by a double layer of high-grade firewalls in operation around the perimeter of the network. These firewalls mediated traffic between the network and the internet and scrutinised any electronic messages or signals seeking to enter the F&amp;C network.  Each of these firewalls operated sophisticated screening measures at a number of levels to review the computer source of any message entering the network, to ensure that it was properly addressed to a relevant part of the network and to analyse the content of the electronic signal entering the network (so-called “deep packet inspection”) to ensure that the entry of that signal into the network was safe.  The two firewalls used different hardware and software, which made them more difficult for a malicious attacker to penetrate.   </p>

In particular, the archiving function associated with it was subject to sporadic failures which jeopardized the efficient conduct of business.  F&amp;C IT came up with a solution to the problems which were being experienced which involved moving to a new e-mail platform.  In order for the new platform to function effectively, however, the overall volume of electronic traffic and storage within it had to be kept within tighter limits than under the previous system.  Therefore, F&amp;C IT decided that each email mailbox within the new system should henceforth be limited in size to 300 Mb, whereas previously it had not been subject to any significant limit in size.  The restriction was to be enforced by configuring the e-mail system so that if someone’s mailbox exceeded 300 Mb in size, they would be prevented from sending any e-mails (they could still receive e-mails).  This sanction was imposed to provide an incentive for all F&amp;C personnel to carry out regular weeding of their mailboxes to delete unwanted material and file other material elsewhere on their computers.  </p>

Mr Culligan and others found that they had to spend a not insignificant amount of time weeding out their mailboxes, which was something of a distraction from focusing on running the business.  They received a great deal of information from hedge funds by e-mail, which would quickly clog up their mailboxes.  Mr Culligan, in particular, had to travel a good deal and it was not possible to weed out the mailboxes while on the move.  Mr Barthelemy travelled a lot too.  This could mean that Mr Culligan  and Mr Barthelemy could become disabled from using their email addresses to send e-mails while they were travelling on the LLP’s business.  The restrictions also appeared to give rise to a problem with the use of Blackberry mobile devices used by the Defendants when they were travelling away from the LLP’s office.   </p>

Such a special exception for LLP personnel might, of course, have led to complaints about their special treatment and other demands for exemptions from elsewhere in the F&amp;C Group.  F&amp;C IT remained very loath to accommodate the LLP’s request for exemption from the 300 Mb mailbox limit.  However, an uneasy compromise was reached, whereby F&amp;C IT allowed the senior personnel in the LLP (Mr Culligan, Mr Barthelemy and Mr Sparks) a rolling series of limited temporary extensions of their mailbox limits to 500 Mb.  This compromise satisfied neither side and was also vulnerable to F&amp;C IT simply terminating the arrangement, which they threatened to do on a number of occasions, on the basis that the LLP should comply with F&amp;C Group policy.   </p>

There were reasonable arguments on each side.  For the LLP it could be said that Article 3.1 of the Service Agreement imposed obligations on F&amp;C to provide the e-mail service to the LLP according to proper standards of market conduct and with reasonable care and that the obligations on F&amp;C in Article 2.4 of Schedule 7 to the Service Agreement to provide access to the F&amp;C email system which would “allow [LLP] staff to both send and receive e-mail” were unlimited in relation to matters such as constraints in relation to mailbox limits. </p>

It might also be said that Article 2.4 of Schedule 7 should be read as an obligation to provide e-mail accounts on the F&amp;C system as it operated from time to time (i.e. including with the mailbox limits existing with effect from January 2007), and that that system still allowed the sending and receipt of e-mails. </p>

They had genuine concerns about the detrimental impact of the new mailbox limits upon the way the LLP was run. That is so even though, as I think is likely, with greater effort on their part that impact could have been reduced; but they felt, with some justification, that they were not obliged by the Service Agreement to shoulder that additional burden, unlike other F&amp;C personnel. As the senior executive managers of the LLP, they legitimately felt that the uneasy compromise arrangement arrived at with F&amp;C IT was not a satisfactory long-term solution for the LLP’s e-mail requirements.  In my judgment, therefore, the Defendants were entitled to take steps to look into alternative e-mail arrangements that the LLP might adopt. </p>

Graeme Smith of F&amp;C IT e-mailed him to ask for all documentation for the project, as he would be asked to carry out a security review on behalf of the GISC.  Mr Pennington forwarded the request to Mr Culligan with the comment, “project documentation (as if)!”.  By this he meant that the LLP was a small organisation run on informal lines, where decisions to carry forward projects of this kind would be unlikely to be documented in any very elaborate way (unlike the more bureaucratic approach required elsewhere in the F&amp;C Group, in view of its size).   </p>

In response, Graeme Smith sent him an F&amp;C IT report on the risks associated with external remote access solutions and explained the action being taken by F&amp;C IT to develop its own remote access solution.

A meeting was held that day between Mr Culligan, Mr Pennington, Graeme Smith and other F&amp;C IT personnel to discuss the issue, after which Mr Culligan drew up a report (agreed with F&amp;C IT) for the GISC. The report explained the LLP’s pressing business need for its personnel to have remote access to their office computers, the solutions which had been considered and the meeting’s preferred option of bringing forward a version of the F&amp;C IT remote access solution to have it implemented “immediately” for the LLP. This solution was to include allowing remote access to LLP office computers from non-F&amp;C hardware such as home computers or hotel business centres (an important point for Mr Culligan, as he emphasised to F&amp;C IT), subject to certain security measures.

It does not appear that Graeme Smith replied to this. Instead, he prepared a report for the GISC on the LLP’s application in which he stated that the computer used for remote access “must be an F&amp;C device” and that there could be absolutely no use of a public computer; he added that if these requirements could not be met by the LLP, it would be required to wait until F&amp;C IT’s full remote access solution was ready at the end of November (in the event, it was not ready until June 2009).  Graeme Smith knew that his recommendation as to the immediate way forward would not meet the LLP’s requirements and that requiring the LLP to wait some time for F&amp;C IT’s full solution failed to respond to what the LLP maintained was the pressing nature of its business needs.  He did not seek to explain his withdrawal from the position agreed at the meeting on 21 October before sending his report to the GISC, which would defeat the proposal which had been discussed and agreed at the meeting that day. Nor does it appear that he showed Mr Culligan or Mr Pennington his report to the GISC.  </p>

As a result of this, the Defendants became convinced that the LLP was going to have to find a new way of satisfying its IT needs, a feeling reinforced by a message from Graeme Smith the next day that the GISC had not met at the scheduled time due to a lack of members attending and so did not even consider the LLP’s request for a remote access solution.

He referred to the discussions with F&amp;C IT about their proposed solution (while also being dismissive of the reasons given by them for rejecting the LLP’s preferred solutions), set out his understanding that it had been discussed at the GISC and approved (which reflected the way in which F&amp;C IT had kept him in the dark about what was really happening) and complained that Mr Pennington had run up against a “surly jobsworth attitude” on the part of F&amp;C IT in having the solution implemented.

These computers were on the new LLP IT network but configured to link to the F&amp;C network as well (“the dual-homed computers”).  This had been done to allow the LLP to have the benefit of electronic data relayed into its office from Bloomberg and Pertrac via the high capacity robust F&amp;C link to the internet (the LLP’s own wireless routers having inadequate capacity to allow for this in a reliable way) and to allow Mr Tilson to be able to connect to his computer in the LLP’s office from a computer in F&amp;C’s office in Dublin.   </p>

The linkage of the new LLP IT network to the internet via the LLP’s wireless router, combined with the linkage of the LLP and F&amp;C networks via the dual homed-computers, constituted a potential back door into the F&amp;C network, bypassing F&amp;C’s firewall protection. </p>

Therefore, he said, the LLP did not need such sophisticated firewall protection as F&amp;C.  The ordinary firewall protection in the LLP’s wireless router was sufficient for the LLP’s business and there was no significant risk for the F&amp;C network via the LLP network.

As the expert evidence on IT matters showed, the mere fact that the LLP network was not configured to received unsolicited messages did not provide full protection from malicious software getting onto the system.  It is a technique of hackers to try to induce someone to open a website or a specific item on a general website such as Facebook, so as to create a link to that person’s computer, by means of which electronic messages containing malicious software can be passed.  Such messages would not be unsolicited, but would have been invited onto the network by contact initiated from the network.  The principal protection against that possible line of attack on a computer network would be to install appropriate firewall protections for the network. Another possibility might be to use very strict operating protocols to forbid computer users connecting to potentially harmful addresses, but these would always be likely to be vulnerable to human error and, in any event, the LLP did not put in place such protocols.  Also relevant to protecting against virus attack is the installation of anti-virus software on computers (all F&amp;C and LLP computers were equipped with such software), but if they are able to introduce a virus onto a computer sophisticated hackers may be able to bypass and defeat this sort of protective measure. </p>

This inevitably involved Mr Culligan in making the relevant decisions about the level of risk of various kinds which would be acceptable for the LLP to accept in relation to its IT arrangements.   He would report IT developments in very summary detail at ManCom and LLP Board meetings, but the ManCom and the Board did not require more detailed reports or make any attempt to decide such matters themselves. This approach to decision-making in relation to this aspect of the LLP’s business was in accordance with the terms of the Agreement: the ManCom, not the Board, had responsibility for such matters (clause 17.1, especially at clause 17.1.7), and could delegate to Mr Culligan as it did (clause 17.1.8).

I consider that that was a judgment they could reasonably make, having regard to the probable limited attractiveness of the LLP as a stand-alone target, the limited level of investment transactions it undertook and financial information it had to maintain (which tended to limit its vulnerability to attack) and the relative imperviousness of the LLP network to messages from the internet.  I reach that conclusion even though, taking the LLP network on a stand-alone basis, the type of risks posed by hackers referred to above could not be fully discounted and I think it would have been preferable (a matter of best practice) if Mr Culligan had commissioned a specialist IT security review of the LLP’s network (notwithstanding that he and Mr Pennington were very knowledgeable about computers, they were not trained in or especially knowledgeable about IT security matters).  </p>

In my opinion, that conclusion (which was their genuine view) was not justified. On this part of the case I accept the main thrust of the evidence of Mr Pearce, the IT expert called by F&amp;C, criticising Mr Culligan for taking steps which unduly compromised the security of the F&amp;C IT network (he said comparatively little bearing directly on the question whether Mr Culligan unduly compromised the security of the LLP’s own IT network, the topic considered above).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The risk created for the F&amp;C IT system was not within acceptable bounds so far as F&amp;C was concerned, but that is a matter falling outside the scope of the protection afforded by section 994 to Holdings as Corporate Member, in respect of its partnership interest in the LLP.  The one qualification to this general observation is that, in appropriate circumstances, I think it would be possible to conclude that the affairs of a company or limited liability partnership had been run in a way unfairly prejudicial to its members if those having relevant control of its affairs caused it to act in such a way as to create serious legal liabilities on the part of that entity to third parties, without adequate or proper business justification for doing so. This might constitute a form of mismanagement of the affairs of such an entity which could potentially fall within the category of situation considered by Arden J in the <span style="font-style:italic">MacroIpswich</span> case: see para.

In my judgment, the answer is “No”.  It is not the case that all conduct which has the effect of putting a company or limited liability partnership in breach of an obligation owed by it to a third party will constitute unfairly prejudicial behaviour for the purposes of section 994.  Businesses often undertake activity which they know is, or may be, in breach of obligation where the managers assess in good faith that it is to the business’s overall commercial advantage to do so.  A minority shareholder or interest holder cannot simply rely upon the breach, or possible breach, of obligation and consequent potential exposure of the entity to complaint or legal action as sufficient foundation for an unfair prejudice petition.  Something more would be required, such as showing that the relevant managers acted to place the entity in possible breach of obligation without having any regard to its commercial interests or acted in a seriously incompetent way with the result that the business suffered substantial detriment. In my judgment, the circumstances of the present case are a good distance away from those sorts of case.  </p>

There were reasonable grounds on which Mr Culligan could conclude that, from the point of view of the LLP, F&amp;C IT was not taking proper action to meet its IT needs.  He did not consciously seek to place the LLP in breach of its obligations to F&amp;C under the Service Agreement; nor from the point of view of the LLP did he act in a negligent or seriously incompetent way as a manager in taking the action he did; nor, in taking the action he did, did he in fact expose the LLP to substantial detriment.  </p>

If F&amp;C withdrew its IT support for the LLP, as it would be entitled to do under the terms of the Service Agreement, that would not have been a significant detriment for the LLP. The LLP had already taken steps to put in place alternative provision for its IT needs, and it would be a relatively straightforward matter for the LLP to establish its own more robust connection to the internet to receive the Bloomberg and Pertrac data feeds by setting up its own ADSL line independently of F&amp;C.    </p>

There is force in this criticism.  Once the LLP moved its operations on to the new network, with its own e-mail and remote access provided by external IT companies, it did not continue to run its software and maintain its records on the F&amp;C network in parallel.  The new IT network at the LLP replaced the LLP’s reliance on F&amp;C’s IT network.  This, combined with the fact that the new network was intended to run for months rather than a day or two, indicates that it was not properly characterised as a BCP test as that term is commonly understood.  If the LLP’s new IT network failed, the LLP would need some distinct business continuity plan as a back-up for that network.   </p>

At this stage, Mr Culligan believed that the LLP’s own IT network would only have to operate as a stop-gap until such time as he felt F&amp;C IT had improved the services it could provide to the LLP so that they met the LLP’s business needs.   </p>

The draft paper accused Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C of “conspiring to destroy” the LLP’s value “by making rash and irrational decisions” from the point of view of the LLP, in order to give effect to F&amp;C’s decision to close it without paying the price of first acquiring the Defendants’ interests in it by exercising its call option under the Fourth Schedule.  The draft paper stated that the Defendants believed this was a criminal offence; that they would seek immediate injunctive relief should F&amp;C take any decision to damage the franchise of the LLP (they referred, in particular, to the obligation of utmost good faith in clause 13.6 of the Agreement); and they called for a discussion with a senior F&amp;C executive other than Mr Ribeiro, whose role they described as “conflicted”.     </p>

The complaint they made regarding Mr Ribeiro’s simple announcement that redundancies would be made was a fair one – Mr Ribeiro could have done more to debate the position with them rather than present it almost as a <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span>.  However, there was a genuine difference of views on the issue and the matter was going to have to be ventilated and brought to a head at some point; so, although the manner in which Mr Ribeiro raised the point was clumsy and involved veiled threats, he did not breach any obligation in bringing it up as he did.

Mr Ribeiro asked the Defendants how they proposed to close the gap between projected costs and revenues.  Mr Barthelemy said that the LLP’s gross projected revenue of about £1.2 million would cover its costs if one left out payment of the marketing fee to F&amp;C, but Mr Ribeiro stated that this was a cost of the LLP and could not be left out of account.  Mr Ribeiro proposed that Mr Reynolds (the due diligence analyst) and one of the two administrative staff should be made redundant.

This triggered Mr Culligan’s interest.  He said that there were real potential cost benefits in the LLP moving out of F&amp;C’s offices.  In due course, this embryonic suggestion developed into another area of controversy, but at this stage the F&amp;C representatives did not raise immediate objections to the idea.   </p>

They proposed to economise substantially on travel and client expenditure (entertaining and the like), to move to cheaper office space and to bring IT and accounting functions in-house (and so reduce payments to F&amp;C under the Service Agreement for those functions).

Mr Redeker confessed that he had failed to forward the 1 December 2008 letter (offering the option to switch to the Balanced Fund) to the client before confirming redemptions on its behalf. This was not, in my view, a very serious omission, since Mr Redeker, as account manager for this ex-PVF client, had authority to make the relevant decision on its behalf and also explained that once he realised his mistake he had discussed the issue with the client who had endorsed what had been done. However, the Defendants considered that this was evidence that F&amp;C had not in fact been marketing the Balanced Fund by reference to the 1 December 2008 letter as it should have been under clause 13.7 of the Agreement, and determined to bring this up at the forthcoming LLP Board meeting on 21 January.

Mr Culligan defended the comment on the basis that the LLP was still testing the capacity and robustness of its new services and had not yet reached a final decision about them.  At this stage he envisaged that the arrangements would only need to last a couple of months while F&amp;C IT improved the services it could provide, and if F&amp;C IT did that to the satisfaction of the LLP, the LLP could go back to using them and these arrangements need not be pursued. If that did not happen, and the LLP was happy with the external e-mail services it had begun to use and had found them to be reliable over an extended period, it would make the change in services permanent and bring the matter back to the attention of the Board for endorsement (as I have noted previously, strictly this was unnecessary, since the arrangements in relation to IT were not a matter reserved for the decision of the LLP Board).   </p>

On the LLP Board, Mr Johns and Mr Cole were not aware of that fact. There had not been a specific audit review and sign-off of the arrangements as had been contemplated at the LLP Board meeting long before, on 24 October 2007 (para. [543] above); but by late 2008/early 2009 I do not think that anyone recalled that that had been said. There was no reason for anyone to check back through the LLP Board minutes for details such as this. In any event, Mr Culligan did not regard the use of the external e-mail system as constituting the final migration of the LLP away from the F&amp;C system and to the new system. In practice, as Mr Culligan had good grounds to believe, F&amp;C IT was on notice that the LLP was now using external e-mail services and it had not suggested that that should be stopped. In these circumstances there is, in my view, no significant criticism which can be made regarding Mr Culligan’s actions in arranging for the LLP to use an external e-mail service in the way he did. </p>

This was a difficult and confrontational meeting.  Mr Ribeiro and Mr Tilson reported that the question of e-mail limits had been raised with Mr Leclercq but that no solution had been proposed.  It was agreed that this item would be treated as an open matter.  Neither Mr Ribeiro nor Mr Tilson thought it necessary to go into the current e-mail arrangements then in place at the LLP and nor did Mr Culligan; I think this was probably on the footing that all three of them regarded them as a temporary solution to the LLP’s e-mail needs pending finalisation of an improved service by F&amp;C IT.   </p>

In particular, he said that it would be disadvantageous to the Corporate Member if the charge was spread out across subsequent years when the LLP was less likely to be in profit.  Mr Culligan objected to the proposed treatment, and in particular to the reason given by Mr Ribeiro (which appeared to be based solely on what would be in the interests of F&amp;C, rather than any proper accounting view).  He asked Mr Tilson what the normal accounting treatment would be, and Mr Tilson reported it would be normal to spread the charge over the relevant five-year period.  Mr Ribeiro stated he would not sign the 2008 accounts without appropriate recognition of the full amount of the liability.  However, in the end it was left to Mr Tilson and Mr Tonkin to check on the proper accounting treatment with F&amp;C’s Finance Department.  In my view, this was an appropriate outcome.   </p>

The proposals included moving the LLP to cheaper offices and reducing the services it received from F&amp;C, so as to save on the rent and service payments which would otherwise be made to F&amp;C. The Defendants did not at this (or any) stage present any detailed assessment or evidence regarding the feasibility of and costs associated with a relocation of the LLP’s offices. So far as the other Board members were concerned, the proposal appeared vague and unsubstantiated. In light of the proposals, Mr Ribeiro said he would need to check with Mr Logan before those proposals could be approved (I think that this was Mr Ribeiro’s intention and belief at the time, although in the event he never did refer these points to Mr Logan).  The Board asked the Defendants to provide additional assurance that in achieving the proposed savings, the control environment for the LLP’s business would not be compromised.   </p>

This item was left unresolved, with Mr Ribeiro asking Mr Tilson to provide a list of recipients of the AAF report in the previous year, presumably to test the Defendants’ claims about how important such a report really was as a marketing tool.   </p>

Mr Ribeiro was a member of Execom and had the authority delegated from Execom to react on behalf of F&amp;C to these proposals by the Defendants.

There was no distinct agenda item for the Board to consider an expansion of the LLP’s activities under clause 4.1 of the Agreement in this way and the materials about other possible ventures for the LLP thus far provided to the LLP Board by the Defendants were only in very outline and hazy terms and did not distinctly mention the CTA project. Moreover, the Defendants themselves had no firm or viable plan for a CTA project to be carried forward by the LLP by itself.  If such a project were to be set up, it would require seed capital and the LLP had no money available to fund this or proposals to raise such funding itself.  (In the event, when Mr Sparks and Ms Ross pitched the CTA project to Ms Hall and Mr Mendez de Vigo, it was on the basis that they were seeking to persuade F&amp;C to invest its money in the project; but F&amp;C was completely unpersuaded of the commercial merits of taking it forward: see paras.

It cannot be inferred from these comments that Mr Ribeiro had now determined to ignore his fiduciary obligations to act in the best interests of the LLP. In fact, he himself made the arrangements for Mr Sparks and Ms Ross to have an opportunity to pitch the CTA idea to senior F&amp;C management, Mr Mendez de Vigo and Ms Hall, and left the decision on its merits to them.  Nor do I think that Mr Johns and Mr Cole acted in breach of any fiduciary duty at this meeting, as alleged by the Defendants. They were not a party to Mr Ribeiro’s thinking, and in the absence of any agenda item or Board papers explaining the CTA project they could not be expected to vote on any proposal that the LLP should embark upon such a project. Events happened very quickly at the meeting, and in a confused way, so I do not think that they can be criticised for failing immediately to intervene when Mr Ribeiro made his comments or when he indicated that a Members’ meeting should be called. </p>

The Defendants never did return to the LLP Board with a firm proposal that the Board should consider an extension of the LLP’s business under clause 4.1 of the Agreement to launch a CTA (or any other) product.  In my view, this was because the Defendants knew that launching such a product was outside the financial capacity of the LLP.  To be able to derive value from the CTA project, the LLP was in reality dependent on F&amp;C finding it an attractive project to take on itself, so that the LLP might be able to extract a price from F&amp;C, as Mr Culligan had hinted in his e-mail of 20 January 2009  (para.

This seemed to them to be underlined by the way in which Mr Ribeiro brought discussion on these points to a close and abruptly announced that a Members’ meeting would be convened to resolve this and other points of dispute.  They rightly surmised that Mr Ribeiro had devised some strategy aimed at trying to put pressure on them by referring matters to a Members’ meeting, where F&amp;C’s 60% voting interest in the LLP could be deployed against their 40% voting interest.   </p>

Mr Culligan’s evidence, which I accept, was that the Defendants did not know what detailed plan Mr Ribeiro had in mind; they thought that perhaps it was to try to get a vote at the Members’ meeting which could then be deployed in some way to try to persuade a majority on the LLP Board to back him against the Defendants on the points then in dispute; and they believed that their best course (since they could not prevent the summoning of a Members’ meeting) was simply to wait and see how Mr Ribeiro’s strategy played out.   </p>

At this point, Mr Ribeiro left the meeting in a state of some agitation to try to calm down a bit outside the meeting room.  This meant that the LLP Board did not discuss in detail the IT matters to which their attention had been drawn in the operations report and the Turnbull report. Mr Culligan was, I think, entitled to assume that the other Board members had read these materials and had no objection which they wished to raise in relation to the IT arrangements set out in them.  In particular, in light of the explicit statement in the operations report that the LLP was now running its own IT infrastructure, he was entitled to think that the Board (and indeed F&amp;C) was content with that. </p>

Mr Cole and Mr Johns asked him to articulate his concerns (this is one incident which shows, in my view, that they genuinely sought to carry out their responsibilities as independent Board members, rather than simply pursue F&amp;C’s interests or side with Mr Ribeiro).   </p>

Mr Culligan added that he had yet to receive clarification as to how F&amp;C intended to provide this important service.  He referred to the haste which seemed to have been applied to the decision and how Fiona Ross’ departure would prejudice the partnership’s ability to both generate new sales of existing products and also the partnership’s ability to pursue the opportunity outlined in the discussion of strategic options.  He noted that the corporate partner had a responsibility in the partnership agreement to provide marketing support. </p>

[633] above].  Mr Johns reported that he failed to see how such an action could be perceived as the responsibility of the Corporate Partner rather than an oversight of the client services manager.  When asked, Mr Culligan expressed the view that he considered that this oversight could represent an action undermining the partnership and could be indicative of a broader failure to consult with clients on the decision to give notice of redemption of the fund and the subsequent ‘client’ decisions not to opt for transfer to the F&amp;C Balanced fund. He observed that if the client had not been consulted, then the form outlining the options, in this case, must have been completed by F&amp;C based on their own decision, not that of the client. He noted that to the extent that F&amp;C Balanced had performed well in excess of the majority of other F&amp;C products such a decision was not logical. The chairman noted that most clients had been invested in the F&amp;C Select fund which had not performed as well. </p>

Each side blames the other for bringing this state of affairs about.  F&amp;C seeks to rely on this loss of trust and confidence to say that an equitable foundation for the LLP’s existence had now disappeared so that it was entitled to treat the partnership as at an end without activating the put or call option arrangements under the Fourth Schedule.  I have already held that there was no such additional equitable foundation for the LLP outside the terms of the Agreement (see e.g. para. [21] above), so I dismiss this contention.   </p>

But F&amp;C’s actions in relation to marketing and advising its clients in respect of the LLP’s products and putting in redemption requests were justified by the current poor performance of the LLP’s funds (especially as compared with their absolute return objective), the general state of the market and sentiment amongst investors, and fell within the scope of the marketing discretion reserved to F&amp;C by clause 13.7 of the Agreement;   </p>

But although Mr Ribeiro acted in a high-handed way in relation to the AAF report and the accounts, he left the issues for further research and future determination as was proper.  Certain of his comments at the meeting were ill-advised, but they were explicable as statements in a heated and rather confused debate which had not been thought through and I think the Defendants attached excessive weight to them, partly because they took them as confirming their other grounds for suspicion of F&amp;C, referred to at sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) above.  Mr Ribeiro’s call for a Members’ meeting at the end of the Board meeting was clearly hostile, but was something which everyone accepted it was within his rights to do.   </p>

In a hard-nosed business environment, such as that in which the LLP operated, a significant degree of robustness is properly to be expected when participating in debate about collective business decisions and in sometimes acrimonious discussions about such decisions, which may particularly be expected where conflicting interests and factors have to be taken into account and reconciled. In this context, I think it would require particularly strong and clearly unacceptable behaviour, with a clear preponderance of fault on one side, before a court would find that a breakdown in trust and confidence was attributable to unfairly prejudicial conduct in the form merely of the way in which one side within the management of a company or limited partnership conducts itself in discussions with the other side (as distinct from analysing actions which are taken which determine how the business is run and how practical power is exercised within the entity): cf <span style="font-style:italic">Rackind v Gross</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 815 at [16].

The Defendants maintain that at the dinner Mr Ribeiro made disparaging remarks about them, and that this constituted a breach of clause 15.2 of the Agreement. I do not find that this case has been made out by the Defendants. Mr Sparks was not called to give evidence about the discussion and Mr Ribeiro was not cross-examined to suggest that he had made improper disparaging remarks at the dinner. I would add that I do not consider that Mr Ribeiro making comments, while discussing the affairs of the LLP with two of its managers, to the effect that there were strong disagreements between Mr Ribeiro and the Defendants about the steps the LLP should take in the difficult circumstances it found itself in and that Mr Ribeiro thought he was right and they were wrong (which is what I think probably happened) would constitute disparagement contrary to clause 15.2. That much was probably already known to Mr Tilson and Mr Sparks, and in any event there was a legitimate reason for Mr Ribeiro to inform them about this, since it was relevant to their roles within the LLP that they should understand the tensions that existed between the Members. It is very probable that the Defendants informed them about their contrary views from time to time when dealing with Mr Tilson and Mr Sparks in the course of their day-to-day conduct of the LLP’s business, and Mr Ribeiro was entitled to put his side of the picture to them. It seems that at the dinner Mr Ribeiro made some vague reference to a “nuclear option”, and that this filtered back to the Defendants via Mr Sparks.

The meeting moved swiftly to consider the ten resolutions in the notice.  There was next to no discussion of Resolutions 1 to 6.  In each case, Mr Ribeiro introduced the resolution and cast Holdings’ votes in favour of it, while the Defendants voted against it.  Mr Ribeiro clearly did not intend there to be significant discussion of these matters.  He was seeking to use Holdings’ superior voting power simply to carry them through.  In relation to Resolution 3 (payout ratio), Mr Ribeiro said that he envisaged that the final payment ratio would be determined and agreed at the LLP Board meeting which approved its annual accounts. </p>

There was no obligation on F&amp;C to agree to such accelerated payment, so in itself this resolution was not directed to achieving any specific practical result contrary to the rights or interests of the Defendants. But it has signifance as part of the overall picture presented by the notice of 3 February and the package of resolutions it contained. I think that this resolution was intended to operate as a reminder to the Defendants that they could come under personal financial pressure (i.e. to meet tax liabilities) and that they could not expect assistance from F&amp;C as a matter of goodwill if they continued to oppose its will regarding the future conduct of the affairs of the LLP. </p>

This was not concealed from the Board members. Mr Culligan did not put the arrangements forward as a final solution for the LLP because it was still hoped that F&amp;C IT would eventually resolve the problems which had been experienced by the LLP.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Under Resolution 8 (office relocation), Mr Ribeiro said he considered the proposal, which would reduce the costs for the LLP at the expense of F&amp;C, did not represent an equitable solution in the best interests of all Members. He put forward a resolution that any relocation of the LLP’s offices should be rejected, and promptly voted in favour of that resolution and carried it against the votes of the Defendants. Again, there was no debate about the legal effect of such a resolution (in fact, the question of re-location of office was a matter reserved to the LLP Board by clause 18.1.10 of the Agreement, and the Members’ meeting had no powers in respect of it; in relation to F&amp;C, the renting by the LLP of its office from F&amp;C was governed by Schedule 4 to the Service Agreement, and under article 6.3 of that agreement and article 6.1 of Schedule 4 the arrangement could be terminated on the giving of 30 days’ notice).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Under Resolution 9 (staff costs), Mr Ribeiro said that costs had to be reduced in other ways than as proposed by the Defendants and this meant redundancies.  He proposed that Mr Reynolds, Mr O’Hara and Ms Rattigan should be made redundant.  (He had reverted to his original suggestion of three rather than two redundancies of LLP employees, presumably because he now felt that at the Members' meeting matters had moved beyond negotiation and he was going to use Holdings’ vote to carry his proposal forward).  He noted that the Defendants said this would have an adverse impact on the business, and Mr Culligan again emphasised this point, but Mr Ribeiro gave his view that the senior members of staff left in place at the LLP (including the Defendants) would be capable of managing the business with its much reduced AUM.   Mr Ribeiro therefore put a resolution that the three identified staff members should be made redundant and used the votes of Holdings to carry it against the opposition of the Defendants. Again, the effect of such a resolution was not debated (in fact, under clause 18.1.2 of the Agreement this aspect of setting the budget for the LLP was reserved to the LLP Board, and the Members’ meeting had no powers in relation to it). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Under Resolution 10 (future of the LLP), Mr Ribeiro said that F&amp;C continued to be committed to the FoHF business but wished to record its concern about the viability of the LLP if new business could not be brought in.  He referred to the fact that the vast majority of the LLP’s AUM had been sourced by F&amp;C from its client base.  Mr Culligan asked Mr Ribeiro to clarify a comment he had previously made referring to the “nuclear option”.  Mr Ribeiro said he thought the LLP had reached a point where it was difficult to resolve issues at Board meetings but would not be drawn further on the point.  Mr Ribeiro stated that comments from both sides provided ample evidence that the future of the LLP would be put in question if things did not return to smooth running as before.  Mr Barthelemy asked, “Is that a threat?”  Mr Ribeiro responded that it was not a threat.  Mr Culligan said the Defendants had made a number of sensible proposals towards improving the prospects of the LLP, avoiding the disruption redundancies would cause, and that he was not sure there was anything else the Defendants could do.  He recorded that he saw no commercial logic in the adoption of the resolutions put forward by Mr Ribeiro.  The meeting was then brought to a close with Mr Ribeiro asking Mr Tonkin to ensure the minutes were finalised and that the LLP Board members were formally notified of the resolutions.  </p>

For decisions at Board level, Mr Ribeiro would have to seek to win the arguments on their business merits in order to attract majority – or, depending on the nature of the decision, unanimous - support from the Board members. By contrast, for decisions at the level of a Members’ meeting, Mr Ribeiro did not have to engage in argument, but could simply exercise Holdings’ majority voting rights to get the result he and F&amp;C desired.   </p>

It also acted in a way which it calculated and hoped would, by passing resolutions 2 and 3, undermine the specific rights of the Defendants defined in the Agreement to receive income from the LLP. Although Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C believed very strongly that the Defendants, as part owners of the LLP, should share the financial pain with F&amp;C (as the other part owner) when the LLP’s business prospects were in jeopardy, that afforded no justification for trying to defeat the rights which F&amp;C had agreed the Defendants should have under the Agreement, in particular to receive monthly advance drawings in a manner akin to receipt of salary.  </p>

In my judgment there is no merit whatever in this suggestion.

In fact, the majority voting mechanism had been invoked by the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board previously where there was a difference of view between Board members (see para. [404] above). Although it was desirable for the Board to try to reach a consensus, where that was not possible it was obvious that the mechanism of voting on the Board according to the particular requirements set out in the Agreement should be employed so that the Board could fulfil the role given to it under the Agreement. There was no provision in the Agreement or other agreement that a Members’ meeting could take decisions reserved to the Board, even if there was deadlock on the Board. In any event, in early 2009 the Board was not deadlocked - by cutting short discussion at the LLP Board meeting on 21 January 2009 and putting these resolutions to the Members’ meeting on 18 February, Mr Ribeiro sought to avoid having to have a vote of the LLP Board on the various points which were then in dispute.   </p>

[672] above). F&amp;C submitted that I should find that Mr Ribeiro had been given mistaken in-house legal advice and acted in reliance on that, believing (wrongly) that the Members’ meeting had power to pass resolutions which had the legal effects they purported to have. This paragraph of F&amp;C’s written closing submissions gives the thrust of this argument: </p>

I observed to Miss Newman that in her written submission she appeared to be seeking positively to suggest, in particular by the words “Relying on it”, that legal advice had been given to Mr Ribeiro that the resolutions put to the Members’ meeting could be passed and implemented without breaching the terms of the Agreement. I suggested that since F&amp;C had not waived privilege in relation to the advice given by Mr Apfel it was not permissible for her now to maintain a positive case about the content of that advice.

By operation of the rules on legal professional privilege I do not have before me evidence about those matters.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the basis of that evidence, I find that Mr Ribeiro did not make a mistake about the powers of the Members’ meeting. He is a careful man, and it is very probable that by this stage he had studied the terms of the Agreement himself with care. The Agreement is tolerably clear in explaining the respective decision-making powers of the LLP ManCom, Board and Members’ meeting. In these proceedings, its true effect in this regard has not been disputed by F&amp;C. In particular, the Agreement is clear about the requirement for a unanimous decision of the Board to change the Defendants’ rights in respect of advance drawings under clause 18.4.11. Mr Tilson had had no difficulty in identifying that provision as the governing provision in relation to any such decision and had drawn it expressly to the attention of Mr Ribeiro. It would have been commercially nonsensical for the parties to have agreed that there should be that protection for the Defendants, but at the same time to have agreed that the protection could be bypassed by F&amp;C by the simple expedient of calling a Members’ meeting where Holdings could out-vote the Defendants to remove or reduce their right to such drawings, and on the evidence before me I do not consider that Mr Ribeiro made the mistake of thinking that that nonsensical result was intended. His evidence regarding his state of mind at the time was vague, imprecise and unimpressive. He did not distinctly suggest that he did think that this nonsensical position was truly a feature of the Agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, Mr Ribeiro’s objective in calling the Members’ meeting and putting the resolutions to it was to test out the Defendants’ stomach for a fight with F&amp;C over these issues and to try to cow them into submission. He intended that the resolutions should be put into effect. Even though he appreciated that F&amp;C’s legal arguments that this was a permissible course under the Agreement were in all probability ill-founded, I consider that he thought that if F&amp;C proceeded in this way the Defendants might be intimidated by the sheer enormity of the task of taking on the might of F&amp;C to challenge what had been done and would feel themselves constrained in practice to accept that the resolutions of the Members’ meeting should be treated as binding and effective. I think he calculated that there was just enough doubt surrounding the powers of the Members’ meeting that the Defendants would think that the risk of challenging F&amp;C over this (and possibly losing, at great financial cost to themselves) would simply be too great for them to bear; and if they allowed the resolutions to stand and be implemented over time, F&amp;C would be furnished with arguments that whatever the rights and wrongs of what had been done the Defendants had acquiesced in it and could not seek to challenge it later on. </p>

They were aware that Mr Ribeiro had asked for the resolutions to be formally notified to the LLP Board members and that an LLP Board meeting was to be called.  They continued to assume that Mr Ribeiro would seek to deploy the resolutions passed by the Members' meeting to try to persuade the LLP Board (including them) at its next meeting to see the strength of feeling on the part of F&amp;C about the business strategy for the LLP (and, in particular, the need for redundancies), so as to persuade the Board members to accept that that was the best way forward. </p>

He gave instructions to the payroll team in F&amp;C’s Finance Department, who were responsible (by operation of the Service Agreement) for making such payments, not to make any payments to the Defendants without express prior instruction from himself or Mr Logan.  The Defendants were not told of this. In taking this action, Mr Ribeiro acted as agent of Holdings for the purpose of analysis of relations between the Members under the Agreement (this is so even if it might be said that, in relation to F&amp;C’s Finance Department, Mr Ribeiro also purported to act as agent for the LLP, with its ostensible authority, in giving his instruction).

The Defendants knew that Mr Ribeiro had been examining the Agreement carefully (he had told them as much at the meeting on 17 December 2008).  They also correctly assumed that Mr Ribeiro had taken legal advice, and the shift of the forum for discussion from the LLP Board meeting on 21 January to the Members' meeting on 18 February gave every appearance that Mr Ribeiro had got a carefully worked out strategy in mind (though at that stage they could only speculate what it might be). When the Defendants learned that F&amp;C had stopped payment of their monthly drawings in accordance with Resolution 2 passed at the Members' meeting, they were entitled to think, and did think, that F&amp;C was now executing a settled, fully thought-out plan of its own devising.

Their evidence on that point was corroborated by grammatical errors in their Notices (“you as the Corporate Member has procured… has acted…”), which indicated that they had been drawn up in a hurry on the evening of 25 February, as the Defendants testified.  It is true that the Defendants acted very quickly in putting in their Put Option Notices but, in my view, that is explained by the fact that there had been an acrimonious build up to this event and they were not prepared to put up with the treatment they were receiving any longer.  It was also a way of demonstrating to F&amp;C how strongly they felt about what had happened. </p>

Before doing so, Mr Barthelemy asked Mr Ribeiro if he was aware that the drawings were supposed to be paid, but had not been.  Mr Ribeiro confirmed that he was and that it had been done on his instruction.  Mr Barthelemy asked Mr Ribeiro if he understood that it was a breach of the Agreement.  Mr Ribeiro replied that he did not believe it was in breach of the Agreement and that he had taken advice on the matter.  He offered to show the Defendants the advice but said it would take some time to find it and provide it to them (in the event, the advice was not disclosed; I have already assessed Mr Ribeiro’s actual state of mind on the evidence before me).   </p>

The Defendants reiterated that they regarded the stoppage of drawings as a breach of the Agreement and handed over their Notices.  They asked Mr Ribeiro to sign a receipt, which he did (timed at 6.52 pm).  There was an awkward conversation as the Defendants left his office, during which Mr Culligan said words to the effect that he congratulated F&amp;C on their owning the LLP.  In his evidence, Mr Ribeiro described the Defendants as “smug”, “cheerful” and “victorious”, but whatever impression he took away from the meeting, in my view that is far from the true position.  In fact, despite the momentousness of what they had done, the Defendants turned up for work the next day in the usual way.  I think they regarded the service of the Put Option Notices as the start of a potentially long and difficult period of negotiation with F&amp;C about the way forward, rather than a trap that they had successfully sprung (as F&amp;C sought to suggest). </p>

So far as the Defendants could see, there was no legal impediment against the Members’ meeting passing the resolutions put to it by Mr Ribeiro, and in my view they were correct in this. Once he had armed himself with these resolutions, the Defendants had to wait to see what use he would try to make of them. Moreover, Mr Ribeiro had not made any mistake about the powers of the Members’ meeting. He was acting not on the basis of any such mistake but rather because he thought that proceeding by way of such a meeting was a good way to create uncertainty for the Defendants and to put pressure on them to agree to F&amp;C’s plans for the LLP’s business: see para.

As to the first ground, Holdings (acting by Mr Ribeiro) was in breach of clause 11.1 of the Agreement, alternatively in breach of an implied term that it would not prevent compliance by the LLP with its obligation under clause 11.1 to pay the advance drawings: see paras. [260]-[274] above.  So far as the second specified ground is concerned, I consider that the various business disagreements to which that ground referred were as a result of legitimate  and genuine differences of view and were not part of a scheme by F&amp;C to damage the value of the LLP’s business for its own purposes.  </p>

In my view, the extent of the breach of the Agreement constituted by the calling of the Members’ meeting, the presentation of the various resolutions and the vote by Holdings in favour of them and the intention to carry those resolutions into effect in disregard of the terms of the Agreement, as manifested by the stoppage of the Defendants’ advance drawings without further reference to them or the LLP Board, was wider than simply a breach of clause 11.1 or an implied term not to prevent performance under that provision. As the Defendants submitted, Holdings’ actions were part of a single course of conduct and were closely related. This set of actions on the part of Holdings gave the objective appearance that Holdings (acting by Mr Ribeiro) had decided to shift the effective management of the LLP from the LLP ManCom and Board to the level of the Members’ meeting (where Holdings intended to dictate policy and take decisions by virtue of its 60% majority voting rights). This involved a subversion of the intended operation of the Agreement in a fundamental way, since it undermined the distribution of decision-making powers under clauses 17, 18 and 22. Holdings had evinced an intention not to comply with the basic decision-making framework of the Agreement, but rather to seek to act in a way intended to defeat that framework. In ordinary contract parlance, Holdings had repudiated the Agreement: para. [713] above.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, in my opinion Holdings’ actions constituted a breach of its duty of utmost good faith to the LLP under clause 13.6 of the Agreement. The attempt to distort the distribution of decision-making powers in relation to the LLP’s business was intended to have the effect that Holdings alone could decide how the LLP’s affairs should be carried on, thereby depriving the LLP of having the benefit of the collective judgment of particular individuals brought to bear at the level of the ManCom and LLP Board </p>

Since the Agreement itself defined the LLP’s relevant interests in respect of the decision-making procedures which should operate when deciding what it should do, I consider that the actions of Holdings to subvert those procedures (and hence to undermine the proper interest of the LLP in having those procedures applied for its benefit) was in breach of Holdings’ duty to the LLP under clause 13.6. This is illustrated particularly clearly by the first three resolutions voted on at the Members’ meeting on 18 February, the cumulative object of which was to apply illegitimate financial pressure to the Defendants to seek to compel them to endorse Mr Ribeiro’s and F&amp;C’s judgments about how the LLP’s affairs should be carried on, contrary to the Defendants’ own considered judgment regarding what was in the best interests of the LLP.  </p>

I do not consider that there is any language in paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule sufficient to displace this ordinary rule. Although the paragraph refers to a right to exercise the Put Option within a period of three months “following a discovery … that the Corporate Member is in breach of any provision”, the object of that is to lay down a time limit within which matters have to be brought to a head by service of a notice in respect of any discovered breach of the Agreement, not to displace the usual rule that once matters are brought to a head by notice to terminate an agreement it is open to the terminating party to seek to justify the termination by reference to any breaches of the agreement which have occurred up to that point and which have the requisite character (as repudiatory breaches or, in this case, as breaches which satisfy the criteria of seriousness set out in paragraph 1.7).  </p>

The attempt by Holdings to subvert the proper management processes for the LLP in an effort improperly to impose its will in the conduct of the LLP’s affairs, including as one element in that the stoppage of payment of the advance drawings of the Defendants, is also relevant to the Defendants’ claim under section 994, considered at paras. [1094]ff below. ( By similar reasoning, it would also be open to the Defendants to seek to rely on the breach by Holdings of clause 13.6 consisting in its failure to inform the LLP about the decision taken on 20 August 2008 to move to “open architecture” advisory arrangements with clients: paras. [255]-[259] above; but since in my view that breach arose out of an understandable degree of confusion about the precise ambit of Holdings’ obligations to provide information to the LLP and since the decision would have been disclosed at any point when it became of particular relevance for the LLP, the breach did not constitute “gross misconduct” or “gross negligence” within the meaning of paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule and it is not necessary to examine it further). </p>

This accords with the usual objective approach applied in determining the content of contractual obligations and assessing whether they have been breached. It also accords with the strong desirability, in the specific context of a put option agreement, that the parties should be able to know with reasonable clarity at the time a put option is exercised whether there is a proper basis for its exercise or not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, however, one qualification I would add to that basic approach. I think that it would be relevant to answering in the affirmative the question whether a breach of the Agreement had occurred in a manner amounting to “gross misconduct” if it were established at trial that a particular breach had been committed in deliberate way, with the party in breach knowing that it was so acting or being reckless as to that fact – that is to say, if the party in breach had acted in conscious disregard of the rights of the other party under the Agreement. So, for example, in a marginal case the innocent party may purport to exercise put option rights under paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule thinking that that is justified by reference to objective circumstances, but if the court disagrees, or in order to bolster his case on “gross misconduct”, that party may also seek to show at trial that the party in breach acted deliberately in a knowing or reckless way. This qualification to a simple objective approach still allows the party in breach to know at the time a put option notice is served whether it is valid, since if that party has acted in conscious disregard of the rights of the other party it will know that and therefore will be in a position to assess the risks of refusing to recognise the validity of the notice in question. (I do not think that the converse would apply: if, judged on an objective basis, the Agreement had been breached in a manner amounting to gross misconduct, it would not be open to the party in breach to seek to defend itself by saying that it had acted on the basis of a subjective mistake of which the innocent party had had no notice – in that situation the innocent party cannot know whether its action in serving a notice might later be proved to be invalid by reference to the subjective state of mind of the party in breach which he has had no </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the end, on the facts I have found, the result in this case does not depend upon assessment of Holdings’ (Mr Ribeiro’s) subjective state of mind, because the context in which Holdings stopped payment of the advance drawings due to the Defendants meant that, judged on an objective basis, it had indicated an intention to repudiate the proper operation of the Agreement in a fundamental way, which clearly amounted to gross misconduct for the purposes of paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule. The Defendants were deliberately deprived by Holdings of monies which, according to the terms of the Agreement, they should have been paid, on the basis of a settled determination on the part of Holdings (objectively manifested) to stop the payments to them as part of a scheme by F&amp;C to exert illegitimate pressure upon them to agree to F&amp;C’s proposals for the way forward for the LLP’s business and for F&amp;C to gain practical management control of the LLP. I would, however, add that reference to Holdings’ subjective state of mind (i.e. by reference to the state of mind of its agent, Mr Ribeiro) reinforces that conclusion, since in my view he acted with the knowledge that Holdings had no right under the Agreement to subvert the intended decisionmaking processes of the LLP as it sought to do and in reckless disregard of the rights of the Defendants under the Agreement: paras. [704]-[705] above. Similar reasoning also leads to the conclusion that the other breaches of the Agreement identified at paras. [726]-[727] above amounted to “gross misconduct”. Given my conclusion in relation to “gross misconduct”, it is not necessary to refer to the alternative basis of “gross negligence” relied on by the Defendants. </p>

So far as concerns the effect upon the LLP, two points may be made. Holdings’ conduct in acting in clear breach of the Agreement in this way as the culmination of the disputes from the 21 January LLP Board meeting and the 18 February Members' meeting was bound to be highly detrimental to the co-operative working relationship between the Defendants and F&amp;C and its representatives, which was an important foundation for the success of the LLP. Also, it was action taken as part of a scheme by Holdings to exert illegitimate pressure on the Defendants to accept F&amp;C’s plans for the business, contrary to their own judgment, so undermining the interest of the LLP  to have the benefit of the full and uninhibited expression of views on the LLP Board before decisions were taken, after full and informed debate, how the LLP should proceed (if necessary by taking a vote if disagreements persisted).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards the effect upon the Defendants, the breach of the Agreement had a direct materially adverse effect upon them, in that they were deprived of monies which they ought to have received (and as a result of a deliberate decision, rather than a mere administrative error, so that at the time the First Put Option Notices were served there appeared to be no prospect that the monies would be paid shortly thereafter). It is no answer for F&amp;C to say that the monies were in fact paid the next day. Since, as set out above, the parties intended that they should be able to assess the validity of a put option notice at the time it is served, the test of material adverse effect under paragraph 1.7 falls to be applied at that time, and not by reference to how events might transpire later on. This interpretation is supported by the language of the provision, which defines an entitlement for the Defendants to serve a put option notice by reference to a breach which “<span style="text-decoration:underline">has</span> a materially adverse effect” (present tense). Accordingly, in the context of the Agreement, the material adverse effect requirement has to be assessed by reference to the circumstances applying at the time the notice is served and their character, whether they are by their nature adverse or calculated to have an adverse effect (to adopt the formulation of Lightman J in <span style="font-style:italic">Evans v SMG Television</span> [2003] EWHC 1423 (Ch); [2003] All ER (D) 348 (Jun), at [274], interpreting a contractual provision which, in this respect, was analogous).  </p>

Since the LLP was intended to be a vehicle to serve the interests of the Defendants (as well as F&amp;C) and to operate to that end by means of the decision-making procedures involving the Defendants as set out in the Agreement, the damage done by Holdings to co-operative working relationships within the LLP and the way in which it sought to undermine those decision-making procedures by stopping payment of the Defendants’ advance drawings and removing management decisions to the Members’ meeting also constituted materially adverse effects upon the Defendants. </p>

The thrust of the letter was that there had been a mutual mistake, made in good faith, to the effect that the Members' meeting had authority to decide to block the drawings for the Defendants.  Mr Logan said that as a result of the Defendants’ Put Option Notices, Holdings had taken advice and, “We now appreciate that the Members' meeting had no authority to decide these matters for the LLP”.

Mr Logan accused the Defendants of becoming aware of the mistake soon after the meeting and of choosing to keep quiet about it (these accusations were misplaced, as I have found above).

As a sweetener, the Defendants also suggested that they should increase the basic salaries payable to the staff in 2009 by 5%.  They argued that this rebalancing of the staff’s remuneration packages from bonus to salary would be in line with recommendations for the financial industry to shift the balance between basic salary and bonus elements of remuneration packages more towards the salary element.   </p>

In the circumstances in early 2009, particularly following the Defendants’ exercise of their Put Options, this would be to the financial advantage of the Defendants.  This is because the formula for the Put Option price in paragraph 1.2 of the Fourth Schedule would operate by reference to an average of the profits of the LLP in its two most profitable years out of the year in which the option was exercised (2009), the two preceding years (2007 and 2008) and the one following year (2010).   </p>

These were dark times from the point of view of the LLP.  The FoHF industry generally, and the LLP’s business in particular, were doing very badly by comparison with the preceding period and any guesses as to improvement would be pure speculation. Moreover, any improvement which might come would be likely to take some considerable time to be achieved.  I consider that F&amp;C and the Defendants all thought that 2009 and 2010 were almost bound to be worse, in terms of profits for the LLP, than 2007 and 2008.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ribeiro fairly pointed out that there had been disputes about items which could affect the 2008 accounts and that this had held up their finalisation; and that in the previous year he had arranged for early payment of advanced profits in response to requests by the Defendants to help them meet their tax liabilities but that no such request had been made this year.  Disingenuously (in light of the forewarning he had had from Mr Tilson), Mr Ribeiro expressed surprise that he had not been given prior knowledge of the document prepared by Mr Tilson, while also (fairly) making the point that Mr Culligan should have given formal notification of his intention to table the draft accounts.  However, he agreed to use his influence to get F&amp;C’s Finance Department to issue the LLP’s accounts for 2008 as soon as possible. Mr Culligan proposed a resolution that 100% of the LLP’s profits for 2008 be distributed to the Members, and (subject to an amendment by Mr Ribeiro to make it clear that the reference was to the profits contained in the final, audited accounts for 2008) the resolution was unanimously approved. (On about 14 April 2009 it was agreed that since the amount of the LLP’s profits for 2008 was known, subject only to a few items of dispute, about 90% of the profits would be paid to the Members in advance of the accounts being finalised, and that was done: Mr Ribeiro had retreated from his tactic of trying to place the Defendants under personal financial pressure). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ribeiro pointed out that one key matter to be resolved before the 2008 accounts could be finalised was the amount of employee bonuses for 2008.  This was now urgent to prevent upsetting the LLP employees, since F&amp;C Group bonuses were about to be announced.  Mr Cole said he thought it should be possible for agreement to be reached and bonuses announced in line with the timetable for announcing bonuses throughout the group.   </p>

Mr Culligan expressed his view that these should be amortised over five years (i.e. not all taken into account in 2008, thereby depressing the LLP’s profits for 2008 – a point of significance for both sides because of the operation of the Put Option price formula: see paras. [747]-[749] above), and said that the only inference that he could draw from F&amp;C’s insistence that they all be accounted for in 2008 was that F&amp;C was deliberately trying to depress the LLP’s profits for 2008 and hence the available profit distribution in respect of that year.   </p>

Mr Culligan said he thought KPMG would ask for management’s views whether there was a future for the Credit Alpha Fund (so that outside investors could be expected to be attracted into it and to bear some of the launch costs, so affecting any provision to be made in the LLP’s accounts). Mr Ribeiro said he would not be prepared to mislead anyone about questions whether the Credit Alpha Fund was a going concern  and that all LLP Board members should adopt the same approach.  It was agreed that Mr Tilson, F&amp;C’s Finance Department and KPMG should consider the matter together.   </p>

Mr Culligan accused him of angling to have the Pushkin Fund closed down and said he should have discussed the matters in the e-mail with the Defendants before sending it out.

He sent a private e-mail to Mr Ribeiro to give his account of events and explain his actions; to inform Mr Ribeiro that he believed Mr Culligan had lost confidence in him (Mr Tilson); and to complain that he felt that he had been scolded by Mr Culligan “like a naughty schoolboy”, which he interpreted as a form of intimidation.   </p>

Since the Defendants were the persons with primary responsibility for handling the LLP’s relationship with the Pushkin Fund, I think the proper course for Mr Tilson should have been to seek the Defendants’ views on the detailed points he wished to raise to see if there was a good explanation, before seeking to refer their behaviour to others as he did.  Accordingly, I do not think the Defendants’ treatment of him on this issue can fairly be described as “intimidation”. </p>

Nonetheless, on 8 March 2009 Mr Ribeiro joined in the e-mail correspondence to complain that he had always said that the Defendants should never have been members of the Pushkin Fund Board (so as to avoid any conflicts of interest) and to say that he had called for Mr Tilson’s e-mail to be tabled for discussion at the next ManCom meeting.  This tended to reinforce the Defendants’ suspicion that Mr Tilson and Mr Ribeiro were co-ordinating their actions in some way.  It seems that Mr Ribeiro also passed Mr Tilson’s complaint on to Mr Cole as a human resources matter, leading to Mr Tilson giving a report to Mr Ribeiro and Mr Cole by e-mail on 10 March.   </p>

Mr Culligan was then involved in providing KPMG with full instructions and discussing the issue with them.  He also took informal advice on the issue from another firm of accountants. In the end, in late March KPMG advised that the full likely liability of LLP to the Balanced Fund in respect of the launch costs should be recognised in the LLP’s 2008 accounts (i.e. not spread over a five year period as Mr Culligan had wanted), but the actual amount to be included should be determined based on management’s view of the likelihood that and extent to which new investors would come into the Fund and bear a proportion of the launch costs costs. Accordingly, the question of the effect of this item on the LLP’s 2008 accounts was to turn on the views of the LLP’s Board.   </p>

The arguments about the different proposed approaches to bonuses and salaries were resumed.  Mr Cole objected that the Defendants’ proposals would involve a mis-match between the sharp reduction proposed by the Defendants for bonuses for 2008 and the actual performance of the LLP in 2008 in terms of profitability; the Defendants’ proposals would, for example, mean a reduction in the total bonus for Mr Sparks of 68% by comparison with his bonus for 2007 whereas profits for the LLP were down by only 20% from 2007.  The Defendants continued to press for their proposed approach, saying that it was more suited to the different market environment which now existed, particularly for hedge funds, and that it was appropriate to shift the balance between the bonus and salary elements in the employees’ remuneration packages.  Mr Ribeiro objected to such a change being applied retrospectively and disagreed with a 5% increase in salary for employees in 2009, on the grounds that it was inappropriate to increase the fixed costs of the LLP in that way at such a difficult time.

The situation of the Pushkin Fund was considered and it was decided that the LLP should send a letter to its directors to cover the LLP’s position in relation to advice to them about their options.  The AUM and redemptions were discussed.

After that transfer to the Select Fund had been processed on 1 April 2009, the remaining funds actively managed by the LLP would be some $63 million in the Balanced Fund (including its holding in the Credit Alpha Fund) held on behalf of two remaining investors – Friends Provident and Millennium BCP Fortis.   </p>

The point of this was to try to gain goodwill with clients by granting them a reduction in fees during the gradual winding down of the Select Fund.  Mr Ribeiro pointed out that F&amp;C could achieve the same commercial result by itself rebating to the clients the marketing fee it received from the LLP, but gave his view that it would be better for the LLP to do it directly (i.e. so that the goodwill would accrue to the LLP, which might help it when trying to build its client base in future).  This was a genuine and generous offer by Mr Ribeiro which again indicates that he was not thinking in terms of damaging the LLP, but rather was looking for ways to safeguard its reputation and goodwill with clients against a time in the future when its performance and market circumstances had improved and it would be possible to rebuild its business.   </p>

Mr Ribeiro made the stronger point that the Defendants’ proposals were a departure from how they had dealt with bonuses in previous years, to which Mr Culligan replied that this was because 2008 was financially a very different year.  Mr Barthelemy accused F&amp;C of trying to hurt the Defendants by their proposals because of the legal position (for the logic of this comment see paras.

Mr Barthelemy referred to recent FSA proposed guidelines on rebalancing salary and bonuses in support of the Defendants’ position; Mr Cole denied there was any inconsistency between his proposals and those guidelines.   </p>

Mr Cole maintained that it was important the employees had confidence that the bonuses awarded were related to the profitability of the business and that it would be damaging to the LLP to be seen to pay the least it thought it could get away with in any one year.

He said that this obligation arose from the LLP’s obligation to treat its clients fairly (this was an additional line of argument as compared with what he had said on 18 March).

I reject that suggestion.  In my view, Mr Ribeiro wrote in neutral terms to fulfil what he genuinely felt was an obligation to inform the two investors of the factual position. The advice (given by Mr Apfel) to the effect that the two remaining clients should be informed of their position was, in my view, sought and given in good faith and could be regarded as supported by the regulatory requirements applicable to the LLP requiring it to treat clients fairly (para. [94] above). The information the letters contained was not good news for them (since as the last two investors they would probably have to bear a higher burden of costs associated with the Fund) and the sentence quoted above was in neutral terms in recognition of the likely reality that they might wish to re-assess their position.  Mr Ribeiro did not have the intention of inducing the two investors to redeem and the letters were not framed to achieve that result.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, there is force in other criticisms by the Defendants of Mr Ribeiro’s conduct in relation to the sending of these letters. The question whether the obligation of the LLP to treat its clients fairly meant that these two clients had to be informed that they were the last remaining clients did not lead to an obvious, single answer. It is not usually the position that clients in a mutual fund such as the Balanced Fund have to be given a running account of the proportionate extent of their involvement in the fund, and at the ManCom meeting on 18 March Mr Ribeiro did not put forward such an argument. The advice received by Mr Ribeiro had been obtained (at least in part) in order to inform the LLP what to do, yet Mr Ribeiro failed to share the details of it with the LLP so that the ManCom could consider it and decide how the LLP should proceed in the light of it, as had been contemplated should happen at the ManCom meeting on 18 March and as required by clause 17 of the Agreement. The ManCom had not delegated its authority to Mr Ribeiro to deal with the issue. Also, there did not appear to be any urgently pressing need (such as might have justified Mr Ribeiro in acting in the unilateral way he did) to inform Friends Provident about the position so that it could consider consolidation of accounts – there were no Friends Provident group accounts referable to 1 April 2009 which were about to be drawn up or signed off in the immediate future. His peremptory demand that the Defendants agree to him informing the clients was not justified; nor did he have any authority or justification to send the letters without giving the ManCom or the Defendants any opportunity to review them first.  </p>

He also said he would inform the Board of the Balanced Fund about the letters “in the interests of transparency”. In my view, Mr Ribeiro’s advice to the Investment Committee was legitimate and sensible, since there was a distinct possibility that the two investors might wish to redeem their investments, in which case the Balanced Fund should not be taking action (pending clarification of their position) which might hinder them in doing that. In the atmosphere of mistrust at this time, however, the Defendants again assumed that this was a hostile action by Mr Ribeiro, amounting in effect to a direction to Mr Sparks (who sat on the LLP’s Investment Committee and had a veto in relation to its decisions) to prevent the Defendants making other investment decisions for the Balanced Fund.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 31 March 2009, a further ManCom meeting took place attended by Mr Ribeiro, the Defendants, Mr Tilson and Mr Sparks.  Mr Ribeiro pressed the Defendants for detailed information on actual and potential activities of the LLP with associated revenues and costs.  The Defendants objected that they could not produce that sort of information without being able to meet the client base or having input from F&amp;C Distribution in order to assess the potential market for their proposed new products.  They therefore asked Mr Ribeiro to arrange meetings for them with F&amp;C’s clients and with Mr Mendez de Vigo. Mr Ribeiro said he would check within F&amp;C whether it would be feasible to arrange such meetings.  Mr Barthelemy pressed for a promise that such meetings would be arranged, but Mr Ribeiro said he could not promise as it was not fully in his control. This tension between Mr Ribeiro and F&amp;C on the one hand (who were now pressing for detailed financial projections, including estimates of revenues in relation to the LLP’s proposed products) and the Defendants on the other (who maintained that they needed assistance from F&amp;C Distribution to produce such projections) represented a new area of dispute between the parties.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">F&amp;C’s case at trial was that the Defendants had produced a detailed business plan with financial forecasts when they first approached F&amp;C in 2004 with their proposal to set up the LLP and should have been able to do the same for the LLP’s business at this stage, including setting out a persuasive case for any new products they wished the LLP to launch.  F&amp;C maintained that the impasse which arose in relation to this - where the Defendants did not provide the further detailed information which the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board required to make decisions about potential new business projects for the LLP - was therefore the fault of the Defendants in failing to produce any detailed business plan for the LLP Board to consider.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendants’ response was that since the LLP was part of the F&amp;C Group and the marketing of its products (including any new products) was the responsibility of F&amp;C Distribution (with the Defendants having only very limited contact themselves with F&amp;C’s clients), the input of F&amp;C Distribution was essential to provide an assessment of potential client appetite for such products and hence an assessment of possible revenue to be derived from such products.  They said that in fact they had had the benefit of input from F&amp;C Distribution when they worked on their original business case for the LLP in order to turn it (with help from Mr Ribeiro and his assistants within F&amp;C) into a full business plan for Mr Ribeiro to put to the Execom and Board of F&amp;C plc.  They said that it was usual for entities within the F&amp;C Group to be able to draw on the resources of F&amp;C Distribution to assist in providing an assessment of client interest and revenue forecasts when compiling business plans for new products for consideration. They maintained that this was an obvious approach, since it was F&amp;C Distribution which had the most extensive contacts with clients and was best placed to assess how easily and in what volume some new product might be capable of being sold to them. These points had considerable force. They were further supported by the form of detailed business plan with which Mr Mendez de Vigo eventually provided them as a model to follow, in which the assessments of potential client interest used as the basis for revenue forecasts had been supplied by F&amp;C Distribution personnel.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendants complained that not only did Mr Mendez de Vigo refuse to meet them to discuss client interest and production of revenue forecasts in conjunction with F&amp;C Distribution, as the foundation for a business plan, (since he refused to meet them <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the Defendants provided him with a fully worked out business plan including such forecasts – a position the Defendants characterised, with considerable justice, as a “Catch-22” situation), but Mr Ribeiro also forbade them to have direct contact with clients (see e.g. paras. [443]-[444] below). This disabled them from researching client interest amongst F&amp;C’s client base for themselves in order to produce the sort of fully worked out business plan with revenue forecasts which Mr Mendez de Vigo was demanding from them. Mr Ribeiro’s stance regarding contact with clients was assumed by him for legitimate reasons (in view of the importance for F&amp;C of conducting its overall relationships with clients in a coherent way), but created difficulties for the Defendants. The Defendants therefore blamed F&amp;C for the impasse in relation to production of a business plan for products (both its existing products and any new products) which could be taken further by the LLP. </p>

The question of providing access to clients and the provision of such assistance fell within the obligation of the Corporate Member in clause 13.7 of the Agreement to provide “general marketing support” for “the activities of the LLP” (including within that phrase the activity of seeking to explore and develop new products).  But that obligation was qualified by the right of F&amp;C to use its discretion as to what support should be provided.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as Mr Ribeiro’s direction that the Defendants should not themselves approach F&amp;C clients is concerned, I consider that amounted to a legitimate exercise by F&amp;C of its discretion under clause 13.7 in relation to the conduct of marketing activities.  At this stage F&amp;C was struggling to contain client dissatisfaction with its performance across a wide range of products. It was entitled to assess that – particularly in those circumstances – its relations with and marketing to its clients should be conducted through single, unified points of contact at F&amp;C Distribution, who could best assess and respond appropriately to the clients’ overall needs and concerns. F&amp;C was entitled to assess that this would be preferable to allowing a chaotic free-for-all involving individual F&amp;C product managers approaching clients to try to canvass their views about or to persuade them to buy their particular products. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also think that the refusal of F&amp;C Distribution to dedicate resources to help the LLP at this stage was a legitimate exercise of discretion by F&amp;C under clause 13.7. F&amp;C Distribution’s resources for marketing were not unlimited. F&amp;C Distribution was subject to many demands for marketing support from across the group, and it had to decide how to prioritise those demands in light of the resources available to it. Moreover, the extent to which F&amp;C Distribution could trespass upon the goodwill and patience of clients to canvass possible new products and to make updated assessments </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, whereas it would have been a breach of the obligation in clause 13.7 for F&amp;C maliciously to withhold support in order to damage the LLP, that was not what occurred. Even though there was a degree of unfriendliness and a lack of helpfulness in Mr Mendez de Vigo’s attitude in relation to this issue (reflecting the way in which the Defendants’ previous dealings with him had eroded his sense of goodwill towards them), F&amp;C Distribution was entitled to withhold the assistance sought by the Defendants for two particular reasons.  First, aside from the CTA proposal (which was considered in detail by Mr Mendez de Vigo and Ms Hall and rejected by them on its business merits and for which, in any event, the Defendants did not propose that it should be funded by the LLP: see paras. [340]-[351] above) and the QFII proposal (which was carried forward by Mr Mendez de Vigo until the point at which the Defendants could not provide a reasonable level of assurance about the likelihood of investor support from among their contacts: see paras. [356]-[361] above), the Defendants did not make any business proposals which were sufficiently concrete or specific, even at a level well short of a full business plan, to provide any good basis to persuade F&amp;C Distribution that they merited effort by F&amp;C Distribution to assist in developing them further.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the existence of the dispute, which was now reflected in the litigation on foot between F&amp;C and the Defendants, meant that it was not realistic to expect that any new product to be managed by the LLP could be introduced into the market with any credibility or expectation of success.  As the Defendants themselves emphasised from time to time, the main attraction of LLP-managed products was their skill and expertise.  So, for example, if the LLP had offered a fiduciary management service or due diligence service to third parties, the basis on which it would have been sold would have had to be the skill and expertise of the Defendants in selecting hedge fund investments.  But according to their First Put Option Notices served on 25 February, they were leaving the business; and there was no obvious prospect of finding suitably experienced and credible replacements for them.  Also, the fact that there was a serious dispute between them and F&amp;C would be expected to operate as a major distraction for them in the effective management of the LLP’s investment products, even if they somehow remained in position within the management of the LLP.  Therefore, from about early March 2009, when it became clear there would be no prompt resolution of the dispute and that litigation was on foot, there were very strong reasons why F&amp;C Distribution was entitled to conclude that its resources and client goodwill should not be expended as the Defendants would wish. </p>

This would have been a sensible way for them to proceed, but they did not seek to do this. Moreover, there was in my view nothing that the Defendants could have said at this stage which could or would have persuaded F&amp;C Distribution that they had any good answer to the difficulty referred to at para. [814] above. Because of that difficulty, Mr Mendex de Vigo would still have been unpersuaded that there was any merit in him meeting them or in devoting the resources of F&amp;C Distribution to working up a detailed business plan for the LLP at that stage. </p>

In my view, the steps taken by Mr Tilson to by-pass the ordinary processes of government within the LLP (see paras. [741], [761]-[764], [773], [776] and [797]-[798] above), the appearance of a degree of co-ordination with Mr Ribeiro, other steps taken by Mr Ribeiro by-passing the ordinary governance structures of the LLP (in particular, in unilaterally sending out his letters of 25 March to the two remaining investors in the Balanced Fund: paras. [790]-[791] above), all read against the background of sharply conflicting interests of the Defendants and F&amp;C in the context of the dispute, combined together to produce an adequate justification of the step taken by Mr Culligan.  Since he had legitimate objective grounds to be concerned that Mr Ribeiro might be seeking to by-pass proper governance of the LLP by contact with Mr Tilson, he also, in my view, had legitimate objective grounds for concern that he might also be seeking to do so by contact with Mr Sparks.  I therefore find that Mr Culligan’s covert investigation of e-mails of staff of the LLP was authorised by the LLP under its relevant policy and was justified on the facts which presented themselves to Mr Culligan at the time.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The same analysis applies in relation to F&amp;C’s complaint about Mr Culligan’s actions under section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (set out at para. [80] above). Applying the statutory definition in section 1(1) of the Act, the “data controller” for the relevant e-mail archive was the LLP. Mr Culligan was authorised by the LLP, the data controller, to conduct his investigation (so the element of the offence defined in section 55(1)(a) was not satisfied in relation to his gaining access to the e-mails). Certainly he believed that was the case (so he had a defence under section 55(2)(b) in relation to his gaining access to the e-mails). As regards his disclosure of the e-mails to JGR in the course of the conduct of the dispute, he had a reasonable belief that he had the right to disclose them to obtain advice on his position and to defend himself and the LLP in the dispute and the litigation (and hence had a defence under section 55(2)(b)). The same points apply in relation to Mr Barthelemy. </p>

Mr Ribeiro did not specify what level of detail such a plan should contain but, in context, I think it was tolerably clear that he was pressing the Defendants to do the best they could with the information and ideas they had and then seek to use that as a platform for debate with Mr Mendez de Vigo, Mr Niven and their teams (i.e. he was proposing that they should follow the course referred to in para [815] above, but the Defendants did not proceed in that way). </p>

Mr Tilson informed the Board that the LLP’s 2008 accounts were due to be filed with the FSA by 27 April 2009 and that in the absence of an approved budget for 2009, the best estimate of costs for that year was the level of costs for 2008 (about £900,000).  Mr Tilson tabled the latest draft of the LLP’s 2008 accounts, indicating that their approval by KPMG was conditional, in particular, on disclosure of the Defendants’ service of their Put Option Notices and confirmation from the Board that the LLP was a going concern.  Mr Tilson was asked to discuss the first of these further with KPMG.  The Board members then discussed the question whether the LLP was a going concern.  Mr Culligan said that, in his view, the LLP was a going concern and Mr Cole agreed with him (despite suggestions by Mr Ribeiro that the matter needed to be considered further – another indication, it may be observed, that Mr Cole did indeed approach his role as Board member with an independent attitude).

On the accounting treatment of the Credit Alpha Fund launch costs, Mr Ribeiro, Mr Johns and Mr Cole asked for further accounting advice on the grounds that Mr Culligan had questioned the independence of KPMG and the other accountancy advice he had obtained had been informal.  Unfortunately, by an oversight, Mr Tilson had not sent Mr McDonald’s note of 6 April 2009 (para. [803] above) to Mr Johns and Mr Cole.  The Defendants pressed for a vote on a resolution that the costs should continue to be amortised over five years in the LLP’s accounts.  In light of the disagreements on the questions to be put to the accountancy advisers, Mr Ribeiro said the Board would have to vote on the questions.  In the event, it was left that Mr Johns would try to find a satisfactory formulation of questions for further accounting advice.  (After the meeting he suggested an approach to Ernst &amp; Young, but Mr McDonald ruled that out as impermissible “opinion shopping”).  Mr Culligan again proposed that a vote be taken on the Defendants’ resolution for amortisation of the costs, but Mr Johns proposed an adjournment and Mr Cole and Mr Ribeiro agreed with him.

Again, the reference to “dissolution” of the LLP simply reflected the label that had been given to this item by Mr Moir at the outset of phase 2 of the Project Fitness exercise in November 2008, which had been retained for continuity and ease of reference across the various iterations of the report (see para. [512] above) - it did not indicate that he had been told that any decision had been taken to dissolve the LLP.  This latest Project Fitness report provides further support for this finding, since it shows a reversal, by reason of “delay”, of about the same figure for a reduction in staff costs as had been taken as a saving in the earlier figures for Project Fitness – i.e. Mr Moir and Ms Bomba were never told that there would be greater savings, as would have been expected if the decision had been that the LLP should simply be closed. </p>

By the time F&amp;C took control of the management of the LLP in late 2009 circumstances had changed radically from late 2008, and it had good reason to have changed its mind about whether LLP staff should be dismissed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In late April 2009, F&amp;C received an invitation to tender for a FoHF investment from a company called bfinance Limited (“bfinance”) in a window between 24 April and 20 May 2009.  Mr Hunt in F&amp;C Distribution forwarded this to Ms Ross to ask whether the performance of the Balanced Fund had improved sufficiently to merit making a bid for this business.  She, of course, had left F&amp;C by this stage, but it seems that no automatic reply had been set up by the LLP on her “fandcpartners.com” e-mail address to give out that information.  It was not until much later that the information reached Mr Barthelemy.  This was no doubt irritating for the Defendants, but was the result of an unfortunate mix-up rather than any breach of duty (let alone any deliberate scheme to damage the LLP).   </p>

Eventually, in some desperation, F&amp;C Netherlands spoke to Mr Tilson by telephone on 13 May.  He promptly sent a response by e-mail, copying it to Mr Ribeiro amongst others.  Mr Ribeiro e-mailed Mr Barthelemy to protest at his failure to answer the questions and to point out that this did not build confidence with F&amp;C Netherlands.  Mr Barthelemy again e-mailed F&amp;C Netherlands to offer to attend a meeting with WRI, but F&amp;C Netherlands replied that it would not be necessary.  There was nothing untoward in this.

This time Mr McDonald’s note of 6 April was available to everyone and he telephoned in to the meeting to explain the position and the technical accounting advice given by KPMG.  In terms of the amount of the LLP’s liability, he said it depended on the view of the Board (i.e. as to the prospects for the Credit Alpha Fund’s business and its ability to attract in investors to help bear the launch costs) and stated that that view should be as at 31 December 2008, with the possibility of adding a note to the accounts to reflect any change after that date (although he also advised that the sums in question were so small that they were not material to the 2008 accounts and therefore might not even merit a post-balance sheet note).  The size of the Credit Alpha Fund had been greatly reduced after the year-end as redemptions from the Select Fund (and therefore, in due course, from the Balanced Fund and the Credit Alpha Fund) took effect.   </p>

KPMG would be likely to find any decision it made acceptable.

Mr Culligan argued that what he termed “the strong performance” of the Credit Alpha Fund (as part of the Balanced Fund) in 2008 and proper marketing efforts by F&amp;C could still at that date have led to increased investment in the fund.  Mr Johns said that investor appetite had not returned for hedge fund products and asked Mr Culligan for evidence to support his comments.

The Defendants voted against that resolution. Mr Ribeiro, Mr Johns and Mr Cole voted for it and it was carried. In my assessment, those votes reflected legitimate differences of view between the LLP Board members about the future prospects of the Credit Alpha Fund at the relevant date, particularly in light of the redemption notices in relation to the Select Fund which had been received and confirmed before 31 December 2008.   </p>

He had not circulated the document in advance.  The Business Model Review set out the Defendants’ proposals for new products to be developed by the LLP which were stated to be integral to the FoHF business model and necessary to maintain the LLP’s competitive edge against its peers.  In his main witness statement, Mr Barthelemy emphasised that the Defendants were determined to put forward genuine proposals for attractive new business propositions for the LLP, in part as a way of testing F&amp;C’s attitude to the LLP.  F&amp;C suggested that, contrary to this evidence, the Defendants were simply trying to catch F&amp;C out with insincere proposals designed to provoke reactions from F&amp;C so as to bolster their claims in the litigation.   </p>

In my view, the Defendants at this stage were genuinely trying to persuade the LLP Board members, and beyond them F&amp;C, of the desirability of pursuing these proposals.  However, the Business Model Review was thin and the arguments it set out were far from compelling.  It is revealing that this was the best that the Defendants were able to do.

The paper set out no concrete proposal for the LLP to seed such a fund itself.

If the CTA fund were not seeded by the LLP, it would need to be seeded by F&amp;C or its clients (but F&amp;C was unpersuaded of the merits of the proposal and had no obligation to tax its clients with requests for funding) or by third parties (but the Defendants did not identify any whom they or F&amp;C had approached, or might conceivably approach, with any realistic prospects of obtaining funding).

The F&amp;C representatives protested at Mr Culligan’s accusation and complained (with justification) that the Business Model Review was completely inadequate to form any reasonable judgment on it.  That led back to the argument of the Defendants that they could not produce a full business plan with detailed numbers without assistance from F&amp;C Distribution; and F&amp;C Distribution would not meet with them without first having a detailed paper equivalent to a full business plan (see paras.

The Business Model Review did not give sufficient detail, by reference to material the Defendants could be expected to know and provide, as to require the LLP Board to agree that there should be further investigation of the new proposed ventures on the basis of it or an expansion of the LLP’s business activities under Article 4.1 of the Agreement.

Mr Mendez de Vigo’s position did not involve any withdrawal from the LLP of the basic marketing support which clause 13.7 obliged F&amp;C to provide (see paras. [325]-[330] above).  Beyond that, decisions as to marketing resources (including Mr Mendez de Vigo’s time) to be provided to the LLP were a matter for the discretion of F&amp;C.  It was not suggested to Mr Mendez de Vigo in cross-examination that his insistence on having a business plan before being prepared to meet the Defendants was arrived at in deliberate bad faith, intending to introduce an impossible condition which the Defendants could never fulfil. Up to this point, Mr Mendez de Vigo’s request to see a business plan had not been pitched at an unreasonable level (see paras. [827] and </p>

Although it is of concern that, when later asked by the Defendants for an example of what he required, he provided a fully worked-up business plan (which included sales and revenue projections produced with the assistance of his own Distribution department) and did not explain that he would be prepared to accept something less from the Defendants as the best they could do in the circumstances (see paras. [887]-[888] below), his actions were not intended to destroy any opportunity for the Defendants to enlist the support of F&amp;C Distribution to develop and promote the LLP’s products if they had commercial merit.  In my view, the burden of persuasion lay on the Defendants to show Mr Mendez de Vigo that they had proposals to which it would be worthwhile F&amp;C Distribution devoting time and effort and it was legitimate for Mr Mendez de Vigo to call for something more detailed than, for example, the Defendants’ Business Model Review as a condition to persuade him that it would be worthwhile to meet and not just an empty discussion leading nowhere.  He knew that the LLP was capable of producing much more detailed work when it was serious about a proposal, as it had done for the CTA project, and he was entitled to press the Defendants for more details along those lines and for an explanation how their position could be explained to clients (para. [814] above) before agreeing to meet them and before making arrangements for F&amp;C Distribution to divert resources to engage with them to work up a detailed business plan for new products which could be taken forward for full consideration by F&amp;C. </p>

This is a more difficult submission to analyse, partly because of my conclusions in relation to the validity of those Notices. The basis on which the present submission would become relevant is not altogether clear. I think it would be unreal to ignore what had happened up to 25 February and to ignore my previous conclusions regarding breaches of the Agreement as at that date, when analysing the position on 22 May. What I have done is consider whether there was a significant change in Holdings’ approach to the conduct of its relations with the Defendants and the LLP after 25 February which somehow changed matters so that, when judging the position at 22 May, it could be said that Holdings no longer gave an appearance of trying to subvert the operation of the Agreement and hence could not be said to be in breach of its relevant obligations when judged at that time.  </p>

Mr Ribeiro, for Holdings, arranged for the Defendants’ advance drawings to be paid on 26 February. He then made a clear effort in early March to show that he and Holdings had ceased to try to rely on the resolutions passed at the Members’ meeting on 18 February as a basis for determining how the affairs of the LLP should be conducted, and generally sought to adopt a stance where relevant decisions would be taken by the LLP Board or ManCom, in line with the terms of the Agreement.  So far as concerns the conduct of Mr Ribeiro, Mr Cole and Mr Johns in carrying out their respective functions as members of the LLP Board, ManCom and Compensation Committee, they approached the questions they had to decide or vote on in a proper and lawful way, as set out above.

This is the same I ask for any product to be launched through the PDC [Product Development Committee of F&amp;C].  If needed, I am happy to send you some samples.

Mr Culligan had already got Mr Tilson to prepare a version of the budget which he had deployed without sufficient warning to the LLP ManCom and Board at the Board meeting on 4 March 2009, and I think Mr Tilson was entitled to be cautious about lending further support to Mr Culligan now that the Board was already seised of a particular budget proposal.  </p>

This proposal made Mr Tilson nervous in case it misled investors, and he said he would only distribute such a fact sheet if that was approved by the F&amp;C’s ARC Department.  Mr Culligan said there was no need for such approval.  However, on 24 June Mr Culligan told Mr Tilson the US dollar fact sheet had, in fact, been approved by F&amp;C’s ARC Department and told him to distribute it.  Mr Tilson remained unsure of his position and delayed a few days, but then sent it out on 29 June. </p>

The Defendants were right to be angry and concerned when they found out what he had done.  This was a matter of particular sensitivity to the Defendants (and the LLP), because of the criticism of the LLP’s charging of fees implicit in Achmea’s unusual demand for an audit of the Select Fund fees (the implied criticism seemed to amount, in effect, to a query whether the LLP had been fraudulent).  The Defendants were understandably upset that Mr Ribeiro had agreed to an audit of the LLP’s fees by Achmea and had instructed Mr Tilson to carry out work on a response to Achmea on such a matter, and without informing them. This was a further incident of Mr Ribeiro seeking to run the business of the LLP without reference to them and behind their backs. In my view, these were matters which Mr Ribeiro ought to have discussed with the Defendants and the ManCom, in accordance with clause 17 of the Agreement, before any action was taken on behalf of the LLP. </p>

I consider that Mr Mendez de Vigo paid insufficient attention to the detail of what he was asking the Defendants to provide to him by reference to the sample which was sent to them, which was ill-advised (since he gave Mr Barthelemy ammunition for a complaint by failing to explain in reasonable terms what was required), and that his behaviour at this point was high-handed (particularly since he does not seem to have studied the sales presentation provided by Mr Barthelemy with much attention and his implicit complaint that it should not have been sent to Mr Lyne was unjustified); but his conduct was not intended to be destructive of the ability of the Defendants to engage with F&amp;C Distribution. In particular, Mr Mendez de Vigo’s request for a written explanation of the Defendants’ position in relation to the dispute to inform marketing judgments in respect of the LLP’s products was reasonable (see para.

The Defendants’ failure to address this legitimate concern in writing at this stage, despite repeated requests by Mr Mendez de Vigo, meant that Mr Mendez de Vigo’s refusal to meet them was justified.   </p>

The Defendants pressed for version 4.  Mr Johns and Mr Cole voted with Mr Ribeiro for version 3, which they regarded as more prudent, so version 3 of the budget was carried by a majority.  I consider that the different views on each side of this debate again represented genuine legitimate differences of opinion about what was in the best interests of the LLP. </p>

I also think that Mr Ribeiro’s comment that he had not given an instruction to Mr Tilson not to inform the Defendants about the Achmea audit, but to leave it to Mr Tilson’s discretion, was disingenuous: by this stage Mr Ribeiro knew that Mr Tilson was prepared to be disloyal to the Defendants and to act as Mr Ribeiro’s private assistant without informing the Defendants about what he was doing, and he probably recognised that there was a good chance (to put it no higher) that Mr Tilson would not inform them about the further private instructions he had received from Mr Ribeiro and the work he did pursuant to those instructions. </p>

At trial, F&amp;C accused Mr Culligan of deliberately hijacking the meeting in order to avoid answering awkward questions.  I reject that accusation.  Mr Culligan was deeply suspicious about the independence of Mr Mackay in conducting his investigation, fearing that it was, in reality, a tactical ploy by F&amp;C to put pressure on the Defendants in the dispute.  There were objective grounds on which he could reasonably entertain such a suspicion – the fact that the setting up of the LLP’s external e-mail service and IT infrastructure had been made known to the LLP ManCom and Board, and in particular Mr Ribeiro, long before and had not previously been raised as a controversial issue (see e.g. paras. [600], [631], [710], [769], [867] and [922] above); the failure of anyone within the governance structure of the LLP (whether at Board level or ManCom level) to ask Mr Culligan for an explanation regarding the matters being investigated by Mackay before the investigation was commenced and the absence of any discussion within that structure whether an investigation by the Compliance Officer was called for; and the appearance given by Mr Mackay at the outset that he was acting on behalf of F&amp;C Group rather than the LLP (para.

Mr Culligan believed he had had authority for his investigation under the relevant IT security policy (reading it with modifications appropriate for the context of the LLP).  In my view, Mr Culligan’s conduct at the meeting with Mr Mackay was genuinely to explore whether his grounds of concern about Mr Mackay’s independence from F&amp;C and from F&amp;C’s interests in fighting the Defendants in the dispute were well grounded or not.  If Mr Mackay was not genuinely independent, Mr Culligan did not wish to dignify what seemed to him to be trumped up charges and a process designed to prejudice his rights in the dispute by co-operating with Mr Mackay’s investigation and thereby appearing to accept its validity. </p>

He said he had had both face-to-face meetings and telephone conversations with Norton Rose.  This appeared to confirm Mr Culligan’s worst fears.

Mr Culligan denied there had been any wrongdoing.  He objected to Mr Mackay’s investigation and questioned the involvement of Norton Rose in setting it in motion.  He said he considered it no more than an element of the dispute dressed up as a compliance matter.

He said that if Mr Barthelemy was really set on putting together an RFP proposal, he should have contacted Mr Mendez de Vigo promptly rather than leaving it for a month before getting back to Mr Hunt and that he should have complied with Mr Mendez de Vigo’s previous request to supply a detailed business plan and written statement regarding the legal proceedings.

The reason F&amp;C IT did not immediately intervene was, in essence, explained in Ashley Smith’s e-mail: disconnecting the dual- homed computers from F&amp;C’s network would leave the LLP without the Pertrac and Bloomberg data streams, and this would have been likely to  provide ammunition to the Defendants for their complaints in the litigation that F&amp;C was deliberately seeking to undermine the LLP’s business.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">F&amp;C IT did work on proposals along these lines, but they proved not to be attractive to Mr Culligan and Mr Pennington, since they would have involved subjecting the LLP’s own discretion in choosing to link to internet sites to approval by Graeme Smith and the GISC, which had been a source of problems for the LLP previously. Therefore, Mr Culligan did not agree to F&amp;C IT’s proposals. He, in turn, on 14 September, suggested that the LLP would be happy to have its own fixed line connection to the internet to receive Pertrac and Bloomberg data, which would allow the LLP to disconnect entirely from F&amp;C’s network.   </p>

Mr Mackay contacted Mr Culligan to ask for confirmation that this would be done.  Mr Culligan replied that he saw no need to make the changes, and when Mr Mackay sought to insist on them, demanded an explanation of his reasons.  Mr Mackay responded that they had been provided already (and referred to the minutes of the LLP Board meeting on 27 July, although these had not yet been circulated).  In substance, Mr Mackay’s point appeared to be that F&amp;C Group IT policies applied and Mr Culligan had acted in breach of them in accessing staff e-mails.  Since Mr Culligan did not accept that they applied to the LLP and did not believe he had done anything wrong, he maintained his position that Mr Mackay had not shown any good reason why he should be replaced as administrator on the LLP’s e-mail system.  Mr Mackay, in fact, had no authority simply to instruct Mr Culligan to withdraw as administrator (under clause 17 of the Agreement, a matter such as this should have been brought to the ManCom for a decision). </p>

He explained his action had been motivated solely by a concern that Mr Ribeiro was seeking to instruct him directly without consulting him (Mr Culligan), even though he was the CEO of the LLP and Mr Tilson’s direct manager; it was not related to any suspicion in respect of Mr Tilson’s behaviour “of which there was none” (this was not candid: see para. [822] above; but since this was a document which would presumably go on Mr Tilson’s personnel file and in light of Mr Tilson’s concerns about his forthcoming appraisal, it was perhaps fair that Mr Culligan did not seek to set out the concerns he had about Mr Tilson’s conduct).  Mr Culligan wrote that it would not be consistent with his duty to the LLP to undertake to obtain Mr Tilson’s prior consent before he could examine any LLP documents; however, to address Mr Tilson’s concerns, he undertook that Mr Cole’s agreement, as a member of the LLP Board, would be required in future before Mr Tilson’s e-mails would be scrutinised, leaving it to Mr Cole’s discretion whether Mr Tilson should be told.

Against the background of the dispute, Mr Culligan regarded this step as highly suspicious, and he e-mailed Mr Blomerius to protest at what they had done. Mr Culligan suggested that Mr Blomerius and Mr Cole had not acted in the interests of the LLP, but so as to keep Mr Tilson’s grievance alive because it suited F&amp;C, as an element of their tactics in the litigation.  I do not think that this was the case, but against the background of the litigation (with the deep suspicion on both sides which that engendered) and the threat to Mr Culligan posed by Mr Mackay’s investigation of his review of Mr Tilson’s e-mails, I think it can fairly be said that it was perhaps unwise for Mr Cole to have involved Norton Rose as he did.   </p>

Taking that into account, he should have sought to ensure that he maintained high standards of fairness and carefulness in conducting his investigation and writing his report on it.  The ordinary obligation of fairness to be expected from a compliance officer in carrying out an investigation into alleged misconduct in a context such as this was reinforced by Rule SUP 15.6.1 of the FSA Handbook (para. [107] above), which required that information to be supplied to the FSA should be “factually accurate” (implying that there should be a proper investigation adequate to get at the truth of the facts to be reported) and, in relation to the judgments to be made by Mr Mackay and the LLP, “fairly and properly based after appropriate enquiries have been made by the firm”. </p>

I was not impressed by this particular criticism.  I do not think it was improper for Mr Mackay to seek such assistance (particularly technical, legal and regulatory assistance such as could be provided by Mr Apfel and Mr Tonkin) in reviewing and checking his draft, provided always that he ensured that if he decided to adopt any of their drafting proposals he first reviewed them carefully to satisfy himself, as the final signatory on the report, that they accurately stated his own views and findings.  In my view, Mr Mackay only accepted their proposed changes where he honestly believed it was right to do so.   </p>

This material, once digested, increased the Defendants’ sense that they were the victims of a conspiracy by F&amp;C involving Mr Tilson as a sort of F&amp;C spy in the heart of the LLP, acting in breach of his fiduciary duty to the LLP.  JGR duly made these points in a letter dated 8 December 2009, stating that Mr Culligan, as CEO of the LLP, had asked Mr Barthelemy, as Senior Partner, to investigate the actions of Mr Ribeiro and Mr Tilson and report to the ManCom and Board.

In my view, the report as issued was primarily the work of Mr Pennington and Mr Sparks, with some changes made by Mr Barthelemy (who drew on Mr Culligan’s early report only to a very limited extent). </p>

There may have been other possible ways forward but, in my view, the way forward proposed by the Defendants was the most obvious and sensible solution in the circumstances.  It was certainly a reasonable position for the Defendants to adopt. If the Defendants were truly guilty of material wrongdoing, the unfortunate position into which Mr Mackay had got himself could not mean that the relevant governance structures within the LLP, and beyond them the FSA, were to be disabled from taking action in respect of it. But on the other hand, the Defendants needed to be afforded a fair opportunity to answer the case against them. That meant in practice, in the circumstances that had arisen, that the ManCom and the LLP Board would have to look at both sides of the argument and examine the underlying facts for themselves, before they decided how to proceed. (A little later, Mr Barthelemy took a rather different line from Mr Culligan, arguing that it should be the FSA which should be the fact-finding tribunal: para. [1029] below; however, I think that this ignored the importance of the LLP ManCom and Board retaining control of the LLP’s affairs and making decisions how its business should be conducted). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Also on 4 December 2009, Mr Mackay issued his report in final form (“the Mackay Final Report”).  He sent it to the members of ManCom, suggesting that it should be tabled for discussion at the next ManCom meeting.  The report was finalised for issue in circumstances where a mediation between F&amp;C and the Defendants had been scheduled for 9 December.  This again made the Defendants very suspicious that Mr Mackay was acting in concert with F&amp;C to put pressure on them for the purposes of the dispute.  However, although a consciousness on the part of Mr Mackay that a mediation had been scheduled was probably a subsidiary factor in making him think it would be desirable to finalise his report at this stage, I find that the predominant reason was that the Defendants had made it clear that they would not provide further comments to him and he genuinely considered it to be his duty, as Compliance Officer, to finalise his report promptly so that the LLP’s ManCom and Board could consider it (and, as necessary, steps could be taken by the LLP to inform the FSA about what he believed he had discovered).   </p>

In preparing his Final Report Mr Mackay had failed to carry out further interviews and again failed to look at Mr Tilson’s e-mail to Mr Ribeiro of 19 January 2009, describing the LLP’s IT arrangements.  These failures undermined, for example, his statement in the Final Report: </p>

In cross-examination, Mr Mackay accepted that he must have read these instructions, but he did not take the trouble to acquaint himself with that 23 January e-mail. This demonstrated a troubling lack of care on Mr Mackay’s part in carrying out his responsibilities in relation to his investigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In giving his evidence, Mr Mackay suggested that the e-mail of 23 January would have made little or no difference to the substance of his report.  I do not think that this is likely.  If Mr Mackay had by this stage still retained an open mind, I think it would have been quite possible that consideration of Mr Tilson’s e-mail of 23 January could have affected his assessment whether there were sufficient objective grounds to justify Mr Culligan’s decision to conduct a covert review of Mr Tilson’s e-mails.  The e-mail of 23 January showed that, in fact, Mr Tilson was acting in a manner disloyal to the Defendants and the LLP. It was at least capable of providing background information supporting Mr Culligan’s case that Mr Tilson appeared to him, in early 2009, to be acting in a way which was out of the usual and out of character, so as to reinforce Mr Culligan’s assessment, based on such behaviour, that he might be conspiring with Mr Ribeiro in some way which harmed the LLP.   </p>

For example, his description in the report of what Mr Culligan told the Board meeting on 27 July 2009 about the currency of the BCP test commenced in December 2008 (see para.

Under the heading “Set up of externally hosted e-mail system and bespoke IT infrastructure”, Mr Mackay said that Mr Culligan had acted without the knowledge or approval of the LLP Board or ManCom in introducing a significant security risk to both the LLP and the wider F&amp;C Group, so displaying a complete disregard for the governance arrangements in place within the LLP and the F&amp;C Group and “a deeply concerning lack of judgment”, also displayed by Mr Barthelemy in not drawing the arrangements to the attention of the ManCom or Board; Mr Culligan’s actions could not have been undertaken in the best interests of the LLP so “the only explanation” was that they were undertaken “in the context of the increasing tensions between the partners in the latter part of 2008”  (I find the reasoning here rather hard to follow – Mr Mackay appears to suggest that Mr Culligan acted for improper personal motives in changing the LLP’s IT arrangements in the way he did, but it is unclear what those personal motives might have been); the positions of both Mr Culligan and Mr Barthelemy on the LLP should be reconsidered by the LLP ManCom and Board; and consideration should be given to whether notice should be given to the FSA to withdraw their Approved Person status.   </p>

Mr Sparks emphasised the seriousness of the matter, said the Committee should proceed with the utmost care and diligence and said that he was loath to take any steps along these lines.  These were wise and fair words, but Mr Ribeiro was determined to press ahead.  He tried to persuade Mr Sparks to support the resolution, but Mr Sparks abstained.  Mr Ribeiro and Mr Johns voted in favour of the resolution, as did Mr Tilson, who stated that he thought it would be a failure of duty for him not to act upon the report of the Compliance Officer and (according to the minutes of the meeting, which he drafted) “implored” Mr Barthelemy to respond to this serious matter.  Mr Barthelemy said he would respond to the FSA.  Mr Culligan said he would respond in due course with the benefit of legal advice.   </p>

Rule SUP 15.6.1 in the FSA Handbook (para. [107] above) requires a firm to take reasonable steps to ensure that information which it gives to the FSA is factually accurate and “fairly and properly based after appropriate enquiries have been made by the firm”. Mr Mackay, as Compliance Officer, did not think it incumbent on him or the LLP to disclose their suspicions or the Mackay Draft Report to the FSA, presumably on the basis that his investigation was still continuing at that stage. I therefore think that Mr Culligan’s proposal, based on the fact that he maintained (correctly) that there had not been a fair and proper investigation, was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Three to four weeks’ delay for the Defendants to have a proper opportunity to prepare their defence would not amount to a substantial period of additional time or add significantly to the regulatory risk to which the LLP was subject.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although I consider that there were serious defects in Mr Mackay’s investigation and report, I find that Mr Ribeiro, Mr Johns, Mr Tilson and Mr Sparks all genuinely believed that the investigation and report were proper. The Mackay Final Report appeared to raise serious matters affecting the ability of the Defendants to continue in their executive management roles at the LLP and whether they could be regarded as fit and proper persons for the purposes of FSA approval. Although Mr Mackay left the decision what to do to the ManCom, it was clear to the members of ManCom that it was his view as Compliance Officer that the report should be sent to the FSA. In the light of all this, the members of the ManCom who voted to pass the report to the FSA did so believing that they had a personal responsibility to make sure the the LLP behaved properly in relation to the FSA, in accordance with its general regulatory obligation to be open with the FSA and to bring to the FSA’s attention matters potentially affecting the regulatory standing of managers of a regulated firm (see, e.g., the obligations in the FSA Handbook set out at paras. [94] (Principle 11), [105] and [106] above). In taking that decision, they did not act as agents of Holdings, and in any event did not act in breach of any obligation of utmost good faith to the LLP.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to whether there was a breach of clause 15.2 of the Agreement (see para. [48] above) on the part of Holdings arising from the LLP passing the Mackay Final Report to the FSA, I think that the LLP is probably to be regarded as an “entity in the F&amp;C Group” for the purposes of that provision, i.e. as an entity on behalf of which Holdings had assumed the obligation set out in it. However, clause 15.2 cannot reasonably be construed as preventing communication on important matters with the LLP’s regulator, the FSA. In my view, on proper construction of clause 15.2, communication by the LLP with the FSA on issues which the LLP (acting by its ManCom, and on the advice of its Compliance Officer) believes in good faith it should draw to the attention of the LLP does not qualify as “disparagement” within the sense of that term as used in clause 15.2. Therefore, I do not consider that any breach of clause 15.2 occurred when the ManCom caused the LLP to supply the Mackay Final Report and qualified withdrawal notices to the FSA. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if I were wrong about that, any breach of the Agreement in that regard would have been technical in character so far as Holdings was concerned. Any such breach would have arisen from action taken in good faith and for what could reasonably be regarded by ManCom members as good reasons, seeking to do what they genuinely believed it was the responsibility of the LLP to do under the regulatory regime and hence genuinely believing it was in the best interests of the LLP to act as it did.  In these circumstances, Holdings could not be said to have been in breach of the Agreement “in a manner that amounts to gross negligence or gross misconduct” (paragraph 1.7 of the Fourth Schedule).  </p>

Their claim in the Petition, based on section 994, has a wider basis, however. I address that in paras. [1094]ff below. </p>

He concluded that the conduct of Mr Culligan in covertly reviewing staff e-mails, as set out in JGR’s letter of 6 August 2009 to Schulte Roth, constituted an offence under section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.  In that regard, he referred to the Employment Practices Code issued by the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998, which stated that covert monitoring of employees’ e-mails would rarely be justified and should normally be authorised by senior management, who “should satisfy themselves that there are grounds for suspecting criminal activity or equivalent malpractice and that notifying the individuals about the monitoring would prejudice its prevention or detection”.  In Mr Bergin’s opinion, Mr Culligan’s suspicions “fell far below the sorts of suspicion which would have justified covert monitoring” (I disagree: see paras. [126]-[128] and [821]-[825] above); his conduct was not a focused and proportionate response to his suspicions (I disagree: see paras.

Since Mr Culligan had not attempted to get the consent of F&amp;C Management Limited as the data controller, Mr Bergin concluded that Mr Culligan had committed a breach of that provision so far as concerned his deliberate obtaining of access to personal data.  According to Mr Bergin, Mr Culligan could not rely on any defence under section 55(2)(b) or (c), since he had no authority to conduct the review and he could not have thought that the Group Management Committee (to which, Mr Bergin noted, the Group IT policy made reference) or the data controller (who, he was instructed, was F&amp;C Management Limited) would have permitted such monitoring of staff e-mails had Mr Culligan referred the matter to them.   </p>

However, in my view, the management resources were appropriate given the state of the LLP’s business against the background of the dispute at that stage, and where the LLP was effectively marking time until the dispute was resolved. It was not incumbent on F&amp;C, the LLP or F&amp;C’s representatives in the LLP to go to the considerable expense of trying to replace the Defendants with full-time managers at this point.   </p>

I reject that contention.  I consider that Mr Ribeiro’s and Mr Johns’ decisions and reactions were genuinely motivated by what they believed to be in the best interests of the LLP at that stage in the highly unusual circumstances in which it found itself.  F&amp;C has, in fact, continued to inject capital into the LLP as necessary and has not sought to close it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendants’ claim under section 994 is brought against both Holdings and F&amp;C plc. It was common ground between the parties that in order to make out a claim under section 994 that the affairs of a company or limited liability partnership have been conducted in a way which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of members in the entity, it is not necessary to show that the conduct was carried out by agents of the person or persons against who the claim is brought. It was also common ground that there is jurisdiction in appropriate cases to grant a remedy under section 996 against non-members in a company or limited liability partnership (see, e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">Re Little Olympian Each-Ways Ltd </span>[1994] 2 BCLC 420, 429; <span style="font-style:italic">Re a company (No. 005287 of 1985) </span>[1986] BCLC 68). But the parties were not in agreement as to what the relevant test of attribution of unfairly prejudicial conduct to a defendant in a section 994 claim should be. In particular, Miss Newman submitted that, if I were of the view that the F&amp;C representatives had conducted the affairs of the LLP in a manner which was unfairly prejudicial to the Defendants, I should limit any liability and remedy under sections 994 to 996 to Holdings, and should find that F&amp;C plc is not liable in respect of that conduct. Mr Thompson submitted that both Holdings and F&amp;C plc should be found liable under section 994 and that relief should be granted against both of them under section 996. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Where relevant conduct is carried out by a person himself or by his agent, there is no difficulty of attribution of responsibility for that conduct for the purposes of section 994, since the ordinary (and strict) standards of attribution of responsibility applicable under the general law will have been satisfied. At certain points (in particular, at the LLP Board meeting on 21 January 2009, the Members’ meeting on 18 February 2009 and in stopping payment of the advance drawings of the Defendants on 25 February 2009) Mr Ribeiro engaged in conduct prejudicial to the interests of the Defendants in the LLP in circumstances where he acted as agent of Holdings. The analysis above relating to breach of clause 13.6 of the Agreement by Holdings in relation to such conduct is also applicable to support the conclusion that such conduct was unfairly prejudicial to the interests of Defendants for the purposes of their unfair prejudice claim.  </p>

In my judgment, the test is whether the defendant in a section 994 claim is so connected to the unfairly prejudicial conduct in question that it would be just, in the context of the statutory regime contained in sections 994 to 996, to grant a remedy against that defendant in relation to that conduct. The standard of justice to be applied reflects the requirements of fair commercial dealing inherent in the statutory regime. This is to state the test at a high level of abstraction. In practice,  everything will depend upon the facts of a particular case and the court’s assessment whether what was done involved unfairness in which the relevant defendant was sufficiently implicated to warrant relief being granted against him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Holdings is responsible for the attempt by Mr Ribeiro in January and February 2009 to shift decision-making for the LLP from the proper organs of the LLP Board and ManCom to the Members’ meeting, where Holdings could dictate policy. This did constitute unfairly prejudicial conduct. In early March 2009, however, well before the Petition was issued, Mr Ribeiro sought to reverse that approach. Can these earlier matters therefore be ignored, on the grounds that by the time the Petition was issued they had been rectified? I do not consider that they can be ignored. These actions of Mr Ribeiro and Holdings had a lasting prejudicial effect upon the Defendants’ interests in the LLP, since they severely undermined trust between those involved in the management of the LLP in a way which was unlikely to be, and in fact was not, restored thereafter, and hence severely undermined the ability of the LLP to operate effectively as a business facing the severe challenges it faced in 2009.  The actions of Mr Ribeiro and Holdings also, as a reasonable and legitimate reaction by the Defendants, caused them to serve the First Put Option Notices and led to the litigation between the Members. That had a major and lasting detrimental effect on the business of the LLP (see, in particular, para. [814] above). The letters of 26 February and 2 March 2009 written by Mr Ribeiro and Mr Logan, respectively, on behalf of Holdings (paras. [720] and [742] above) were not straightforward and gave grounds for the Defendants to think that they had not really undergone a complete change of heart. The way in which F&amp;C secretly commenced the Part 7 proceedings (para. [767] above) reinforced that impression. Moreover, the change of approach by Mr Ribeiro from March 2009 was not complete, and his actions in January and February 2009 provide an important context for evaluating his conduct after that time, as referred to below. His actions in early 2009 therefore continue to be relevant, weighty matters to be taken into account in evaluating the Defendants’ claims under section 994. From March 2009 Mr Ribeiro continued to take action which unfairly removed control of important aspects of the LLP’s affairs from the Defendants and the LLP’s organs of government, as follows; </p>

They acted as they did at least in part because they thought it was in the interests of F&amp;C to take the various steps referred to (e.g. in order to protect its relations with its clients) and with a consciousness that F&amp;C did not like or trust the business judgment of the Defendants and had a strong interest (which they did little or nothing to resist when it came for them to take action) to try to undermine the Defendants’ influence on the conduct of the business.   </p>

Holdings was in reality a cipher for the F&amp;C Group, and F&amp;C plc in particular. There were no Board meetings of Holdings. Mr Ribeiro was authorised by its directors (Mr Grisay and F&amp;C plc) to conduct its affairs, reporting back to Mr Grisay and F&amp;C plc as he thought appropriate. F&amp;C plc, acting by Execom, was informed about Mr Ribeiro’s strategy of trying to remove decision-making in the LLP to the Members’ meeting and in substance endorsed his approach and authorised him to proceed: see, in particular, para. [674] above. Thereafter, F&amp;C plc continued to be happy to leave Mr Ribeiro to handle the detailed conduct of the dispute, trusting him to promote F&amp;C’s interests, without making any attempt to intervene to control his actions. There was thus, in a broad sense, authorisation from F&amp;C plc to Mr Ribeiro and the F&amp;C representatives to proceed in acting as they did; and see para. [200] above.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On this issue, my view as to the responsibility of F&amp;C plc for the unfairly prejudicial conduct of the LLP’s affairs is also, I think, supported by <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society v Meyer </span>[1959] AC 324. That case concerned section 210 of the Companies Act 1948, which was held to require the court to look at “the business realities of a situation” rather than taking a narrow legalistic view (p. 343). I consider that the same is true of what is now section 994. In the present case, F&amp;C plc assigned Mr Ribeiro to formulate strategy and tactics for the F&amp;C Group in dealing with the dispute with the Defendants and endorsed his approach. F&amp;C plc looked to take the benefit from that approach. As a matter of business reality, F&amp;C plc did not stand aloof from the conduct of the affairs of the LLP, but actively intervened in them. Although the involvement of F&amp;C plc was achieved at some points in a different way from the involvement of the appellant society in <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society </span>in the affairs of its subsidiary, it was all of a character with sufficient similarities to the conduct in that case as to indicate that it is fair to hold F&amp;C plc responsible for it for the purposes of section 994. In <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society</span> the appellant society stood behind the nominee directors, who were supine in the face of the policy of the society to destroy the company so that it was appropriate, when looking at the business reality, to hold the society responsible to a material degree for the conduct of the business of the company (see in particular [1959] AC at 341-342, per Viscount Simonds, 362-363, per Lord Keith of Avonholm, and 366, per Lord Denning). In the present case, F&amp;C plc’s interests were promoted by Mr Ribeiro seeking to divert material parts of the conduct of the LLP’s affairs outside the proper governance structures of the LLP. This was involvement by F&amp;C plc in the conduct of the affairs of the LLP which was at least as direct as in <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society</span> – indeed, it was, in a certain sense, more direct, in that the implementation of F&amp;C plc’s policy did not depend upon passive inaction and breach of fiduciary duty by the F&amp;C representatives on the LLP Board and ManCom, but often operated by means of by-passing the executive managers of the LLP and the LLP Board and ManCom altogether in important respects.  </p>

[77] above). Where someone in the position of Compliance Officer or equivalent (e.g. a disciplinary tribunal within a firm dealing with a complaint against an employee) acts in accordance with what they believe in good faith to be their duty, it will be rare for an unfair prejudice case based on their conduct to be made out: cf <span style="font-style:italic">Hawkes v Cuddy </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 291; [2009] 2 BCLC 427 at [54]<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(a director may take action which is prejudicial to a claimant, but it will not be <span style="font-style:italic">unfairly</span> prejudicial if taken in the genuine belief it is in the company’s interests). However, as with a situation where a director conducts the business of a company in a manner which departs in a serious way from the standards of reasonable management to be expected of him (<span style="font-style:italic">Re Macro (Ipswich) Ltd</span>,  para. [254] above), in a case of a serious departure from the relevant standards of fairness to be expected in a particular context, where removal from involvement in the executive management of the business is a foreseen result, the relevant breach of the applicable standards of fairness will be capable of constituting unfairly prejudicial conduct for the purposes of section 994. In my judgment, that is the position in relation to Mr Mackay’s investigation and report, and the LLP’s actions taken on the basis of his report, in the present case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as F&amp;C’s IT network was concerned, the creation of the LLP IT network with the dual-homed computers linking to the F&amp;C network did give rise to an unjustified risk to F&amp;C’s system and electronic data. The creation of this unjustified risk was inadvertent on the part of Mr Culligan and Mr Pennington, and in any event did not constitute unfairly prejudical conduct of the affairs of the LLP in a manner which could justify the grant of relief under sections 994 to 996: see paras. [588]-[598] above. It did not expose the LLP to any significant business risk: para. [598] above; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Culligan’s description of the new IT system as part of a continuing BCP test stretched that notion very far and was inappropriate, but – in relation to the management of the LLP’s affairs - the members of the ManCom were all aware from January 2009 that in substance the LLP was operating with its own stand-alone IT network. Mr Culligan did not deceive the ManCom or the LLP Board, nor did he subvert, or seek to subvert, the proper ability of the ManCom to control the IT arrangements of the LLP in the normal way; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The new IT system was the LLP’s primary IT system. The LLP did not keep its data and run its operating systems in parallel on the F&amp;C IT system. Accordingly, the LLP did not have a back-up system in operation which would take over if the LLP’s IT system were affected by some disaster. However, this was a relatively minor matter. If the IT infrastructure at the LLP’s office were knocked out, Mr Culligan and Mr Pennington would readily have been able to set up a new back-up system at another location, with access to the LLP’s data stored on the archives provided by its external IT service providers. This was the same sort of BCP arrangement which the LLP relied on at other times. The proper functioning of its business was not put in jeopardy to any significant degree.    </p>

Accordingly, the case against him under section 994 in relation to this particular issue is unfounded. </p>
