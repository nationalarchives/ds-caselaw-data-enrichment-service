This has resulted in further instances of unfair prejudice, arising both from breaches of the shareholders’ agreement and the articles, and also from breaches by the Vollin and Minden nominee directors of the duties owed by them under the Companies Act 2006.  Among the allegations made, a particularly important one concerns the alleged sale at an undervalue of a property known as Newton Aycliffe, which was owned by a subsidiary of CPGL, Compound Photonics UK Limited (“<span style="font-style:italic">CPUK</span>”), the Fourth Respondent in these proceedings. </p>

Their basic point is that they invested huge sums in the business over many years in order to support Dr Sachs in realising his vision, but after long delays and a series of failures, they lost faith in Dr Sachs and entirely reasonably asked him to resign, which he agreed to do.  They removed Mr Faulkner from the business by exercise of their majority vote after it became clear that his role as director and Chairman of CPGL was redundant and he had begun to behave in an erratic and unpredictable manner which was damaging to CPGL.  They say that at all times they and their nominee directors acted in good faith, and so were not in breach of any provisions of the relevant shareholders agreement or, in the case of the directors, of the articles or of any Companies Act duties.  They deny that Newton Aycliffe was sold at an undervalue. </p>

He is plainly also still bruised by the circumstances which led to his departure from CPGL, and therefore has a high degree of mistrust of the Investors.  The combination of these factors, in my view, led to him being a very guarded witness.  Mr Hollington described him as giving his evidence in a painstakingly precise manner.  That is true, but in my judgment, this tendency led him on occasion to give a very limited account of certain of the events he was involved in.  I have in mind in particular the exchanges he must have had with Mr Faulkner in the Summer of 2016 (see, e.g., below at [274]) as to their own positions and their possible plans for the Newton Aycliffe plant.  On one view, a degree of care about this period was understandable because the events were informed by legal advice and therefore questions of privilege arose.  On the other hand, Dr Sachs’ guarded account left one having to fill in some of the important gaps for oneself in a way which could easily have been avoided.  Overall, my judgment is that I must assess Dr Sachs’ evidence with some care, although for the most part a clear enough picture of the relevant events can be gleaned from the contemporaneous documents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Mr Faulkner</span>:  In terms of overall impression, Mr Faulkner was in many ways the opposite of Dr Sachs.  He was often fulsome in his answers, sometimes to the extent of providing lengthy and rambling responses.  He spoke with great conviction about certain parts of the case, and in particular about the early discussions with Vollin and the sense of excitement the parties felt about the potential for their business relationship. On occasion, however, Mr Faulkner was also guarded and defensive.  That was so most particularly as regards his evidence about his visit to Newton Aycliffe on 7 September 2016, and the background to his request to see the Newton Aycliffe visitors book (see below at [262]-[265]).  I found his account of those events unpersuasive.  On other occasions, however, I felt that Mr Faulkner grasped the nettle and gave honest evidence even when it did not suit his case to do so, for example in connection with his making contact with the “<span style="font-style:italic">Let’s Grow Grant</span>” foundation in the early Spring of 2017 (see below at [319]).  Overall, as with Dr Sachs, my judgment is that I must assess Mr Faulkner’s evidence with some care, and measure his oral evidence against the documentary evidence.  Thankfully, that is possible in most if not all instances which are relevant to the outcome of this trial.   </p>

He was focused and perceptive in the way he gave his evidence.  That evidence suggests that at times he could be abrasive in his dealings with others, and it is plain that he lost patience with Dr Sachs for, as he saw it, poor management of what had at one time seemed a very promising investment for his client Vollin.  Mr Fletcher was frank about that however, and about other matters which did not necessarily suit his case – for example, his characterisation of the way in which CPGL was managed in the period immediately after Dr Sachs’ departure (see below at [449]).  I therefore regard him as an honest and reliable witness.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Mr Bolger</span>: The Petitioners were very critical of Mr Bolger in their closing submissions, largely as a result of his admitted deception of Mr Faulkner in relation to a presentation made to Vollin and Minden on 15 August 2016 (which was later sent to Mr Faulkner in amended form but purported to be the same document provided to the Investors– see below at [246]).  I agree that that deception was an unfortunate incident, and one which does Mr Bolger no credit, although at the time he felt he had good reasons for it.  All the same, I do not think it follows that Mr Bolger was deceptive in the way in which he gave his evidence to the Court.  He gave a full account at trial of the relevant events and, as noted, accepted the fact of his deception straightforwardly.  It is true that the point was not originally addressed in his witness statement (see below at [249]), but I did not detect in that an intention to mislead.  My overall assessment therefore was that Mr Bolger sought to give his evidence straightforwardly and accepted points which counted against the Investors’ case and which must have involved some discomfort for him personally. </p>

Again, however, unfortunate though that incident was, no attempt was made to conceal it.  In other ways too Ms McDermid was straightforward in her evidence, for example as to Mr Fletcher’s character and the concerns she had about the potential for conflict between him and Dr Sachs.  I found her a reliable witness. </p>

Mr Valler struck me as an intelligent and perceptive witness who was straightforward in the evidence he gave.  The Petitioners in their closing criticised him for not telling the whole story as regards Target’s promotion of the proposed transaction with Kaiam.  I do not agree.  Mr Valler straightforwardly accepted Target’s interest in introducing Kaiam to CPGL, as a possible way of solving a serious problem which CPGL had and which in turn might enable Target to obtain a wider mandate from Vollin in managing its technologyrelated investments.  That strikes me as an entirely plausible account which is supported by the documentary records.

One can quite understand that.  The commercial venture contemplated was designed to exploit technology he had largely been responsible for developing.  He had his own vision as to how that commercial exploitation might best be handled.  He was obviously concerned about the potential for the fruits of his labour to be wrenched away from him by his very well resourced new investor.  Both he and Mr Faulkner gave evidence to that effect, and said that they were concerned about being ousted from the business at some critical point in its future development, for example just before an IPO.  Mr Faulkner said he recalled being given assurances that he and Dr Sachs would not be treated capriciously in that way.

At one point he said he recalled discussing with Dr Sachs the possibility of his being removed from the business, for example in the event of serious wrongdoing, such as theft or fraud.   Mr Fletcher described the business of negotiation with Dr Sachs as akin to a courtship, and recalled giving general assurances to the effect that Vollin would not act capriciously, and to the effect that they were serious investors and in it for the long-haul.

Mr Fletcher said that once the company reached breakeven, the expectation was that it would then become self-funding – i.e., that CPGL would be able to finance its own growth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On this point, it seems to me the reality is as follows.  There was no firm commitment given by Vollin to make further funding available beyond the amount of its initial investment.  It would have made little sense commercially for Vollin to have committed to give a blank cheque to Dr Sachs and CPGL.  No doubt the hope and expectation at the time was that the $20m investment would be enough to see CPGL through to break-even; but at the same time, given the nature of the venture, it must have been clear to all concerned that there was a risk that that would not happen, and consequently a risk that more funding would be needed in order to keep the business on track.  While no firm commitment was given that such funding would be made available, it seems to me logical to think that an understanding arose from the parties’ discussions, and in particular from the assurances given by Vollin that they were a long-term investor, that in the event of a funding need arising, Vollin would at least consider it.  The proof of the pudding was in the eating, and as the facts reveal, the need for further funding did arise, and Vollin responded by making funding available.   </p>

Where necessary – for example in relation to subscriptions for further shares by Vollin – there were written board resolutions.  But the day-to-day management of the company was left to Dr Sachs and those working for him, supported (it seems) in managing the ongoing relationship with their major investor, Vollin, by Mr Bolger and Ms McDermid from Kew.   </p>

The acquisition cost was £3.599m.  Newton Aycliffe employed a large number of staff, and so came with substantial running costs also.  These were mitigated to some extent by a long-term supply contract Newton Aycliffe had with a company called Selex, which in turn had a contract with the Ministry of Defence.  But even with the benefit of the Selex contract, Newton Aycliffe was loss-making as matters stood.  The idea, however, was that over time it would become part of Dr Sachs’ overall vision of becoming a vertically integrated manufacturer.

Dr Sachs’ evidence was that it was an impressive achievement that a fully functioning pico projector was available by February 2014. I am sure that is correct, but the evidence is that there were some problems with it, in that the display had certain imperfections, which were later sourced to a component provided by a third party manufacturer.   </p>

Dr Sachs was challenged on this aspect of his evidence, on the basis that a further cause of their lack of interest must have been the defects revealed by the Barcelona demonstration.  As to this, I find it impossible to say, on the basis of the evidence before me (which did not include evidence from any of the mobile manufacturers themselves) what the real reasons were for the failure of Dr Sachs’ efforts, and I do not think it relevant to do so.

In an effort to support Dr Sachs and to provide him with a sounding board, CPGL had engaged Sir Peter Williams as a consultant.  Sir Peter had been Chairman of Oxford Instruments, the company which had manufactured the first MRI scanners.  His early report to Dr Sachs following a meeting with Dr Abramov, Dr Frolov, Mr Abramovich and Mr Fletcher on 19 June 2015 was positive, notwithstanding the ongoing delays in production.

I do not consider that the involvement of Mr Bolger in giving this presentation leads to the conclusion that the reservations he says he was developing were not genuinely felt.

Unfortunately when you knocked over that domino, a number of other dominos fall over as well. When you start with a materially high bill of materials, so we are selling a projector for $3-5,000 not $1,000 to $1,500 then all of a sudden you come to the conclusion if you look at the market segmentation, these curves that plot how many projectors have sold at different price points, it is no surprise there is really a lot like 3 million projectors sold as $500 down to literally hundreds of thousands of projectors sold above $35,000, you end in a situation where your assumptions on vertical integration suddenly just fall over because you are not going to be able to be producing in volume to pay – for example in this case to pay the overheads of Newton Aycliffe.”  </span>

It was accepted that Dr Sachs had much to contribute technically (one of the later emails refers to his providing “<span style="font-style:italic">pixie dust</span>”), but at the same time there were concerns about the effect of his management style, and more particularly about the fact that there were differing views within the business about likely build costs, and therefore about the viability of the standalone, or fully integrated, model.

Mr Fletcher thought this would assist, because the personal connection would encourage BCG to put their best team on the assignment.  But Dr Sachs was highly resistant.

Once a Last Time Buy Notice was served,  Selex had a period of two months to place any final orders (a grace period to allow it to identify a new source of supply), and thereafter CPUK had a further period of six months to fulfil those orders.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Service of the Last Time Buy Notice would thus set the clock ticking on an overall period of about 8 months.  During that time, the expectation was that the volume of orders from Selex would increase, bringing the Fab to breakeven, but once the run-off period came to an end, CPUK’s main income source would dry up.  That would then give rise to further issues.  Closure of the Fab would obviously give rise to job losses, and would itself be an expensive exercise (later, in August 2016, closure costs were put at US$8.4m gross, including repayment of the US$3.9m grant from a regional development fund, the “<span style="font-style:italic">Let’s Grow</span>” fund).  Moreover, once closed, it would be a very expensive exercise to make the Fab operational again. </p>

The idea was a management buy-out (“<span style="font-style:italic">MBO</span>”).  The broad concept was to try to spin off the Newton Aycliffe Fab into a new company, separate from CPGL, in which Mr Jackson and possibly Mr Bolger would have an interest.  The structure was dependent, however, on increasing the volume of business under the Selex contract to make it more profitable, and that was not a certainty. </p>

That was not about the Last Time Buy Notice as such, but about his realisation that major decisions were being made which affected CPGL and CPUK and which he had no part in, effectively because he was being kept at arm’s-length by Mr Fletcher who had little time for him and thought the existing corporate governance arrangements obsolete anyway.

That resignation seems to have been entirely consensual – Mr Faulkner accepted in cross-examination that it was.  But he also said, and I accept, that Dr Lind decided to step down voluntarily because of a concern that he was not being included in the business of CPGL in a manner which allowed him to discharge his duties as a director satisfactorily, and he was concerned about the risk of litigation.  </p>

Mr Faulkner proposed meeting Mr Jackson at Newton Aycliffe on 11 August.  That was the same day fixed for a visit by Kaiam, as part of the merger discussions.  Moreover, receipt of Mr Faulkner’s email coincided with a conversation Mr Jackson had with an individual called Mike Hebbron, who was known to be close to Dr Sachs and who was based (together with Mr Jackson) at the Newton Aycliffe plant.  Mr Jackson described the discussion with Mr Hebbron as rather strange, in particular given a somewhat Delphic suggestion by Mr Hebbron that Mr Jackson should take care to ensure that his official job title fully reflected his full range of roles and responsibilities.  Mr Jackson said Mr Hebbron hinted at something going on in the background, but would not be drawn into giving details.   </p>

He exchanged emails with Ms McDermid, who told him to say he was on holiday.  In the event Mr Jackson decided (as he candidly accepted in his evidence) to lie to Mr Faulkner and said in an email that the “<span style="font-style:italic">CP management team are gathered in London next week</span>”, as a way of deflecting Mr Faulkner’s request for a meeting.  Mr Jackson thought that was justified in the overall interests of the business, or in any event was the least worst option available to him.   The deception was successful and Mr Faulkner did not travel to Newton Aycliffe on 11 August, although he made a visit later, in early September, as I will mention below.   </p>

His evidence was that this was not done with a view to deceiving Mr Faulkner, but instead was taken as a routine precaution to limit the risk of news of the Kaiam visit leaking inadvertently, in particular to employees at Newton Aycliffe or other visitors there.  I should say immediately that I accept that explanation.  It seems to me entirely likely that Mr Jackson would have wanted to take steps to try and limit the circulation of what he saw as sensitive and confidential information, and Mr Jackson explained that similar precautions had been taken in the past in other cases.   </p>

The language is somewhat ambiguous, and that gave rise to the question whether approval of the proposed  Subscription Agreement by Vollin and Minden was a matter for the board, or a matter for the shareholders – and if the latter, whether it was a matter which Vollin and Minden could vote on, or whether they were effectively conflicted, given that they were the intended counterparties to the Subscription Agreement.   </p>

What is significant on that basis, however, as Mr Hollington pointed out in argument, is that Mr Bolger apparently felt it appropriate to amend the presentation without consulting anyone else about it, or informing them afterwards.  He can only have done so because he felt that was consistent with what was expected generally in dealing with Mr Faulkner, i.e. it was one example of the practice which had developed of keeping Mr Faulkner at arm’slength and telling him only what Mr Bolger and others thought he needed to know. </p>

When asked about this in cross-examination, Mr Bolger said he had simply forgotten at the time of making his Witness Statement that the two versions of the slide deck were different. His recollection was prompted only during the course of preparations for trial, and it is true to say that the fact that an amended version was provided to Mr Faulkner was fairly reflected in the Investors’ Written Opening.

The full picture was clear before the start of the trial.  The real significance of it, as it seems to me, is that in Mr Bolger’s mind the original decision to amend the presentation before sending it to Mr Faulkner was so routine that he had forgotten about it. That reinforces the point already made, that it was the accepted practice at the time to limit the flow of information to Mr Faulkner, notwithstanding his status as director and chairman of CPGL and director of CPUK.   </p>

On 22 August Mr Faulkner had a meeting with BDO, but it seems still had some concerns and at his insistence a further meeting was arranged for 7 September, this time at Newton Aycliffe.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded I must reject Mr Faulkner’s evidence on all these points.  The strong likelihood, it seems to me, is that the real reason for his visit to Newton Aycliffe was to investigate a suspicion or concern he had already formed about what had happened on 11 August.  He was the one who sought inspection of the visitors book, and he asked to see the entries for 11 August, not Ms Small from BDO.  He wanted to check who had visited on that day, and that in turn was because of concerns he had – no doubt shared by Dr Sachs – that something was afoot in connection with Newton Aycliffe which was being kept from them and which they wanted to know more about.  As it happens, they were right.       </p>

That same evening, Vollin requisitioned a meeting under CA 2006 section 303, to pass a resolution removing Mr Faulkner as a director of CPGL. In the event, this was a false start, because the notice was defective, for reasons which are presently immaterial.  A further notice was sent on 30 September, and a meeting convened for 18 October. </p>

It also seems clear to me that the decision they took was a pragmatic one.  As they saw it, the ATREG proposal was expensive; their remit was to cut costs not increase them; there were great uncertainties about whether the likely costs would be worth it; and in the meantime, although undoubtedly there were uncertainties, progress was being made with Kaiam, and indeed by early November 2016 a draft term sheet was under discussion.  </p>

Mr Hollington clarified that in making that submission, he was not seeking to rely on any oral assurances given to Dr Sachs and Mr Faulkner as to their continued involvement in the management of CPGL.  Instead, his case was based on a reading of the constitutional documents, looked at in the round, and of course against the background of the factual matrix as it stood at the time of contracting.  Mr Hollington said that reading the constitutional documents in this way disclosed two particular agreed common purposes, namely (1) entrenchment of the positions in management of Dr Sachs and Mr Faulkner, and, as its corollary, (2) the prevention of Vollin and Minden from obtaining control of the CPGL board.  Mr Hollington argued that both those purposes had been overridden or frustrated by the actions taken by the Investors from March 2016 onwards, in breach of their obligation of good faith under SHA clause 4.2, and that consequently the Petitioners had been treated in a manner which was both unfair and prejudicial.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Gledhill for the Investors disagreed fundamentally.  He said there was no analogy to be drawn with the quasi-partnership type case.  Such cases involved the Court recognising the existence of an equitable constraint, which inhibited in some way the otherwise unrestricted right of a shareholder to exercise its legal rights however it sees fit.  In the present case, no such equitable constraint was alleged.  Instead, the case in the Petition is that the Investors breached the Petitioners’ legal rights under the 2013 Articles or the 2013 SHA.  But there is nothing in those agreements which gave Dr Sachs or Mr Faulkner an entrenched right to remain as directors and managers of CPGL, and nothing which inhibited the statutory entitlement of the majority shareholders under CA section 168 to remove the directors if they saw fit to do so, for whatever reason.  At most the Investors were subject only to the obligation under SHA clause 4.2 to act in good faith, but here the Investors had acted in good faith, because they had acted honestly and in a manner which was commercially justified: commercially, it was entirely right to have required Dr Sachs to step down as a director of CPGL in March 2016, given the state of the business at the time which (as CEO) Dr Sachs must have contributed to. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“My Lords, this is an expulsion case, and I must briefly justify the application in such cases of the just and equitable clause. The question is, as always, whether it is equitable to allow one (or two) to make use of his legal rights to the prejudice of his associate(s). The law of companies recognises the right, in many ways, to remove a director from the board. Section 184 of the Companies Act 1948 [the predecessor of s. 168] confers this right upon the company in general meeting whatever the articles may say. Some articles may prescribe other methods: for example, a governing director may have the power to remove (compare </span>

In all these ways a particular director-member may find himself no longer a director, through removal, or non-re-election: this situation he must normally accept, unless he undertakes the burden of proving fraud or mala fides. The just and equitable provision nevertheless comes to his assistance if he can point to, and prove, some special underlying obligation of his fellow member(s) in good faith, or confidence, that so long as the business continues he shall be entitled to management participation, an obligation so basic that, if broken, the conclusion must be that the association must be dissolved.”  </span>

But in my opinion, when Area Health’s planning processes would make a substantial difference to what MHC and/or Macquarie could reasonably expect concerning the flow of persons between the hospitals or the creation of a campus concept, the obligation of utmost good faith would require that MHC and/or Macquarie be informed of this, at least to enable them to take account of it in the design and construction of the works contemplated by the HOA.”  </span>

The adoption of such a standard of conduct made sense in the context of an arrangement which sought to marry together the disparate strengths of the defendants and F &amp; C through the vehicle of the LLP in a relationship intended to last a long time (and which therefore required considerable flexibility of application to cope with the wide range of unforeseeable business challenges which might arise), where they were each required to have regard to the legitimate interests of the other parties to the agreement while at the same time being entitled to take into account their own self-interest.  </span>

I think that the meeting was arranged with a view to shocking or surprising Mr Mullins into agreeing to resign (which I accept he got near to doing), and then, while he was still in a state of shock, telling him the financial consequences, by the exercise of the Defendants’ purported rights under clause 7 of the Protocol. That is not the way in which partners should behave to each other. Bullying, seeking to trap, and intentionally taking by surprise with a view to shock, in hope of obtaining an advantage for the co-partners and a disadvantage for the partner concerned, must, in my view, amount to a breach of good faith.” </span>

There was no or no proper investigation into how come the project management team was in a state of disorder or into the extent of Mr Unwin’s role in its poor performance. Mr Unwin was given no, or no real, opportunity, before his employment was terminated, to respond to Mr Bond’s complaints about him in relation to the TKM projects or the Aldwych project. Mr Unwin had no opportunity to reveal that his poor performance, if any, was due to the pressure of his mother’s illness or the tragedy of her death. Mr Bond did not consider or explore with Mr Unwin whether any steps could be taken to improve Mr Unwin’s performance, if necessary, or the project management team’s performance, short of the replacement of Mr Unwin. As the Employee Handbook makes clear, that was something junior employees could expect and so, even more so in Mr Unwin’s case, fairness required that there be a proper investigation and a consideration of remedial action.  </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Prejudice will certainly encompass damage to the financial position of a member. The prejudice may be damage to the value of his shares but may also extend to other financial damage which in the circumstances of the case is bound up with his position as a member. So, for example, removal from participation in the management of a company and the resulting loss of income or profits from the company in the form of remuneration will constitute prejudice in those cases where the members have rights recognised in equity if not at law, to participate in that way. Similarly, damage to the financial position of a member in relation to a debt due to him from the company can in the appropriate circumstances amount to prejudice. The prejudice must be to the petitioner in his capacity as a member but this is not to be strictly confined to damage to the value of his shareholding. Moreover, prejudice need not be financial in character. A disregard of the rights of a member as such, without any financial consequences, may amount to prejudice falling within the section. </span>

They were bound to act with fidelity to the bargain (see [357]-[358] above), and that meant respecting the balance of power achieved by means of the overall constitutional settlement.  Critical parts of that were the special positions occupied by Dr Sachs and by Mr Faulkner.

That cannot have been what the parties intended.  The upshot is that the Investors could of course exercise their majority power to remove Dr Sachs and Mr Faulkner, and such removals would be effective and not susceptible to revocation; but at the same time, they would constitute a breach of contract as between the shareholders, entitling the disadvantaged shareholders in an appropriate case to claim a remedy – as they do in this case, in the form of relief for unfair prejudice under CA section 994.   </p>

It followed that it made sense to make provision in the 2013 constitution for what would happen as regards Dr Sachs’ and Mr Faulkner’s B Shares in the event of them being classified as “<span style="font-style:italic">Good Leavers</span>”, and the idea that they might be so classified and were thus vulnerable to removal at will was inconsistent with the idea that their positions were entrenched.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This strikes me as a somewhat contrived argument.  First of all, it bears emphasis that under Article 15.2 of the 2013 Articles, the board of CPGL had no power to remove either Dr Sachs or Mr Faulkner from their <span style="font-style:italic">offices</span> as director.  That could occur only in other circumstances, such as death, mental incapacity, bankruptcy or on a vote of the majority shareholders.  I accept of course that the question of the executive arrangements under which Dr Sachs and Mr Faulkner were engaged was something different, and that on one view, such matters are not affected by Article 15.2 which is concerned with the <span style="font-style:italic">office</span> of director.  All the same, however, it cannot seriously have been contemplated that circumstances would arise in which the board would be called upon to consider termination of the executive arrangements as a freestanding matter, absent some other event giving rise to termination of the office of director.  It would be an odd and perhaps perverse exercise of power for a board to terminate a director’s employment contract without him or her also being removed from office.  That being so, in my view the scenario contemplated by Mr Gledhill’s argument is an entirely artificial one, even if theoretically possible.  If that is right, then it provides very thin justification for taking a contrary view of the content of the good faith provision in clause 4.2.  </p>

But even more significant, in my view, was the threat to use the majority voting power to remove Dr Sachs if he did not go.  Dr Sachs’ written evidence, which was not challenged on this point, was that he was told expressly at the meeting on 14 March 2016 that if he did not go he would be removed forcibly under the relevant procedure in the Companies Act.  I accept that evidence, which seems to be entirely consistent with the inherent probabilities.  In the event there was no vote of shareholders, but that would have been a sterile exercise because the result was a foregone conclusion.  The effect is that although the formalities had to be tied up, Dr Sachs’ position was effectively terminated as of 14 March 2016, when he was told that the Investors had lost confidence in him and had decided to exercise their voting power in favour of his removal.  But that is just what, in my view, the good faith provision, importing as it did the requirement of fidelity to the parties’ bargain, inhibited them from doing. </p>

Again to refer to Dr Sachs’ unchallenged evidence, he said that Mr Fletcher took out a piece of paper (the term sheet for his removal) and said “<span style="font-style:italic">We are not going to fund the company unless you are no longer CEO.</span>”  Once more, that evidence was not challenged and I accept it. </p>

It seems to me that there was at least ambiguity about what the threat to withdraw funding involved.  Mr Faulkner in his cross-examination said he understood it to be a reference to long-term funding, but that is not inconsistent with the idea that Dr Sachs – to whom Mr Faulkner did not speak before the 14 March meeting – interpreted differently what he was told, and the critical player in this part of the story is Dr Sachs not Mr Faulkner.  The evidence overall is consistent with a degree of ambiguity which it would have been easy for Dr Sachs to interpret in the way he did.  First, there is the tone of the letter sent by Mr Burkey to Mr Faulkner on the afternoon of 13 March 2016 (see [149] above: “<span style="font-style:italic">The Company has a small cash balance but will be unable to make March UK payroll … The Majority Investors have lost confidence in the CEO, Jonathan Sachs, and as a result, will not provide further funding to the Company under the existing management arrangements”)</span>.  Second, there is the tone of the draft email prepared by Mr Bolger on the morning of 14 March 2016, to be sent if needed to Mr Stark (see [155] above: “<span style="font-style:italic">The alternative is no more funding and insolvency this week mostly likely”)</span>.  Third, there is the fact that the completion of the Subscription Agreement for the short term injection of funding was held off pending Dr Sachs’ departure (in an email dated 22 March 2016, the day after Dr Sachs’ compromise agreement was executed, Ms McDermid sent an email referring to the “<span style="font-style:italic">next round of financing for CP, that has been left until Jonathan’s agreement had been signed.</span>”)</p>

I say only that the information given to him was ambiguous, and he acted (reasonably in my view) by interpreting what he was told as including the risk of an imminent and peremptory withdrawal of funding.  That created a degree of urgency which meant Dr Sachs felt he had no room for manoeuvre and was no doubt a weighty factor in his decision to resign, which was then documented in short order over the course of the next few days.  It also helps to explain the surprise Mr Faulkner said he felt at the fact that Dr Sachs agreed to go so easily: his evidence was that he thought Dr Sachs would put up a fight and was surprised when he did not.  The explanation is that Dr Sachs did not think he had time for it.  He might have thought differently had he been made aware that funding would be available until 31 May. </p>

By 14 March 2016, the Investors had reached the view that success (or perhaps, as they saw it, salvaging something from failure) was possible only with Dr Sachs out of the picture.  Viewed purely commercially, I have no doubt that that was a rational view to have come to: the overall project had come to be vastly more expensive than originally anticipated; there had been many setbacks including missed milestones; the P1 prototype tested in Phoenix in February was some way removed from the original vision; Dr Sachs had demonstrated a stubborn personality and limited leadership skills; and there had been the ugly disagreement with Mr Bolger at the meeting on 11 March, and then the stand-off over the appointment of management consultants, both of which – entirely reasonably in my view – had so unsettled Mr Tenenbaum.  </p>

It was his vision and leadership they had invested in.  Moreover, they had contracted on a basis which gave him a special status in the management and direction of CPGL’s business.  From their point of view, removing Dr Sachs was a seismic event, not only in the sense that it would result in the loss of his technical expertise, but also in the sense that it would remove from the overall constitutional structure one of the two key individuals whose role on the board was expressly designed to counteract the possible effect of overbearing majority shareholder control.  I have seen nothing to suggest that the Investors took account of any of these factors in deciding how to deal with Dr Sachs in March 2016.  It was not suggested that they did.   </p>

What one is left with is essentially the majority Investors imposing on CPGL their own vision of what should happen to CPGL commercially.  In my view, it does not matter that that vision may have been a sound one.  The point is that, good or bad, it was an expression of the will of the majority only.   The 2013 constitution was expressly designed to avoid the will of the majority prevailing in matters concerned with the commercial future of CPGL.    </p>

It is true that Mr Faulkner had acted as a point of contact for them and as a conduit for information, but it seems to me that the change envisaged by the removal of Dr Sachs was so fundamental that transparency and fair dealing really required the Minorities to be informed and actively consulted before any final decision was made.  Aside from other matters, they may have had views about any successor appointment, and about whether any successor to Dr Sachs should similarly be accorded special status and voting rights on CPGL’s board. It is quite unrealistic to think that Mr Faulkner had authority to speak for them in relation to such matters, and there is nothing to suggest that the Investors thought about them.  On the contrary, the evidence is consistent with them having a desire to sweep away the constitutional restrictions which inhibited them from imposing on CPGL their own view of what was required commercially.     </p>

In the absence of some form of wrongdoing which would make an otherwise unfair exclusion fair, a difference of view about what is right for the business – however marked and whatever the good sense of the majority view – does not justify exclusion by the majority.

I think that is the Petitioners’ real point.  The Company was not being managed in the way they had been promised.  That was because <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> control of management of the business was taken over by Vollin and Minden via the medium of the Kew Investor presentations.  The sporadic information flow to Mr Faulkner was really a symptom of that wider issue, which involved Mr Faulkner being kept at arm’s-length and marginalised.  Over time of course, as the relationship between Mr Faulkner and Mr Bolger became more strained and indeed dysfunctional, positive efforts were made to keep information from him, specifically in connection with the approach from Kaiam.  But in a sense, even these later events are only a development of the same phenomenon.  They certainly had the same root cause, which was fact that the constitutional settlement contained in the 2013 Articles and 2013 SHA had collapsed. </p>

That is true, but in the circumstances it seems to me that the reasons are plain.  Mr Fletcher’s view of Mr Faulkner has always been poor (see his early email above at [86]: “<span style="font-style:italic">I would strongly suggest he doesn’t attend other than possibly in the role/guise of a breakfast appetiser. Maybe he tastes good with eggs! I don’t think we actually need a board meeting in any official sense.”</span>). There is nothing to suggest that Mr Fletcher’s view had improved over time, and indeed it seems logical to think that he viewed with increasing alarm the idea of Mr Faulkner playing an active role in the management of the business, still less one which involved him having a right of veto over resolutions at board meetings.  From his point of view, the existing constitutional structure was a dead letter.   </p>

Thus, the die was already cast, and no doubt to him, the idea that he should seek to invoke a governance structure which his major investors considered to have “<span style="font-style:italic">manifestly failed</span>” and had already in practice overridden seemed quite unrealistic. </p>

Mr Faulkner was aware of what was needed, but had no active involvement in the relevant decision-making process. His resultant concerns informed his decision to circularise the Minorities on 17 August 2016, seeking their consent to the further US$4.5m subscription by Vollin.  Given that their consent was sought and provided, it is impossible for them to say they did not know what was going on or were not consulted, but what they can say is that by this stage the proper constitutional machinery for approving new subscriptions had entirely broken down.  Even assuming Fieldfisher’s view of clause 20.1 of the SHA was the correct one, still, what clause 20.1 contemplated was a board constituted and operating in accordance with the 2013 constitution.  Self-evidently, by August 2016 that was no longer happening.  Thus, whatever they may have known, the crux of the matter is that the Minorities were deprived of the benefits of the constitutional settlement they had agreed with the Investors.  The same logic can be applied to the later loan by Minden in November 2016, although that was not the subject of any detailed submissions by the parties at trial.   </p>

Thus, there was some debate at trial as to what Mr Faulkner should have been told about the Kaiam merger approach.  It seems to me the answer to that question is clear if one imagines what would have happened in the normal course had there been a properly functioning board.  In such circumstances, it is obvious that Mr Faulkner would and should have been informed about the approach by Kaiam, even at the stage when the favoured option was a merger.  That is because a critical part of Kaiam’s motivation was acquisition of the Newton Aycliffe Fab, and the Fab was a major asset of the Group and indeed of CPUK, of which Mr Faulkner was the sole director.  I do not see that there was ever such a hard and fast division between the merger idea and the asset sale structure as to justify Mr Faulkner not being told what was going on.

Likewise, he together with Mr Jackson managed the process of terminating the contract with Selex and (in the event) selling the Newton Aycliffe Fab to Kaiam, but that was only implementing a strategy to cut costs and reposition the business which was being driven by the Investors and indeed had its origins in the Vollin meeting held on 12 March 2016.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me the position here is different.  I do not think it inevitably follows from the fact that the overall constitutional machinery had broken down that the nominee directors were <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> exercising their powers for the purposes for which they were conferred.  One would need to understand more clearly what powers are in question and, in relation to their exercise, precisely what purpose is said to have been improper.  No specifics are given.  The directors did exercise their power to allot shares during the relevant period, but I do not think it is said specifically that the power was exercised for an improper purpose: after all, the business needed ongoing funding, and the evidence seems clear that the allotment of new shares to Vollin in August 2016 was carried out for the purpose of providing working capital, which selfevidently was a proper purpose.  The same logic must apply to the later approval of the loan made by Minden in November 2016.  Consequently, I see nothing in the general complaint made under this head. </p>

It seems to me the nominee directors acted in good faith in taking the steps they thought necessary to bring that about.  Certainly, I have seen nothing to persuade me that they did not honestly believe they were acting in the best interests of the Company.  The evidence of Mr Tenenbaum was particularly telling in this regard (see above at [132]-[133]), in articulating the serious commercial concerns he had in March 2016, and which no doubt informed his thinking thereafter.  True, he was not a director, but there can be little doubt that the concerns he expressed in his evidence were shared by the others who were (Mr Fletcher, Mr Burkey and Mr De Cort), because they were obvious and significant concerns. </p>

I can well see that the Investors and the Minorities had divergent interests when it came to the make-up of the board and constitutional structure of the business, but not when it came to the commercial direction of the business, and to making the tough decisions which had to be made in the Spring of 2016 in the wake of Dr Sachs’ departure.  Very likely, given the state the business was in, and its dependence on the majority Investors for its ongoing funding, the range of options available to the nominee directors was very narrow, and they had no real choice but to do what they did.  It thus seems to me that at that point and in that sense, the interests of the Investors and the Minorities were aligned; or at any rate, I am not persuaded that they were sufficiently different that I can conclude that any particular sectional interests of the Minorities were not sufficiently taken account of, such that in any material sense the nominee directors can be criticised for failing to act in the interests of the members as a whole.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first is essentially the same point already made above regarding the position of Dr Sachs within the agreed constitutional structure (see above at [382], <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span>.).  The same logic applies vis-à-vis Mr Faulkner. His position, too, was critical in terms of the agreed upon balance of power as between the shareholders and the board, and hence in terms of the balance of power between the Investors and the Minorities.  He too occupied a special position on the board.  The actions taken by the Investors to remove him from his position as a director were on the face of it unfairly prejudicial for just the same reasons as in the case of Dr Sachs.  They were unfair because they involved the Investors exercising their voting power to exclude Mr Faulkner in a manner which obviously had the effect of overriding the agreed upon constitutional balance, and they were prejudicial because they deprived the Minorities not only of Mr Faulkner’s presence on the board as someone who could look out for their interests, but also of the protections which his presence on the board were designed to achieve.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is to consider whether the exclusion of Mr Faulkner, even if otherwise unfair, is rendered fair as a result of his own conduct, which the Investors maintain justified his expulsion.  They rely on Mr Faulkner’s behaviour generally in the period from late June 2016 onwards, which they criticise as having been erratic and potentially damaging.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is true that aspects of Mr Faulkner’s behaviour were strange and unsatisfactory.  These included (i) his peremptory demand for a number of categories of information made in his email of 2 August 2016, in which he also proposed to meet at Newton Aycliffe on 11 August, (ii) his decision to circularise the Minorities in order to obtain their individual approvals for the proposed further US$4.5m subscription by Vollin, and (iii) his insistence, when he eventually visited Newton Aycliffe with BDO on 7 September 2016, on demanding access to the visitors’ book, about which he gave some odd and less than compelling oral evidence at trial.   </p>

For one thing, there is no pleaded allegation of breach of duty by Mr Faulkner.  For another, Mr Faulkner, like Dr Sachs, was classified on his departure as a “<span style="font-style:italic">Good Leaver</span>”, which is inconsistent with the idea that he was in breach of duty at the time and, as Mr Hollington pointed out, should preclude the making of any allegation now that in fact he was.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, it seems to me that the examples of what I have called Mr Faulkner’s strange behaviour must be put in context.  It is relevant in assessing them to identify what one might describe as their root cause.  Here, it seems to me the position is plain.  The oddities in Mr Faulkner’s behaviour can all be traced back to the decision made by the Investors to exclude Dr Sachs, and thereafter to adopt a structure for managing CPGL which left no room for involvement by Mr Faulkner, and ignored the framework of the 2013 constitution.  That left Mr Faulkner marginalised and concerned not only about his own position but also that of the Minorities he had introduced to the business.  His behaviour in that sense was a reaction to the situation he found himself in, and was a response to the breakdown in the governance structure which came about as a result of the actions taken by Vollin and Minden, and which on the Vollin and Minden side gave rise to examples of dysfunctional behaviour which were equally if not more serious and concerning (by which I mean in particular the decision made by Mr Jackson and Mr Bolger to lie to Mr Faulkner to avoid him visiting Newton Aycliffe on 11 August 2016, and the decision made by Mr Bolger to mislead him about the presentation to the Investors given on 15 August 2016). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The high watermark of the Investors’ criticism is Mr Faulkner’s decision to circularise the Minorities on 17 August 2016, relying on his alternative interpretation of clause 20.1 of the 2013 SHA.  It bears emphasis, however, that that interpretation was supported by legal advice, and it seems to me that even if I disagree with it (I think I probably do), I am bound to conclude that it was put forward by Mr Faulkner in good faith.  One might perhaps say that Mr Faulkner’s actions in this regard were illadvised, but given the uncertain and febrile atmosphere in which he found himself in August 2016, it seems to me that equally they were understandable.  I certainly think that, looked at in context, it would be disproportionate and wrong to say that they were such as to deprive him or the Minorities of the ability to say that his exclusion was unfairly prejudicial.   </p>

It is rather difficult for me to say whether the information in fact provided to the Minorities was adequate or not, when measured against the yardstick of clause 5.3(f) of the SHA (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Company and each CPG Group Company … shall keep the Shareholders … fully informed as to all their material financial and business affairs</span>”).  The complaint made is again very generalised, and is more in the nature of a complaint that things were simply not being done in the way the Minorities were entitled to expect.  Certainly information <span style="font-style:italic">has </span>been provided, but perhaps not at the level one might have expected given the terms of clause 5.3(f).

They very rarely change hands as a separate asset. They are usually sold as part of an overall business. Therefore, a particular asset within the context of a broader business may not itself be generating revenue but it might be doing something that enables the business as a whole to generate revenue and profit. Therefore you may not be able to attach a specific revenue stream to it … Within that context, the standards allow you to use a depreciated replacement cost.

This line of argument therefore does nothing in my view to change the overall position, and if anything counts against the appropriateness of the DRC method. </p>

I will have to return to this below, but for now I will say that one cannot safely infer from the discussions which Mr Jackson and Mr Bolger had with ATREG that there was a ready market for the Fab in late 2016 or early 2017.  On the contrary, it seems to me that the exchanges with ATREG only underscore how difficult and unpredictable the process of trying to market such a specialist facility was anticipated to be (see e.g., above at [285]).  It is true that the Fab had changed hands on three occasions previously, as mentioned above at [296], but on each occasion for a reduced value, and on the occasion of the sale to CPGL, at a much reduced value from the previous sale by Filtronics to RFMD.  I see little in these facts to support the view that as things stood in late 2016 or early 2017, a buyer was likely to be found for the Fab who would be able to turn it to profitable use.   </p>

I do not agree that is an appropriate inference to draw.  It is equally if not more plausible to think that the minimum success fee was there to reflect the possibility of a much lower sales value, with the effect that the standard 4% return would not come to much (to use Mr Bolger’s expression).  It is notable that after the meeting at Newton Aycliffe on 25 October 2016, when Mr Khan wrote to Mr Jackson to give some worked examples of how his revised commission arrangements might work, he included sale values in the US$8m-US$9m range (see above at [299]). </p>

In either event I have come to the conclusion that I cannot regard the sale to II-VI in August 2017 as a reliable indicator of market value in May, or as a reliable indicator of demand at that stage such as to justify use of the DRC valuation method.   </p>

Yet some points are clear.  The proposed acquisition by Kaiam was publicly announced in March 2017 but not completed until May.  Had there been real interest in the Fab at that stage from alternative buyers one might have expected them to emerge and try and intervene in the sale: I received evidence of II-VI itself having intervened in a prospective sale on one previous occasion.  Yet nothing happened.  Instead, the first suggestion of another market participant expressing an interest came only on about 9 June 2016 (see above at [324]).  This was a month or so after the sale to Kaiam, and two days after Mr Bolger had attended a Kaiam Board meeting in California at which the focus had been on Kaiam’s liquidity difficulties.   </p>

When Mr Pezeshki reported this, according to Mr Bolger, he linked the interest to intelligence released to the market by Apple at its WDC on 5 June 2017.  By 30 June, Lumentum had also appeared as another interested party.  Mr Bolger explained in an email to Kew and others on 30 June 2017 that the “<span style="font-style:italic">major laser businesses … are scrambling for laser capacity</span>.”  He also said “<span style="font-style:italic">the sudden interest in NA has arisen because of what is believed to be an Apple plan to put a laser system in the iPhone and iPad to work with AR software tools it is releasing for its IOS mobile platform</span>.”  II-VI emerged later and a three-way bidding process developed in which II-VI was the eventual winner, paying a great deal more (US$80m paid for Kaiam Laser Ltd, with approximately US$69m allocated to “<span style="font-style:italic">property, plant and equipment</span>”) than what Mr Bolger at any rate understood to be the nearest alternative offer (US$25m). </p>

The consideration was paid on the sale of Newton Aycliffe and selling Newton Aycliffe was a part of the overall strategy for CPGL which became necessary given its financial state after Dr Sachs’ departure.  To my mind, an acquisition of shares in that manner does not infringe the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">Business</span>” in the SHA.  No decision had been made by the Investors to enter into a new area of commercial investment activity.  The holding of shares in Kaiam was only a consequence of the decision to sell Newton Aycliffe, and the inability to find an alternative buyer who would pay cash.  That was an entirely defensible decision commercially, as I have already held, and plainly was not part of a new business strategy whose focus was holding investments in other technology companies.  For those reasons, I reject this head of complaint. </p>

It appeared at the time (correctly, in my view) to have limited value.  It was a problem to be solved, rather than an asset of substantial value the disposal of which was likely to generate significant revenue for the Group.  The problem was really one about trying to avoid the costs and job losses which would inevitably follow if the Selex contract came to an end and no new acquirer had been found in the meantime.  Mr Bolger and Mr Jackson, and in particular Mr Jackson who knew the Fab well and had a good relationship with Selex, were well placed to try and solve that problem.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I say that essentially for the reasons already developed at [292]-[295] above.  The ATREG proposal was an expensive one which would require material expenditure even if one or other of the alternatives (MBO or sale to Kaiam) came off.  ATREG’s further proposal ([298]-[299] above) did not fully address that point, and indeed expressly contemplated the payment of significant fees to ATREG even in the event of a sale to Kaiam or an MBO.  ATREG’s projected 12 month timescale, even if realistic, would have extended beyond the date of the Selex contract and therefore into the period when the Fab (if kept open) would be absorbing significant costs but generating no income.  There was great uncertainty about price and ATREG would not commit to provide a valuation without signed engagement terms.  In the meantime, the other available alternatives appeared equally if not more promising as potential solutions.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The choice of whether or not to engage ATREG was effectively a business decision, to be made in light of the many commercial factors in play.  It cannot be said that those involved did not honestly think they were doing the right thing, in choosing not to proceed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Frolov Junior had an interest in a sale to Kaiam coming about (see at [304]), but the other evidence is equivocal, and in fact shows the Investors wavering between the MBO option (which was cost neutral), and the Kaiam option (which would involve them having to make a further investment in Kaiam as a “<span style="font-style:italic">sweetener</span>”).  Here I have in mind in particular Ms McDermid’s email mentioned at [291] above (<span style="font-style:italic">“the principals…are happy to invest in Kaiam to get rid of NA, but I get the feeling that they would be even happier to not invest.”</span>).   I also have in mind Mr Bolger’s email to Mr de Cort and Mr Tenenbaum on 27 February 2017, showing that even at that stage the MBO, although unlikely, appeared the better option (“<span style="font-style:italic">while there is still a possibility that [the MBO] might be happen [sic] (and would generally be a better outcome for CP/NA), it does not seem likely at this point</span>.”)  By April 2017, the MBO had fallen away and only Kaiam was left (see above at [314]), which made Mr Bolger nervous about what would happen if the Kaiam sale fell through.  This overall fact pattern is not consistent, in my view, with Dr Frolov pushing the Kaiam deal and the directors of CPGL therefore favouring it above the other available options.   </p>
