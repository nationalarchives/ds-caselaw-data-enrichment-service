	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.54in">In August 2015 the well known children’s charity, Kids Company, entered insolvent liquidation. After a lengthy and extensive investigation, and shortly before the two year time limit for doing so expired, the Official Receiver commenced proceedings against all of the directors who had been in office at or shortly before the date of the charity’s collapse (the “Trustees”), together with its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). By its claim the Official Receiver seeks to disqualify each of them under s 6 Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.54in">The structure of this judgment can be seen from the table of contents. After a brief outline of the background and procedural history, I set out some information about each of the defendants and summarise the issues. I then describe the evidence, including comments on the individual witnesses, and summarise the relevant legal principles. The sections that follow contain my factual findings and conclusions covering the principal areas of factual dispute. (A dramatis personae of key individuals is included as an Appendix to assist the reader.) I then turn to apply the legal principles to the facts, first by determining whether the second defendant, Camila Batmanghelidjh (the CEO), was a de facto director, and then by determining whether the test for disqualification is satisfied.  I conclude with some recommendations. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.54in">The way in which the factual findings have been set out reflects the different issues raised in this case. So whilst the general findings in relation to the charity’s financial position from paragraph [199] onwards are chronological, others are dealt with by subject matter or theme. This, and the interconnected nature of the issues more generally, inevitably requires a great deal of cross-referencing. Crossreferences are indicated by square bracketed references to paragraph numbers of this judgment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Kids Company was founded in 1996 by Ms Batmanghelidjh, originally as a dropin centre under railway arches in Camberwell. It was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in September 1997 under the name “Keeping Kids Company”, and was registered as a charity in February 1998.

The original drop-in centre was replaced by “Arches II”, at Kenbury Street in Brixton. I will refer to the children and young people that Kids Company supported as “clients”, although I should clarify that Kids Company did not charge them for its services. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In common with other incorporated charities, the Trustees were the directors of Kids Company. They were both “charity trustees”, being the persons having the general control and management of the administration of the charity (s 177 Charities Act 2011), and company directors, subject to duties as such. The Trustees operated through full Trustee meetings (the “Board”) and also through two Board committees, the Finance Committee and Governance Committee, which each comprised certain members of the Board. The Board generally met six times a year. The Governance Committee met with similar regularity, and the Finance Committee met at least nine times a year (in practice monthly by 2014). The Trustees all saw the minutes of meetings of the two Board committees. They also received detailed reports on the finances at each Board meeting, typically with copies of the most recent monthly management accounts considered by the Finance Committee. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">With limited exceptions, charity trustees may not be remunerated for their role.

In addition to staff located at its centres, Kids Company had a head office with sizeable teams devoted to finance and fundraising, as well as staff performing a number of other administrative and managerial functions.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In its last published annual report and accounts, for the year ended 31 December 2013, Kids Company described itself as both supplementing parental care and acting as substitute parents when young people did not have functioning parents, and its primary aim as being to help people to discover their resilience and go on to thrive. The report included some details of the scale of the problems that the charity was dealing with, including very significant levels of deprivation, neglect and abuse. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">There is no doubt that the charity was involved in highly challenging work. A September 2013 report by the LSE (see [568] below) said that Kids Company worked with the “most vulnerable children and youth in the UK” with its clients experiencing “severe developmental adversity, being exposed to food insecurity, poverty, poor housing, violence and social exclusion, abuse and substance misuse, low educational and employment aspirations, domestic maltreatment and unstable home environments”.  </p>

In very brief summary, the underlying thinking, as explained in the LSE report just referred to, was that developmental adversity is associated with changes in brain structure and function. Kids Company’s model of intervention was intended to provide support that could alter neural pathways and provide the opportunity for positive change, making what the report concluded was a substantial difference to clients’ lives.  </p>

At a more material level, it assisted by providing meals, food vouchers, various types of therapy and educational and other support services. </p>

There was some challenge to an apparent lack on her part of formal qualifications, which (given the case being brought) appeared at best irrelevant. There is no question that the methodology that Kids Company developed was widely praised, and Ms Batmanghelidjh’s work received significant recognition, including for example a lifetime achievement award from the Centre for Social Justice in 2009 and an honorary fellowship at University College London in 2014.

Mr Yentob described her as having the gift of reaching the (otherwise) unreachable. But she was also an extraordinarily successful fundraiser for Kids Company, and developed influential relationships with a number of senior politicians as well as philanthropists. Mr Yentob described her particular gift as engendering sympathy for Kids Company’s beneficiaries, young people who were often troubled, involved in crime and excluded from school: as he said, not a group of people for whom the public would necessarily have a natural affinity. As Ms Bolton noted in her affidavit, Ms Batmanghelidjh was widely recognised as a compelling advocate for vulnerable young people. Ms Bolton added that Ms Batmanghelidjh was probably the best fundraiser she had ever worked with (Ms Bolton’s own expertise in that area is described in the next section).  </p>

Ms Bolton developed a good working relationship with Ms Batmanghelidjh through her work on the exhibition, and Ms Batmanghelidjh approached her to see if she was interested in becoming a trustee. Ms Bolton also knew Mr Yentob and had been deeply affected by what the exhibition had revealed about the circumstances in which some London children found themselves.

This included introductions to individual artists who might, for example, provide works for auction, and to venues that could host exhibitions of art work produced by Kids Company’s clients. She said that a number of the charity’s most significant funders came from the arts world, and that well-known artists, including Grayson Perry, Tracy Emin, Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor, had made contributions. Ms Bolton also explained that she understood that being a trustee involved having, with her co-trustees, overall responsibility for the charity’s affairs, but that she did not hold herself out as having any particular financial expertise.  </p>

He was evidently not familiar with the concept of a charity board being comprised entirely of non-executives.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, I was left with a strong impression from Mr Hannon’s evidence that his report had been produced, and reworked, very much with an eye on the team within the Insolvency Service that would (at the direction of the Secretary of State) authorise him to launch proceedings, and would approve what period of disqualification should be recommended. I was not persuaded that sufficient regard had been paid to the duties not to overstate the case against the defendants, to put it in a balanced way, and not to omit significant evidence in their favour (<span style="font-style:italic">Re Finelist</span> [2004] BCC 877 at [19]). I should emphasise that this is not intended to be a criticism of Mr Hannon as an individual – for example, as mentioned above, the investigation was not all conducted under his leadership – but of what I infer is a broader issue of training and understanding within the Department. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, despite Mr Hannon’s level of experience I am afraid to say that I found some of his evidence rather unrealistic. Most of the issues in question are matters of opinion so they are strictly inadmissible as evidence, but they underpin aspects of the Official Receiver’s case and need to be addressed in that context. Again, I deal with these points later but my concerns included views expressed as to how reserves should have been built up, how Ms Batmanghelidjh should have been dealt with by the Trustees, the view that should have been taken about communications from senior members of the government and associated individuals, and the approach that the charity should have taken to the reality of young people’s needs. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, there was a difficulty in Mr Hannon’s approach to the directors individually, as opposed to collectively. The court must make an assessment as to the fitness or otherwise of each director individually (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Walters &amp; Davis-White, Directors' Disqualification &amp; Insolvency Restrictions</span> (3rd ed.), para 5-82, referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Re City Investment Centres Ltd</span> [1992] BCLC 956, 960 and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Westmid Packing Services Ltd</span> [1998] BCC 836, 842). Apart from recognising that Mr Webster joined the Board on 10 December 2013 and that Mr O’Brien resigned on 31 March 2015, and including a table purporting to set out who was on the Board committees, no distinctions were drawn between the Trustees in the report. Mr Hannon was also unable to assist the court in understanding the distinctions drawn between the length of disqualification sought for each defendant. I accept that the length of disqualification is a matter for the court (and therefore for submissions) rather than the Official Receiver’s report, but it must be the responsibility of the Official Receiver to adduce evidence on which the court may rely in determining both whether each <span style="font-style:italic">individual</span> director is unfit and the length of disqualification that is appropriate to <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> individual. In any event I would expect the Official Receiver to be able to explain the different lengths of disqualification that he had sought when asked. It is, after all, his case.  </p>

The explanation for this appears to relate to the way in which the allegations developed. The allegations as originally put to the defendants, in letters sent in March 2017, included an allegation of causing or allowing Kids Company to incur inappropriate expenditure. That allegation was said to be demonstrated by an analysis of “Top 25” clients between 2013 and 2015 (see [546] below for an explanation of the “Top 25”). The allegation was later dropped, but Mr Tatham’s report was already substantially complete by the date that the March letters were sent. All but four of the 39 clients covered were in the “Top 25” category during that period, and the others were either connected to them or there was a link to a member of staff. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Tatham also appeared to struggle even more than Mr Hannon with the idea of a wholly non-executive charity board. For example, he suggested in crossexamination that Trustees should have noticed that (as he alleged) client filing was not being done, although on the following day he sought to modify this by suggesting that they should have instructed someone else to check client files. He also suggested that, rather than relying on expectations of or reassurances from staff, the implementation of decisions should have been formally checked by Trustees. </p>

More significantly, the narrow focus on adherence to Kids Company’s policies for distributing financial assistance did not in my view result in a balanced representation in Mr Tatham’s report of the findings of various external reports about the charity’s operations that had been undertaken during  or close to the period in question, and in particular what the Trustees might reasonably have derived from those reports. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Hamilton was very softly spoken, and much of her oral evidence was not very clearly articulated. This was somewhat surprising given her qualifications and apparent level of experience. There was a notable tendency to start speaking, stop, restart and then quite often not to complete, or complete clearly, what Ms Hamilton might have intended to say. This might have been in part due to nerves, since Ms Hamilton became somewhat clearer during the second day of her two days in the witness box, although the tendency was still there to a marked extent. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">While I accept that Ms Hamilton gave her evidence honestly, I did notice what appeared to be some exaggerated caution in confirming some points, relying on failures of recollection. Whilst the lapse of time meant that an inability to recall details was perfectly understandable, in Ms Hamilton’s case this appeared to extend to a refusal to confirm a point by reference to how she would have behaved in the situation in question. For example, there was some reticence in confirming that she had reviewed management account documents in advance of Finance Committee meetings even when it was clear from the agenda and minutes that she was responsible for presenting those documents at the relevant meeting. In contrast, certain other points were apparently very clearly recalled, even though they related to a specific event, such as what happened in a particular meeting. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Hamilton seems to have retained all, or at least a significant number of, her Kids Company work emails on a laptop after she left the organisation. It appears that this material was used among other things in connection with the creation of the joint timeline discussed further below. Ms Hamilton also confirmed that she had looked through her emails to pick out what she considered to be “relevant”, printed them and provided them to the Official Receiver. I infer that Ms Hamilton’s approach to relevance was rather different to the approach that might be taken on a disclosure exercise, and was more directed at identifying material that could be used to criticise the charity. That is consistent with her evident views about the charity’s failings, and with what appeared to be a rather selective approach in referring to documents in her affidavit.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Hamilton also had some handwritten notes which she said had been written in a notebook that she started using at a point when she developed real concerns. There were also typed notes prepared over a later period, around June 2015, which were said to be a typed version of the handwritten notes but in fact included additional material. Ms Hamilton said that she stopped work on the typed version when the joint timeline was developed. Differences between the notes, and between them and other documents including notes of her statement to the Official Receiver under s 132 Insolvency Act 1986, together with an inability clearly to explain the timing or process of creating the handwritten and typed notes, affected the weight that could be placed on the later documents in particular. There were also differences between the tenor of her evidence and some of the documentary evidence, including the content of a contemporaneous email that she wrote about the reasons for her resignation and the work she continued to do for the charity following her resignation. </p>

She felt increasingly undermined, in particular by direct dealings in relation to contingency planning between Ms Batmanghelidjh and Sachin Mevada, the Head of Finance who reported (or should have reported) to Ms Hamilton. As discussed further below, she also felt that she was being dissuaded from continuing to contact Trustees directly to express her genuinely held concerns.  </p>

As Ms Batmanghelidjh said, Ms Lloyd was a senior, highly paid, employee and I do not believe that she would have been readily cowed into silence by Ms Batmanghelidjh. She could have chosen to speak out if she had wished to do so. Instead it appears that she relied on other senior managers raising concerns. However, since the fundamental concerns that she could speak to related to the quality of the fundraising projections, on which she directly worked and which were shown on spreadsheets which the Trustees would have been aware had been produced by her, the effect of not speaking out either within a meeting, or outside its confines, risked Trustees being left with a misleading impression. </p>

There is also an email from Ms Tyler on 25 March 2015 about the importance of pressing ahead with implementing an effective plan to manage the financial situation (see [301] below). It was Ms Tyler who in May 2015 arranged for Hogan Lovells LLP to provide pro bono insolvency advice. Deborah Gregory, a Hogan Lovells partner, was heavily involved from then on, together with Chris Laverty, a partner at KPMG who agreed to give insolvency advice in conjunction with Hogan Lovells. <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Ms Bolton </span></p>

However, Mr Webster was clear that this was not his perspective.

It was an exercise in recollection, performed some time after the events in question. Secondly, it was a combined effort rather than the recollections of a single individual, the precise input by each being unclear, and with one of them not being a witness in the case (for reasons that were never provided).

In reality, lawyers would also have had significant input into the drafting of the other affidavits, not only those of other defendants but also for example (and as she accepted) Ms Hamilton’s. Further, there is in my view a difference between affidavits prepared by each of the defendants in late 2019 (or in Mr Webster’s case 2020), long after the events in question, and the potential impact of the discussions between Ms Hamilton, Mr Stones, Ms Lloyd and Ms Caldwell much closer to the events in question, and in circumstances where the evidence relied on by the Official Receiver includes documentary evidence emanating from those discussions. Witness evidence based on recollection and not supported by documentary evidence will always be treated with some caution.  </p>

In Section IIIA the judge made a number of observations on the proper construction and application of the Act to which we refer, not because we disagree with the judge, but because we wish to emphasise the propositions to which he referred. First, the court must consider the question of ‘unfitness’ by reference to the conduct relied on by the Secretary of State and decide whether ‘viewed cumulatively and taking into account any extenuating circumstances, [it] has fallen below the standards of … competence appropriate for persons fit to be directors of companies’ ( [1999] 1 BCLC 433 at p.483b). Thus it is no answer to the allegations of the Secretary of State that separately and individually none of them is sufficiently serious to demonstrate the requisite unfitness. Secondly, the matter referred to in Sch. 1, para. 6, namely, ‘the director’s responsibility for the causes of the company becoming insolvent’, requires a broad approach and is not to be assessed by reference to nice legal concepts of causation (p.483f-g). Thus it matters not that others may also have been responsible for the causes of the insolvency whether more or less proximately. Thirdly, where the allegation is incompetence without dishonesty it is to be demonstrated to a high degree (pp.483j-484b). This follows from the nature of the penalty. Nevertheless the degree of incompetence should not be exaggerated given the ability of the court to grant leave, as envisaged by the disqualification order as defined in s. 1, notwithstanding the making of such an order. Fourthly, it is not necessary for the Secretary of State to show that the person in question is unfit to be concerned in the management of any company in any role. This test, described by the judge as the lowest common denominator approach, is not what the Act enjoins. As the judge observed, the court is concerned only with the respondent’s conduct in respect of which complaint is made set in the context of his actual management role in that company. If his conduct in that role shows incompetence to the requisite degree then a finding of unfitness and a consequential disqualification order should be made (p.485d-h). Fifthly, a finding of breach of duty is neither necessary nor of itself sufficient for a finding of unfitness (p.486d-g). As the judge observed, a person may be unfit even though no breach of duty is proved against him or may remain fit notwithstanding the proof of various breaches of duty.” </p>

By the time an application comes before the court, the conduct of the directors has to be judged on the basis of statements given to the Official Receiver, no doubt frequently under stress, and a comparatively small collection of documents selected to support the Official Receiver’s and the respondents’ respective positions. On the basis of this the court has to pass judgment on the way in which the directors conducted the affairs of the company over a period of days, weeks or, as in this case, months. Those statements and documents are analysed in the clinical atmosphere of the courtroom. They are analysed, for example, with the benefit of knowing that the company went into liquidation. It is very easy therefore to look at the signals available to the directors at the time and to assume that they, or any other competent director, would have realised that the end was coming. The court must be careful not to fall into the trap of being too wise after the event.” </p>

The court takes into account all the relevant factors. Those factors include at least whether or not there was a holding out by the company of the individual as a director, whether the individual used the title, whether the individual had proper information (e.g. management accounts) on which to base decisions, and whether the individual has to make major decisions and so on. Taking all these factors into account, one asks “was this individual part of the corporate governing structure?”, answering it as a kind of jury question. In deciding this, one bears very much in mind why one is asking the question. That is why I think the passage I quoted from Millett J is important.

He referred at [91] to the “very difficult problem” that emerged of “identifying what functions were in essence the sole responsibility of a director or board of directors”, noting the various formulations that had been suggested, including whether the individual was acting on an equal footing with others in directing the company’s affairs, whether there was a holding out by the company of the individual as a director, and whether the individual was part of the corporate governing structure. He noted the approval by Robert Walker LJ of the way in which Jacob J had declined to formulate a single test and commented that it was just as difficult to define “corporate governance” as to identify those activities which are the sole responsibility of the board. At [93] he said that it did not follow that the concept of de facto director must be given the same meaning in different contexts, but in that context, namely the fiduciary duty of a director not to dispose wrongfully of a company’s assets, the crucial question was whether the person had “assumed the duties of a director”: was he “part of the corporate governing structure”, and had the claimants proved that he “had assumed a role sufficient” to make him responsible?</p>

For example, one of the charity’s programmes was entitled “Get Legit”, which whilst it extended to criminal justice aspects focused on immigration issues and status, and in particular lack of documentation which prevented access to statutory support. The charity worked with very troubled sections of society, including in areas of gang violence, who were not engaging with public authorities. When asked about the self-referral model, Ms Bolton said that she had never considered the charity operating in a different way. It would be a completely different charity.

By definition, local authorities and other budget holders were not referring young people to the charity in any official, or at least funded, manner.  </p>

Kids Company sets out to provide parenting through therapeutic engagement grounded in a practical approach to the meeting of individual needs”.  </p>

For example, a contingency plan attached to the going concern paper prepared in September 2013 (see [221] and [222] below) refers to need for services increasing due to an increase in the number of children pushed into poverty.

In broad terms this was an accurate assessment. The February 2013 Board minutes record that the Trustees had taken a “conscious decision to support what could be considered a financially risky model”. As Ms Robinson pointed out, this was an example of the precise wording of the minutes reflecting Ms Batmanghelidjh’s influence, but the key point was that the Trustees were aware of the risk, and understood that meeting an increased level of need would have to be achieved using funds that had not yet been raised. As discussed further below, what reassured them was the charity’s track record in fundraising, its network of wealthy supporters and the belief that it had support from government at the highest levels.</p>

Kids Company’s 2013 Budget records that it was required to bid for services through local authorities under the terms of a capacity building grant from the Department of Education. This was a £12.7m grant under its Youth Sector Development Fund programme, awarded over a three-year period from 2008 (at around £4.2m per year). The NAO report referred to at [437] below states that the Department for Education “intended this funding to help Kids Company become a centre of excellence” and that it received the largest grant, around 20% of the total funding available. An earlier section of the NAO report explains that the government awarded Kids Company grants “to support the delivery of services to vulnerable young people, <span style="text-decoration:underline">replicate its model of service</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">delivery nationally</span> and ensure continuity of support to young people” (emphasis supplied). </p>

Both Ms Batmanghelidjh and Mr O’Brien confirmed in cross-examination that the matter was extensively discussed with the Board. Mr O’Brien also referred to being presented with a detailed report from Ms Chipperfield (the then Director of Finance), who was negotiating the contract, and being asked to sign it. His evidence was that the Board did approve the move to Bristol. I accept this, and note that the point was rightly not pursued by the Official Receiver in closing.

And although it took some time, the charity did raise significant additional funds for Bristol. In particular, figures for June 2015 include a £500,000 donation from a charitable foundation associated with a Bristol based individual, the terms of which permitted it to be used for general purposes.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">At its meeting on 25 April 2012 the Finance Committee discussed a significant increase in costs, particularly staff costs, since the previous year, reflecting the fact that the charity had been increasing staff numbers in anticipation of winning contracts that had not in fact been won. The cash position had also worsened significantly. The Finance Committee formed the view that immediate action should be taken, not only to secure income but also to freeze recruitment and implement a headcount reduction. The minutes refer to debt of £1.7m being accumulated in a very short time, a “short term cash crisis” and running costs being “significantly more than what the charity can afford”. </p>

Among other things the notes record Ms Batmanghelidjh going through income prospects and asking for time to speak to people, discussing the increase in staff and the need to show deliverability to win contracts, but also recording that if the charity did not have “anything firm in place” by the end of July then Ms Batmanghelidjh would start a process of letting people go. The notes record that a freeze on new recruitment was agreed and that it was also agreed that the position should be reviewed again both in a week or so and at the end of July. Mr O’Brien’s summary states that overall it was a very positive meeting with Ms Batmanghelidjh “on top form and reassuringly, very close to the numbers”. Mr O’Brien explained in cross-examination that the latter reference was intended to relate to headcount (although I would suggest that the way it was most likely to be understood was that she had a good grasp of the financial situation). He also said that there was a very good discussion at the meeting, with Ms Batmanghelidjh listening carefully and recalling in detail whom she was talking about in terms of headcount, where they were and why they were needed. But she accepted the need for a headcount freeze. </p>

He said that budgets and income projections were always prepared on a conservative basis. Whilst it was sensible to look at staffing levels, the Finance Committee believed that the income projections would be met. It was also important to bear in mind that the charity was dealing with very vulnerable young people, and the Trustees needed to be mindful that any significant action to cut costs by reducing headcount could have a major impact. In other words, it should not be done unless it was really necessary. I accept Mr Handover’s evidence that budgets and income projections were prepared on a conservative basis (evidence which was consistent with that of Mr O’Brien and Ms Robinson), and that, having regard to the further work referred to in the next paragraph, Finance Committee members were able to reassure themselves that the income projections would be able to be met. </p>

I agree that she did resist the immediate implementation of a headcount reduction, but not on the basis of a refusal to follow instructions. Rather, she explained her understanding of the position in greater detail, in particular her expectation of additional income, and it was agreed by Mr O’Brien and Mr Handover that in the light of that information further immediate action, beyond a headcount freeze, was not needed. Mr O’Brien was asked about the meeting in cross-examination, and his evidence was entirely consistent with this. He described it as a conversation between adults. He also said, and I accept, that the discussion was followed by Mr Handover spending a lot of time with Ms Batmanghelidjh working on income prospects, and that there was a further detailed discussion of the financial position at the Board meeting on 1 August 2012 referred to below.

However, it was clear that the charity’s financial position was under regular review. The annual accounts for 2011 were discussed at a Finance Committee meeting on 25 July and approved by the Board on 1 August 2012, with specific reference to the need to form a view that the charity was a going concern. At the Board meeting the management accounts for the period up to June 2012 were reviewed, cash flow and the increased headcount were discussed, and Mr O’Brien raised the issue of solvency. The continued headcount freeze was noted.  </p>

The Board took comfort from Ms Batmanghelidjh’s confidence that she would be able to raise the full £16.7m income figure that the Board had discussed at the start of the year and from Ms Chipperfield’s assurance that she could manage cash flow and would raise any problems at the September Finance Committee meeting. The Board also concluded that a contingency plan should be prepared in light of the fact that the current government grant would cease in March 2013, and that Ms Batmanghelidjh should attend future Finance Committee meetings. </p>

The view expressed at the Finance Committee reflected the full and frank discussion he encouraged. His view was that he needed to warn Trustees of the risks. If he really believed that the charity was insolvent then he would be doing a formal note to the Board. Instead, there was a detailed discussion at the Board meeting at which income projections would have been reviewed in some detail, together with the position in relation to creditors and the risk to payroll. Ms Batmanghelidjh was confident that the required income could be raised (as proved to be correct) and Ms Chipperfield assured the Board that cash flow could be managed and any problems would be brought up at the September Finance Committee meeting. Ms Batmanghelidjh went into some detail at the meeting about the need for increased staff levels given the growth in demand. The Board had to weigh up the different elements: this was a professional Board doing its best. By the end of the discussion Mr O’Brien was comfortable. His concerns were not being overruled. Rather, there was a clear appreciation of the risks. His affidavit evidence included a comment that most of the other Trustees were much more positive about the charity’s ability to raise funds that year, and they proved to be right. </p>

Problems were identified and considered, rather than not being picked up or ignored. As regards the specific point that the Board determined only to produce a contingency plan rather than implement it, this obviously reflected the Board’s decision to accept the fundraising targets and Ms Chipperfield’s assessment that cash flow could be managed in the meantime. The contingency plan was aimed at the risk that further government funding would not be secured, a risk that did not in the event materialise (see [439] below). </p>

(Surpluses had also been achieved in prior years, apart from 2009, despite the charity’s significant growth.) Cash did remain difficult, however, and Kids Company had an overdraft position of about £110,000 at the end of the year.

Income was budgeted to increase from around £18m to £20m, reflecting a broadly similar increase in costs, of which approximately half (around £1m) were Bristol related and the great majority of which comprised staff costs. The remainder of the increase was largely attributable to the recruitment of senior managers and the full year effect of staff taken on in 2012. Kids costs were largely stable, despite a material increase in the number of young people supported.

It referred to an outline contingency plan prepared by Ms Jenkins, Mr Stones and Mr Mevada, and appended to the paper, as something that could be implemented if needed, and described management of seasonal projected income shortfalls through a combination of the bank overdraft, interest-free loans from supporters and negotiation with major creditors to agree staged payments.

They did so, and in reaching that view I consider they were entitled to be informed and guided by advice received from two well qualified professionals, Ms Jenkins and Mr Mevada, and by the fact that the auditors were prepared to sign off the accounts on that basis. (As already indicated, Ms Jenkins and Mr Mevada were both qualified accountants, Ms Jenkins having joined Kids Company from the charity’s former auditors. Kingston Smith, the auditors from 2012, were also a well-regarded firm with a specialism in the not-for-profit sector.)  </p>

As to Ms Anderson’s point about looking 12 months ahead rather than at any longer period, there was no evidence before the court as to the relevant accounting principles. Mr Westwood’s closing submissions, to which the Official Receiver did not object on this point, stated that the assessment required is that the organisation will continue in existence for the foreseeable future, which is usually taken to be a period of at least 12 months. That is consistent with my understanding. Whilst the evidence I did have indicated that it is normal to look 12 months ahead, it would be counterintuitive to suggest that that is the maximum period that can be considered. I also note that the forecast Ms Jenkins produced for the purpose covered the whole of 2014, and that Mr Handover observed that that was consistent with his experience in business, which was that forecasts of this nature would adopt a similar approach of covering the entirety of the following accounting period. </p>

He considered the going concern paper to be a balanced document, which he questioned and tested. Mr O’Brien described himself as a “due diligence accountant” who would never simply accept such a document. The income and expenditure forecast would, as always, have been prepared on a conservative basis. Mr O’Brien took account not only of all the points made in the going concern paper but all the circumstances at the time, including other matters discussed at the Board meeting, for example in relation to discussions with government (see [449] below) and a meeting that Ms Batmanghelidjh had had with the Prince of Wales and Louise Casey, head of the Troubled Families programme.

The Official Receiver focused on the first one, which related to the low level of reserves and the cash flow issues that the charity had suffered throughout the year, which had been managed by delaying payments to suppliers and setting up a payment plan with HMRC. The auditors referred to the concern raised in that connection by a donor in an email of 16 January 2013 (this was Mr Spiers, see [362] below) and to a letter from HMRC in April 2013 highlighting concerns over the continued arrangement for late payments. They recommended continual work to build up reserves and continual monitoring of the cash position, noting that the possible reluctance of HMRC to provide future payment arrangements should be taken into account in cash flow projections to ensure that PAYE liabilities were paid promptly.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The 2014 Budget was agreed by the Board on 25 March 2014, having been in discussion with the Finance Committee since December 2013. It was a challenging one, budgeting income at £24.4m, a £3m increase on the anticipated actual figure for 2013 of £21.4m (and income of £19.3m in 2012). Costs were also budgeted at £24.4m, compared to an anticipated £21.3m for 2013. Most of this increase was attributable to staff costs, budgeted to increase from £15.3m to £18.3m, around a 20% increase. Staff numbers were budgeted at 520 (full-time equivalent) as compared to 495 in November 2013. The email evidence, as well as the minutes, supports the conclusion that the increase in staff costs and headcount was approved by Finance Committee members in December 2013, following a meeting at which a draft Budget was considered. The increases were also flagged at the Board meeting on 30 January 2014. The increase in staff numbers obviously did not account for the full staff costs increase. Part of the increase, £0.8m, was attributable to new provision for pension contributions and maternity absence, but there were also other factors, in particular the full year effect of staff taken on during 2013, including at senior management level. The Bristol element of the increase was £0.5m. Running costs were actually reduced, with a significant reduction in the research commitment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr O’Brien’s responses to these points were robust and clear, and I accept them. He had no difficulty with the reference to breach of trust in principle, but thought it unnecessary to include it in a budget, the function of which is to state what the organisation is doing and how the numbers look. The reference to increased staff provision being on the Finance Committee’s “recommendation” was factually incorrect. It had been discussed and agreed by the Finance Committee but the Board needed to have an independent discussion rather than simply follow a recommendation. The change to the income schedule wording was because by this stage the document was much more than a first draft by Ms Batmanghelidjh. It had been reviewed both by the Finance team and Finance Committee. As regards the February year-to-date figures, Mr O’Brien understandably could not respond in detail in cross-examination without being given a proper opportunity to study the figures, but I accept his point that it is not practical to keep redoing a budget. I am also satisfied, however, that the Finance Committee and Board would have had in mind the available financial information in determining whether the Budget as a whole was achievable, and I take account of the fact that the Budget itself emphasises the difficulty of accurately predicting timing of income within the year. In fact, the February year-to-date figures showed expenditure as well as income below budget, the former by around £500,000 and the latter by around £800,000. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Robinson was also asked about the 2014 Budget. She emphasised that budgeting was carried out by Kids Company on a conservative basis, namely in a way that minimised revenue and maximised cost, and that historically forecasts were broadly accurate. When the 2014 Budget was agreed she thought that the potential deficit was conservative as things then stood, because the charity would have the time either to raise income or reduce costs as the year progressed. She pointed out that, at the time, there had been a very clear message of support from the Prime Minister in his January 2014 letter (see [452] below), and that whilst Ms Batmanghelidjh could not, or would not want to, carry on fundraising as she had been year after year, at the time she was still being incredibly effective as a fundraiser. In any event the Trustees had their “eyes wide open” about the task ahead. Given the information available to them at the time, including the indications they were getting from the government, what they saw as the necessity of the work being done by the charity, and the difficulty of making material cuts without closing centres (which both the government and philanthropists that supported Kids Company did not want it to do), they decided to proceed without instituting major cost cutting at that time. There were risks but they were believed to be reasonable and manageable in the context of what the charity was doing. I accept this. Mr Yentob’s evidence also echoed the point that the Trustees were balancing the risks with the needs that the charity was meeting. </p>

However, he fairly pointed out the relevance of the context, including what he understood about the discussions with the government, the apparent continued ability of the charity to fundraise and the assurances he understood were being provided by the management team.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The management accounts between May and August 2014 showed, in summary, that the deficit was running at a lower rate than budgeted, with lower income being more than offset by lower costs, in particular staff costs which by August were about £1m lower than budgeted on a year-to-date basis (with a headcount lower than budgeted). A surplus for the year was still anticipated. However, it was clear that cash flow was difficult, with grants being paid later than anticipated and creditors not being paid promptly (see [262] below in respect of aged creditors during this period). As at 31 August the debt ratio, comparing the total debt of the charity to its assets, indicated that only 27% of its liabilities would be covered by its assets, excluding the Heart Yard building (as to which see [537] below). Loans had more than doubled over the previous 12 months. As far as HMRC was concerned, it seems that the position was generally being managed, with the August management accounts summary stating that the charity was upto-date with payments to HMRC as at 16 September. But issues were still arising. The charity could not make the full payments due to HMRC in June and July </p>

In the finance discussion, Mr O’Brien reported that the deficit position was within budget, but this meant having to “stretch creditors to the maximum” and securing loans. Ms Batmanghelidjh is reported as saying that plans were in place to raise additional funding and anticipating that loans would be cleared in October, but also saying that September would be a particularly difficult month. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">As far as the Trustees were concerned, the process was run uncomfortably late, with the accounts being filed on the last possible day within the filing window, 30 September 2014. This was only shortly after the Sunday Times published an article on 21 September in which Ms Batmanghelidjh was reported as saying that the charity would not survive beyond Christmas unless the government stepped in with significant funding. The article, which Trustees were not asked about in advance, led Mr O’Brien to express concern in an email to other members of the Finance Committee that, because of what he described as Ms Batmanghelidjh “playing a game with the government”, it was going to be very difficult to convince the auditors that the charity was a going concern. He made some specific proposals, including the need for a detailed cash flow forecast. Ms Robinson had previously suggested that it might be helpful to produce a cash flow forecast “through to the end of that year”. This was agreed as an action point at the Finance Committee meeting on 23 September. I accept Ms Robinson’s evidence that what she meant was a cash flow forecast covering the full 12 months ahead, to the end of September 2015, on the basis that when considering the question of going concern it is normal to look 12 months ahead. The cash flow forecast in the management accounts pack considered at the Finance Committee meeting (which included the management accounts for August 2014) only ran to August 2015. </p>

Mr O’Brien agreed with this in an email sent early the next morning, asking for a note from Mr Mevada as to “what you have done on going concern” so that the Trustees could be given appropriate reassurance. He added “We need an outline of what you did to get them happy”. The reference to “them” is clearly to the auditors. He suggested that it was not going to be possible to file the accounts that day. This prompted a response from Ms Hamilton that that would result in a fine and create “more cause for concern regarding recent press”. She added that the accounts had not changed “since previous finance committees”, but the text had been delayed, and said that there had been no concerns from the auditors as yet. </p>

The email explained that he had spoken to the audit manager at Kingston Smith (the charity’s auditors) who had confirmed that they were in a position to sign off the accounts that afternoon, and that they were also happy with the going concern statement on the basis that they had “done extensive work on going concern of the charity”. He confirmed that Kingston Smith had reviewed the contingency plan, cash flow forecast up to September 2015, plus management accounts for August 2014, all of which Mr Mevada attached to the email. He added “I went through this cash flow forecast in detail over the phone with the auditor”. (The contingency plan envisaged that Kids Company could afford to reduce staffing by 17%, saving £2.5m over a full year, but would need financing options to fund reductions of 41%, saving £6.4m. As with earlier outline plans, it also noted that cuts at the higher level would risk putting funders off, jeopardising going concern status. The same version of the plan was attached to the 2014 Budget.) </p>

The forecasts attached to the email were consistent with each other and projected positive cash from October 2014 onwards (with a balance of £2.2m by August 2015 and £2.1m by September 2015). The forecast considered at the Finance Committee meeting projected negative cash throughout the period of varying amounts, being around (minus) £570,000 by August 2015.  </p>

When asked about the difference in oral evidence Ms Hamilton could not explain it, saying she could not recall, even though she had presented the management accounts to the Finance Committee and confirmed that she would have seen the different forecast sent to the auditors (she was copied on the relevant email on 26 September, so well in advance of the last minute circulation of the revised forecast to some of the Trustees by Mr Mevada on 30 September).

That of course is not direct evidence of what happened. Further, it directly contradicts Ms Batmanghelidjh’s evidence on the topic when asked about it in cross-examination. She explained that Ms Lloyd would have gone through the detailed figures in the income spreadsheets with the Finance team. Ms Batmanghelidjh’s evidence is consistent with the conclusions I have drawn about income spreadsheets, which were not produced by Ms Batmanghelidjh herself (see [371] onwards below). In my view it is more likely than not that Ms Lloyd, or if not her Ms Caldwell, provided the figures to Mr Mevada, since it was Ms Lloyd (or possibly Ms Caldwell) who kept the detailed information on her computer, and Ms Batmanghelidjh’s learning difficulties meant that working with spreadsheets and lines of numbers was difficult for her. However, it is the case that Ms Batmanghelidjh’s input into the figures would have been reflected in the numbers used by Mr Mevada, and in terms of the most substantial donations that input would have been significant.  </p>

This would have been the case in any circumstances but was particularly so given the very late circulation of the documents. As Ms Tyler said in cross-examination, it was squarely within their remit. Rather, the impression is given that none of the figures have changed. Although the specific confirmation provided on that point related to the figures in the statutory accounts rather than those relevant to cash flow, the point about the impression given still has real force. Both Mr Mevada and Ms Hamilton were qualified accountants with significant experience. The issue of the cash flow forecast was obviously material and something that Mr Mevada had specifically discussed with the auditors. Between them they would also have been responsible for putting the management accounts to the Finance Committee the previous week. I note that Ms Hamilton was listed on the agenda for that meeting as leading the discussion of the management accounts. Mr Mevada’s email attaching the revised cash flow was sent at the last minute on 30 September, during a working day.  </p>

None of the Trustees who were sent the email could recall spotting that the figures were different, and I conclude from the fact that no query was raised that they did not notice. This was hardly surprising given that Mr Mevada circulated the figures discussed with the auditors so late, and without flagging any issue. </p>

Mr O’Brien’s reference to what was done to get the auditors happy carries no such implication, but rather a need to understand what had been said to the auditors. That was obviously necessary in order for the Trustees to form their own view. I note that he was not cross-examined about what he meant by this statement. </p>

This letter was in the Official Receiver’s possession but was not initially included in the trial bundle, only being added at the request of Mr O’Brien’s advisers when it became clear from the Official Receiver’s skeleton argument that the Official Receiver was seeking to argue that staff had not said that they thought the charity was a going concern at the time. Among other things this letter confirmed that it was appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis, and that it was the signatories’ opinion that the company would have adequate cash resources during the following 12 months. Ms Hamilton confirmed in oral evidence that at the time she had no reason to think that Kids Company was not a going concern. She clearly understood the nature and significance of the document. Although not all the Trustees would have seen this letter at the time, the fact that Ms Hamilton signed it underlines the responsibility she adopted for the process and reinforces my conclusion that it would have been the responsibility of management, and not Trustees, to identify and point out material changes to the figures. Whilst it is not the case that the Trustees were entitled to substitute others’ views for their own, I am also satisfied that in signing the accounts and confirming the company’s status as a going concern Mr Handover took some comfort from the fact that Ms Hamilton was prepared to sign the letter, and was entitled to do so. Mr O’Brien also referred to the fact that Ms Hamilton had clearly signed off the accounts, and the fact that Mr Mevada was making it clear that he had discussed the position with the auditors. </p>

On 29 September Ms Tyler had also explicitly flagged the fact that not all Trustees had been copied into a particular email chain about the accounts, and in a further email at 12.26 on 30 September specifically asked why the draft accounts had not been circulated to all Trustees, and stated that Ms Bolton, Ms Atkinson and Mr Webster should be included.   </p>

A more fundamental question is how, particularly if the most recent financial information that the Trustees had gone through was that contained in the August 2014 management accounts, the Trustees could actually conclude that the charity was a going concern. Those accounts projected negative cash flow for the following 12 months. They also showed creditors of around £1.3m, of which around £600,000 were more than three months old (which I will refer to as “aged creditors”). The extent of aged creditors was not outside the range it had been in the preceding few months, which was of the order of between £300,000 and £700,000. (Obviously the mix of aged creditors altered to some extent from month-to-month, as some were paid off and others fell into that category. For example, at the Board meeting on 2 June 2014 Trustees were told that there were no aged creditors from 2013, with the exception of research institutions.) The summary report provided with the management accounts also explained that there were loans outstanding of £1.9m, as compared to £850,000 a year earlier. </p>

The statement carefully reflected the need to secure continuing grant income, the fact that reserves were low (a point discussed further below) and that there were strains on the cash flow. Most importantly, it expressed the Trustees’ confidence, which I am satisfied that they had at the time, that sufficient funds would be secured. Specifically in relation to the projections in the management accounts, Mr Handover confirmed (as did Mr O’Brien) that income was always forecast on a conservative basis.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr O’Brien gave clear evidence that he, like the other Trustees, had not spotted the difference in the figures, but also that he would have been prepared to confirm that Kids Company was a going concern on the basis of the more negative forecast included in the August management accounts. The forecast outturn for 2014 was positive. Cash flow forecasts were prepared on a conservative (worst case) basis to show the maximum scale of the fundraising challenge, and changes in the cost base could have been made during the following year if required to avoid a negative position. The fact that the outturn was forecast to be positive should mean that aged creditors could be paid.  It was the job of the Finance team to manage the details of payments to creditors, although Mr O’Brien made clear in his affidavit that he would go through the aged creditor list with them at each Finance Committee meeting (this is supported, in particular, by the detailed information about aged creditors included in management account packs from the January 2014 management accounts onwards, and by a discussion recorded in the minutes of a Finance Committee meeting on 19 March 2014 in which more detail was requested). And whilst the August management accounts pack also included details of outstanding loans, at that stage there were a relatively small number of loans from very supportive donors to the charity. I accept this, and would add that the summary report in the management accounts stated that, although the deficit was larger than the previous year, “we expect to catch up substantially by October”. I infer that Mr O’Brien approved the accounts on the basis of the forecast and other information in the August management accounts, together with his understanding of other relevant circumstances at the time. </p>

Mr O’Brien asked Ms Hamilton and Mr Mevada to look at the contingency plan to ensure that it was robust, and also requested a zero-based budget for 2015 to be prepared for January (that is, one in which all expenses were justified, rather than starting with a previous budget or expenditure). Mr O’Brien explained in his affidavit that he made this request in light of the fact that the charity was behind budget (albeit by a relatively small amount) and the government had still not made a firm commitment to further funding following the end of the current grant programme in March 2015. However, Mr Mevada is recorded as reporting that the charity would “come to a positive cash flow for year end”, with a £2000 surplus, if all forecast income came in, and as tabling income projections prepared by Ms Batmanghelidjh and the fundraising team to support this (although the forecast outturn in the management accounts was a loss of around £400,000). Loans were also discussed (see [720] below), as was government funding.

Payroll for November had been delayed by one day due to “timing issues”, and the overdraft was now at £100,000. Loans were discussed (£2.2m as at 31 October), including that Mr Roden (who had £700,000 outstanding) was aware of the charity’s need for money and Harvey McGrath (who had £300,000 outstanding) had not set a date for repayment. The minutes report the Board as being “aware of the current financial situation, and are concerned that the situation is not desirable or sustainable”, and that in the absence of new government funding a contingency plan would be put into effect. The final version of the minutes reflected a change from the draft minutes relied on in the Official Receiver’s report. The draft minutes stated that the Board was “comfortable with” rather than “aware of” the current financial situation. Mr O’Brien described this as a testing meeting where he was pointing out the dangers, with the minutes not fully reflecting the tough nature of the discussion. Following the meeting, and as agreed at it, Mr O’Brien produced a draft letter for Mr Yentob to send to the Prime Minister. I accept Mr O’Brien’s evidence that this was effectively a prompt for action to be taken to press the government, rather than that he expected Mr Yentob to send a letter in those terms. As he said in his affidavit, the charity was in a precarious position, and whilst the Trustees did not think that it was on the verge of imminent collapse there was agreement that it was very important to get a final decision from the government. (As discussed at [472] below Mr Yentob did rather better than sending a letter, by securing a meeting at short notice with Mr Letwin.) </p>

I accept his evidence that he did not consider that this warranted an insolvency process but did feel that urgent action was needed (see further [404] below on that point). From her notes of the call this appeared to be Ms Hamilton’s view as well.

However, since it was clear both to Ms Batmanghelidjh and other staff that Mr Kendrick at least had disappeared as a possibility by then, I think it unlikely that Mr Kendrick’s name would have been raised as a donor at that meeting.

The draft letter also refers to the need to be able to show that the charity continued to be financially prudent if it was going to approach the government, and that the Board wanted to meet Ms Batmanghelidjh urgently to explore a number of actions. The list of actions set out included a freeze on recruitment and a rigorous review of headcount “with a view to making real and immediate savings”, revisiting the contingency plan to come up with a detailed plan of action, imposing strict control over costs by requiring that any “financial commitments, whether leases or contracts, research or new requests for assistance” should be subject to prior agreement by the Trustees, and addressing outstanding payments to the self-employed.

I do not agree that it provides evidence of the Trustees not exerting control. First, as Mr O’Brien pointed out, five days had elapsed between the meetings and there had been a significant amount of discussion, including at what Mr O’Brien described as a long meeting on 15 December, of what could practically be done. Secondly, much of the substance remained the same, in particular the recruitment freeze (headcount was roughly on budget at that point so it was an effective freeze) and controls on new financial commitments (I do not agree that there is a substantive difference between the draft letter and the agreed action point in this respect, other than sign off by an individual Trustee rather than Trustees as a whole). There remained a requirement to identify a headcount reduction as part of the contingency plan. Mr O’Brien’s reference in his email dated 28 November to all “payments” being approved by a Trustee was obviously impractical, as in fact Ms Hamilton pointed out, and was not agreed.  </p>

It was reported that a request for the government to bring their January grant payment forward to December was awaiting final approval.

Mr O’Brien’s evidence in cross-examination was that the Finance Committee had good visibility of the accruals at that stage. He did not think he had seen Ms Hamilton’s email of 15 January, but obviously did see the management accounts which were discussed at the meeting. He gained the impression that Ms Hamilton was indicating at the meeting that the charity would end up in the black for 2014.  </p>

Mr Handover also emailed Sian Joseph at the Cabinet Office on 19 March stating that while Kids Company had not finalised its audit “we will end up in the black for 2014”. In an interview with the Official Receiver he recalled his understanding that the audited accounts would show a surplus of around £400,000. On 23 March 2015 Mark Fisher of the Cabinet Office asked for contact details of Kids Company’s auditors “to get their opinion on your 2014 year end accounts as part of our due diligence process”. I infer from this that the auditors were spoken to and sufficient comfort was provided to enable the government’s grant to be released a few days later (see [308] below). </p>

However, it is the case that cash flow was difficult, with the summary report for the December management accounts noting that it was being very tightly managed by increasing creditors and reducing debtors. </p>

It referred to the possibility of closing the Kenbury centre (Arches II) and the Urban Academy (an education centre in Bermondsey for young people not in mainstream education), and concluded by stating that it was hoped that it would not be necessary to implement these plans, but that the Trustees would have no option if they were not able to secure a “short and long term solution to funding”.

The suggested actions included putting in place a “comprehensive and actionable” contingency plan to address a shortfall in funding, reviewing the structure, roles and accountabilities of the CEO and management team, an audit to ensure that funds were being used appropriately and with full transparency, and Trustee approval of external communications. Mr Webster confirmed in crossexamination that the reference to an audit did not mean that there was evidence that funds were being used inappropriately, but rather to assurance being obtained that they were not.

The notes refer to the need to expedite the conversation with the government as quickly as possible, and state that only with government funding could Kids Company provide an assurance that it was solvent. There is also a comment that a statement in the draft minutes of the last meeting (on 26 November 2014) that the Trustees were “comfortable” about the financial situation was not correct; the revised minutes state that they were aware of the financial situation and were concerned that it was neither desirable nor sustainable (see [271] above).

The Board expressly agreed that the then promised government grant of £4.265m (see [439] below) was “insufficient to fund us through 2015”. The current financial position was discussed in some detail, with the Board agreeing that the organisation was under “extreme financial stress”. The position with the bank was discussed, with Ms Batmanghelidjh reporting that she had agreed with the bank that kids related expenditure would be honoured, and Mr Handover commenting that Mr Bufton (a bank employee referred to at [342] below) was making decisions about what payments could be made, and that donations were coming in late. The Board also discussed the potential appointment of a further trustee, whom Mr O’Brien described in cross-examination as a “hard-nosed” turnaround specialist (the Board resolved that this individual should be appointed at its meeting on 31 March, although he did not subsequently take up the role). </p>

Mr Handover responded in broad agreement on the figures, pointing out that with the government funding (the £4.265m) there would be a funding gap of around 30%.

Mr O’Brien pointed out that if there was no sight of income and the contingency plan was not implemented to reduce costs by £6m then his view was that the organisation was insolvent. However, they had agreed that there was a reasonable possibility of avoiding insolvency if actions discussed were taken. He set out options discussed, including closing the Urban Academy and finding a 10% saving across the charity’s divisions, and recorded an agreement by Ms Batmanghelidjh to work up a detailed contingency plan to achieve £6.6m of savings (see further [493] and [496] below in relation to the £6.6m figure). The contingency plan was intended to be activated if the desired government funding was not obtained, or was obtained in a lower amount than required. He also expressed disappointment in an earlier email to Ms Batmanghelidjh about a response she had provided following the meeting, and emphasised the need for a plan to achieve £6.6m of savings, and “hard decisions immediately” in relation to the 10% cut.

Ms Robinson’s email referred to the “perilous” financial situation and to the need for Trustees to face up to their legal responsibilities. The email also referred to an agreement reached two weeks earlier at a meeting at the BBC (the meeting on 12 March) that immediate steps would be taken to reduce expenditure by 10%, adding that nothing appeared to have been done, and that 10% was “not nearly enough if we are to proceed without significant government funding”. Nevertheless, it was a start and an “important acknowledgement internally” of the need to control expenditure. Ms Robinson also asked what the evidence was to support Ms Batmanghelidjh’s assumptions that there would be further funding available, and stated that unless there was a clear indication that there would be additional funding “we must assume the worst and organise ourselves accordingly”. She referred to a need to impose strict controls on all expenditure with immediate effect, as asked for in December (and queried how this could be enforced), and the need to identify someone who could carry out a tough independent review of expenditure and assist in implementing a cost reduction plan. She referred to the pressing problem of head office accommodation, saying she could not see how the Trustees were in a position to sign a lease on County Hall (see [308] below). The email ends with an expression of frustration that “we seem to be going round in circles”, with a lack of control over what was going on and “an acute lack of critical resources i.e. money and people”, with the “slightest suggestion” from any of the Trustees as to how to proceed being rejected.</p>

She described the Trustees’ obligations in a manner that obviously followed the then Charity Commission guidance, in terms of the Trustees’ “ultimate responsibility to manage the charity and to ensure that it is and will remain solvent and that it is well run”. She added that this required a clear plan to be produced to reduce expenditure and deal with the cash shortfall, as had already been agreed. She referred to the fact that Mr Handover and others had already spent a lot of time on the figures, and that whilst the process should be collaborative there was likely to come a point when the Trustees “must be prepared to be prescriptive about what money can and cannot be spent on”. She closed the email by apologising if she was reiterating what had been discussed already. </p>

A later version published in July 2015, also in the trial bundle, contains no reference to solvency, presumably because the Charity Commission recognised that the law does not require trustees to “ensure” solvency. The Official Receiver cross-examined some of the Trustees over their alleged failure to follow the 2012 version of the guidance. Unfortunately, it only became apparent to the court later in the trial that that guidance had been superseded and another version was available. Insofar as the cross-examination appeared to imply that the guidance accurately represented the Charity Commission’s view of the required standard of behaviour (or indeed represented the law), this was not fair.  </p>

Rather, he believed it would survive. He had been considering resigning for some time, given his heavy work commitments and the weight of work involved in being a Trustee (in particular, I would add, with the work he did as chair of the Finance Committee). He delayed his resignation until government funding was secured, as he said, “driven by the desire to do the right thing”. </p>

However, it is clear from the email correspondence that the Trustees were not lulled into a false sense of security by the imminent receipt of the government grant, and recognised that further cost-cutting steps were required, in addition to the (more limited) cuts that had by then already been implemented. The Board minutes refer to a comment by Ms Bolton that it had to be made clearly evident that Kids Company was downsizing, and there is also reference to 90 redundancies already made in the charity’s education provision (albeit that it appears that this was independent of the contingency plan).</p>

A plan involving roughly £3m in cuts was discussed at a Finance Committee meeting on 21 April and shared with the government. Given ongoing discussions with the government about alternative funding sources (in particular the free school programme), the upcoming election and a statement by Harriet Harman about funding for Kids Company (see [499] below) it was at that stage still unclear to what extent cuts would actually be needed. But it was also clear that Ms Batmanghelidjh was resisting cuts, and also still hoped to relocate the head office to County Hall, a relatively expensive choice. </p>

By 12 May it was apparent to the Trustees that there was going to be a struggle to meet the running costs for that month. I accept Ms Bolton’s evidence that the negative press that Kids Company had by then received was a significant contributory factor to the fundraising difficulties experienced at the time (see further below, [516] to [522]). There was a real difference from the position in previous years. Ms Tyler emailed on 14 May, following a Trustee discussion by conference call, with information about the Trustees’ legal duties and to confirm that Hogan Lovells had agreed to give Kids Company pro bono advice. The following day KPMG also agreed to give pro bono advice. The difficulty the Trustees had in ensuring that cuts were implemented is evident from a proposal recorded in an email from Ms Tyler on 15 May that Trustees should be present at head office to monitor the implementation of the agreed cost reductions. Both Ms Tyler and Mr Handover attended at head office for this purpose.</p>

I should clarify that this was reported to the Trustees by Mr Whipp after payroll had been run. Once the Trustees became aware, further payments out of grant money, in particular a payment to HMRC, were stopped. Newsnight publicised the investigation the same evening. Ms Bolton, who met the police to discuss the allegations on 31 July, got the impression that they considered that there was little substance to the allegations but felt compelled to investigate them, particularly in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Also on 31 July the Trustees provisionally concluded that, with the uncertainty caused by the investigation, its likely impact on donations and on the government grant, the restructuring would not be able to proceed and Kids Company would have to close. (A return of the government grant was in fact sought shortly afterwards, but it is now accepted that the amount not used for payroll is an asset in the liquidation.) Kids Company ceased operations on 5 August 2015, the Trustees resolved to present a winding up petition on 11 August, and a winding up order was made on 20 August. </p>

Information obtained by the Official Receiver from HMRC confirms that this was dealt with by telephone conversations and correspondence with Ms Chipperfield, in which Ms Chipperfield referred to contacts that the charity was having with Iain Duncan Smith and David Cameron. A payment proposal was accepted during April, but Kids Company did not keep up-to-date with its normal monthly payments thereafter. This led to another 7 day letter on 12 August 2013 which HMRC also sent or attempted to send direct to at least some Trustees’ personal addresses (presumably taken from Companies House records). This letter referred to an unpaid debt of £726,487, which had accrued between April and July. It cancelled the time to pay arrangements for failure to pay current PAYE on time and refused to accept a revised offer that the charity had put to HMRC to clear the outstanding arrears during August and September, because it did not make any provision to pay the further PAYE that would fall due during those months.

He referred in that correspondence to HMRC not being contacted in advance about the monthly payment due in July (for month 3 of the tax year) being late, although in fact that conflicts with HMRC’s own summary of dealings with Kids Company that it provided to the Official Receiver, which showed that Ms Jenkins had called. It appears that the relevant payment was made shortly afterwards because no further action was taken. The management accounts pack for July 2014, circulated on 21 August, stated that as at 20 August Kids Company was up to date with payments to HMRC.  </p>

I also do not accept her evidence that the Finance team dealt directly with Trustees in relation to HMRC outside formal meetings. For example, there is no indication that any Trustees received the letter HMRC sent in March 2013 at the time it was sent or were involved in discussing or agreeing the payment proposal that followed it. (It is possible that members of the Finance Committee saw the letter at a later date because HMRC correspondence was tabled at a Finance Committee meeting on 18 July 2013, following an action point at the previous meeting on 1 July for HMRC correspondence to be sent to Mr O’Brien. The auditors’ report referred to at [229] above also referred to HMRC correspondence in April 2013 about time to pay arrangements.

My own assessment is that HMRC were indeed patient, but this would not have been based on simple altruism. Final demands were either met, or where they were not I infer that HMRC took the view that the debt was more likely to be paid by allowing the charity to continue to operate, as indeed proved to be the case in respect of all amounts other than the sum left unpaid at the point of liquidation. </p>

On the first point, whilst I understand the utility of loans to address seasonality of income flow, the pattern referred to above is not fully consistent with that. In particular, loans did not drop in the first half of 2014 in the way that might be expected by reference to cash receipts attributable to fundraising in the last part of 2013. The increase during the second half of 2014 is more consistent with seasonality, but there was no similar increase a year earlier. (As explained at [185] above, a significant proportion of Kids Company’s income arose in the last quarter of each year. However this often did not manifest itself as cash receipts until the first part of the following year, a feature that also resulted in accruals in Kids Company’s accounts, as discussed further below.) </p>

As Ms Robinson explained, many of the loans were, and were regarded as, “soft loans” because there was a good prospect that the lender would either choose to convert the loan to a donation, or that he or she would be prepared to leave the loan outstanding rather than press for repayment. So in such cases there was certainly a hope when the loan was taken out that it might be converted to a donation at a later stage, or if not that the lender would not press for repayment if the charity did not have cash available to pay. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">There is force in the Official Receiver’s criticism of increased reliance on loans, especially during 2014, and particularly where sought on an emergency basis. There could be no assurance that a particular loan would be converted to a donation. If it was not, then the loan would need to be repaid from income. However, it is important to take into account the wider context of what was happening at the time, the charity’s overall income position, the identity of the lenders and the total size of the loans as compared to turnover.  </p>

The loans were raised to meet revenue expenditure. In principle, if the charity was at least breaking even then cash reflecting the income should in time be available to pay off the loans. It is worth bearing in mind that the 2014 Budget had specifically contemplated the need for loans: see [235] above. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The loans were also all from supporters. In all but one case they were interest free and, generally, lenders did not push for repayment in the way that a commercial lender would. Of the £2.2m in loans outstanding on 31 October 2014, £200,000 was from two Trustees, £700,000 was from Mr Roden (comprising two loans of £50,000 and £650,000), £300,000 from Harvey McGrath, £200,000 from ICAP and £120,000 from James Lupton. Although Mr Roden’s assistant enquired about repayment in late October 2014 and Mr Roden raised the topic again in December 2014 it is clear that he was not seriously pressing for repayment, and subsequently extended the loans. Similarly, the Trustees were satisfied that Harvey McGrath was highly supportive and would be very accommodating. Mr Lupton was clearly a supporter (see [465] below) who also told Ms Batmanghelidjh on 29 September not to worry about making repayment and indicated that he might “do a deal” on it, which I read as indicating a willingness to consider conversion. Although ICAP did request repayment, they clearly did not press strongly, and in fact later made a donation (see [597] below).  </p>

Loans did not at any point exceed around 10% of annual turnover, and were generally lower (for example, around 3% of turnover as at 31 December 2013). The £2.5m figure discussed at the 10 November meeting was the peak. Thereafter, controls were put on further loans. </p>

However, she was certainly in that role during 2014, and Mr Mevada referred to her in his Official Receiver interview as the charity’s last fundraising director. It is highly likely that she had at least some role in the production of income projections: this is consistent with the fact that it was Ms Caldwell with whom Mr O’Brien chose to check the information he was given by Ms Hamilton on 27 or 28 November 2014 (see [394] below). A number of the Trustees knew Ms Caldwell well and were used to dealing with her. If there had been fundamental concerns before late 2014 they might reasonably have expected her to raise them. For example, she was present at Mr Webster’s first two Board meetings in January and March 2014 at which income spreadsheets were discussed, and he did not recall her challenging or contradicting what Ms Batmanghelidjh said.  </p>

She also confirmed in cross-examination that Mr O’Brien would ask in Finance Committee meetings whether the Finance team felt comfortable with the income being forecast. Her evidence was that Mr Mevada would provide the confirmation, which she did not contradict.

Ms Batmanghelidjh would be accompanied by Ms Lloyd who would contribute to the discussion. The level of detailed discussion, including about the probability of individual sums coming in, was consistent with Ms Tyler’s affidavit evidence.

Up until 2014, Ms Batmanghelidjh’s income projections appear to have been generally broadly accurate in terms of the overall amount actually raised for the year. Clearly, serious problems arose in late 2014 which were alerted by Ms Hamilton to Mr O’Brien. But until that occurred the Trustees were justified, based on past experience of Ms Batmanghelidjh’s fundraising capabilities, in taking comfort from the sum projected to be raised for the year in question. I also accept that the projections were subject to real scrutiny in Trustee meetings.  </p>

It was the case that income projections included amounts that Ms Batmanghelidjh hoped to receive but about which there was no confidence. The three projected donations flagged up by Ms Hamilton in late November 2014 appear to be extreme examples of this, namely Mr Kendrick, Comic Relief and the Moshiris. The position of Mr Kendrick is discussed at [663] to [668] below. As regards Comic Relief, Mr Webster attended a meeting with Ms Batmanghelidjh on 20 November 2014 at which an extra £1 million was requested. Mr Webster took away from the meeting that Comic Relief were unlikely to approve that sum but they could donate a lower amount. Nevertheless a figure of £1 million appears to have been included in the income projections discussed the following day, on 21 November. (In fact it seems that the actual figure received was of the order of £200,000, and that represented a bringing forward of an amount that would otherwise have been paid in 2015.) The Moshiris did not materialise as donors. </p>

I am satisfied that the Trustees were not aware of, and did not have cause to doubt, the correctness of the accruals. They relied, and in my view were entitled to rely, on the expertise of the Finance team and the auditors. (I should add that the same applies to an allegation in the Official Receiver’s report that there was an error in the 2013 loans figure due to a loan from Harvey McGrath being recorded as a donation that year, when there is evidence to suggest that the loan was in fact converted the following year.) In relation to Ms Bolton, I also note that the Official Receiver had accepted, in response to Part 18 requests made by her advisers, that it was not his case that she knew or ought to have known about the alleged errors. </p>

For example, at a Finance Committee meeting on 28 January 2015, Mr O’Brien asked whether the auditors were comfortable with the level of accruals for 2014 and Ms Hamilton was asked to circulate guidance on accruals. Mr O’Brien also made it clear that including amounts as accruals was dependent on the correct evidence being in place to satisfy the auditors. A year earlier, the minutes of a Trustee meeting dated 30 January 2014 also referred to £4 million being accrued “with appropriate supporting documentation for audit purposes”, and there was a similar reference in the minutes of a Finance Committee meeting on the previous day. In the absence of reason to doubt whether the appropriate evidence was provided, or whether the auditors were in fact doing a competent job, I do not accept the suggestion that the Trustees should have made additional enquiries, for example checking the evidence themselves to determine whether it was sufficient to satisfy the accounting test. </p>

In cash flow terms it may do so if the expected cash inflow corresponding to the accrual cannot be matched with the dates when obligations to creditors should be met. The problem can be exacerbated if accruals are increasing year-on-year as a proportion of turnover and if turnover (and expenditure) is also increasing, as was the case here between 2010 and 2013.

The concerns related to whether particular fundraising had in fact been secured. This was something that Ms Batmanghelidjh knew more about than anyone else in the organisation, at least as regards the most substantial amounts. As CEO, she had an executive responsibility for the charity’s finances which would in principle have required her to ensure that accurate and complete information was being presented not only to the Board but to the auditors, including making any appropriate enquiries of staff or advisers. As discussed from [634] below I do not accept that it was appropriate simply to leave all matters other than actual fundraising to the Finance team and Finance Committee, and in fact Ms Batmanghelidjh did not do so. Given the increasing significance of accruals, it would have been preferable for Ms Batmanghelidjh to ensure that she had a broad understanding of what the accounting requirements were. </p>

However, it is the case that Ms Batmanghelidjh at least gave the impression of seeking to dissuade the senior managers from doing so outside formal Board and Board committee meetings. Whilst this could be interpreted as an encouragement to use proper reporting lines so as to ensure that Trustees were fully and correctly briefed, I think it was not unreasonably interpreted by the senior managers as being rather more than that. That interpretation is consistent with Ms Batmanghelidjh’s optimistic approach and her strong encouragement of an ethos that focused on the positives. In any event, and not unreasonably, she certainly expected the staff to help in providing solutions to problems rather than simply raising concerns.  </p>

Ms Hamilton also raised growing concerns on the part of staff about a lack of control of costs, and in particular Ms Batmanghelidjh continuing to enter into contractual commitments despite attempts to put controls in place, and concerns about the self-employed. Mr O’Brien had an email exchange with Ms Caldwell following this call, on 28 November, to check what had happened in relation to Mr Kendrick, Comic Relief and the Moshiris, in which she confirmed that Mr Kendrick had declined, Comic Relief had also declined but would bring forward the grant for next year, and that they were waiting on the Moshiris.  </p>

The timeline suggests that Ms Caldwell expressed concern about the finances, Ms Batmanghelidjh’s mental and physical health, and (in the call) that she was refusing to discuss issues and was “bullying directors”, that she had turned down funding because it was interfering with her plan to get government money, that her spending was out of control and was bypassing Ms Hamilton, with the charity getting closer to bankruptcy “each day they wait”, and that trustee support was needed for proper contingency plans, which would not work unless Ms Batmanghelidjh contributed to them. In contrast, the earlier version of the timeline I saw has entries limited to Ms Caldwell raising the subject of unlawful trading on the call, and financial concerns at the Coldplay event.

Among other things he noted significant delays in paying self-employed and other creditors, stated that the only way payroll had been made for several months was by “bringing donations forward from 2015 and by borrowing money”, that the recent inability to meet payroll on time was a “wake up call to deal with fundamental issues”, that issues were being raised by funders and that there would need to be a significant reduction in staff numbers for Kids Company to survive. He also referred to Mr Webster being aware that “raising these issues is difficult”, and that to be told that if he could not take the level of risk he should leave was unacceptable. He mentioned that “potential detrimental treatment of staff” in connection with expressing concerns to Trustees could lead to lengthy litigation. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Webster accepted that the 9 December email properly set out Mr Stones’ concerns as he saw them. However, the Trustees were already well aware of the acute financial position and were responding to it. The position of the selfemployed, for example, was as already mentioned covered at the 10 December meeting. Mr Webster pointed out that he had a coaching relationship with Mr Stones and the emails needed to be seen in that context. I accept that this is relevant. The email states that Mr Stones thought that Mr Webster would already be aware of the issues he was raising, but that he thought it might be helpful to hear the HR perspective, and said “I write from my own perspective and personally to you for your advice”. This is also consistent with the email being sent from Mr Stones’ private email address rather than his Kids Company one. The email does flag up the point that Mr Stones found it difficult to raise issues with Ms Batmanghelidjh, but Mr Webster already knew that (it was why coaching and mentoring had been arranged: see [430] below). The whistleblowing issue is properly raised as an HR issue, but the email does not suggest that there had been any instance of detrimental treatment. I also accept Mr Webster’s evidence that he did not ignore this email, and telephoned Mr Stones in response. Mr Stones did not accept this in cross-examination (having initially appeared to), but given his more general acceptance that Mr Webster would be acting out of character in not responding to emails and the fact that there is no indication of Mr Stones chasing for a response or checking that such an important email had been received, I think it is more likely than not that Mr Stones’ recollection is at fault. </p>

I accept Mr O’Brien’s evidence that they also spoke on a number of occasions during the few days leading up to the Board meeting that was fixed for 10 December, and that he had reassured Ms Hamilton that he was taking the matter seriously. Mr O’Brien did not consider it necessary to take up her suggestion of contacting an insolvency practitioner because his assessment was that, with the level of support it had, the charity was not in a position of needing to enter into an insolvency process. It was a concern that income was not coming in close to the year end, and it was therefore necessary to take action both in relation to income and costs and do contingency planning work, but it was too early to talk to an insolvency practitioner. He also made the point in his affidavit that his duty as a Trustee was to discuss the concerns raised by Ms Hamilton with the other Trustees and make a (collective) informed decision about how to respond, and noted that unilateral action by him to call an insolvency practitioner could have been highly damaging to the charity reputationally if it emerged, as well as potentially involving significant cost.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>This cannot be described as an unreasonable approach. Mr O’Brien is highly experienced, including in relation to companies that are in financial distress. He has a good knowledge of insolvency.

These notes support Mr O’Brien’s evidence that he was taking the issues raised by her seriously. They also discussed some specific issues such as leases and a cash float the charity held with the Abbey National, and more generally increased cash flow problems. On 9 December they discussed the management accounts, including the level of accruals and cash flow issues. </p>

Mr Handover gave a similar response: Ms Batmanghelidjh was saying that she wanted concerns to be raised with her directly. I accept that this was their understanding of the email. I do not read the email as saying that no concerns could be raised by staff with Trustees, but it is the case that Ms Batmanghelidjh was signalling against direct discussions between staff and Trustees without involving her. This was Ms Bolton’s reading of it, which Mr O’Brien broadly agreed in cross-examination. Ms Batmanghelidjh was communicating that she wished to be made aware of any concerns raised by staff and directly involved in discussing them, rather than there being ongoing dialogue about them between Trustees and staff in which she was not involved. </p>

Mr Handover’s evidence about proper channels is consistent with Mr O’Brien’s response to Ms Hamilton’s email of 15 December just referred to, and with Ms Robinson’s evidence that she had expressed the view to Mr O’Brien that the Finance Committee was the proper forum for such issues to be raised.

There are longer notes of the meeting in the versions I saw of the joint timeline, which were prepared over six months later. Neither Mr Handover nor Ms Robinson took notes of the meeting. The fact that they did not do so was the subject of challenge by Ms Anderson. I do not find the absence of a note surprising. It was an informal meeting, held around a low coffee table in a public area of a hotel, intended to ascertain what the employees’ concerns were. It was not a formal meeting dealing, for example, with a complaint or grievance: none had been received. All four had had significant dealings in the past.

Starting the meeting with an accusation that the two staff members were causing trouble would have been quite inconsistent with the aim of the meeting, namely to discover their concerns in an informal setting. If the aim was in some way to discipline staff or “get them into line” then this would be unlikely to have been done in what seems to have been the foyer of a hotel.  It would much more naturally have been done at the company’s premises, and indeed is something that the Trustees would no doubt have expected Ms Batmanghelidjh to address in the first instance. So I do not accept that allegation. Having heard lengthy oral evidence from Ms Robinson and Mr Handover I also have no doubt that they would not have adopted references to “splitting” or “verge of greatness” (which is terminology that Ms Batmanghelidjh, not they, would have used), and certainly would not have said that there was no problem with the finances. I also accept Ms Robinson’s evidence that Ms Caldwell and Mr Stones were neither forceful in their approach, and nor did they say that cash flow documents being sent to the bank were inaccurate. </p>

I accept Mr Handover’s evidence that he did not describe her as a trouble maker. The Cabinet Office request that seems to be being referred to was part of a chain of emails forwarded by Ms Hamilton to Mr Stones on 16 December (not obviously for business reasons in connection with his HR role) and appears to have been dealt with by Ms Batmanghelidjh rather than the Trustees. In his affidavit Mr O’Brien recalled Mr Handover being annoyed with Ms Hamilton for unilaterally offering a document confirming that the charity would be solvent over the first quarter of  2015 in a meeting with the Cabinet Office without first consulting the Trustees. Such annoyance would have been justified and would be a rational explanation for Mr Stones’ recollection from the meeting, albeit that the cause of the concern would have been different from the one identified by him. However, Mr Handover did not give evidence to that effect and Mr O’Brien’s recollection does not obviously fit with the email correspondence. Doing the best I can with the evidence, I think it inherently unlikely that Mr Handover would consider that Ms Hamilton was somehow causing trouble for highlighting, or expecting the Trustees to take responsibility for, issues of solvency. They knew they had responsibility. The more likely issue, if there was one, would have related to </p>

They subsequently spoke. I accept Mr Handover’s evidence that he wanted to explain that they had addressed the issue with the former headteacher. He also tried to persuade her not to leave. I do not accept much of what the joint timeline records of this conversation, which includes reference to Mr Handover asking whether Ms Caldwell thought Ms Batmanghelidjh was in “self sabotage” mode. That is not an expression that Mr Handover would use. </p>

If Mr Handover or Ms Robinson had understood that there was, in effect, a whistleblowing allegation against Ms Batmanghelidjh then I am satisfied that they would have treated it with the seriousness that it would have deserved.</p>

However, it is outweighed by the fact that what the Trustees are recorded as saying is simply inconsistent with the purpose of the meeting and its setting, and with my assessment of Ms Robinson and Mr Handover.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In contrast to the tone of Mr Stones’ resignation email, there were some strongly worded emails from Ms Caldwell. These included an email to Ms Batmanghelidjh on 28 January stating that the charity could not meet its liabilities and was wrongfully trading, and that Ms Batmanghelidjh expected her to “conceal all this from the Trustees”. She also raised other allegations about Ms Batmanghelidjh. This email was seen by at least Mr Handover and Mr Webster, who concluded that there had been an irretrievable breakdown in the personal relationship between Ms Caldwell and Ms Batmanghelidjh, and that the email was written by a lawyer and amounted to a constructive dismissal claim. In the absence of evidence from Ms Caldwell, and bearing in mind that Ms Batmanghelidjh strongly disagreed with the subsequent decision of the Trustees to settle Ms Caldwell’s claim, I can place very little weight on the allegations contained in the email, on which Ms Batmanghelidjh was not cross-examined. The view that there had been an irretrievable breakdown is evidenced by an email that Mr Handover sent to inform Board members about the resignations on 30 January, which was drafted for him by Mr Webster. This referred to an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship between Ms Caldwell and Ms Batmanghelidjh. </p>

She referred to the 2014 accounts showing a large loss, which would not give funders confidence until evidence of accruals was presented. She referred to the need for a robust turnaround plan and stated that she had not been involved in the “recent contingency planning process” so could not comment on future plans. She included a schedule listing a number of suggestions for improvement, which Ms Batmanghelidjh had requested. The email is consistent with Mr Handover’s recollection of being told by Ms Hamilton when she saw him at Kids Company’s head office that she was resigning because of the pressure and stress of working at the charity.  </p>

The statement was supportive. It explained that the directors fully supported the work of the charity and had left due to high levels of stress, referring to the challenging environments in which the charity worked as already placing “enormous stress on the staff without the onerous addition of financial uncertainty”.

His annotations to the note make clear that his staff-related questions were addressed. This also supports the conclusion that the Trustees, having appropriately turned their minds to the matter, did not understand that there was a whistleblowing allegation in relation to Ms Batmanghelidjh that needed to be addressed. I also note that Mr Webster provided a further update on discussions with Ms Caldwell and Mr Stones at the informal Board meeting on 12 March 2015 referred to at [297] above.  </p>

It records that Kids Company received at least £42 million in central government grants, and at least £4 million from other public sector sources such as local authorities, lottery bodies and schools that commissioned Kids Company to provide services. In addition it received other help, including HMRC writing off nearly £600,000 of tax debts in 2003. At least seven central government departments had contributed to grants between 2000 and 2015. The principal contributor was the Department for Education (“DfE”) and its predecessors, which provided £28 million, but other departments, led by the Cabinet Office, made significant contributions between 2013 and 2015. </p>

In 2013 the DfE rejected a bid for a £9 million grant under a different grant programme, but it prepared a “Public Interest Case” in February 2013 that recommended a continuation of support.

(It is worth clarifying that references to years in this format are to the government’s financial years, that is 1 April to 31 March, and further that the initial grant awarded was in fact £4 million, but as discussed below this was relatively quickly increased to £4.5 million.) The NAO report comments that Kids Company’s bid for another DfE grant for 2015/16 was rejected. It was instead awarded further cross-government funding of £4.265 million for 2015/16, which was confirmed by Ministers in December 2014, formally awarded in March 2015 and paid in full in April. The report states that this was the first grant award to include conditions relating to financial management and governance, including the production of a detailed contingency plan and the creation and implementation of an action plan to better match revenue and expenditure. The final payment of £3 million of emergency funding in July 2015 was made following a Ministerial direction, officials having advised Ministers that a further grant did not represent value for money. </p>

This would result in Ministers asking officials to review options for funding, and officials awarding grants either through a wider grant programme, or from 2013/14 onwards as a direct grant award. Grants were made despite concerns being expressed by officials about the charity’s cash flow and financial sustainability, such concerns being expressed as early as 2002. However, the report notes that no Ministerial direction was sought before June 2015, and prior to that officials accepted Kids Company’s assertions that it would become insolvent without grant funding. Furthermore, the government agreed that the charity was providing a valuable local service to some of the most disadvantaged and hard to reach young people, and that other organisations could learn lessons from the services it provided and its approach to young people with multiple problems, including mental health issues and the risk of involvement in gun and </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">A theme of Ms Batmanghelidjh’s evidence was that in her experience verbal communications often had a more positive tone than Ministers were prepared to commit to writing. I accept that there was some basis to conclude that assistance could be made available in circumstances where the written communications would suggest otherwise. A good example is the acceleration of the grant payment in December 2014, when Kids Company had been told that the similar acceleration the year before was a one off (see [450] below). Others include the provision of emergency funding in July 2015 despite being told in the formal grant offer on 31 March 2015 that the £4.265 million awarded was “the only funding you will receive from the Cabinet Office in 2015/16”, and the clear understanding that the grant for 2015/16 could be spent immediately, despite its apparent purpose.  </p>

This was written in response to a letter in which Ms Batmanghelidjh asked for different departments to be brought together so that the government could look holistically at the problems faced by Kids Company. The Prime Minister stressed how much the charity’s work was valued and explained that he was asking that a senior official from the DfE convene a discussion with senior colleagues from other Departments to explore opportunities to identify possible paths to funding. The Public Interest Case prepared in February 2013 (see [438] above) and the two year grant that followed it were, I infer, linked to this. The formal grant offer was made on 1 July 2013. </p>

Ms Batmanghelidjh was very direct about the scale of the problems that Kids Company was dealing with and its financial needs. They elicited an immediate agreement to the grant of an additional £500,000 in the short term, and discussed the need for long-term government funding. Ms Robinson’s impression was that the meeting, with what she understood to be one of Mr Cameron’s chief advisers, was a very positive step forward, with Ms Trott making “all the right noises”. It was clear from the discussion that there was a lot of interest in what Kids Company was doing, and in the potential for replicating it. </p>

This is recorded in minutes of the Board meeting on 23 September 2013, together with a comment that Nick Hurd was looking at “substantial” additional funding. Mr Hurd’s involvement is also reflected in an email that Ms Batmanghelidjh sent to the then trustees (including Ms Robinson) on 8 September in which she reported on the meeting and said that she had since had a communication from Mr Hurd that the £500,000 was “the beginning” and that “after that they want to find us sustainable funding”.

Ms Batmanghelidjh followed up the meeting with a letter to Mr Letwin. The letter, dated 14 July, refers to the fact that the government had placed two full-time civil servants with the charity to identify sources of statutory funding, but they had left after a year without being able to do so. The charity had been kept going by fundraising but “this model is no longer tenable as we are past proof of concept, and now the business world expects us to be absorbed by mainstream”. </p>

The letter continues by referring to an agreement by Mr Letwin to speak to the team within the Cabinet Office about the then current grant, which was going to run out in March 2015, such that the charity would not need to engage in a redundancy process. </p>

Mr Letwin said that he knew that Kids Company did not want to be fully financed by the government, so retaining its autonomy and flexibility, and understood that it needed approximately £20 million, asking if the remainder could be fundraised by the charity (to which the answer was yes). Mr Letwin also said that he wanted to support the charity, was not a budget holder and would need to speak to other people during the summer recess, looking at central government funds but also at the Troubled Families programme. He commented that the money Kids Company wanted was a drop in the ocean compared to that programme budget. He said that he did not want the charity to close any centres. It would be problematic to create a fund just for Kids Company, so it would be a fund to which the charity could apply. The free schools initiative was also discussed in relation to parts of Kids Company’s activities. Ms Robinson described it as being “as positive a meeting as you could expect without him actually promising that he would get us the money”. I accept this evidence.  </p>

Her evidence was to the effect that, based on her prior knowledge of Mr Letwin and what she said was a similar experience with him in 2011, he was communicating to her that Kids Company would get the money, albeit that due process would need to be seen to be observed. That this was Ms Batmanghelidjh’s view broadly accords with the way in which she reported back to the Trustees by email on 19 July, stating Mr Letwin’s view that the charity “should” have £20 million, that he was going to “make this happen” from the following April, and that Ms Batmanghelidjh was “pretty sure” they would get the money given the upcoming election. </p>

For example, Mr Yentob fully accepted that Mr Letwin had not promised £20m, and indeed made that clear to a journalist in 2015 when Ms Batmanghelidjh suggested otherwise. Furthermore, it was not assumed that the assistance provided would turn out to be as great as £20m. However, there was a view that there was a strong prospect of material additional help. Ms Bolton, for example, thought that £10m was realistic and a higher number certainly possible. Mr Handover was hopeful of obtaining a large proportion, perhaps as high as £16-18m. Ms Tyler thought that £10m was realistic. Mr O’Brien, whose tendency was to be “healthily sceptical” and focus on the worst case, also thought that £10m might be realistic. My assessment is that, overall, the Trustees’ assessments of the position at the time was not unreasonable.  </p>

This email stated that Ms Batmanghelidjh could not raise more money and was even struggling to make it to the end of the year, with the lack of certainty about government funding making it worse, and reiterated the need for certainty of substantial funding as soon as possible. This email was forwarded by Ms Batmanghelidjh to Chris Grayling, the then Secretary of State for Justice. The forwarding email stated that it seemed that some of the thinking was to provide the current level of funding for a year and then require the charity to come back to the table again. It included a statement that it was Mr Letwin who suggested that the charity should get £20 million, but that Ms Batmanghelidjh was “now being told they’re talking about £4 million”, which was not sustainable. Mr Grayling responded on 17 November that he would speak to Mr Letwin. </p>

Information from Cabinet Office sources also indicates that Ms Batmanghelidjh had had email exchanges with him in June 2014 following a meeting which apparently took place at Kids Company premises.

In the light of the correspondence I do not fully accept her oral evidence that until December 2014 she thought that the charity was on track to receive £20m. The indications she was receiving – albeit indications that she was challenging – were that it might well not be forthcoming for 2015/16, although higher funding might be available subsequently. It is not apparent, however, that the Trustees were told about the £4m figure or saw the correspondence with Mr Grayling at the time. They did see the letter of 24 October after it was sent. </p>

I conclude that at that stage the Trustees were still optimistic that the government would agree to provide a substantially higher level of funding than it had previously, and that based on their understanding of the discussions with government it was not unreasonable to take that view. The precise number was of course unclear, but it was obviously accepted that it would not be as high as £20m. Following the meeting, Mr O’Brien prepared a draft letter to the Prime Minister to be sent by Mr Yentob. The draft was overtaken by events but is relevant as indicating the Trustees’ thinking at the time. It refers to the fundraising challenge, stating that as demands for the charity’s services increased “it becomes ever harder to raise the required donations”. It states that conversations with Ministers about “getting the charity on a sound financial footing” had resulted in “a number of reassuring statements” but nothing firm being offered, and refers to it being unclear which department or Minister could make a real commitment. This was resulting in a “precarious financial situation”. The letter concludes by asking for time for the Trustees to make a presentation of why they believed that a permanent source of funding was critical, and how it would help the government by enabling Kids Company to replicate its successful model. </p>

This was arranged for 22 December. It was attended by Mr Handover, Mr Yentob, Mr Letwin and Ms Trott, and possibly by Mr Oliver. I accept Mr Handover’s evidence that at that stage they were asking for £11m to £12m a year, which was broadly in line with Mr Yentob’s evidence, which referred to £12m a year. Mr Letwin said that the government did not want Kids Company to close, it recognised the great job being done, that the next grant from the Cabinet Office would be the last from that source (because the Prime Minister could not be seen to be favouring Kids Company) but the government would find a way to fund Kids Company going forwards by other means. He suggested the Troubled Families and free schools programmes. He was, according to Mr Yentob, deeply apologetic that the position had not been resolved to date, and made it clear that work would start in earnest early in the new year and that the government did not want Kids Company closing centres without alternatives (such as a free school structure) being found. Mr Handover said that either at this or a meeting in January Mr Letwin described the money needed as equivalent to a rounding error. I accept this evidence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The Official Receiver sought to dismiss the handwritten postscript to Mr Letwin’s letter as “non-committal verbiage” which (presumably) the defendants should have ignored. This was a rather astonishing claim. The letter was written by a politician at the heart of government. It puts the reference in the body of the letter to asking officials to work collaboratively in a context that, overall (and taking account of the discussion at the meeting), sent a signal that the government was seeking to be supportive in establishing a sustainable way forward, rather than simply leaving the charity without support. Whilst a possible reading of “sustainable” meant the charity cutting costs so that it could manage without further public funding, or at least increased funding beyond around £4m a year, that is not the way in which Trustees understood it at that time in the context of the discussions that were ongoing, and I do not think that it was unreasonable of them to take that view. Mr Letwin referred in his letter to the “services you provide”. There is no hint there that he meant a radically scaled back operation or, for example, one that provided a very different type of service. Mr Handover explained that he understood “sustainable” to mean sustainable funding on a regular basis, rather than dependence on ad hoc grants. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">However, it is the case that the postscript specifically refers to 2016/17 onwards, rather than indicating that additional funding could be made available as early as 2015/16.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Yentob explained in his oral evidence that he thought that the events of 22 December were a turning point. Until that point the funding level for 2015/16 was not agreed, and the Trustees had been seeking a substantially higher figure than around £4m for that financial year as well as subsequently. The Prime Minister was also saying that he could not continue to make a special funding arrangement as had been done in the past. However, there was a clear signal of a willingness to work hard to find other means of funding Kids Company, and start proper discussions on that, which so far had been delayed. I accept this and also accept Mr Yentob’s evidence that he did not understand Mr Letwin to be saying that what would be found from other sources in 2016/17 and beyond was limited to a grant at a similar level, because Mr Letwin knew that the charity needed more substantial funding. Mr Yentob also clearly hoped that, despite the reference to 2016/17 onwards, some interim funding could be found.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The Official Receiver challenged the evidence of Mr Yentob and Mr Handover, arguing that at most the signals from government could be interpreted as taking steps to find further funds from other existing statutory sources during the course of 2015/16, with any funding actually being put in place only from the following financial year. In particular, Ms Anderson referred Mr Yentob to an email sent by Ms Batmanghelidjh to Mr Roden on 31 December 2014 which referred to the government having come back and said they were going to give £4m this year and “make sure we’re properly funded from 2016/2017”. (A similar point was made in an email she sent to some of the Trustees on 6 January 2015, discussed at [590] below, chafing at controls on expenditure, which said that her understanding of the meeting that Mr Handover and Mr Yentob had had in December was that the government had requested them not to shut services and that the charity would be able to access “funding that’s appropriate from 2016”.) Ms Anderson also relied in submissions on the reference to 2016/17 in the letter of 22 March referred to at [479] above. </p>

Mr Yentob’s sense was that Mr Letwin was going to find some further means of funding to allow Kids Company time to restructure and transition to its next stage. However, as I understood his evidence, he sought to manage Ms Batmanghelidjh’s expectations. That would be understandable, although I note that by 23 January she was referring in an email to additional government funding of £6.75m for 2015, and to the need to close centres if it was not achieved. At the Finance Committee meeting on 28 January she also expressed some confidence, in particular in relation to the ability she thought she would have to obtain government assistance to the costs of a redundancy programme if cuts had to be implemented, given that the lack of notice from the government had impacted on the charity’s ability to plan for such a programme. </p>

He did not read it as limited to funding at around the £4m level. He also said in his affidavit that the £6.75m figure just referred to was at the time thought by the Trustees to be a reasonable figure in light of the reassurances from government.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Nevertheless, he preferred to start looking to cut costs at once in the absence of additional confirmed funding for 2015/16.

I also do not think that it would have been unreasonable to conclude that there was a real prospect of further support being found during the transition period if it was necessary. This gains support from Mr Yentob’s evidence about the meeting of 18 February 2015 and the draft email that followed it (see [488] and [489] below). There would be no point in putting a longer term package in place if the charity could not survive in the interim. Furthermore, and as discussed at [617] below, in order to make a sensible decision about where any radical cuts should be made the Trustees would first want to understand what the future plan was. As already stated, I also consider that the Trustees could reasonably have taken the view that references to “sustainable” funding meant funding at a materially higher level than previously. </p>

It was explained to Ms Stroud that a decision was needed so that the Trustees could decide whether to implement contingency plans, and that there was a gap between the agreed funding of £4.265m and the £11/12m being requested.

There was also a discussion about payment of the agreed £4.265m grant being made in one lump sum. Mr Yentob’s affidavit stated that Mr Letwin and others were still optimistic about additional money being found in that calendar year (which he clarified in oral evidence probably meant the financial year 2015/16) other than by direct grant from the Cabinet Office, and referred to possible access to funding from the mental health budget.

A list of actions sent after the meeting by Mr Letwin’s Private Secretary included that the Cabinet Office would provide details of other sources of funding, Kids Company would provide additional information about certain of its activities, and meetings would be arranged in relation to the Troubled Families programme and to discuss the practicalities of moving to free school status. The final point on the list is “ensure a regular series of progress monitoring meetings”.</p>

It states that there had been a constructive conversation with Mr Letwin, and that although the government had not declared its final position the Trustees believed that “some funding for 2015” would be secured, albeit at the “lower end of our expectations”. This is clearly a reference to funding in addition to the already agreed £4.265m. </p>

This view is likely to have reflected the lack of progress with government and also the seriously negative press that had by then started, and its impact on donations (see [522] below). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">A key indication of the less promising tone is provided by an email from Mr Fisher to Mr Yentob on 2 March containing draft text for a formal communication which would refer to “helping an orderly transition for Kids Company from its unusual dependence on public funds, to put the organisation on a more sustainable footing, and to improve the way it interfaces with public bodies in the areas in which it operates”. The text refers to dealing with specific cases of children let down by local authorities, assisting conversion of part of the operation to a free school, and discussion to see if any of the children helped by Kids Company could be given assistance through the Troubled Families programme (although, more positively, it also refers in more general terms to supporting the proposal to “integrate” the charity’s activities into the Troubled Families programme). It also refers to assisting with an “end-to-end business review” of the charity’s operation and “rebuilding the Kids Co operating model”. It refers to confirmation being required that there would be no further request for monies during 2015/16, although it does qualify this by adding that information would be provided on “potential sources of funding from various programmes that might be available”. I note that that comment provides some support for the conclusion that the possibility of additional support during 2015/16 had not been ruled out. (It is worth noting that the Board meeting referred to at [295] above was held the same day, after this email was received. It is clear that the negative tone was picked up by the Trustees.) </p>

The covering letter reiterated Mr Fisher’s “personal commitment, and that of my team, to you and the Trustees to support the incredible work of Kids Company”.  Further discussions ensued about ensuring that the full grant was released in April (which Kids Company thought was agreed at a meeting on 17 March), as well as about free schools, Troubled Families and possible funding from the mental health programme. During the discussions, on 11 March, Mr Yentob provided a financial projection showing an estimated £6.6m shortfall for the year. Although Mr Yentob’s email refers to this figure as being consistent with the view “we have communicated since the middle of last year” I think there is a more accurate reference to the timing in the email he forwarded which attached the projection. This was an email from Mr Handover which stated that it was the number communicated to government “during the last six months or so”, and also stated that there was a contingency plan to address the shortfall. In any event what is clear, and was confirmed by Mr O’Brien in cross-examination, is that (allowing for rounding) £6.6m represents the difference between the agreed grant of £4.265m and the £11m that Kids Company had been saying that it required. </p>

This was confirmed by an email from Mr Fisher sent on the same day, suggesting a meeting in a fortnight to discuss next steps. It is clear from this and from the earlier correspondence that the Cabinet Office did not regard its work as complete with payment of the grant. This is also reflected in the minutes of the Board meeting on 31 March, where Mr Oliver is reported as having informed Mr Yentob that a meeting would take place with Kids Company “top of the agenda”. However, the Trustees also recognised that they could not sit back: Mr Yentob’s email, for example, refers to the need to make as much progress as possible over the following few weeks with the charity’s own cost-cutting and contingency plans, whilst simultaneously putting vigorous pressure on the government to address replacement funding.  </p>

During May Mr Roden and Mr Frieda became increasingly involved (see [312] above), and an additional £3m of funding was ultimately procured (see [313] above).  </p>

The reference to the process for approval of business planning decisions, and a reference to the annual “Can-do” document being approved by the Board (as to which see [702] below), were also challenged at trial, effectively on the basis that PKF had been given the wrong impression (a point not raised in the Official Receiver’s reports).

The slightly negative comments recorded at the Governance Committee reflect disappointment that the report was not even more positive than it was, rather than a view that it was a negative report. The main difficulties identified in the report, in particular regarding cash flow, HMRC, the absence of reserves and the Bristol related risk, were well known and the Trustees did not need to be told about them. They knew that improvements were needed, particularly in the charity’s funding position and financial management. The report did not identify significant issues that they did not already have well in mind, and I do not consider that it was negative overall. It does not, to me, describe a failing organisation that was poorly run, but rather one with significant cash flow issues that were taking a lot of work to manage. Subject to that point, it is pretty positive, especially about governance, accounting and controls.

He claimed that the funding model was ad hoc, often reactive to crises, dependent on Ms Batmanghelidjh’s central role and reliant on a small pool of high net worth individuals and connected trusts or foundations. </p>

When asked whether there was a difficulty in continuing to rely on private donations in March 2014, he said that there was not and pointed out that there was a mix of corporate, government and private funding. Ms Robinson emphasised the context in which Mr Handover made his comment about donations not increasing indefinitely, which was that in 2012 and 2013 the charity was being encouraged by government and local authorities to expand and replicate. Her evidence was that in 2013 the charity was very confident about increasing donations from private individuals, and they in fact continued to increase. For example, the gala dinner in 2014 was the most successful ever. </p>

Excluding gifts in kind (of £1.3m), donations from individuals increased by around 50% between 2012 and 2013, from about £3.2m to £4.9m. Corporate donations were reasonably stable at around £2m, and donations from trusts and foundations increased from about £5.8m to £6.6m. Total voluntary income was £14.8m as compared to income from central government, local authorities and schools of £6.1m. Ms Robinson estimated that of total revenue high net worth individuals contributed a little less than 30% (this would include some of the gifts categorised as being from trusts and foundations).  </p>

The former listed 187 major donors (of which only 45 were major donors in 2011) and the latter 208, of which only 74 were major donors in 2012. I take the Official Receiver’s point that “major donor” is not defined and the individual donations are not set out, but the information in the accounts is neither indicative of donor fatigue nor reliance on a small pool of donors which was not “refreshed”. Mr O’Brien also made the point, as did others, that there was a significant fundraising team: by the end of 2013 it comprised around 18 staff on a full-time equivalent basis. The Development Committee also provided wellconnected support. However, whilst I accept this, it was undoubtedly the case that the charity was heavily reliant on Ms Batmanghelidjh’s phenomenal fundraising ability to fund the services it provided, and in the period under review this included (but was certainly not limited to) fundraising at short notice in response to immediate cash flow difficulties.  </p>

This was why the charity was pressing the government so hard for a substantial increase in funding, particularly from 2013 onwards. He was clear that this was required in order to allow the charity to continue to meet increasing need and to replicate its model in the way the government wished it to do. By early 2014 it was clear to him that a new way forward would need to be found: there was a serious financial issue and the funding model needed to change. He saw 2014 as the start of a transition. I accept this. He also made the point, which I accept, that Kids Company wanted “an organisation which wasn’t spending all its time trying to raise money”, with Ms Batmanghelidjh no longer having continually to focus on fundraising and with the government instead accepting responsibility to a greater degree (as the charity saw it) for the young people it served.  </p>

I accept this, although there were some warning signs earlier. Ms Bolton’s evidence was that by around October 2014, and despite the success of the gala dinner, Kids Company was no longer meeting its fundraising targets. Her view was that this was in part a result of the overall financial climate but she also referred to some donor fatigue and to the impact of negative press. I would add to this that, of course, the fundraising target had increased year on year and for 2014 was noticeably more challenging than the previous year’s outcome. However, I accept that the Trustees did not have serious grounds to doubt that the income projection for 2014 would be met until late November. </p>

I agree with Ms Bolton that negative press is relevant. Whilst it appears that the Sunday Times article published on 21 September did not cause any immediate major issue with donors, over time it became apparent that the uncertainty flagged up by the article was having an impact on some potential funders.

The context included the expiry of the then government grant in March 2015, the harmful uncertainty relating to that and Ms Batmanghelidjh’s strong views that the government should be bearing a significantly greater proportion of the burden so that she did not have to focus continually on fundraising. Having said that, in fact what is said in the letter just referred to is broadly consistent with both the Trustees’ views and the conclusions I have drawn. There was recognition that the burden of increasing need could not continue to be met entirely from non-statutory sources, and the funding model needed to change. But that does not mean that there was an immediate funding crisis or that it was unreasonable to continue operating without immediate severe cuts, bearing in mind not only the indications from government but also the support that the Trustees believed the charity had from philanthropists (on which see below). </p>

This press coverage must have made the charity’s fundraising challenge even harder from that point onwards. (The first threat to publish by Mr Goslett was in November 2014. The article in question was not published but the Cabinet Office and Charity Commission both became aware of the issues raised. The Charity Commission investigated and concluded that no further action was needed.

The continued level of goodwill to the charity can be seen not only from that but more broadly from Mr Roden’s confidence in the charity’s ability to fundraise following the restructuring (see [607] below). The continued level of support for the charity is evident from the management accounts for June 2015, which showed year to date donations from individuals at nearly £1.9m, as compared to around £1m for the prior year, and donations from trusts up by about £750,000 to nearly £3m. I accept Mr. Yentob’s explanation that a number of people, including well-known names, stepped in to provide additional support to the charity when they realized the danger it was in.

On 17 January 2014 Mr Frieda emailed Mr Yentob following a social engagement attended by them and by Peter Wheeler (a former trustee), offering to contact Ms Stroud to arrange a meeting, and asking whether Mr Hurd should also attend. There were then further discussions between Mr Yentob, Mr Frieda, Mr Wheeler and David Gold, a recruitment specialist, following which Mr Wheeler circulated some notes on 14 February. These notes record, among other things, a “broad consensus” of a desire to support Kids Company and for Ms Batmanghelidjh to take the charity to the “next level”, stating that it needed to be “built on firmer foundations”, in particular requiring a financial reserve so that it “doesn’t operate on the edge of the cliff of doom all the time”, and that a COO was probably required. The notes also suggest fresh blood on the Board to complement Mr Yentob’s skills in “handling talent, connecting with government, the elite and the public etc”, and approaching both the government and key private supporters to co-fund the charity. Mr Yentob explained in cross-examination that this was a great vision, and he obviously did not want to discourage support, but how achievable it was and within what timeframe was another matter (see further [629] and [630] below). He also noted that Mr Wheeler was not himself offering the suggested reserves.

It was also raised as an issue during the charity’s operation, in particular by Mr Spiers, who included it as a reason why he was not prepared to continue supporting the charity (see [362] above). However, given the position that the charity was actually in the creation of reserves was something that was more easily said than done. </p>

At least in the period in question there is a sense from the evidence of a focus on fundraising for immediate need, often against the backdrop of an emergency requirement for funds having been identified, and steps frequently having already been taken to meet the need in question. Building reserves would usually require a longer term approach, where donors understand that they are contributing at least in part to the charity’s long-term stability, and the fundraising structure includes arrangements to encourage regular giving, legacies and the like.  </p>

Ms Bolton confirmed, with the benefit of what is obviously considerable experience, the difficulty of persuading trusts and foundations to give towards reserves and endowments.  The government was also unwilling to allow its grants to be used to build reserves. Mr Yentob’s evidence confirmed the difficulties. In particular, he was asked in cross-examination about the minutes of a Board meeting held on 28 July 2010, at which he “again” proposed using a donation promised by the Sigrid Rausing Trust to create a contingency fund. He explained that the donor was not in fact prepared to agree this. The subject came up again in late 2014. An email from Ms Rausing in November 2014 refers to a telephone conversation with Mr Yentob in which she suggested the creation of an endowment. But the email makes clear that she was not suggesting getting involved in providing an endowment herself. The charity’s responses to the reserves related issue raised by the auditors in their report on the 2012 accounts (see [230] above) are also consistent with this. </p>

Although the terms of the donation were initially restricted, under its terms the charity would have been free to sell or mortgage the property without Morgan Stanley’s consent after seven years (in 2019), which would have potentially allowed a real contribution to reserves, or at least would have provided an asset which could have been used to generate funds.

It might be said that this suggests that such a policy could have been implemented earlier. There is something in this, but the circumstances were very different. The need for reserves had by then been clearly demonstrated by the existential crisis that the charity had faced. Further, and importantly, the restructuring plan was backed by philanthropists who had themselves decided to back the charity, and to become trustees, on the basis that part of the funds contributed would be allocated to reserves.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In summary, there is some validity in the Official Receiver’s criticism of a failure to build up reserves, in the form of liquid resources. The existence of liquidity would obviously have assisted in addressing cash flow issues. However, it would not have been a straightforward exercise, and to the extent that it could have been achieved it would have diverted resources from meeting the needs of the charity’s clients, which were increasing year-on-year, particularly (in the period under review) as local authority budgets were cut. This was something that the Trustees were unwilling to do. The decision to prioritise spending on charitable objects rather than to build reserves is one that, in my view, could reasonably be reached.  </p>

In summary these relate to (a) the lack of criticism of any item of individual expenditure; (b) the level of scrutiny actually undertaken by the Trustees; (c) the questionable weight that can be attached to the Official Receiver’s failure to locate records; and (d) doubt as to the conclusions that can properly be drawn from any absence of records found to exist. These difficulties, together with the questionable relevance to the single allegation of the Official Receiver’s concentration on apparent failures to follow policy (see [79] above), were reflected in the notable lack of focus on this issue in the Official Receiver’s closing submissions, despite the very significant amount of evidence adduced in respect of it in Mr Tatham’s report. </p>

This represented around 2.7% and 1.6% respectively of the charity’s total costs. For 2014, spend on the Top 25 represented about 18% of total kids costs, or about 3.2% of total expenditure, averaging around £30,000 per client.

Financial support requests would be subject to thorough assessment, “always” involving budgeting, and requiring sign-off by two other managers. The process for handing out cash and vouchers was “very tightly managed and monitored”. Obviously Mr Gee was not cross-examined and I need to treat his witness statement with caution, but there was no real challenge to it (indeed the statement was relied on in Mr Hannon’s first report on another point) and I accept that it indicates a robust assessment process at what was by some distance the charity’s most significant centre.  </p>

She recalled a substantial document that she had asked one of the staff to produce which had a breakdown of all the clients that received financial support and explained why the client was given allowances, a document which it appears that the Official Receiver did not locate. Ms Batmanghelidjh also referred to regular reviews of everyone on the allowances list by Mr Kerman and another member of staff, and to detailed discussions with Mr O’Brien about individual clients at Trustee meetings. The transcript of the interview records her expressing incredulity and shock at gaps in client records as identified by the Official Receiver, including the absence of complete files. The evidence from this transcript is compelling. The reference to a document with a breakdown of clients supported is also consistent with a reference Ms Batmanghelidjh made to such a document in an email she sent to Helen Tabiner at the Cabinet Office on 10 April </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Other difficulties relate to the record keeping process. The charity was effectively running a dual system of paper and electronic records. An electronic system, Aurora, had relatively recently been introduced but many existing paper records were not transferred across. It also appears that the Bristol operation may not have been using Aurora. Paper documentation was still being created to a significant extent, and although some scanning occurred, as I understood it this was largely done at head office following a physical transfer of papers from the relevant centre. It appears from the transcript of the interview just referred to that a lot of staff were reluctant to use the Aurora system. A version of the risk register produced in mid-December 2014 raised issues over inaccurate data collection and problems with Aurora. A note produced by Ms Hamilton in relation to Aurora as part of her work in February 2015, following her resignation, referred to gaps in data to which both “behaviours and the system” contributed, indicating that there were some systemic difficulties. She made a number of recommendations, including creating visibility at a senior level about missing assessments and creating a process to sign off “exceptions”, which I understood to be cases where support was proposed to be provided without a full assessment being prepared. </p>

In addition it seems likely that some assessments would have occurred without being correctly evidenced in writing. There was also evidence of one clinician complaining that a significant number of assessments that they thought they had loaded onto Aurora had disappeared from the system.  </p>

I have no reason to doubt that the motivation would have been a well-intentioned aim of avoiding confidential information ending up in the wrong hands, but it was, as Ms Tyler confirmed, contrary to the Trustees’ instructions. In addition, and with some justification with particular reference to missing records in respect of multidisciplinary “Right to Health” meetings (a forum for staff to discuss difficult cases), there was a real lack of confidence on the part of the defendants in the Official Receiver’s ability to identify documents among the many it took into its control over a very short period. The Official Receiver also led no evidence about the process by which it took control of the charity’s documents. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Hamilton’s work on Aurora in early 2015 involved looking at a random sample of 32 records, together with another 32 records taken from Top 25 clients for 2013 and 2014. This did indicate gaps, but apparently not on the scale suggested by the Official Receiver. Ms Hamilton made recommendations to the relevant staff members, led by Mr Kerman (with a copy to Ms Batmanghelidjh), but had not it seems discovered anything that she felt necessary to raise with Trustees. The impression given is one of areas for improvement rather than issues of pressing concern. It is worth noting that, as Director of Finance and Accountability, Ms Hamilton had overall responsibility for this area. Her evidence did not address this issue. She had also contributed to the letter to the Charity Commission referred to at [522] above which, among other things, referred to the Aurora system and described the client assessment process and documentation of needs in a way that provided reassurance. It is also worth noting that at the Governance Committee meeting on 18 December 2014, when Ms Hamilton’s proposed work to check the robustness of the records on Aurora for the Top 25 was first discussed, Mr Webster is recorded in the minutes as asking about what governance procedure was in place, and being told by Ms Hamilton that each decision needed an appropriate sign off. Mr Kerman is also recorded as saying that each child had their own team and that decisions about care were made collectively, with a “train of evidence” for that. Similarly, at the Finance Committee meeting on the same day (at which Ms Hamilton was also present) clarification was sought about decision-making in respect of kids costs, and the minutes record Mr Mevada confirming that decisions about allowances were made by a team, with summaries for the highest individual kids costs being prepared for discussion by the Governance Committee. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Another point to make is that the Official Receiver’s work focused almost exclusively on clients who had been in the “Top 25”. These tended to be clients dealt with by Ms Batmanghelidjh, who was not cross-examined on the topic and who also relied on her PAs to ensure that appropriate record keeping was maintained (see [576] below). This is supported by an email from a staff member to Mr Whipp dated 22 July 2015 which confirmed that all but two of the highest spend clients at that stage were key-worked from head office. I accept that a focus on those clients does not provide a clear indication of the state of client files more generally, particularly in the light of the comments by Mr Gee. However, given the significance of the Top 25 in terms of levels of expenditure and the appropriate focus on them by the Trustees, it would also be reasonable to expect the exercise of a commensurate level of care in maintenance of their files. </p>

In my view that was far too narrow an approach, both as a general matter and in terms of the comfort that the Trustees (and to some extent Ms Batmanghelidjh) could reasonably have drawn, and in fact did draw, from them.

The report was produced in June 2013. One of the allegations was about the distribution of financial assistance and another was about expensive gifts – in other words, allegations of clear relevance to this issue. In the course of her work Ms Lesirge interviewed 19 people across the organisation. She attended a Board meeting to discuss the findings in September 2013. The notes of her summary to the Board at the meeting describe a “sophisticated process” of electronic logging, and substantial professional expertise of staff, with a constant making of judgments. She concluded that none of the allegations had substance. The full report was sent to the Trustees following the meeting. Its findings included that interviewees repeatedly confirmed that services were provided based on the assessed needs, and that there was a rigorous system for accessing cash. Ms Lesirge commented that there was a “sophisticated system” for recording and monitoring goals and outcomes and that there appeared to be a “good audit trail” in relation to allowances.  </p>

This was not a fair representation. The report had found the allegations to have no substance, and the Trustees were entitled to take comfort from it. The question whether Kids Company was following its charitable aims was also not part of the Official Receiver’s case. I also note that Ms Lesirge had specifically stated in response to the Official Receiver’s questions to her that the evidence indicated that the Policy for Distributing Financial Assistance was largely adhered to, with key workers and others sometimes using their judgment about how best to interpret guidelines. </p>

The difficulty is what this proves. Of itself, it simply means that there is an absence of documentation, or documentation in the correct location, demonstrating that a policy-compliant decision-making process had taken place, whether in terms of the appropriate assessment of the client’s needs, or the correct authorisation process within the organisation. In many cases this may not prove that the assessment or authorisation did not occur, but simply that there is now no written record of it, or none that the Official Receiver has located.

But a conclusion that a policy was not followed does not demonstrate whether or not there was a good reason to depart from the policy, because if there was then the missing element might be limited to a record of the justification for the expenditure as an exception to the policy. In order to answer that question it would be necessary to investigate the individual expenditure in question and the circumstances in which it was incurred.

There was also evidence indicating that formal written assessments were not always recorded on client files. However, I also accept Ms Batmanghelidjh’s evidence that notes she prepared in relation to clients, and which she believed were stored by her PAs, did exist and appear not to have been located by the Official Receiver. Furthermore, Ms Batmanghelidjh’s affidavit evidence in relation to the Top 25 included statements that she did not make decisions about them on her own, that there were robust assessments in respect of each of them if they had mental health difficulties (which most did) and that all decisions were informed and driven by clinical and safety needs. Ms Batmanghelidjh was not cross-examined on the question of expenditure on clients, so this evidence was not challenged. In any event it is again the case that even if it were possible to conclude that there was a failure to adhere to policy that went beyond record keeping, it would not follow that there was no good reason for the departure.  </p>

They exercised real scrutiny over expenditure and were also entitled to gain comfort from the external reports undertaken. They were entitled to expect that staff would draw their attention to any major concerns, for example with the operation of Aurora or the maintenance of paper records, that were not being appropriately addressed.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Data collection and the Aurora system were specifically addressed in the risk register, which was regularly reviewed by the Governance Committee, with named staff being assigned responsibility. I also do not accept that the Trustees needed to commission their own enquiries into whether policies were being adhered to in the absence of cause for concern. Where concerns were raised they reacted appropriately, as evidenced by the commissioning of the Lesirge report. </p>

The level of influence that Ms Batmanghelidjh had depended on the subject matter. Ms Robinson agreed that the Trustees wanted to extend the level of expertise on the Board, and the review was a catalyst for that. Board papers were often provided later than was ideal, but that was often the case in the real world. Ms Batmanghelidjh had a lot of delegated authority and responsibility for day-to-day management, and given she was responsible at an operational level, what she said about those aspects would be taken very seriously. As to preapproval of major decisions, Ms Robinson thought Mr O’Brien made a good point but pointed to the Trustees’ part-time role. Day-to-day matters were delegated, and Ms Batmanghelidjh was supported by a very experienced Finance team. Similarly in relation to Mr Handover’s summary, Ms Robinson’s response was that the reference to a majority of decisions being predetermined was a statement of fact given the Trustees’ part-time role.  Ms Robinson also pointed out (in the context of questions about why the charity did not downsize earlier) that Ms Batmanghelidjh was a very effective, proven CEO who had never previously let the charity down on the fundraising side, that the Board would have insisted on downsizing had there been no alternative, but no decision would have been made without listening to Ms Batmanghelidjh and the senior staff about what could reasonably be expected to occur over the following few months. </p>

It was not evident to him that Ms Batmanghelidjh tended to provide all the answers. Furthermore, he would expect the Board to be presented with plans developed by Ms Batmanghelidjh and the management team. He did not feel unable to challenge her. As regards the need for clinical expertise, he pointed to what he thought was a very strong and capable clinical team whose professionalism and decision-making he had no grounds to doubt, but agreed with the proposal to add expertise to the Board in that area. </p>

There was a desire for improvement in the effectiveness of the way the Board operated in this area, and also to allow for a more rigorous process of challenge on major issues. The evidence does not support a conclusion that the Board could not exert control over Ms Batmanghelidjh, but rather that it allowed someone who was regarded as a very effective CEO to operate under a broad level of delegated authority, without significant interference. The effect of doing so was that the CEO was making the “majority of decisions”. </p>

Ms Batmanghelidjh was concerned about the desirability as well as the practicality of controls, and not just in respect of urgent expenditure. In all likelihood the immediate prompt for Ms Batmanghelidjh’s email was an email that Mr O’Brien had sent the previous day (and which was forwarded by Mr Mevada to Ms Batmanghelidjh shortly before she sent her email) querying two apparently non-urgent items of expenditure in respect of medical and college costs, and confirming the need for advance Trustee approval of commitments. Ms Batmanghelidjh was responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation as CEO and wanted to ensure that it could operate in practice as she thought it should. As Mr Handover said, as the person in charge of running the organisation it was to be expected that she would push back on controls imposed: that is what chief executives do. Mr O’Brien gave similar evidence and added that some of the best CEOs are difficult people who fight back on everything, pointing out that for Ms Batmanghelidjh the young people always came first.  </p>

It is clear from the Trustees’ evidence that they did not go through the whole list of lenders deciding whom should be repaid. Timing was also left to the executive team. I accept that Mr O’Brien’s loan was not discussed, and indeed accept his evidence that he did not request or expect repayment, and was surprised to receive it. It is also clear that Ms Atkinson’s loan was discussed, and the Trustees decided to repay her because the loan was well overdue for repayment, she was in difficult financial circumstances at the time and the Trustees did not want to discourage her or her network from lending or donating. (Mr Yentob did subsequently ask her to agree to a delayed repayment. She did not agree and was in fact repaid on 21 April.) As Mr Handover pointed out, it was important for Kids Company to keep well-connected donors, who would also help it to attract new donors, onside. It was also agreed that ICAP should be repaid because it was a condition of it making a donation that the loan was repaid. None of the relevant Trustees could recall discussing Ms Dellal’s loan but accepted that they might have done. Ms Robinson made the point that it would have been important to keep Ms Dellal onside because, like Ms Atkinson, she was a well-connected lender. I accept this evidence and conclude that, given her significance, it is more likely than not that the position of Ms Dellal was discussed.  </p>

If they had thought that was the case then it is highly unlikely that they would have felt able to agree to take the government grant. Rather, the decision to repay certain lenders because they or those associated with them could donate in the future indicates the Trustees’ view that the charity had a future, and that their decisions were being driven by a desire to secure that future, rather than by a concern that it would fail. </p>

In summary, this was said to understate creditors and overstate the funds that could be raised during the following month, August. The latter included £400,000 from an art sale and £350,000 from Ms Batmanghelidjh. The creditors were said to be understated by reference to claims lodged in the liquidation. </p>

The projected cash surplus of just over £1m would be used as a starting point for building cash reserves. Existing creditors, as well as restructuring and ongoing running costs, were addressed specifically. The plan referred to a schedule of payment being formalised with HMRC, addressed outstanding loans (for example, indicating which loans would be converted to donations and which had been agreed with the lender could remain outstanding), and in relation to other creditors explained that the cash flow provided for them all to be repaid over the remainder of 2015.  </p>

As I understand it, the document was produced by Ms Jenkins, an experienced accountant, but in addition Mr Whipp, an experienced restructuring professional, was very heavily involved and it was he who was corresponding with the Cabinet Office. Furthermore, Mr Roden was also heavily involved, had clearly looked at the numbers carefully and was also in direct contact with the Cabinet Office. He was planning to become chair of the trustees. I note that one of the emails that Mr Roden sent earlier in the day, before the cash flow was sent to the Cabinet Office, specifically stated that Mr Whipp needed to be comfortable with the numbers before they were sent. Mr Whipp was to remain in his role as CRO for a period, with responsibility for operational, strategic and financial control, until a new CEO was appointed (with Ms Batmanghelidjh becoming “President”, focusing on clinical aspects and fundraising). In addition, the figures were obviously scrutinised closely by the Cabinet Office. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The email correspondence supports the defendants’ position that, if the Cabinet Office grant was secured, Mr Roden was confident that Kids Company’s future could be secured via private donations from himself and others. For example, an email he sent to Mr Yentob on 29 July asked that if Mr Letwin needed any more comfort on funds then Mr Roden should be given a chance to “respond/provide comfort”, and went on to say: “This is v conservative plan and assumes we raise no additional monies”. A slightly earlier email from him reports that he had lost his temper with Ms Tabiner because she had failed to include in her figures an additional £200,000 that he had secured that morning. Mr Yentob also provided clear oral evidence about Mr Roden’s level of confidence at this stage, and his determination to ensure that the charity survived. The latter point is supported by an email that Mr Roden sent to Mr Yentob on 26 May 2015 in which he said “I can’t let this charity go down – be a true disgrace”, and by a further email he sent on 8 June to a number of recipients, including Mr Yentob, reporting on a meeting with Mr Fisher and Ms Tabiner and stating that he had told them that he would make sure Kids Company “wasn’t insolvent by the time they put their money in”. The strength of his commitment is further underlined by the fact that (as an email he sent on 6 August 2015 makes plain) he did not withdraw the offer of £3m once the unfounded allegations were made, even though he knew that as a result of the allegations he would struggle to raise any of it from others and would be responsible for the whole amount himself.  </p>

She accepted in cross-examination that it would probably not have occurred during August but she thought it could be achieved during September, by putting the works into an auction house contemporary art sale. Mr Yentob’s evidence, based on his knowledge of Mr Roden’s position at the time, was that Mr Roden thought the £400,000 was on the low side and that he would have taken the art himself if necessary. However, he wanted to encourage other supporters and demonstrate that well-known artists had pledged works.  </p>

It would have been relatively obvious to Mr Whipp and others that her property could not be sold, or probably even mortgaged, within a month. Instead, I conclude that the primary plan was to raise funds from elsewhere. This is supported by a query Mr Roden raised in an email on 28 July as to whether he was expected to step in and take Ms Batmanghelidjh’s flat “if Comic Relief doesn’t materialise”. It was also supported by Mr Yentob’s evidence, which was that there was a specific individual who had made it clear that they would not let Ms Batmanghelidjh mortgage or lose her home and would provide the money instead. However, Ms Batmanghelidjh wanted the reference to her on the list to show the level of commitment that she was prepared to make.

For example, donors who had been expected to convert their loans to donations if the restructuring proceeded would obviously have remained as creditors in the liquidation. The information provided to the Cabinet Office included details of proposed loan conversions. It also appears that a number of individuals who had been treated as self-employed by Kids Company (without there having been any challenge to that during the charity’s existence) established that they were employed by the charity following its liquidation, or at least lodged claims on that basis. Creditors in the liquidation would also have included redundancy costs for all staff. Ms Batmanghelidjh also evidently had a firm belief that there were a significant number of creditors on the Official Receiver’s list who should not have been there. </p>

On 27 July Mr de Winton sent Ms Batmanghelidjh an email stating that it was not right for Mr Roden to become a “lender of last resort”, that there needed to be “fundamental and lasting changes” to how the charity was run, with an “absolute focus” on financial management, in particular building reserves, and that unless there was a real change of heart by her he would not join the Board and would seek to dissuade Mr Roden. He added that without Mr Roden’s “backstop” the charity was not a going concern, was insolvent and the Cabinet Office money should not be taken. On 28 July he sent an email to the Trustees following a meeting the previous evening stating that he would not join the Board because he would not be able to </p>

He was obviously entitled to reach the view that he did in respect of Ms Batmanghelidjh, but she did ultimately agree to change her role (signing the papers later in the day on 28 July). If anything, his comments as to solvency are supportive of the defendants’ position: the obverse of what he was saying is that with Mr Roden’s support the charity <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> solvent. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">At first sight it appears attractively easy to criticise, particularly with the benefit of hindsight, a failure to implement a radical contingency plan at an earlier stage. That criticism is at the core of the Official Receiver’s case, with particular reference to the position no later than 30 November 2014. However, as already discussed at that stage the Trustees were still genuinely, and not unreasonably, hopeful of substantial additional statutory funding being found. The government was still conveying a strong message that it did not want Kids Company to close any of its centres, which is what would be required to make radical cuts (see below). The Trustees also reasonably believed that there was strong support from philanthropists. For example, in cross-examination Ms Bolton stressed the strong support the charity had from key philanthropists and the relevance of that in determining whether a contingency plan should be implemented when it became clear that the government was not going to be forthcoming with the additional funding within the timeframe that Kids Company had hoped. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In order to make a sensible plan about what to close, the Trustees would first want to have some understanding of the future funding position. Specifically, the Trustees would want to understand which parts of Kids Company’s operations could continue to be funded through other means (such as the free schools programme or mental health budget) and which could not. As Ms Robinson pointed out in cross-examination, no organisation entering a restructuring would wish to make strategic decisions about closure of operations until the full expected future plan was known. I would add that, in particular, it would want to understand the priorities of the proposed funder or funders. Making the wrong cuts could harm future funding prospects. Indications from senior government representatives that the government did not wish Kids Company to close centres are therefore relevant in determining whether the only reasonable course of action was to press ahead with significant cuts. It is also relevant that the charity was getting a similar message from supportive philanthropists: see [527] above in relation to a meeting with Mr Frieda in early March 2015.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The difficulty of making significant cuts should not be underestimated. The high proportion that staff costs represented of overall expenditure meant that any material cost cutting programme would mean significant cuts to staff. However, steep cuts to the numbers of staff at individual centres would have raised safeguarding concerns in respect of clients as well as safety concerns in respect of staff. Any material cuts would require the closure of one or more centres, with the result that support to significant numbers of vulnerable clients – for whom the charity provided a safety net – would be cut off. Implementing steep cuts could itself have an impact on fundraising, because it could put donors off. The choices available were therefore limited, and difficult. The fact that choices are hard does not mean they do not need to be made, but it is a relevant part of the factual context in assessing the defendants’ conduct. Ms Robinson’s point about any business wanting to understand its funding position before making strategic decisions to close operations would be true for any business, but in this case the need to balance the harm to clients that would be involved in needless closures, and the consequent failure to fulfil Kids Company’s charitable objectives, was undoubtedly a legitimate factor for the Trustees to take into account. </p>

It is also clear from the evidence that, despite pressing from the Trustees, this was not done as promptly as would have been desirable. The reasons for this were not fully explored but I infer that they were at least in part attributable to the events leading up to, and the effect of, the departure of the senior managers, which removed a critical management layer. Ms Batmanghelidjh’s reluctance to entertain steep cuts would also have played a part, together with the personal difficulties touched on at [651] below.

Mr Handover gave similar evidence. Ms Robinson confirmed that all the Trustees agreed that Ms Batmanghelidjh could not stay as CEO permanently, but that she needed to stay in position for the time being given the charity’s reliance on her as a fundraiser. Ms Tyler gave similar evidence. Mr Webster’s evidence was that the Trustees had lost confidence in Ms Batmanghelidjh as a CEO beyond the immediate future, but that it was not possible to remove her or materially change her functions at the time. Mr O’Brien’s evidence was that there was a discussion about her role and how it could be changed but it would have been harmful to the charity to replace Ms Batmanghelidjh at the time. Ms Bolton’s recollection was a consensus by the Trustees that, while she was an excellent fundraiser, Ms Batmanghelidjh did not have the requisite management skills to run a charity the size of Kids Company without senior management support, but that it was not in the charity’s best interests, or that of the young people it served, to remove her at that stage: she would not at the time have accepted a reduced role, and losing her completely would have been extremely damaging for the charity, which was dependent on her connections and relationships with donors.  </p>

She was important to and highly regarded by David Cameron. Ms Batmanghelidjh finally accepted that her role needed to change, but this took time and a lot of work on the part of a number of the Trustees. Mr Handover commented that a change of role was impractical until a specific plan for the future was developed, and that required the government funding position to be resolved.

Mr Yentob clearly did have an effective, and what he described as honest, relationship as chair with Ms Batmanghelidjh as CEO. It was also clear that Mr Handover employed his own significant skills in dealing with Ms Batmanghelidjh, and invested a great deal of time in it. As Mr O’Brien said in the slightly different context of challenging Ms Batmanghelidjh in Board and committee discussions, when dealing with a CEO it is important to take care not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. He commented in his affidavit that he thought that both Mr Yentob and Mr Handover were comfortable addressing difficult issues with Ms Batmanghelidjh, and would do so by talking to her rather than in writing.

However, Mr Roden was very clear that he wanted Ms Batmanghelidjh to remain at the charity, albeit in a different role. So obtaining her agreement to the changes was essential. In fact, the correspondence indicates that Mr Roden’s preference was to keep her in the role of CEO for a transitional period, and shows him supporting her position against what was by then Cabinet Office insistence that she should not have an executive role. </p>

She accepted that she was shown as the most senior staff member on the organisational charts, with direct reports to her from all areas of the business, both administrative and managerial in nature (for example finance, HR etc) and also from the individual centres where services were provided, although in the latter case she said that centre managers also reported to the Clinical Director. However, in oral evidence she was not really prepared to accept that she was responsible for financial elements, with the exception of fundraising. Crudely, she accepted responsibility for income but not expenditure. Her position was that the Finance team, headed by the Director of Finance and Accountability, were responsible for financial aspects and that, due to her learning difficulties, they dealt directly with Trustees. Ms Batmanghelidjh modified this stance slightly near the end of her oral evidence, when she was being cross-examined on behalf of other defendants and was shown part of a statement she made to the Official Receiver about regularly reviewing expenditure as well as income, but it remained a theme. </p>

I would add that it might be expected to be a core responsibility of a CEO, as the most senior executive, to ensure that he or she has a proper understanding of and control over key risks, which would include any question about the ability of an organisation to meet its debts as they fell due. Ms Batmanghelidjh’s evidence that the Finance team effectively reported to and dealt with Trustees directly was not supported by the Trustees’ evidence insofar as it referred to dealings outside Board and Board committee meetings (and related matters such as management account packs). Although she would not have routinely got involved in the details of which creditors were paid and when, I find that Ms Batmanghelidjh did have responsibility for expenditure as well as income, and that the Finance team followed her philosophy in that respect (as to which see [642] below). </p>

Given what Ms Batmanghelidjh described as her very good long term memory and her evidently vivid memories of other events, I doubt that the explanation is in all cases a simple failure to recollect. It more likely reflects the adoption of a selective approach, to some extent in recollection but probably more in choosing not to focus on the area in question, or adopting a perspective in relation to it that did not always accord with what others might regard as its significance.  </p>

Another example is that Ms Batmanghelidjh claimed not to have been made aware of very real concerns being expressed by self-employed staff towards the end of 2014 about not being paid for some months, and the difficulties to which that was giving rise. That is inherently unlikely. It is also clear from the minutes of a Governance Committee meeting on 21 November 2014 that Ms Batmanghelidjh was involved in a process of determining which self-employed staff should be paid first (by reference to those she identified as “more dependent”). This appropriately led to challenge by the Trustees present, Mr Webster and Ms Robinson, as to the robustness of the system and the risk of favouritism. Similar comments appear to have been made at the Finance Committee meeting on the same day, with Mr O’Brien requesting a qualitative analysis of self-employed staff and criteria for payment, and Ms Robinson saying that more robust documentation was required to explain the rationale. I accept that Ms Batmanghelidjh did not attend either meeting, but the point is that the discussions related to a system that she was said to be involved in. </p>

The evidence included correspondence with the LSE (in respect of the report referred to at [568] above) and the University of Cambridge in respect of unpaid invoices. Late payment for this research was not raised as an issue in the Official Receiver’s report, so it is not surprising that when it was raised in crossexamination Ms Batmanghelidjh could not recall the paperwork or that particular concerns had been raised about the impact of non-payment on the position of the relevant academic research group at the University of Cambridge. Although Mr Butler did not challenge the questioning at the time, he did raise it as a fairness issue in closing, not without some justification. I deal with a different point about the commissioning of the research at [724] below, but as regards payment for the research the only finding I need to make is that, in the light of the evidence as a whole, I am not convinced by Ms Batmanghelidjh’s suggestion that the relevant member of staff (Mr Guinness) would have agreed the contractual terms with the two institutions in direct discussion with the Trustees without any involvement from her. </p>

Furthermore, there was plenty of evidence that at times she got heavily involved in determining which creditors to pay and how much, for example in relation to HMRC, the selfemployed and supporters who provided loans (see further below in relation to loans). Mr O’Brien commented in one of his interviews with the Official Receiver that Ms Batmanghelidjh “prided herself on being close to the finances”, including in dealings with the bank and HMRC.

Given the difficulties she describes with sequencing of time it occurs to me that Ms Batmanghelidjh’s approach may be affected to some extent by her learning difficulties. This was not directly suggested by Ms Batmanghelidjh or on her behalf, but it would be consistent with the view she put forward that her difficulties were such that she could not undertake all the aspects of corporate governance that would be required of a director. </p>

That is no doubt factually accurate, but it does not by itself justify or explain how the situation arose. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">There were some particular concerns in this regard in respect of the management of creditors’ expectations. Self-employed staff and research institutions have already been mentioned, but a significant example is HMRC. The position with HMRC is discussed in more detail in an earlier section of this judgment. As far as Ms Batmanghelidjh is concerned, she had a significant role in managing the relationship, particularly after Ms Chipperfield left. Email correspondence in late 2014 shows the relevant HMRC officer, Mr Cross-Rudkin, commenting (with some justification) that he was getting increasingly concerned that “we are being strung along”. HMRC had previously been led to believe that the payment due in November 2014 would be covered by November cash flow, which was evidently not the case, and none of the income sources that Ms Batmanghelidjh then indicated (rather optimistically) would be available came through to meet the extended deadline that the officer had, exceptionally, been prepared to agree. </p>

In relation to the latter, Ms Batmanghelidjh sent an email to Trustees in September 2013 stating that the charity should receive £4 million of lottery money in January, to fund work in Bristol. The money evidently did not come through in January, and although Ms Batmanghelidjh asserted in oral evidence that lottery funding was received, the lottery award of £2 million referred to in the 2012 and 2013 statutory accounts was for another project, and was awarded in November 2012. </p>

Although she subsequently did work on contingency planning, my overall impression from the evidence is that she was extremely reluctant to go along with the level of cuts that the Trustees later concluded were essential. She continued to believe that if the Trustees were firm enough the government would provide significant additional funding, possibly through the free schools programme and/or mental health budget. That might have been true in the longer term, but Ms Batmanghelidjh was extremely reluctant to accept that radical action was required to secure the charity’s immediate future and enable it to meet its shortterm running costs. This, combined with the departure of four senior managers and other events, including a period of illness suffered by Mr Mevada at a critical time, made the Trustees’ already difficult task markedly harder. </p>

I accept that Ms Batmanghelidjh was genuinely motivated by strong views about the importance of the work the charity did and the impact of steep cuts on its clients, for whom Kids Company had provided a safety net. She was also concerned that some of the closures proposed could themselves jeopardise future funding applications, for example any free schools application. She would no doubt also have been concerned about the charity’s staff. Further, although she was very reluctant to accept the need for major cuts, it should not be forgotten that she had been making her view that the government needed to shoulder a significant element of the financial burden known for some time, and certainly from the autumn of 2013.  </p>

This was a charity that she had founded and built up, and devoted long hours to working for, over many years. She had a strong belief in the importance of its work (a belief shared by others). She was clearly particularly concerned about the effect that cuts could have on vulnerable young people, including the potential for violence. During this period she lost most of her senior management team, including Ms Caldwell with whom she had worked very closely. Having previously been fêted as a visionary, as the public “face” of Kids Company she became the focus of the negative press. She also had to deal with the loss of her mother in early March 2015, at a critical time in the life of the charity. As Ms Robinson said, the pressure at the time may have affected Ms Batmanghelidjh’s judgment. In any event it was clearly an extremely stressful period for her.

Ms Batmanghelidjh was also not prepared to accept that the final award of £3m was emergency funding, when it was clearly required urgently. She sent an email to all staff on 5 July 2015 which in part obviously reflected appropriate legal advice about what could and could not be said about potential redundancies in advance of a formal process, but it included additional wording to the effect that she was hoping not to have to make drastic cuts and was working “behind the scenes” to find potential solutions. I accept that Mr Roden had agreed that she could attempt to find ways to avoid the cuts, but he clearly thought, as did the Trustees, that it was an unrealistic exercise. </p>

However, draft minutes of Board and Finance Committee meetings were generally circulated only with the papers for the next meeting, rather than shortly after the meeting in question, so that whilst major points, and in particular key action points, were likely to be picked up, the level of scrutiny of the language used was likely to be somewhat less (as Ms Robinson accepted in cross-examination), and inevitably detail would be lost.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Batmanghelidjh did not attend Governance Committee meetings and the member of staff who generally took those minutes was closely guided by Ms Tyler as chair. There was one instance of an email where Ms Batmanghelidjh, having read the draft minutes of a Governance Committee meeting (which were circulated to members of the committee at the same time as being sent to Ms Batmanghelidjh), expressed concern to Ms Jenkins that the “tone” of the minutes was somewhat flippant and factually inaccurate, stating that she wanted the minutes modified because they were formal minutes, and that if that was the tone of the meeting it was inappropriate. Ms Jenkins apologised and asked to discuss the changes that Ms Batmanghelidjh would like made. I accept Ms Batmanghelidjh’s explanation of this, which broadly accords with the email, namely that formal documents of this nature should not exhibit a disrespectful tone, out of line with the charity’s style. It is an example of influence being exercised, but the Trustee members would have seen and had a chance to object to any changes. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">There was also one instance where minutes of a later meeting record that Ms Batmanghelidjh asked for additional context to be added to a set of Finance Committee minutes. There are two points to make about this. First, the minutes in question had clearly been sent to Trustees in draft before Ms Batmanghelidjh had reviewed them, showing that she did not always review minutes in advance. Secondly, I do not accept the allegation made to the Charity Commission that her actions went beyond this and amounted to editorial control. That allegation does not accord with the documentary evidence, and Ms Lloyd, who was present at the relevant meeting, could not provide support for the allegation in oral evidence, accepting that what was said to the Charity Commission was indicative of the sort of thing that would happen, and was reflective of conversations that had occurred between her and the other senior managers. <span style="font-weight:bold"> Contacts between staff and Trustees: general </span></p>

This point was emphasised most in relation to Finance team members and Trustees on the Finance Committee, for reasons attributed to Ms Batmanghelidjh’s learning difficulties (see in particular [634] and [635] above).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In relation to discussion and approval of financial matters, and with the particular exception of the Trustee involvement required in signing large cheques, I am not convinced that these contacts occurred to the extent that Ms Batmanghelidjh suggested. She was in no real position to know what level of contact there was. The evidence I saw and heard leads me to conclude that the principal contacts between other staff and most of the Trustees were through formal Board or Board committee meetings, together with paperwork sent in advance, in particular the detailed monthly management accounts packs. Specifically in relation to payments to HMRC, for most of her oral evidence Ms Batmanghelidjh was under the misapprehension that Trustee approval would have been required for any payment to HMRC because of its size, and therefore that details of each payment must have been discussed. That was not in fact the case under the terms of the Financial Procedures Manual (see [696] below) and I do not accept that Ms Batmanghelidjh was correct in thinking that Trustees were heavily involved. </p>

These proposals involved a form of partnership which included assistance with the website and marketing, developing a strategy for replication globally and exploiting the “commercial potential”, including expanding merchandising. These other ideas were rebuffed by Ms Batmanghelidjh in an email which clearly reflected her honest views but which, at least in retrospect, can be criticised as ill-judged in tone.

As to one it seems to me clear that this cannot be limited simply to statutory functions and to my mind it would mean and include any one or more of the following: directing others, putting it very compendiously, committing the company to major obligations, and thirdly (really I think what we are concerned with here) taking part in an equally based collective decision process at board level, i.e. at the level of a director in effect with a foot in the board room. As to Mr Lloyd's test, I think it is very much on the lines of that third test to which I have just referred. It is not, I think, in any way a question of equality of power but equality of ability to participate in the notional board room. Is he somebody who is simply advising and, as it were, withdrawing having advised, or somebody who joins the other directors, de facto or de jure, in decisions which affect the future of the company?” </p>

In relation to the former in particular, I remind myself of the comment of Robert Walker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kaytech</span>, referred to at [159] above, that the factors listed by Jacob J in <span style="font-style:italic">Tjolle</span>, which included making major decisions, are relevant factors, but the crucial issue is whether the individual had assumed the status and functions of a director. That is a similar approach to the one expressed by Lord Collins in <span style="font-style:italic">Holland</span>, albeit there outside a disqualification context (see [163] above), namely that the crucial question is whether the person “assumed the duties of a director”. As to whether paragraphs [83] and [84] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re Mea Corp</span> were approved in <span style="font-style:italic">Holland</span>, paragraph [83] was referred to by Lord Hope at [32] and by Lord Walker in his dissenting judgment at [108] (who also referred to paragraph [84]), but in the context of a comment by Lewison J about the importance of focusing on what the person did.  Paragraph [83] was briefly referred to again by Lord Walker at [111] in relation to the requirement that the relevant person undertook functions that could properly be discharged only by a director. There was no specific discussion of the reference to “major decisions”. </p>

It is worth noting the reference in it to the provision of “advice and information” to the Board (as opposed to participating in decisions) and the reference to being “directly accountable” to the Board. There are some references to working “with” the Board but I consider that this is in the context of the Board having ultimate control and responsibility for management. They are not saying that the CEO was on an equal footing to the Board. Rather, to function effectively the Board needed to have the most senior member of the executive team working with it, since that person would lead the team responsible for implementing Board decisions. The Board would also be dependent on information that the CEO was best placed to provide. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The Financial Procedures Manual also does not assist the Official Receiver’s case. A clear distinction is drawn between the Board and the “Management Team”, which includes but is not limited to the CEO. The responsibilities of the Board and Finance Committee are clear, for example the latter’s responsibility in relation to budgets and its control over staff costs. The fact that the CEO had responsibility to present strategic analysis and budgets is consistent with the nature of that role. The same applies to the level of expenditure that the CEO could authorise: the existence of those limits is entirely consistent with the role being that of a senior staff member accountable to a Board which had the ultimate responsibility. The fact that the limits were significantly higher than those for other staff members is perfectly explicable by reference to the CEO role, and do not appear to be particularly high in the context of a charity of the size of Kids Company. (I deal separately with whether the Manual was adhered to and whether Ms Batmanghelidjh exceeded her delegated authority under its terms.) </p>

As regards 2014, because the charity spent much of the year discussing the need for long-term sustainable funding with government, it would have been difficult to prepare a formal strategic plan. This is consistent with Mr Handover’s evidence referred to at [702] below. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In the absence of a formal one year or five year plan, what existed by way of annual plan was a so-called “Can-do” document for the year in question. The 2014 version of this document was provided to the Trustees by Ms Caldwell on 14 January 2014 for discussion at the Board meeting on 30 January, but the minutes of the meeting do not indicate that it was discussed or formally approved. It is also not apparent that it was first considered by the Finance Committee as the Manual indicates should have occurred with an annual plan, and it did not contain the required reference to the reserves policy. The Finance Committee had, however, considered the draft 2014 Budget at its meeting a day earlier (29 January) as well as in December 2013. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">When challenged about this in cross-examination, Ms Bolton suggested that the Can-do document was likely to have been approved by the Board, but she evidently could not recall specifically doing so. That evidence was consistent with the PKF Littlejohn report, which stated that the Can-do document was produced by the senior management team and approved by the Board. I am not persuaded that this was correct at least as a formal matter, but it is more likely than not that the key elements of its content would have been covered in Board discussion. Ms Robinson thought that the document was brought to the Board. An email Ms Jenkins sent in March 2014 described the version of the document circulated in January 2014 as the “closest thing” to an overall development plan. Mr Handover commented with reference to the same document that there was no point setting longer-term objectives until the charity knew what would be forthcoming from government. But more generally I accept Mr Handover’s evidence that the Board discussed not only short-term but medium and long-term goals and expectations, including for example in relation to expansion. Performance was assessed in particular through presentation of the monthly management accounts. I also accept Mr O’Brien’s evidence that the detailed budget for 2014 took into account what he described as the CEO’s one-year aims (a description that was consistent with the terms of the Financial Procedures Manual).  </p>

I agree that the staged process contemplated by the Manual was not followed. But what is relevant is whether, as a matter of substance, what happened supports the proposition that Ms Batmanghelidjh assumed the status and functions of a director. I certainly do not agree that the fact that what passed for an annual plan, and the 2014 Budget, were put together by the executive team headed by Ms Batmanghelidjh, demonstrates this. It was to be expected that these documents would be developed by the executive team rather than simply being imposed from above. Any other approach would be unrealistic. Indeed, the 2014 Budget document lists 16 senior managers with whom the Finance team had discussed plans and expectations in order to prepare the budget, and who had budgetary responsibilities. If a budget put forward by the executive team, based on a plan it prepared, is genuinely approved by the Board that does not demonstrate that any member of the executive team is a de facto director, but rather that the Board is prepared to agree to what is proposed. The fact that members of the Board were not willing to agree the same approach in respect of 2015 rather illustrates this. </p>

In order to discharge those responsibilities effectively, they must obtain sufficient knowledge and understanding of the company’s operations. They will also require a mechanism to ensure that the decisions they make are implemented. In practice directors will usually be reliant on the executive team for the information they need, as well as for implementation. This will include the formulation of plans and budgets. In the absence of cause for concern they must be entitled to rely on information provided, and in normal circumstances that decisions made will either be implemented as required, or at least that reasons for not implementing them, or for any unexpected delay in doing so, will be reported back as and when appropriate. The expectation that the CEO would attend Board meetings is entirely consistent with this, and it is hardly surprising that Ms Batmanghelidjh was also expected to attend Finance Committee meetings, not least because of the significance of her fundraising work. Attendance of one or more representatives of the executive team at both Board and Board committee meetings was essential for the Board and its committees to operate effectively: their presence was necessary to answer directors’ questions and to receive instructions, as well as to provide information and advice.  </p>

The evidence indicates that before she left discussions were principally undertaken by Ms Chipperfield. Thereafter Ms Jenkins was involved as well as Ms Batmanghelidjh, although as discussed at [333] above Ms Batmanghelidjh took the leading role. There is nothing remarkable in this. Dealing with HMRC is an executive function that was properly carried out by staff members. The level of involvement by Trustees once they became aware of material issues was appropriate. For example, Mr O’Brien confirmed that he would have been told about HMRC’s letter dated 8 March 2013 (referred to at [318] above). Ms Tyler said that there were regular questions in meetings about the position with HMRC and whether the charity was keeping to time with its payments. I accept this. The position with HMRC, and in particular whether it was up-to-date with payments, was covered in management account information (in particular, in the “Management Accounts Summary Report” referred to below in relation to loans) and minutes indicate discussion in Trustee meetings. To take one example of this, at the Finance Committee meeting on 18 July 2013, Ms Tyler is reported as asking whether the charity was keeping to its deal with HMRC. </p>

The specific provision relied on by Ms Anderson simply stated that PAYE could be processed by the Head of Finance in amounts in excess of the authorisation limits. Elsewhere the Manual made it clear that it was the task of the Head of Finance to submit assessments to HMRC and make monthly payments, and more generally that it was the overall responsibility of the Finance team to ensure accurate and timely payment of creditors, including PAYE. My overall assessment is that the Finance team had and sought to discharge this responsibility, that Ms Batmanghelidjh got involved when major issues arose after Ms Chipperfield left, and that the Board was alerted both to major issues and more generally as to the extent to which payments were either up-to-date or overdue. In my view the Board was appropriately exercising a supervisory role. </p>

Taking out a loan of course involves taking on a commitment, and on that basis it could be said that loans in excess of £20,000 should have been authorised by the Trustees (see [696] above). It is also an exercise of the power to borrow that was expressly conferred on the Management Committee by the Articles (see [684] above). However, Ms Batmanghelidjh did not understand that the limits imposed by the Financial Procedures Manual applied to loans, and neither did the Trustees. It was also clear from the evidence that it was understood that Ms Batmanghelidjh was taking out loans from supporters, and was permitted to do so. (I also note that the loan from Mr Spiers was negotiated by Ms Chipperfield rather than by Ms Batmanghelidjh (see [361] above), albeit that Ms Batmanghelidjh had responsibility for it.) </p>

It also stated that the Trustees would need to work with Ms Batmanghelidjh to identify appropriate sources and negotiate sufficient facilities. I read this, as did Mr Yentob and Mr O’Brien when asked about it in cross-examination, as a recognition that the Trustees’ assistance in identifying philanthropists willing to help with short term loans was of value. The document neither stated that the Trustees had to be involved via an approval process, nor did it confer an authority to take out loans that did not previously exist. It simply recognised that Trustees could assist with their contacts. That interpretation is also consistent with an action point in the “next steps” section of the document which reads “Trustees to identify loan options with Camila”. A number of the lenders were known to Trustees, and in some cases were Trustees themselves. As regards the former, Mr Yentob for example spoke to Mr Roden about loans he made, and did in fact approve a £650,000 loan from Mr Roden in April 2014. He also confirmed in cross-examination that he was asked about loans made by Harvey McGrath and by Mr Frieda. </p>

Ms Anderson cross-examined  Ms Batmanghelidjh about the commissioning of two pieces of research, from the LSE and the University of Cambridge (discussed at [639] above), as examples of instances where it was said that research was commissioned without evidence of Trustee approval, in breach of the requirement in the Financial Procedures Manual for approval to be obtained for research commitments exceeding £20,000 (see paragraph [696] above, and assuming for these purposes that the same authority limits applied before the December 2013 version of that Manual was adopted). In both cases Ms Batmanghelidjh believed that the research had been discussed with the Trustees, even though this is not evident from the available minutes of meetings. However, the Cambridge contract was originally entered into in 2010, most of the Board minutes for which were not in evidence. The LSE contract was entered into in February 2013 with an initial value of around £43,000 (which was invoiced in July 2013), so it would appear to have required approval. </p>

Moreover, I did not read the Financial Procedures Manual as necessarily requiring a collective decision by Trustees, rather than approval from a Trustee. This reading is consistent with the way in which substantial cheques and invoices were dealt with. Cheque requests and invoices in excess of £20,000 were subject to Trustee approval, but this was not taken to mean collective approval in a meeting, at least where the expenditure had been budgeted for. If collective approval was required there would no doubt have been numerous references to such approvals in Board minutes. Rather, my understanding of the evidence is that the approval of an individual Trustee would typically have been sought, and that this was the way in which the controls were understood and operated. This conclusion is consistent with the way in which additional controls were imposed in December 2014: see [279] above. Furthermore, the detail included in monthly management accounts and budgets was such that it is unlikely that the commitments would not have become apparent. There is no evidence of any concern or objection being raised to the commissioning of any research.  </p>

I have already discussed the corporate governance structure in some detail and there is a separate section on the more general allegation of dominance from [579] above (also discussed further below).

The level of written information provided to Trustees, in particular the monthly management accounts packs and also the detailed risk register information (which was considered by the Governance Committee on a regular basis), is notable. There is and can be no suggestion that meetings were too infrequent. Decisions were taken, action points were noted, and there was appropriate follow up. Ms Batmanghelidjh undoubtedly exercised significant influence and was heavily consulted, and for most of the period in question the Trustees were sufficiently content with what she was doing not to require a change of direction, but it does not follow that she was either the ultimate decision maker or that she had parity with the Trustees in that respect. </p>

I do not agree with the suggestion in closing that any CEO of a charity doing a role that can be compared to that of a CEO of a commercial company is likely to be a de facto director. Whilst it is no doubt the case that the CEO of a commercial company would pretty much invariably be on the Board, the roles of CEO and director are distinct. At Board level, directors have the collective role of supervision and control described by Jonathan Parker J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Barings (No. 5)</span>. When carrying out executive functions as a CEO the individual in question is carrying out functions delegated by the Board, and is subject to supervision and control by the Board as a whole.

Expenditure on clients, in particular the “Top 25”, was regularly discussed (see from [546] above). As already explained, there is no criticism of any individual item of client expenditure. During late 2014 and the first part of 2015 the Trustees were taking active steps to recruit a further trustee with a clinical specialism (as well as another trustee with a background in finance). That reflected a wish to ensure that the Board did the best possible job, and in order to do so could benefit from a range of skills that included clinical expertise, but it did not mean that the absence of a clinical specialist meant that Ms Batmanghelidjh rose up in the hierarchy to fill a gap. </p>

My response to this particular point is that Ms Batmanghelidjh was indeed responsible for the operations of the charity, but this was under the delegated authority of the Board and subject to its supervision. Subject to the requirement for overall supervision, it was up to the Board to determine the extent of delegation. In relation to loans, the Board would in principle have been entitled to permit the executive team to arrange loans from supporters, and supervise this as the Finance Committee did through scrutiny of the management accounts. When the Board became uncomfortable with the level of loans, additional controls were put in place. Those additional controls also applied to other commitments. </p>

Whether the loans themselves adversely affected solvency as Ms Anderson suggested is rather questionable, since the loans were invariably taken out to meet other more pressing creditors and were taken from supporters who did not, in fact, take steps to insist on repayment.  </p>

No evidence was adduced to the effect that taking on loans in fact related to any of the conditions or had any impact on delivery, and the defendants had no opportunity to adduce evidence in response to the allegation. If anything, the fact that the loans allowed Kids Company to meet pressing obligations, including payroll, rather indicates that they assisted the charity in delivery of the relevant activities. </p>

The level of loans, and the identity of lenders, was subject to regular scrutiny.

At that meeting the Finance Committee considered the management accounts for May 2013. Those in fact showed staff costs under budget by around £200,000. However, the summary report provided by Mr Mevada with the management accounts gave the headcount figure at the end of June, that is 466 as against the budgeted 430. At the meeting Mr O’Brien is recorded as voicing a concern that staff numbers were higher than budget, with Ms Batmanghelidjh responding that people were leaving, that she wanted to reduce self-employed numbers, but the charity would have “slightly more staff than expected because the Bristol children are more disturbed than we thought”. She is also reported as saying that Bristol would provide more money for this. There are action points asking Mr Mevada to provide a breakdown of the extra people and an analysis of income and expenditure changes at Bristol, and for Mr Stones (who was by then head of HR, having joined in April 2013) to join future Finance Committee meetings. These action points obviously reflect requests from Trustees for additional information to support what Ms Batmanghelidjh was saying. </p>

There is an action point for Mr Stones and Ms Batmanghelidjh to provide Trustees with a breakdown of staff, highlighting which related to Bristol. There was clearly a discussion of the tension between the Trustees’ responsibility for good governance on the financial side, and the issue of clinical safety.

There were two references to the issue of staffing in Bristol, on days 28 and 29. On day 28 the subject came up in connection with the PKF Littlejohn report, which referred to Bristol and also included a statement in the context of budgeting that new appointments were approved in advance. When asked whether the latter statement was correct Mr Yentob confirmed that the matter would have been brought to either the Finance Committee or the Trustees “if they went significantly beyond what was in the budget”. He confirmed that he thought that any significant increase would have been approved, adding that he knew there were issues in 2014 because of requirements in Bristol and elsewhere, but was not quite sure whether there was approval in advance in respect of that. He commented that safeguarding was a critical issue, and referred to issues of child abuse in Bristol. He then made what appeared to be more general comments, not necessarily limited to 2014, about staffing issues and not being sure whether in certain cases the Board was informed about problems immediately. He also pointed out that it was the job of the executive team to bring matters to the Board’s attention, and as soon as Trustees were alerted they would try to address the issue. When pressed about what the PKF Littlejohn report said he stated that “by and large” he thought the Board did control new appointments, but would need clarification of exactly how the executive team and the Trustees interacted on the issue. </p>

What we discovered, or what Camila discovered, as she was there, that one of the reasons for their problems was the skill set of the staff and that they were understaffed. That safeguarding issue for Kids Company has been absolutely crucial, so having got there and found that out, she was concerned. And there was, during this year, a case of sexual abuse of children, which Kids Company was very much involved in disclosing, and this wouldn’t have been done if we didn’t have enough staff to talk to the children privately, to go into their family homes. So the Bristol work was very crucial, but I do accept that it did mean more staffing and that the question of what timing it was in which we had this conversation with Camila and whether she had committed in advance is an issue which is fairly made. </p>

I have to say that I do not think that it was fair to raise it in that way as an issue relevant to whether Ms Batmanghelidjh was a de facto director. The allegation was not put to her, nor was it clearly put to any of the Trustees, and it seems to have derived from a candid volunteering by Mr Yentob that he was unsure whether headcount increases were always agreed in advance. I also have to take account of the fact that Mr Yentob was neither on the Finance Committee nor the Governance Committee, at which staffing matters and the financial commitment that increased staffing entailed were discussed in most detail. In that context, I note that in an email sent by Mr O’Brien on 8 March 2015, in connection with the Sunday Times article published on that day, he referred to the growth in staff costs from 2013 to 2014 as being largely down to the Bristol contract, stated “we have always monitored and discussed the growth in staff costs and discussed it frequently, and occasionally heatedly, in trustee meetings”, and suggested making the point in any rebuttal that any growth in staff costs had been directed at dealing with growing demand. </p>

If that had not been the case before, the paper presented to the Governance Committee in March 2014 provides clear evidence that it was the case afterwards. There was no evidence as to what any earlier version of the Financial Procedures Manual required, and for example whether approval for any staff increase beyond budget was needed or whether there was some different provision, such as approval for material increases above budget. (Compare for example the reference to 10% variance at [694] above, noting that overall staff costs for 2013 were around 3% over budget whilst overall staff numbers ended up by about 15% on a full-time equivalent basis, but this included self-employed staff who would generally be regarded as easier to get rid of.) </p>

Even if that burden had been discharged, I am not persuaded that it would be a clear indicator that Ms Batmanghelidjh was operating on an equal footing with the Board, rather than simply that she and other members of the executive team wrongly exceeded the delegated authority they had been given on this particular occasion for what they obviously viewed as strong operational reasons. </p>

An email Ms Batmanghelidjh sent to Ms Dellal on 6 April 2015 refers to receipt of funds enabling her to be repaid in full, and the way the email is expressed indicates that it was Ms Batmanghelidjh’s wish to repay her. In relation to ICAP there was an email from Ms Hamilton to Mr Mevada on 23 January 2015 in which Ms Hamilton stated “We clearly have to pay the loan back”. A similar message was reflected in an email from Mr Mevada to Mr Handover on 6 April 2015, reporting a conversation between Ms Batmanghelidjh and Mr Yentob in which she confirmed that ICAP needed to be repaid because they were chasing and would be donating the same amount.  </p>

The Trustees took responsibility for determining that some lenders regarded as significant to the charity’s future should be repaid, and it was they who were also responsible for leaving other decisions in relation to creditors to the executive team, and not specifically to Ms Batmanghelidjh. </p>

That does not of itself demonstrate that Ms Batmanghelidjh joined in decisions, as opposed to reporting and then allowing the Trustees to reach decisions. Furthermore, the fact that in many cases the Trustees appear to have accepted what Ms Batmanghelidjh said, or not insisted on a change of tack, does not by itself determine that she was joining in decisions. For example, if staff numbers had been increased without advance approval, there would have been at least two decisions open to the Board, namely either to note the reasons for the increase, accept it and monitor it, or alternatively to reach a conclusion that it was not acceptable and that further steps needed to be taken, such as a recruitment freeze or headcount reduction. The latter is a clear indicator of an exercise of control and would provide some positive support for the proposition that Ms Batmanghelidjh was not participating in decisions (although even that is subject to the possibility that she was taking part but was outvoted), but the former does not itself demonstrate that Ms Batmanghelidjh was operating on an equal footing by joining in decisions. It is consistent with the Trustees exercising a supervisory role and concluding that they were content with what the executive team was doing. I note that Trustees were not asked exactly how decisions were reached at meetings. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">My findings on the question of dominance do demonstrate that Ms Batmanghelidjh was making the majority of the decisions (see [588] above), but that this reflected the significant level of delegated authority she had. There was a desire for the Board to get more involved in the development of future strategy rather than the focus being on reporting, although as Mr Webster rightly commented it would be expected that plans would first be developed by the executive team ([586] above). However, it is also clear that from December 2014 the Board regularly asserted its authority and clearly overrode Ms Batmanghelidjh’s wishes on a number of occasions. It was not easy and Ms Batmanghelidjh often pushed back (as illustrated for example from the frustration evident in Ms Robinson’s email of 25 March, referred to at [300] above), but the Trustees persisted. Examples already touched on include insisting on curbs in expenditure and not taking on additional loans, rejecting Ms Batmanghelidjh’s recommendation that the location of the company’s headquarters be moved to her preferred location at County Hall, and ultimately insisting on a significant restructuring plan and a radical change of role for Ms Batmanghelidjh. Other more minor examples would include the settlement reached with Ms Caldwell (to which Ms Batmanghelidjh was strongly opposed), refusal of a requested salary increase for a senior staff member, and insistence on removal of a former headteacher following the meeting with staff on 20 January 2015. Before December 2014 there are also indications of the exercise of control, most significantly in the annual budgeting process, which was the main control on the company’s level of activity, but also other matters. A few examples would be the approval of the expansion to Bristol (to which I would add other expansions to different centres in London and elsewhere, there being no suggestion that these strategic decisions were not approved at Board level), the strengthening of the senior management team (a process in which the Trustees were heavily involved), an insistence on headcount freezes, decisions about pay rises and a decision not to renew Ms Chipperfield’s fixed term contract in 2013, despite Ms Batmanghelidjh’s preference for her to stay. </p>

I am confident that this is the case by reference to the case as put in the Official Receiver’s reports. The case as developed at trial was stronger. However, taking full account of the case as now put, I remain of the view that the case is not made out. In reaching this conclusion I have borne in mind the need, when determining whether someone is a de facto director, to take into account all relevant factors and look at the matter in the round (<span style="font-style:italic">Smithton v Naggar</span> at [40]). There is a critical difference between an approach which looks at each element individually and determines that that element does not prove the Official Receiver’s case, and standing back to look at the position overall. I have considered the individual elements but, having done so, reach my overall conclusion in the round, focusing on what Ms Batmanghelidjh actually did and how that related to the role of the Board. </p>

Ms Anderson submitted that this was of particular relevance where the Trustees’ response to a number of the allegations referred to their reliance on the executive team led by Ms Batmanghelidjh. However, what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Chohan</span> on this point does not displace the need to demonstrate that the relevant individual was, in fact, occupying the position of a director. Further, the Trustees accepted that they had ultimate responsibility for the way in which the charity was run. Fundamentally, reliance on the executive team in relation to such matters as arranging loans and managing creditors does not affect the key elements of the way in which the business was run, in particular operating a model which allowed expenditure to be incurred without necessarily having secured the corresponding income. The Trustees, to their credit, were not seeking to deflect responsibility for that by blaming Ms Batmanghelidjh. </p>

Arden LJ added at [42] that whether the company considered the individual to be a de facto director is relevant, so the Trustees’ view of the position must be relevant. This makes sense. Ms Batmanghelidjh could only be a de facto director if they allowed her status to be elevated.  The corporate governance structure (see the discussion section at [697] to [703] in particular) was clear and in my view was understood by all of them. For most of the charity’s life Ms Batmanghelidjh was accorded a significant degree of delegated authority, which she used to the full and on occasion may have exceeded. Her views were also accorded significant respect. But neither of those points put her on an equal footing with the Trustees. She was at all times subject to the Board’s supervision. </p>

But in principle there is a distinction between decision-making at the level of a director, and making decisions under delegated authority, subject to supervision. A person engaged to perform delegated functions, who is subject to supervision and control by the directors, cannot properly be said to have assumed the duties of a director simply because of some indeterminate dividing line between what might be regarded as an appropriate or inappropriate level of delegation. The extent and nature of the decision making is relevant, but it is not determinative. (I would add that, if the position were otherwise, it would be impossible to determine what the criteria would be for determining when someone acting under delegated authority should be treated as a de facto director, and it would throw into doubt the status not only of many individuals with executive functions who work in the charitable sector, but that of many in the commercial world as well.)   </p>

The substance of the case that the defendant is required to meet must be set out (<span style="font-style:italic">Re Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd </span>[1988] (Ch) 477 at pp.486-487 per Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson VC; <span style="font-style:italic">Re Sevenoaks Stationers (Retail) Ltd</span> [1991] (Ch) 164 at pp.176-177 per Dillon LJ; <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Goldberg</span> [2003] EWHC 2843 at [51] per Lewison J). The defendant should be able to ascertain with clarity exactly what the allegations are and on what evidence the applicant intends to rely, and there is a duty not to overstate the case against the defendant, to put it in a balanced way, and not to omit significant evidence in their favour (<span style="font-style:italic">Re Finelist</span> [2004] BCC 877 at [16] to [21]).  </p>

Mr Bompas fairly made the point that it is not the case that the Official Receiver should be seeking a win at all costs. I am not going to attempt to list all the concerns raised, but there are two instances that were raised by Mr Westwood in closing which I think are worth highlighting as particular examples, one in relation to the reports and one in relation to the development of the case at trial: </p>

I would add to this the related point discussed in the same section about the letter of representation to the auditors which Ms Hamilton signed, and which had not been included in the trial bundle. The difference between the cash flows was not raised as an issue in Mr Hannon’s report, so it had clearly not been picked up during the course of a long and intensive investigation. It was raised for the first time in the Official Receiver’s skeleton argument, not leaving a proper opportunity for the defendants to investigate the matter and respond, and in particular not affording them a proper opportunity to make enquiries of Mr Mevada or the auditors. The point was obviously not put to Mr Mevada in interview or in follow-up questions. This example is noteworthy not only from a procedural perspective, but because it was thought appropriate to criticise Trustees for not picking up something at extremely short notice that the Official Receiver’s team had failed to pick up during their lengthy investigation. The letter of representation is also important because the Official Receiver sought to allege that staff had not said that they thought the charity was a going concern, despite having possession of what is on any basis a significant letter in which Ms Hamilton did provide such a confirmation. </p>

It is worth recalling that this was not based on groundless optimism: see [243] above for the auditors’ comments in May 2014 that “income levels for 2014 look healthy and also achievable”.

In summary, reserves in the form of liquid resources would have been desirable, and there is some validity in a criticism of their absence, but creating them was much easier said than done. It is also important to note that there is no legal requirement for reserves, and their absence did not prevent unqualified audit opinions being provided. Creating reserves would have involved diverting resources from meeting the increasing level of need that the charity existed to serve. The decision to prioritise spending on charitable objects is one that, in my view, the Trustees could reasonably reach. Further, whilst not having reserves might increase the risk of failure (albeit that reserves would not necessarily ensure survival where income fell away: see [822] below), their absence during the charity’s life self evidently did not make its model “unsustainable”.  </p>

Charities are, of course, commonly dependent on donations. Donations are, by their nature, difficult to predict with confidence, both as to amount and timing of receipt. Kids Company cannot be criticised for that. The combination of this, the lack of reserves and the nature of Kids Company’s charitable activities, with the bulk of its costs being staff costs that were not straightforward to cut, made for a potentially high risk enterprise. But, without more, that does not mean that the model was “unsustainable”.  </p>

This was in response to cuts following the financial crisis and also reflected the replication of Kids Company’s activities, particularly in Bristol. But expansion would not make the charity’s “model” unsustainable if adequate funds could be raised to meet expenditure. It would become unsustainable if and when that was no longer the case, either because circumstances changed such that it was no longer possible to fundraise as before, or the charity was allowed to expand beyond its capacity to fundraise. </p>

In that sense, there is no dispute about unsustainability. This was precisely why Kids Company was lobbying government for a material increase in statutory funding from the autumn of 2013 onwards, as discussed in detail above. It is also important to note that the increased costs reflected in the 2014 Budget did not reflect further material expansion of the charity but rather, for example, the full year effect of increases the previous year (see [233] above). </p>

It was fully recognised both by Ms Batmanghelidjh and by the Trustees that she could not carry on fundraising as she had indefinitely, but the charity can hardly be criticised for making full use of her fundraising skills while they were available, at least provided appropriate consideration was given to plans for the future (as I conclude that the Trustees were attempting to do). She was also not alone: the fundraising team numbered around 18 staff on a full time basis ([513] above). Trustees also played an active role in fundraising. </p>

It is not the case that fundraising became increasingly difficult by 2013, as the Official Receiver alleged. The charity was also not simply dependent on a “small pool” of donors and “ad hoc” donations as he suggested. As explained at [521] above, there was recognition that the burden of increasing need could not continue to be met entirely from non-statutory sources, but it does not follow that it was unreasonable to continue operating without immediate severe cuts, bearing in mind not only the indications from government but also the support the Trustees believed that the charity had from philanthropists. </p>

Where I depart from her analysis is the submission that all that needs to be considered is the director’s responsibility for liabilities exceeding assets, rather than the causes of the company being wound up. A natural reading of the words provides a strong indication that the concept of “becomes insolvent” or “becoming insolvent” encompasses not only the existence of balance sheet insolvency (assets being less than liabilities) but also the fact of going into liquidation. That interpretation would also seem to me to accord best with the aims of the legislation. What is encapsulated by the definition in s 6(2) has two limbs, namely (a) going into liquidation, and (b) doing so at a time when liabilities (and expenses of winding </p>

A schedule was produced comparing creditors as at 9 March 2015 (as provided to the bank on that date) and what was said to be a list of creditors at the date of liquidation. That list dated from 2017, is clearly an estimate of individual amounts owed, and did not include a total figure. Although an updated list was produced during the trial the comparison provided to the court was not done by reference to the updated list, and moreover it appears that there is a significant discrepancy between the Official Receiver’s updated estimate of total liabilities (£10.38m) and the actual claims received (£7.6m). </p>

I was not provided with an aggregate figure, but by my rough calculations these amounts total around £175,000. In the context of this charity and the allegations made, this is relatively modest. It also of course takes no account of the fact that, for a number of these creditors, debts may have been repaid and replaced by others. I note that, as stated at [600] above, the management accounts for April 2015 indicate that creditors more than three months old amounted to around £220,000 at 30 April, as compared to around £550,000 a month earlier. The management accounts for June 2015, the last set produced, show creditors more than three months old amounting to around £212,000. This strongly indicates that the great majority of the company’s debts at the point of liquidation were relatively recently accrued. This does not support a case that the scale of the insolvency should properly be attributed to long term failures to pay creditors.  </p>

Their investigation completed only in January 2016 (when they not only dropped the investigation but reported that they had not identified any failings by the charity in its safeguarding duties). If the charity had built up reserves equivalent to three months of operating expenditure (see [528] above – what I understood to be an uncontroversial aspiration) that would have been well short of what was required. Mr Roden’s view, as reported by Mr Handover during a telephone conference on 31 July 2015, was that “his ability to raise funds while [the allegations were] unresolved was almost impossible”. Ms Batmanghelidjh’s affidavit evidence also pointed out that she thought it would have taken at least six months to regain donor confidence after the police investigation completed.

This features in various forms in the Official Receiver’s case, in particular allegations of failure by the Trustees to take adequate action to control expenditure in the context of rapid growth and increasing financial difficulties, inadequate control of the CEO (who always prioritised clients’ needs), inadequate financial controls, trading at an increasing deficiency of income to expenditure (with increasing reliance on short-term loans, bringing funding forwards, circulation of credit, delaying payments to creditors and year-end accruals), relying on overoptimistic statutory funding projections and failing adequately to consider the risk of donor fatigue (see [55] above). </p>

The Official Receiver relied on Kids Company’s monthly management accounts to assert that Kids Company was “cash flow insolvent at all material times and balance sheet insolvent the vast majority of the time”. Ms Anderson pointed to the extent of aged creditors shown in the management accounts as demonstrating that creditors could not be paid on time (details of creditors more than three months old were included from January 2014 onwards: see [265] above). She referred to the problems that arose in 2012, with an increase in staff and a cash deficit remaining at the end of the year. She referred to a significant increase in spending during 2013 and material cash flow difficulties, as shown by the problems with HMRC in that year, which involved what Ms Anderson submitted was an unacceptable use of statutory debt monies as working capital. By the year end accruals had materially increased and the surplus was, she said, on a balance sheet basis only. Ms Anderson submitted that the pattern continued in 2014, with a substantial value of aged creditors every month (averaging in the region of £500,000 of creditors over three months old), an increase in the budget despite structural problems not being resolved, the 2013 accounts being signed off despite a negative cash flow statement for the following 12 months, and no real progress with the government. She argued that the only real change at the end of 2014 was a recruitment freeze. In 2015, she said that there were further unsuccessful attempts to secure funding from government, and the grant for 2015/16 was spent in a month, showing that the model was unsustainable.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in">The Official Receiver’s focus was on Kids Company’s monthly management accounts. Its statutory accounts were ignored or sought to be discounted. There are significant differences between the two sets of accounts. The statutory accounts were produced under accounting principles the overriding requirement of which is that the accounts show a true and fair view. Unqualified audit opinions were provided in respect of them. In the absence of a successful challenge to those audited accounts, they must in my view be treated as a more accurate reflection of the overall financial position of the charity. For example, the 2012 and 2013 statutory accounts both show positive net current assets (see [211] and [218] above). These facts cannot be dismissed simply because audited accounts reflect accruals that were not included in the management accounts. I have discussed the Official Receiver’s criticisms in relation to accruals in the audited accounts from [379] above. In summary, the charity accounted for accruals as it was required to do under accounting principles. The Trustees had no cause to doubt the correctness of the accruals, and they are in any event not by themselves a reliable indicator of cash flow difficulties. The scale of accruals did increase, but the evidence in relation to the position in 2014 indicates that the increase was not unrelenting.  </p>

As discussed from [219] above, I do not accept the Official Receiver’s criticisms about those accounts being signed off on a going concern basis. Accounts signed off on that basis, with the benefit of an unqualified audit opinion which confirmed that there were no significant matters arising from the audit, are not consistent with the company’s business model being “unsustainable”. This is highly relevant to the Official Receiver’s allegation that the defendants knew or should have known by (or indeed in the period after) 27 September 2013 that Kids Company had an unsustainable business model. </p>

In summary, I am not persuaded that the Trustees could not properly have formed the view at the time that the charity could continue as a going concern. The fact that the 2013 accounts were signed off on a going concern basis in the circumstances described is highly relevant to the allegation that the defendants knew or ought to have known that “failure was inevitable without immediate material change” at a date shortly afterwards. If it was, and the Trustees were aware or ought to have been aware of that, then it is very hard to see how the accounts could have been approved on a going concern basis. Not only were the auditors prepared to give an unqualified opinion, which again confirmed that there were no significant matters arising from the audit, but Ms Hamilton, who had clearly seen both versions of the cash flow, was content to confirm that it was appropriate to prepare the accounts on the basis that Kids Company was a going concern.

She would not have signed the letter of representation had she not felt sufficiently informed to do so.

These reflect the seasonal nature of the charity’s income, with a significant proportion of its income arising in the latter part of the year whilst expenditure was incurred relatively evenly across the year (see [185] above). The figures for 2013 and 2014 show, as might be expected, deficits increasing over the first part of the year and then reducing later in the year. Clearly, for months in which the deficit reduces there is no “increasing deficiency”. Both 2012 and 2013 finished with surpluses (in the latter case I note by reference to the management as well as audited accounts), and in relation to 2014 I have concluded that, at the least, it was not expected that there would be a material deficit, and that the Trustees were expecting the charity to break even (see from [282] above). </p>

However, I would emphasise the relevance of the timing of discussions with the government in relation to the dates selected by the Official Receiver as dates by which the defendants should have appreciated that the business model was unsustainable, 27 September 2013 and 30 November 2014.  If funding had come through as the Trustees reasonably believed was in prospect at those dates, then it is unlikely that material change (assuming that to mean significant cuts) would have been needed. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In very brief summary, there was a significant amount of contact between Kids Company and senior members of the government. It is worth noting that the first date selected by the Official Receiver, 27 September 2013, falls shortly after the charity had elicited an additional £500,000 on top of the grant that had been agreed only a short time earlier. Further and importantly, there were discussions from September 2013 onwards about the provision by the government of “sustainable” funding (meaning funding at a materially higher level than previously), as evidenced in writing by Mr Hurd on 9 December ([449] above). In addition, there was a very supportive letter from the Prime Minister on 8 January 2014 ([452] above).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Kids Company’s pressure on the government increased during the second half of 2014. There were further positive indications about substantial additional funding, and indications that the government did not want Kids Company to close centres, but no actual promise of additional funds. A meeting with and letter from Mr Letwin on 22 December 2014 appeared to leave a promising prospect of additional funding for 2016/17, with the position for 2015/16 less promising, albeit that in my view it was not unreasonable to conclude that there was a real prospect of further support being found during that period if it was necessary. Discussions continued, and even in late February 2015 Mr Yentob (who thought the events of 22 December disappointing) still believed that some additional funding could be obtained for 2015/16. Thereafter, the position became more difficult, although Kids Company managed to secure an immediate payment of its 2015/16 grant in one lump sum in early April, together with a promise of immediate further talks, and ultimately secured a restructuring grant in July 2015. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">I have also explained at [617] above that, in order to know how expenditure should be scaled back (which would require the closure of one or more centres to achieve material savings), it would be necessary to understand what could be funded in the future. That would in turn require an understanding of the priorities of the proposed funders, whether in the government or private sector. The grant offer for 2015/16, finalised during March 2015, contemplated the closure of the Urban Academy and Kids Company’s operations in Bristol if alternative funding could not be secured. Prior to March 2015 the options were unclear: see for example the summary of the contingency plan intended for discussion at the meeting on 18 February discussed at [291] and [292] above, which referred to a possible closure of Arches II. When, during March 2015, the position became clearer the Trustees pushed for the plan to be implemented (see in particular [297] to [306] above). However, even after March there was some uncertainty, given the upcoming general election and Harriet Harman’s statement ([499] above), together with the possibility of alternative funding, in particular under the free school programme (see also [623] above). After the election in early May, the combination of significant cash flow problems due to expected donations not arriving and the continued lack of committed additional funding from the government – together with the indication from Ms Casey that funding from the </p>

In particular, as at 30 November 2014 the Trustees were still genuinely, and not unreasonably, hopeful of substantial additional statutory funding being found. Nonetheless a detailed contingency plan was prepared, albeit that it took longer than the Trustees wished: see [622] above. Once it became clearer what cuts were likely to be required the Trustees pushed for them to be implemented during March 2015. A combination of a worsened financial position and a continued lack of additional committed statutory funding then led to the focus turning to a more radical restructuring plan. </p>

In summary, Ms Batmanghelidjh did have a central role, including in developing strategy, but she was subject to supervision and control by the Trustees. They were the ultimate decision makers: see [588], [741] and [744] above in particular. It is true that Ms Batmanghelidjh was resistant to change, which contributed to the difficulties of implementing cuts (see for example [622] above), but for the reasons given in the section discussing the timing of change to her role (see from [624] above), the Trustees had good reason to tread carefully. </p>

For some 18 years her skills, including her fundraising ability, made a very material – and by most standards pretty extraordinary – contribution to the charity, enabling it not only to survive but to grow very significantly. That is an indication of a successful model, not an unsustainable one. In financial terms it could remain so for so long as Kids Company could raise the funds required to meet its expenditure. </p>

Secondly, as discussed further below, the question is not whether it would have been <span style="font-style:italic">a</span> reasonable course of action to restructure earlier, but whether the Trustees’ conduct amounts to incompetence of a high degree. Self-evidently, the two are not the same.

As summarised at [577], the Trustees were not aware, nor ought they to have been aware, of any major issue in respect of policy compliance. They exercised real scrutiny over expenditure and were entitled to gain comfort from external reports. They were entitled to expect staff to draw any major concerns to their attention.  </p>

The Official Receiver confirmed in witness evidence for the pretrial review that he was not challenging the appropriateness of any particular spending on any individual client. Even if he was it would be pretty hard to see how the allegation properly fits with the so-called single allegation. Whether a model is sustainable or not does not straightforwardly turn on whether spending that was on any basis in accordance with Kids Company’s charitable objectives was (by some unspecified standard) excessive or inappropriate, or indeed on whether particular policies were adhered to. But in any event it does not really fit with the case as presented in closing, which appeared to recognise the reality that the costs the focus of Mr Tatham’s report, which the defendants were said not properly to oversee and scrutinise, were pretty immaterial in the context of the financial challenges facing the charity: see [553] above. I reject the suggestion that it is possible to extrapolate from the alleged failures in respect of kids costs to a lack of control of staff and other costs. There is no real basis for that, and any weight that might be put on it is weakened by Mr Tatham’s focus on the Top 25 rather than the position of the vast majority of clients dealt with at the centres (see for example [556] above). </p>

This was not required to support the case actually put against the Trustees in respect of kids costs. That case goes to what the Trustees did or did not do in terms of scrutiny, testing adherence to policies and considering whether to adjust them. It was always unrealistic to put a case that asserted that volunteer Trustees were expected to have discovered alleged issues with individual client records that Mr Tatham and two other staff seem to have spent most of a year working on.  </p>

Whilst the work might have been used for a different allegation against Ms Batmanghelidjh, the allegation made against her was the same as against the Trustees, and she was not cross-examined on the topic. But the net effect of including Mr Tatham’s work was to make the task of managing the defence of an already diffuse case, with significant documentation, even harder, and to increase costs significantly (including, for example, costs incurred in redacting confidential client information). It also led to understandable concerns on the part of certain of the charity’s former clients, which the court was required to address both at the pre-trial review and at the trial. </p>

But I also agree with Mr Westwood and with Mr Margolin, who made similar submissions on this point, that this does not mean that the fact that Kids Company was a charity should be ignored. This is because, in determining whether someone is unfit to be concerned in the management of a company, the test of unfitness must be applied to the facts of the case. What must be assessed is the individual’s conduct, and that must be evaluated in its context. That context, or setting, must include the nature of the company and its activities, </p>

An important aspect of the role is to ensure that material risks are identified and managed, including financial risks. In addition, the extent of delegation that can properly be made to, and reliance that can be placed on, staff members will depend on the circumstances. In particular it will depend on whether the directors have reason to be concerned about the competence or integrity of the relevant staff member or members, the quality of information being provided, or their willingness to carry out the Board’s instructions. Where issues of that nature arise and cannot be dealt with by a director with executive responsibility, non-executive directors would need to consider what should be done to address the issues that have arisen, for example by replacing staff or recruiting additional staff.  </p>

Beyond that, the extent of follow-up would depend on the significance of the issue and whether there was any cause for concern, for example a doubt arising as to whether an agreed action has been implemented.

They may properly take the view that it is in the interests of the company and its creditors that some loss-making trade should be accepted in anticipation of future profitability. They are not to be criticised if they give effect to such views, properly held.” </p>

They were seeking to meet Kids Company’s charitable objectives, and in doing so not only to address the significant needs of the charity’s vulnerable clients for whom the charity provided a very real safety net, but to have proper regard to safety and safeguarding issues (which included ensuring that the work was properly staffed). They were required continually to assess whether sufficient funding could be obtained, both from the government and private sources, and whether the position with creditors could be appropriately managed. The decisions they made were matters of honest judgment, made in difficult circumstances in what they thought were the best interests of the charity. The Official Receiver has not demonstrated that decisions that the Trustees took, or failed to take, in the factual context were outside a range of reasonable decision-making, and in my view the Trustees’ conduct does not amount to incompetence of a high degree.  </p>

This reflects the requirement of reg. 3(3) Insolvent Companies (Disqualification of Unfit Directors) Proceedings Rules 1987. In my view, more should have been done to assist the court as well as the defendants in understanding the case against each defendant individually, by reference to the duties and responsibilities each had or assumed, the part that they played in the alleged conduct, and the degree to which they are said to be responsible for it.  </p>

He referred to the example of an alleged failure to institute adequate financial controls. For a director not actually charged with instituting them that might amount to a breach of a duty to use best endeavours to procure their institution, but the mere absence of controls would not, without more, constitute a breach (the director in question might, for example, have done his best to introduce them, or I would add might have reasonable grounds to believe that they existed). </p>

He was assiduous in his work as Chair of the Finance Committee, frequently challenged Ms Batmanghelidjh and pointed out financial risks in the clearest terms. But he appropriately recognised that decision making was a collective process, in which the Trustees were balancing different risks. He fully participated in that process and did not distance himself from responsibility for it. For example, he would personally have preferred to reduce the charity’s cost base at an earlier stage, but he accepted the majority view. The Official Receiver also accepted that Mr O’Brien’s resignation was reasonable. It is unfortunate that these proceedings have not only deprived other charities of his significant skills and experience, but that he has also been prevented from taking on new roles in the financial services sector.

However, the sharpest differences between the position of Ms Batmanghelidjh and the Trustees arose in the period after 30 November 2014, the later of the dates relied on by the Official Receiver. Those differences are not clearly relevant to the question of whether the allegation or allegations actually put are made out. In particular, any failure to implement a contingency plan or restructuring immediately after 30 November reflected the decision making of the Trustees rather than action or inaction by Ms Batmanghelidjh. </p>

The factual context would include Ms Batmanghelidjh’s actions in successfully building Kids Company from its foundation in 1996 to what, by 2013, was a very significant and in many ways highly regarded operation. It would also include the fact that, throughout, Ms Batmanghelidjh was driven by a strong desire to protect the charity’s vulnerable beneficiaries, and that she did ultimately agree to a significant change to her role. Further, she had been making it clear to government and others that the funding model needed to change. The factors referred to at [651] above would in addition need to be considered as potential extenuating circumstances.  </p>

The allegation(s) made are of central importance, and great care should be taken to ensure that they are clearly framed, both so that the defendants can fairly understand and prepare for the case they have to meet, and so that the court can properly address it. Once the allegation(s) are framed and the proceedings have commenced, the claimant should not assume that the court will be prepared to allow the case as put to be altered or added to. Central, and real, difficulties with this case have been a lack of clarity about exactly what the allegation or allegations meant, and a tendency for criticisms made of the defendants to expand and alter. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">My perception is that more emphasis needs to be placed on the requirements of balance and fairness in assembling reports and other evidence. This affects the investigation process – for example the choice of whom to interview and the questions asked – as well as the content of the documentary evidence. For example, Mr Tatham’s key criticisms about missing records in relation to clients appear to have been made without the benefit of interviews with staff members who might have been best able to assist in relation to that topic, and with what seems to have been insufficient weight placed on Mr Kerman’s views. Ms Jenkins was also not interviewed, which given her role during key periods and in respect of key events (including the 2012 statutory accounts, the 2014 Budget and the cash forecast produced for the July 2015 restructuring) appears to be a surprising omission.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Generally, I was concerned that both Mr Hannon and Mr Tatham appeared to have had insufficient appreciation of the importance of the duty to present the case in a balanced way. There is no reason to doubt that this reflects a wider issue within the Department, rather than individual failings. This point is not simply a matter for the court. The content of the Official Receiver’s reports determined the decision by the relevant team to permit the proceedings to be brought, and the decision about the period of disqualification to seek. It must be borne in mind that, for proceedings of this nature with potentially penal consequences, the existence of the proceedings themselves can have extremely significant consequences for defendants. In many cases there will also be no review by the court, because the defendant chooses to accept a disqualification undertaking. The decision whether to bring disqualification proceedings should be reached with real care, with proper regard to all relevant issues. The information presented to enable that decision to be made should be presented “warts and all” to ensure that the decision to proceed, which requires a conclusion that a disqualification order is “expedient in the public interest” (s 7(1) CDDA), is fully informed. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The requirement for the Official Receiver to present a balanced case extends to submissions on his behalf. Whilst this group of defendants were fortunate enough to be well advised, I think it would have been difficult for many defendants to ensure that sufficient context was provided in connection with individual criticisms, and to ensure that other relevant documents were identified which could cast a different light on documents on which the Official Receiver placed particular emphasis. Even with assistance from the defendants’ advisers, it was frequently a challenge for the court to seek to ensure that, overall, it had a balanced and fair understanding of the overall position in this case. </p>

There is a risk that the overall length and structure of reports and exhibits, and thus the presentation and conduct of the case overall, can amount to oppression. Real care is needed to minimise the risk of that occurring. An obvious example in this case is the significant proportion of Mr Tatham’s report dealing with individual clients, in a way that was at best disproportionate to the very limited role that that evidence properly played in the single allegation, and as already discussed was in reality not required to support the case that was put.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The reports also included a significant number of quotations, which contributed to length. Two difficulties with these were, first, that they showed a tendency to be selective, such that a reader who did not consult the underlying document could well be left with the wrong impression, and secondly that it was often not possible for the reader (including in particular the defendants) to determine without further enquiry whether the Official Receiver was asserting the truth of the content of all or part of the quotation. Both aspects are unsatisfactory. On the whole I think it would have been better to direct the reader to consider specified documents in full, rather than set out lengthy quotations, and make clear what it is said that the particular document demonstrates. Simply appending full versions of documents does not, without more, address concerns about unbalanced statements or quotations, because unless asked to do so it is unlikely that most readers, including I suspect those charged with deciding whether to authorise the proceedings to be brought, will read much of the exhibits to a report where the total exhibits are extremely lengthy, as they were in this case. </p>

This was not a case alleging dishonesty or want of probity, but an allegation of incompetence against the directors and a manager of a charitable company, who had made no personal gain from any of the alleged conduct, and who with one exception were all unpaid. The periods of disqualification being sought against the Trustees were in the lowest of the three brackets referred to by Dillon LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Sevenoaks Stationers (Retail) Ltd</span> [1991] (Ch) 164 at 174 (being “relatively, not very serious”). The resources involved in bringing the proceedings (not only those of the Insolvency Service, but court resources as well), and the scale and nature of the case that the defendants had to defend, need to be carefully considered against this backdrop. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">More generally, it was unsatisfactory that Mr Hannon was unable to give a proper explanation in oral evidence of the basis on which different periods of disqualification were being sought for the Trustee defendants (2.5 years for Ms Bolton, 3 years for Mr O’Brien and 4 years for the others). On the face of it, the different periods sought sat uneasily with the insistence that the allegation was one of collective failure, and that more did not need to be done to specify the acts or omissions of each individual which were alleged to amount to unfitness. Apart from the periods in office, which has already been touched on, other possibilities that I speculate might have been used as distinguishing factors included the individual skills and experience of the directors (in relation to which there was really no information in the reports), or the extent of their roles on Board committees. The fact that Ms Bolton was on neither the Finance Committee or the Governance Committee might have been the reason for the lower period sought in relation to her. But the overall impression given by Mr Hannon’s first report is that it may have been a lower level of engagement and attendance at meetings (rather than non-membership of committees) that was the relevant mitigating factor. Whilst differences in duties and responsibilities are relevant, to treat or to appear to treat non-engagement or non-attendance at meetings more leniently risks sending a dangerous signal.  </p>

I think this affected their approach and, for example, contributed to some inappropriate assumptions being made as to what should have been done by the Trustees. Although Mr Hannon had obviously attempted to gain some familiarity by speaking to the Charity Commission and going on a training course, this was not able to make up for the lack of experience.  </p>

At the least, this might in practice reduce the risk of charity trustees being held to inappropriately different standards depending on whether the charity in question happens to be incorporated.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The charity sector depends on there being capable individuals with a range of different skills who are prepared to take on trusteeship roles. Most charities would, I would think, be delighted to have available to them individuals with the abilities and experience that the Trustees in this case possess. It is vital that the actions of public bodies do not have the effect of dissuading able and experienced individuals from becoming or remaining charity trustees. Disqualification proceedings, or the perceived risk of them, based on wide ranging but unclear allegations of incompetence rather than any want of probity, carry a high risk of having just that effect, and great caution is therefore required. This is particularly so for individuals otherwise involved in the management of businesses, and professionals for whom additional regulatory issues may arise: in fact, the sorts of individuals whose experience is often most needed. The result of proceedings being brought in other than the clearest of cases is likely to be to deter many talented individuals who take the trouble to understand and appreciate the risks either from charitable trusteeship at all, or at least from all but the most wealthy, well endowed, charities which are likely to have least need of their skills. </p>
