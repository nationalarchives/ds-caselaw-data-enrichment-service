In the Contract Claim (which is Claim No BL-2018-002369), Musst Holdings Limited sues  Astra Asset Management UK Limited (“Astra UK”) and Astra Asset Management LLP (“Astra LLP”) for fees for effecting two introductions, and for access to their books and records to assess all the fees that are properly due to them or an account.  The term “Musst” is used for Musst Holdings Limited.  Where it is intended to refer to the Musst group of companies, the term “MUSST” is used.  The term “Astra” is used collectively for the Defendants in the Contract Claim.  In the Defamation Claim (which is Claim No BL-2019-001483), Astra UK and Astra Capital International Limited (“Astra Capital”) sue Mr Siddiqi and Musst Investments LLP (“Musst LLP”) on the basis that Mr Siddiqi, while acting on behalf of Musst  LLP, made defamatory oral statements about them in Rome in June 2016. The term Astra is also used collectively in context to refer to the Claimants in the Defamation Claim.  These and other statements also form the subject matter of the counterclaim in the Contract Claim.   </p>

At the material time, Mr Mathur was a member of Octave LLP. The fees were payable in return for introducing clients who invested in an investment strategy primarily focused on “synthetic ABS”, i.e. synthetic asset backed securities, a type of financial product which was trading at very low prices relative to their face value after the financial crash of 2008, but which Mr Mathur (who had considerable expertise in such investments) expected in 2011 and 2012 to increase substantially over a three-year period. The Octave Contract defines investments made in Mr Mathur’s strategy as “Eligible Investments”.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Under this contract, Musst says that it introduced at least two clients (a) a US client, 2B LLC (hereafter “2B”), and (b) a Swiss client, Crown Managed Accounts SPC (hereafter “Crown”).  2B agreed to invest in February 2013 (i.e. before the Octave Contract was actually concluded, but after its “Effective Date”), and Crown agreed to invest in June 2013. In both cases, they invested in “managed accounts” – i.e. accounts managed by Octave but managed in turn by Astra LLP on Octave’s behalf. The reason for this arrangement is that, at this point, none of the Astra entities had regulatory authority to manage the accounts themselves, so Astra LLP acted under Octave’s “umbrella”. 2B initially invested US$20 million for Octave to manage, and Crown initially invested $40 million for Octave to manage in synthetic asset backed securities. </p>

Shortly before the earlier date, Astra LLP obtained the necessary regulatory approvals.  Musst’s case is that with Musst’s and Octave’s consent, (a) Astra LLP took over the management of the clients’ respective funds in place of Octave, (b) it received fees for doing so just as Octave had done, and (c) it asked Musst to send its invoices to Astra LLP instead of Octave, which Musst then did. In relation to Crown, it split the invoices between Octave and Astra LLP for the fees accruing before and after 1 September 2014, and in relation to 2B it sent its first invoices in February 2015. Astra LLP then paid these invoices and Octave dropped out of the picture. The fees payable in relation to 2B were payable monthly, and those in relation to Crown were payable quarterly, as this was how Octave and Astra LLP were paid.</p>

By reply on 13 May 2016, Musst as requested sent its invoice, but still made out to Astra LLP.

These sums were, Musst says, its share of “management fees” due to it under the Octave Contract, that is to say 20% of the revenue which Octave and then Astra received from Crown and 2B, in return, as Musst says, for Musst’s  introductions.  The amount of these management fees depended on the size of Crown and 2B’s funds under Octave’s and then Astra’s management, subject to various limits.  </p>

Astra UK accepted in July 2019 (in its Further Information) that by December 2018 it had received £6,671,813 from 2B, and that by September 2018 it was entitled to receive sums totalling £3,021,666 from Crown.

In this regard I would say something about the importance of contemporary documents as a means of getting at the truth, not only of what was going on, but also as to the motivation and state of mind of those concerned. That applies to documents passing between the parties, but with even greater force to a party's internal documents including emails and instant messaging. Those tend to be the documents where a witness's guard is down and their true thoughts are plain to see. Indeed, it has become a commonplace of judgments in commercial cases where there is often extensive disclosure to emphasise the importance of the contemporary documents. Although this cannot be regarded as a rule of law, those documents are generally regarded as far more reliable than the oral evidence of witnesses, still less their demeanour while giving evidence. The classic statement of Robert Goff LJ in The Ocean Frost [1985] 1 Lloyd's Rep 1 at p.57 is frequently, indeed routinely, cited:</span>

It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses' motives, and to the overall probabilities, can be of very great assistance to a judge in ascertaining the truth.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">"19. The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">20.  Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial. A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness's memory has been 'refreshed' by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events."</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">"In the light of these considerations, the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses' recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts. This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose – though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth."</span>

It is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed. Earlier statements of this kind are discussed by Lord Bingham in his well-known essay The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues (from The Business of Judging, Oxford 2000). But a proper awareness of the fallibility of memory does not relieve judges of the task of making findings of fact based upon all of the evidence. Heuristics or mental short cuts are no substitute for this essential judicial function. In particular, where a party's sworn evidence is disbelieved, the court must say why that is; it cannot simply ignore the evidence."</span>

Their evidence was reduced in value to the extent that Ms Galligan went first, whereas the more important witness was Mr Siddiqi (as the person who had been a part of Musst from its inception and as the person who was alleged to have made the defamatory statements).  It was not satisfactory for Mr Siddiqi to confirm in part evidence of Ms Galligan instead of speaking from his own independent recollection.

This was not surprising given how many years earlier the events took place.  With her background in sales, she sometimes seemed to be seeking to win over by her personality rather than by the details of her evidence.  There were aspects of her evidence which were unsatisfactory, notably her evidence that the role of Matrix was administrative and secretarial.  Her skill in sales (representing Matrix until late October/early November 2012) must have gone significantly beyond the administrative or secretarial.  On one occasion, in this strain of evidence, she referred to herself as a passive attendee which seemed unlikely. </p>

There was a concern about the extent to which Mr Siddiqi embellished the extent of financial difficulties in order to persuade Mr Mathur to make payments, and how this impacted on the reliability of his evidence.  It is possibly cancelled out by the fact that Mr Mathur appears to have invoked financial difficulties preventing payments at that stage, whereas, as he accepted in his evidence, Astra did not have such problems as would have prevented any payments at that stage in May/June 2016. </p>

He started with a long explanation which did not deal with the question [T7/22-23], he then invoked legal advice for which privilege was claimed [T7/24], but that was contradicted by a different explanation in his fifth witness statement (at para. 103)[T7/28-30].

He then sought to give a very long answer over several pages of transcript about how a decision in October 2016 to prefer the cash to rest in Deutsche Bank rather than with Astra showed something about the impact of the Statements in June 2016 [T8/34-40].

More likely is that he was wrong and there was no note: his explanations about the note were contrary to the overall probabilities.

He was an important witness in the absence of Mr Plotke the publishee, to whom the alleged Statements had been related.  I was not satisfied about the extent to which he was simply seeking to support a case which had been prepared and developed long before his involvement.  This may not be surprising given the lateness of his statement and the fact that he had become part of Astra through employment.  </p>

For much of his evidence, he did not engage in the question and answer process required of witnesses in these courts.  He did not come over as if was seeking to derail the process, but he was rather set in his very precise ways.  He was often not willing to wait for the question.  He then sought to analyse the question, asking questions about the questions.  He was especially unsatisfactory when asked questions about the Jones Day letter insofar as it concerned him.  </p>

As a result of the 2008 banking crisis, banks were under pressure to get rid of credit instruments such as synthetic ABS.  This created an opportunity in that the assets were complicated and unlikely to mature for some time. Mr Mathur knew from his experience in the market where to acquire them cheap with a view to holding them for a few years, and selling them at a substantial profit on maturity, by which time it was expected that the market would have recovered. </p>

They were also making the initial contact with investors in many cases and going on road trips with Mr Siddiqi and Mr Mathur either locally or abroad e.g. 12 April 2012 planning European trips, 8-9 May 2012 two presentations in the UK offices of Matrix in London with 12 investors at each, 14-17 May 2012 referring to a trip to Switzerland, 30 May 2012– 1 June 2012 trip to Sweden.  The Matrix team assisted Mr Siddiqi and Mr Mathur in drawing up the prospectus and the “due diligence questionnaire” (the “DDQ”) for Octave to send out to prospective investors about the fund (especially late June 2012 and July 2012).</p>

They had also started work, with Mr Siddiqi’s assistance, on the proposed offering memorandum. Octave sent a rough draft of the first prospectus to Mr Reeves, Ms Galligan and Mr Siddiqi. </p>

Musst says that it was at Mr Siddiqi’s suggestion that Ms Galligan made this approach, when the two of them had a “brainstorming” session on 12 March 2012 (Ms Galligan already knew Mr Septon, but Matrix had not sold any products to him).  </p>

Musst says that this again was at Mr Siddiqi’s suggestion to Ms Galligan in their 12 March 2012 brainstorming session because he had met various members of LGT’s investment team including Mr Rigter and Mr Plotke (the latter of whom he had met several times on the hedge fund circuit).</p>

Mr Siddiqi let him continue to liaise with Crown because the “industry etiquette” is that a potential investor is contacted on a specific idea by one person. Thereafter, Mr Elliott arranged the further meetings with LGT on 16/17 October 2012 in Switzerland again, and on 13 November 2012 in London. </p>

Astra say that although the relationship became tripartite (that is to say Mr Mathur/Octave, Matrix and Siddiqi/MUSST after 21 November 2012), in early 2012 the arrangement was that Mr Mathur/Octave would pay  Matrix directly for its introductions, and the parties discussed a 20% fee in respect of management fees and performance fees.    </p>

By contrast, Astra say that there was an arrangement to pay to MUSST for its efforts up to 21 November 2012 by a voluntary payment.  There would then be negotiated a forward-looking written agreement in addition to the November arrangement.  Thereafter, the voluntary arrangement was modified to involve Matrix, so that all three parties would become parties to the November arrangement whereby the voluntary payments would be made to MUSST in respect of any introductions before that time, and MUSST would be responsible to pass on payments to Matrix as would be negotiated between MUSST and Matrix<span class="CommentReference" style="font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

Where clients expressed interest following an initial approach by Matrix, Mr Siddiqi would step in, as the product specialist, to talk about the proposal in more detail with the decision makers. He also approached over 100 potential clients, many of which he met in London, Geneva, Zurich, New York and Stockholm. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Astra accept that Mr Siddiqi was the “co-ordinator” of the distribution effort in that there had to be someone ensuring that there was a united strategy and especially that potential investors were not approached by different people.  It is also accepted that Mr Siddiqi made the introduction of Mr Reeves to Mr Mathur.  That is not surprising in view of the fact that he is married to Ms Galligan, who at the material time, namely early 2012, worked for Matrix.  The case of Astra, especially through the evidence of Mr Reeves, is that it was Matrix that took the lead and was the “capital introducer” for the fund.  They contend that Mr Mathur often had direct contact with them without Mr Siddiqi being there.  Likewise, it was Matrix, Mr Reeves says, that designed the distribution strategy from its database of investors (which included The Observatory and LGT), and worked out who to contact, pursuant to which it contacted over 200 potential investors.  It involved its compliance and legal teams and its risk committee and new business committee.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment, starting with the contemporaneous evidence, this shows that Matrix was more than an administrator or a secretary.  This is for the following reasons.  First, it had a bank of contacts itself to whom it could reach out.  Second, it made contact with potential investors which indicates much more than an administrative role.  Third, Ms Galligan in particular presented as a person with ‘the gift of the gab’ and the charm that the best salespersons have.  Until October/November 2012, she was acting for Matrix and not for MUSST, despite her being married to Mr Siddiqi. In that capacity, she was doing more than simply administrative tasks.  Fourth, when Mr Elliott reached out to LGT (without the prior approval of Mr Siddiqi), he was doing more than being an administrator, but seeking to get the business of a prospective investor.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The key points relied upon by Musst do not make the contact of Matrix merely administrative.  Matrix lacked the technical know-how in the credit instruments relating to synthetic ABS, such that any investment depended on contact between Mr Mathur and/or Mr Siddiqi and the prospective investor.  However, that does not relegate the contact of Matrix to a secretarial role.  The co-ordinator was Mr Siddiqi, but the fact that there was supposed to be liaison before and after contact took place between Matrix and prospective investors does not mean that the extensive personal contact including meetings of Matrix with them was not important.  This is particularly evident as regards the meeting attended in the US by Ms Galligan in September 2012.  The absence of Mr Siddiqi would not mean that an administrator would be a substitute: it reflected on her abilities that she deputed for her husband, and at that stage she deputed as an employee of Matrix rather than as a representative of her husband.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It does not follow from the fact that Matrix was taking a part of the distribution role that Matrix was taking the entire distribution role.  I accept the evidence of Mr Siddiqi and Ms Galligan that they had a brainstorming session together on 12 March 2012 about their contacts including LGT and Crown.  Mr Siddiqi did have the overall coordinating role, and this is not affected by the fact that Mr Elliott made the approach to LGT without prior reference to Mr Siddiqi.  Mr Siddiqi had a major role in respect of distributions, preparing technical material, compiling names of potential investors, attending meetings and speaking with and writing to them.  Likewise, after she ceased to act for Matrix, Ms Galligan immediately continued her distribution role, but this time for MUSST.  </p>

In any event, she appears to have set up the meeting and she was in New York at the relevant time: see Mr Mathur’s fifth witness statement at paras. 40.4 and 54. -.  </p>

Mr Murray replied the same day that the amendment was necessary, as <span style="font-style:italic">“[Octave LLP] is no longer the manager, [Astra LLP] is, none of the terms have changed this is a change of name exercise and I am trying to ensure our files our [sic] fully tied up”</span>.

In response, Ms Agatha Imiolek on 13 May 2016 sent to Mr Holdom at Astra UK Musst’s invoice for its share of these fees (i.e. US$15,138.56), which invoice, Musst says inadvertently was made to Astra LLP rather than Astra UK.  By email of 16 May 2016, Mr Holdom replied that this had now been paid. It is understood that it was Astra UK which paid this fee (everything had been transferred over to it).

By this stage, Astra UK had entered into revised agreements with 2B and Crown to replace those with Astra LLP, again on the same terms, on 21 March 2016 and 30 March 2016. It had also entered into a revised agreement with Crown in relation to the “Crown II” account on 30 March 2016 mentioned above, and which it told Musst on 30 April 2015 was following a different strategy.

However, Mr Mathur maintained that he himself was having difficulty getting paid, and there was nothing to pay over yet. On one occasion, he suggested that instead that they just settle on a figure now, regardless of what the performance should turn out to be in future.  On another, he suggested he make an advance against performance fees now, another £250,000 next year, and then the balance when he was paid.  However, no such payments were made.</p>

By reply of 26 July 2016, Mr Murray, for Astra UK, writing under the heading <span style="font-style:italic">“Subject to Contract/Contract Denied”</span>, said he was still working on the agreement; to which Mr Siddiqi replied on 28 July 2016 that <span style="font-style:italic">“in relation to our contract dated 18 April 2013 ....  you are obliged to pay management and performance fees”</span>.  He complained that in breach of contract, the fees due for May and June had not been paid and asked for payment immediately. He attached three undated invoices, each made out to Astra UK, (a) one for US$32,500 for management fees on the Crown Contract for 1 April to 30 June 2016, and (b) two for US$15,125.96, for management fees on the 2B Contract for May 2016 and June 2016. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The first question is whether there was a  November Arrangement under which Mr Mathur agreed with Mr Siddiqi and Ms Galligan a voluntary arrangement under which all introductions made (including those of 2B and Crown) would be the subject of a revenue share of 20% for three years from the date of 2B’s and Crown’s investments.  Musst says that the November Arrangement did not take place, and that the written agreement applied to introductions of 2B and Crown.  If there was a November Arrangement, then Astra are able to rely upon the same as an important part of the factual matrix to the written Octave Contract.  Its existence would assist an argument that the payments made subsequently in respect of 2B and Crown  which were made over the period of three years from the date of execution of the written agreement are not referable to the written agreement, but to the November Arrangement.  This would assist Astra in being able to contend that the written agreement was intended only to be forward looking and not to look to introductions before 21 November 2012 including 2B and Crown.  The force of this argument might be reduced if there was no November arrangement. </p>

The November Arrangement was not in a vacuum. It was, according to the evidence of Mr Mathur and Mr Reeves, to be seen in the context of what was called the Matrix Arrangement (under which Mr Mathur had agreed to pay Matrix 20% of fees for its introduction for three years) and the Siddiqi Understanding (under which Mr Mathur had agreed to pay Mr Siddiqi 25% of management fees over a three-year period on investments which he introduced directly without assistance from Matrix). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">According to both Mr Mathur’s and Mr Reeves’ oral evidence, this was a tripartite agreement reached at a meeting at which Mr Siddiqi was present at some point in early 2012: see T8/168-9, T9/99, T9/106/12-19 and the statement of Mr Reeves at para. 180. Mr Mathur said that it was an agreement in principle.  Mr Reeves said it amounted to <span style="font-style:italic">“our commercial terms of engagement” </span>[T9/106/23-25 and T9/110-111].  By contrast, the evidence of Ms Galligan was to the effect that there was an oral arrangement made on 16 January 2012. The contractual chain of arrangement was to be between Musst and Mr Mathur and then between Musst and Matrix. The arrangement was 25% but there was fluidity in respect of the last 5% because it was to be worked out whether Musst would obtain an equity in the business of 5%: see Mr Siddiqi’s evidence at [T4/168/9-170/8] and Ms Galligan’s evidence at [T2/127/3-10, T2/158/14-159/14, T3/116/7-118/10, T3/137/19-21]. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">If the evidence for Astra were accepted, it would be a significant building block of the alleged November Arrangement. The reason for this is that it would establish that, as of November 2012, there was at least an agreement in principle between Matrix and Octave.  This would, if accepted, contradict Musst’s case that there was a contractual chain of arrangements between Musst and Mr Mathur’s companies, and then between Musst and Matrix. If the primary deal was between Mr Mathur and Matrix, then that would make more plausible the alleged Siddiqi Understanding (giving rise to a very limited entitlement and predicated upon those instances where investments had been introduced by Mr Siddiqi directly and without any assistance by Matrix). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Musst denies the existence of the November Arrangement.  The evidence of Mr Siddiqi is that he agreed on 16 January 2012 that his business would get 25% of all fees charged by Astra to investors on capital which he raised, and that this was mentioned at other times.  This was not evidenced at the time in writing.  There was the email on 16 January 2012 of Mr Siddiqi to Ms Galligan and Mr Reeves timed 18:42 saying <span style="font-style:italic">“So, I had a two hour meeting with Anish and laid down a gauntlet. The net result is he will work with Musst Investments and understands how we operate.

Hence, it </span>[sic]<span style="font-style:italic"> time to morph his pitch book and move the story forward...

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Musst contends that by November 2012, there had been agreed in principle between Musst by Mr Siddiqi and Octave by Mr Mathur an arrangement whereby Musst would be paid 20% of any monies Mr Mathur received both in respect of management and performance fees whilst the monies sat there without limitation in time (that is contrary to the three-year limit contended for by Astra).  This agreement was with the consent of Mr Reeves with whom there would be sharing of the moneys received by Musst.  The primary agreement would be as between Musst and Octave, and Musst would agree with Mr Reeves some sharing of moneys received by Musst with Mr Reeves for himself and/or LGBR and/or those behind Matrix.  Musst’s case is that with that agreement, there were then negotiations with a view to having an agreement in writing.  This culminated in the agreement in writing dated 18 April 2013.  This was not a separate agreement from that which had been agreed in November 2012.  There was not an agreement in respect of previously made introductions and introductions thereafter.  Nor was the former a voluntary arrangement, whereas only the latter was the subject of a binding agreement.  Nor as between Octave and Musst was there a distinction between introductions made by Matrix and those made by Musst without the involvement of Matrix.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Musst’s case is that the written agreement is to be construed as applying to all of those introductions: alternatively, that it was agreed between the parties by convention that it applied to the same.  Likewise, although there was not a signed novation to apply to the Astra parties, the written agreement was novated with Astra and/or the parties agreed by convention that the written agreement was to be treated as novated as between Musst and Astra.  This was at least the case as regards 2B and Crown Contracts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This is a case where the contemporaneous documents contradict substantially Astra’s account.  I have considered the conflict of oral evidence having regard to this.  I find that there was no Matrix arrangement as contended for by Astra, nor was there a Siddiqi understanding.  The critical stage was November 2012 when there was an agreement in principle between Mr Mathur for Octave and Mr Siddiqi for Musst.  It was agreed that the parties would record their agreement in writing, and it was at this point that the parties embarked on negotiations which went on up to the written agreement dated 18 April 2013.  In my judgment, the contemporaneous written evidence at all times strongly suggests that there was no oral or voluntary arrangement of the kind comprised in the November Arrangement.</p>

This might have made sense after some limited work based on trust of friends, but in this case the documents evidence that Mr Siddiqi had by November 2012 carried out a very large amount of work.

If the distinction is said to be that one was binding and the other is not, that is not an obvious answer, because it only adds to the difficulty in understanding why some part of the arrangement between commercial parties should be binding and other parts voluntary.  In any event, it is not an answer to say that there was no need to have a document because there were no binding obligations to record: it was important to differentiate between what was the subject of a binding agreement and what was not.  That could have been done as part of the written agreement, or as part of a memorandum of understanding, or otherwise in written form. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Further, in such a heavily documented case, one would expect that there would be contemporaneous documentary evidence that would support Astra’s case.  There is a dearth of such documents.  However, such documents as there are provide more support for Musst’s case than Astra’s case.  Documents prior to November 2012 were to the effect that Musst/Mr Reeves were keen to have an agreement in writing between MUSST and Octave/Astra with a view thereafter to an agreement being made between Matrix and MUSST: see the emails of 15 February 2012, 6 and 21 March 2012 and 23 September 2012 above referred to.  Likewise, the documents at the time of the alleged November Arrangement are inconsistent with a November Arrangement: see the email of 16 November 2012 by Mr Siddiqi to his solicitor seeking to protect the interests of MUSST in respect of the work done to date including reference to “two closes” which appear to have been 2B and Crown. They are singled out as if they are the most likely to bear very substantial fruit.  The privilege has been lifted as regards these emails, but not as between Octave and their solicitors.</p>

It was important from a financing point of view for Mr Siddiqi to be able to show them to financiers, but that is not to say that the written agreement was to be only in respect of work done from 21 November 2012.  On the contrary, it was to show the financiers that there was to be reward from all efforts carried out by Musst.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is apparent from the foregoing that there was nothing in writing to say that there was to be no binding agreement in respect of 2B or Crown or anybody previously introduced. In the words of the Opening Skeleton of Musst, the above emails preceding the meeting of 21 November 2012, copied to Mr Reeves, make it plain that Mr Siddiqi was very anxious to get a contract in place to cover the work he had already done and the contacts he had already introduced.  In the way in which it was put in the opening skeleton for Musst at para. 160(5), not once did Mr Mathur, or Mr Reeves, say: <span style="font-style:italic">“But Saleem, we have already agreed we shall pay Matrix on a voluntary basis for three years for all that</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Astra’s amendment to the pleading is also important because the case that the November Arrangement was made on 21 November 2012 has been abandoned or replaced with a case that it was made in several communications. There is no evidence that it was made after the 21 November meeting. It is therefore significant that the alleged November arrangement was not mentioned in the email correspondence of 19 and 20 November 2012. </p>

First, exchanges with Mr Phillips and Mr Murray of 15 and 16 April 2013 about the need for broker dealer cover to deal with the 2B introduction (to which Mr Mathur was copied in) make it plain that it was intended that the Octave Contract should cover the introductions to 2B and, by inference, any other investors such as Crown, whenever introduced. If the Octave Contract had nothing to do with 2B, it is difficult to understand why Mr Mathur would have insisted on 22 April 2013 to have <span style="font-style:italic">“a binding agreement with a director’s signature”</span> before authorising the payment of Musst’s 20% share of the fees that had already been received from 2B.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Second, open communications in 2015 suggest strongly that the parties treated the payments in respect of 2B and Crown as legal obligations rather than a voluntary arrangement.  There were emails of 30 April 2015 which were consistent with the moneys paid in respect of 2B and Crown being paid under the written agreement.  Mr Holdom had first said (11.51am) that the <span style="font-style:italic">“2B invoice is not yet available.  LGT have not yet settled their invoice”.</span>  Later (17.00) he said that a Crown 2 invoice had been sent in error:  <span style="font-style:italic">“The Crown 2 account was set up for a new strategy (primarily CLO and CRE) and therefore is not covered by the Introduction Agreement “as it does not substantially replicate the investment securities and risk profile of ASSCF”. I will settle the [other] invoice once the client has made their payment.”</span>  This judgment will revert later to the question whether Crown 2 was a new strategy such that Musst was not entitled to payment in respect of the same.  The important point here is that the <span style="font-style:italic">“error”</span> of sending the Crown 2 invoice was an acknowledgment that payment in respect of the Crown Contract was covered by the written agreement (referred to as the Introduction Agreement) and not under the November Arrangement.  On the same premise of operating under the written agreement, at 17.45, Mr Holdom wrote saying:</p>

There is a dispute between the parties as to whether these discussions were without prejudice and therefore privileged. The parties agreed that instead of resolving this question of admissibility of evidence prior to the trial, it should in fact be resolved at the same time as the issues in the trial.

Musst through the evidence of Ms Galligan and Mr Siddiqi submits that there was no reference to the conversations being <span style="font-style:italic">“without prejudice”</span> until August 2016.  Further there was no dispute between the parties until, at earliest, late July 2016.  The failure to pay did not evidence a dispute but was simply a non-payment that had to be resolved.  Mr Mathur says that the discussions were agreed to be without prejudice, in particular those of 27 June 2016 and 13 July 2016. Further, there was a dispute as to whether there was a contractual obligation to make any payment. Astra also say that the transcripts were the result of furtive recordings without the knowledge or consent of Mr Mathur which reflects a lack of integrity on the part of Musst. Further the recordings are incomplete, which suggests that those conversations or parts of the conversations which do not suit Musst’s case have been edited out or withheld.</p>

However, Astra rely upon the statement of Ms Galligan in her third witness statement that Mr Mathur muttered under his breath <span style="font-style:italic">“you don’t even have a contract”</span>.

This does not indicate that the conversation was without prejudice or that there was a dispute.  Mr Mathur said that although he was receiving fees from 2B and Crown, he would not pay Musst its percentage of management fees because he was having cashflow problems.  Due to reduced management fees, Mr Mathur said that he would no longer be in a position to pay all his staff and costs.  He would no longer be in a position to pay Musst or Mr Chandaria.  There was no dispute about the contractual entitlement of Musst, but Mr Mathur required breathing space.  His primary focus was to ensure that Astra met its FCA capital adequacy requirement.  </p>

So no, he most definitely did not say “without prejudice” at the start of the meeting.

The evidence of Mr Murray was that he advised that the conversation should be without prejudice.  As will be set out below as regards the case about defamation, his evidence was unsatisfactory as regards his failure to have a note about the alleged defamation.  There was no contemporaneous record to support this evidence.  Further, although in emails of 19 July and 26 July 2016, he wrote that the intended contract was subject to contract and he wrote <span style="font-style:italic">“contract denied”</span>, his use of the term <span style="font-style:italic">“without prejudice”</span> was not until 3 August 2016.</p>

The absence of the first part of the conversation is explained by Ms Galligan as being about pleasantries, and the suggestion that this has not been produced smacks of an allegation of concealment.  It is not proven, and in any event, having seen the witnesses, the Court has no reason to believe that they would have sought to conceal such evidence.  In any event, if it were the case that there was something in the early part of the conversation which showed that it was about a resolution of dispute, it would be expected that the contents of the conversation which was transcribed would indicate that it was about the resolution of a dispute.  It does not.  Rather it is that the moneys were said not yet to be due because they had not been received by Astra.  There was a discussion about bringing forward the time for payment of such money as would become due.  If in fact there was a dispute about the money ever being due (on the basis that Musst had no rights and there was only a voluntary arrangement), one would expect that this would have been stated expressly.  It was not.</p>

Of greater significance, on 26 July 2016, Mr Murray sent the email referred to above to Mr Siddiqi and Ms Galligan headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Subject to Contract/Contract Denied”</span>.    When the draft was sent on 3 August 2016, it had the same heading and also <span style="font-style:italic">“Without Prejudice”</span>.  I am satisfied that, by this stage there was a dispute as to whether there was a contractual relationship and that the draft contract sent on 3 August 2016 was not only subject to contract, but that it was without prejudice.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;background-color:#FFFFFF">“My conclusions are these. There are two bases for the operation of the without prejudice rule. The first rests on public policy and that policy is to encourage people to settle their differences. However, in order for that head of public policy to be engaged there must be a dispute. The concept of dispute is given a wide scope so that an opening shot of negotiations may fall within the policy even though the other party has not rejected the offer. That is the explanation for Standrin</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;background-color:#FFFFFF">. In order to decide whether this head of public policy is engaged, the court must determine on an objective basis whether there was in fact a dispute or issue to be resolved.</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;background-color:#FFFFFF"> If there was not then this head of public policy is not engaged. On facts of this case, in my judgment the judge was right to say there was no dispute at the time the communications took place. </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;background-color:#FFFFFF">The other basis for the rule is contractual, that is by contract the parties may extend the usual ambit of the without prejudice rule.</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;background-color:#FFFFFF"> In Cutts v Head the dispute was over so the justification was purely in terms of contract. In Unilever the possibility of extending the scope of the rules expressly envisaged and the decision in Unilever is treated as an authoritative exposition.”</span>

The parties’ cases on the construction of the Octave Contract as regards what constituted an introduction are predicated, in part, upon a factual matrix that as per Astra there was a November Arrangement, and as per Musst there was no November Arrangement.  Further, Musst’s alternative case on rectification and/or estoppel is predicated upon there having been no November Arrangement and the payments which were made being thought by the parties to be referable to the Octave Contract alone (even if as a matter of construction of the Octave Contract, the same were not payable).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The above needs to be considered as if Octave had remained the vehicle of Mr Mathur throughout and as if the Astra parties had never existed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Astra’s case is that the Octave Contract was forward looking whereas the November Arrangement was backward looking.  Thus, the November Arrangement applied to introductions which had been effected prior to the Effective Date, that is to say 21 November 2012.  The structure of the Octave Contract was forward looking from the Effective Date.  Since there was a period of about 5 months of negotiation of the Octave Contract which went through numerous iterations, the parties agreed an Effective Date, said by Astra to be from the time of the agreement of the backward-looking November Arrangement.  To that limited extent to the time to the Effective Date, even on Astra’s case, the Octave Contract too was backward looking.  </p>

There are also differences between the parties as a matter of fact about the role of Musst as regards the introduction of 2B and Crown.  Astra’s case is that any introduction was not by Musst: to the extent that there was an introduction by anyone, it was by Matrix.  Musst says that it effected the introductions and to the extent that Matrix was involved, it was in an administrative or secretarial role.   </p>

By clause 2.1 of the Octave Contract, Octave Limited appointed Musst to be the Introducer <span style="font-style:italic">“from the Effective Date … to introduce Prospective Investors and make introductions to Octave”</span>, but bearing in mind the wide definition of <span style="font-style:italic">“Introduction”</span> all this means is that Musst’s appointment ran from 21 November 2012: it does not mean that the initial introduction itself, in the sense of a meeting or discussion, had to take place after this date as well: only the investment had to take place after it, as happened.</p>

West Bromwich Building Society </span>[1998] 1 WLR 898 at 912-3 is considered further below.  Objectively, the reason for the choice of 21 November 2012 as the Effective Date was that this was when the parties agreed in principle the main part of the deal, namely Musst’s entitlement to 20% of Octave’s fees, which led to the production of the Octave Contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">By this stage, MUSST through Mr Siddiqi had been heavily engaged in identifying prospective investors and effecting introductions and making or preparing presentations.  Musst submits that it would be absurd to suppose that it was intended that Musst would have no right to fees for any of these potential investors, but only a right for new investors whom Octave met for the first time to discuss the fund after 21 November 2012.  Likewise, it would be very surprising if it was intended to exclude Musst’s right to payment under the Contract in relation to investments by 2B and Crown given the nature of the discussions with and about them before and after 21 November 2012, and there were, as at the date of the contract on 18 April 2013, no other likely investors on the horizon. </p>

In considering the factual matrix of the Octave Contract, the question as to whether the November Arrangement existed is of importance.  On Astra’s case, there was a Matrix Arrangement and thereafter a November Arrangement.  The effect was that the introductions were to be done by Matrix who would be paid directly by Mr Mathur or his vehicle.  By the November Arrangement, this was converted into a three-way arrangement whereby payments would be made on a voluntary basis by Octave to Musst for the benefit of Matrix/LGBR/Mr Reeves and for Musst.  </p>

The amounts payable were to be paid by Octave Limited within 10 days of first receipt of fees by it, without set-off, counterclaim, withholding or deduction. (Clause 4.5.) Any dispute as to the amount payable was to be resolved by referring it to Octave’s auditors (Clause 4.6.)

Musst was entitled on reasonable notice to attend premises where such records were kept (and Octave was to procure access to the same), and to access them and to take copies to ensure that the correct amounts had been paid to it.

This can be seen from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v. National Westminster Bank plc [1995] 1 EGLR 97. The court was considering the true construction of rent review clauses in a number of different cases. The underlying result which the landlords sought in each case was the same. The court regarded it as a most improbable commercial result. Where the result, though improbable, flowed from the unambiguous language of the clause, the landlords succeeded, whereas where it did not, they failed. The court held that ordinary principles of construction applied to rent review clauses and applied the principles in The Antaios (Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB) [1985] AC 191.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“17. First, the reliance placed in some cases on commercial common sense and surrounding circumstances (eg in Chartbrook, paras 16-26) should not be invoked to undervalue the importance of the language of the provision which is to be construed. The exercise of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable reader, and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties have control over the language they use in a contract. And, again save perhaps in a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision.</span>

Secondly, when it comes to considering the centrally relevant words to be interpreted, I accept that the less clear they are, or, to put it another way, the worse their drafting, the more ready the court can properly be to depart from their natural meaning. That is simply the obverse of the sensible proposition that the clearer the natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify departing from it. However, that does not justify the court embarking on an exercise of searching for, let alone constructing, drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural meaning. If there is a specific error in the drafting, it may often have no relevance to the issue of interpretation which the court has to resolve.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">19. The third point I should mention is that commercial common sense is not to be invoked retrospectively. The mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even disastrously, for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language. Commercial common sense is only relevant to the extent of how matters would or could have been perceived by the parties, or by reasonable people in the position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made. Judicial observations such as those of Lord Reid in Wickman Machine Tools Sales Ltd v L Schuler AG [1974] AC 235, 251 and Lord Diplock in Antaios Cia Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB (The Antaios) [1985] AC 191, 201, quoted by Lord Carnwath at para 110, have to be read and applied bearing that important point in mind.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">20. Fourthly, while commercial common sense is a very important factor to take into account when interpreting a contract, a court should be very slow to reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight. The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice. Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Musst’s case on how the introduction of 2B came about is that in early 2012, Mr Siddiqi put Mr Reeves, the manager of Ms Galligan, at Matrix, in touch with Mr Mathur, on the basis that Matrix was authorised by the FSA to market and sell financial products.  On 16 January 2012 and 8 February 2012, Mr Siddiqi introduced Mr Reeves to Mr Mathur and, subsequently, Mr Siddiqi and Mr Mathur presented the proposed AMCO business strategy to the Matrix sales team.  As a result, Ms Galligan and other members of the Matrix sales team started speaking to potential investors about the proposed AMCO business in March and April 2012. Potential investors were suggested to them as such by Mr Siddiqi on behalf of Musst. </p>

At Ms Galligan's instigation (now of Musst having left Matrix since its insolvency), he attended a long meeting on 4 December 2012 with herself, Mr Siddiqi, and Mr Mathur (now of Octave) at Octave LLP’s offices at 23 Ironmonger Lane, London EC2V 8EY, at which he said he wanted to invest in the proposed AMCO fund, as he confirmed by email later that day to Musst.  At that meeting, Mr Septon not only carried out operational due diligence, but enquired into the underlying strategy, and what types of trade would be carried out, and what underlying collateral there was for the synthetic ABS and what there would be in the portfolio if he were to invest.  </p>

There was a further follow up meeting on 13 November 2012 in New York attended by Mr Mathur and Mr Septon.  Although Ms Galligan accepted in cross-examination the proposition that that meeting was without her (if that was what Mr Mathur said [T3/52/1-11]): in fact, Mr Mathur’s evidence was unclear in respect of the same because he did not recall whether she was there. In any event, she appears to have set up the meeting and she was in New York at the relevant time: see Mr Mathur’s fifth witness statement at paras. 40.4 and 54. Even on the basis that Ms Galligan was by this stage working for MUSST, this was a meeting prior to the Effective Date. The case of Astra is that the introduction was at the meetings of July and September 2012, and the fact that there was follow up and subsequent due diligence (which was organised by Ms Galligan in October 2012 whilst still working for Matrix) and/or that the 2B Contract  made was after the time of the introduction did not postpone the time of the introduction of 2B until after the Effective Date;</span>

At the point in time when the investment was made, the question is whether that was at the instigation or initiative of Introducer.  That is not limited in time to after 21 November 2012.  The circumstance does not arise until and unless an investment is ultimately made.

Neither was this said in the Octave Contract nor outside the contract in communications between the parties at the relevant time.   In the iterative approach commended above, it would be necessary then to consider a contextual approach and to consider the contract in the light of the factual matrix and to consider which of any competing constructions bears a meaning most consistent with commercial common sense.  </p>

They included especially 2B and Crown.  There is nothing in the factual background to suggest that there has been excluded any work carried out prior to the Effective Date.  A construction that the words indicate that the approaches prior to the Effective Date would be paid for provided that the investments were made thereafter accords with the factual matrix and is consistent with commercial sense.  This would not be the case if Musst had no right to fees other than for potential investors approached for the first time after 21 November 2012.  Going back from the contextual approach to the textual approach, even on the basis that the construction was not clear, there is nothing in the words used which precludes the construction that the investments are covered by the Octave Contract provided that they were made after the Effective Date, even if the customer was solicited prior to the Effective Date.  </p>

A question which arises is whether a qualifying introduction must be at the sole instigation or on the sole initiative of the introducer.  In a different kind of contract, namely that of estate agents, a question arises on the particular contracts before the Court whether the implied term that the estate agent be the effective cause is to be interpreted as <span style="font-style:italic">“the”</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">“an”</span> effective cause: see Bowstead and Reynolds on the Law of Agency 32<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Ed. para. 7-030.  This is a different kind of contract from an estate agent, bearing in mind not least the obligations on Musst.  The words of the clause do not state that the instigation or initiative has to be the sole or predominant instigation or initiative of Musst.   I therefore prefer the construction that this is not required so long as in the case of the instigation, it was substantial.</p>

Accordingly, I turn to the iterative process referred to above.  When testing what at highest was an uncertain meaning against the factual matrix, or looking at the matter contextually, there are important contextual matters to take into account relevant to the construction of the contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">One way in which Musst can be seen to be the introducer notwithstanding a more than secretarial or administrative role of Matrix is by the clause being capable of operating where Matrix and Musst/MUSST are acting together.  I am satisfied that when the words are construed contextually the words are broad enough to include a case where both Matrix and Musst are acting together as introducers.  Prior to the making of the Octave Contract, Mr Siddiqi introduced Matrix to Mr Mathur to provide distribution services.  To this end, Matrix reached out to customers in distribution services generally under the coordination of Musst.  In my judgment, the services of Matrix by themselves were not sufficient to open the door to the customers even those whom they approached, but a critical part of which was the presentations to the clients and the documentation prepared by Mr Siddiqi with his detailed appreciation of the technical details of the product.  Further, the parties organised their affairs on the basis that payment for introductions would be made by Octave/Astra to Musst and that Musst would make their arrangement with Matrix.  On this basis, vis-à-vis Octave it is an entirely logical construction that an introduction of Musst in circumstances where Matrix was acting jointly or taking a part of the introduction, is still an introduction of Musst.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This can be applied as regards 2B.  Ms Galligan had known Mr Septon for some time, and a suggestion of Mr Siddiqi was Mr Septon as a possible investor, following which Ms Galligan got in touch with Mr Septon.  I accept the oral evidence that there was a brainstorming session, and I do not treat it as a retrospective invention even though there is no contemporaneous written evidence.  The July meeting was joint between Mr Siddiqi and Matrix, or in part one and in part the other.  The September meeting would have been joint but for the visa problem of Mr Siddiqi.  The evidence was equivocal as to whether Ms Galligan attended the 13 November meeting with Mr Septon, but she appears to have organised the meeting with Mr Septon.  She was in New York at the time, by then being part of Musst.  The 4 December meeting was in large part Musst.  On this basis, I conclude that the instigation or the initiative was that of Musst or of Musst jointly with Matrix or of Musst in part and Matrix in part.  Any of those formulations suffice in my judgment to qualify so that the 2B Contract was on the instigation or initiative of Musst.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I conclude that the words used seen in their contextual analysis provide support to Musst being the Introducer as regards 2B.  The commercial common sense was that the fees were or would become due to Musst.  The context or factual matrix included (without limitation) (a) the way in which the contract was drawn up between Octave and Musst with the expectation of a separate arrangement or negotiation between Musst and Matrix, (b) Mr Siddiqi’s overall coordinating role including bringing Matrix into the distribution process, (c) the critical role of Mr Siddiqi in preparing the documentation and making technical presentations to clients with his detailed appreciation of the technical details of the product.  It would be surprising if it was intended to exclude Musst’s right to payment under the Octave Contract in relation to the investments by 2B (and Crown), which is the consequence of Astra’s construction, given that at the time of the contract 2B had already invested and Octave was discussing payment to it.  At the date of the Octave Contract, there were no other likely new investors on the horizon.   By then, Crown had already done a considerable amount of due diligence on AMCO and expressed considerable interest in investing. It is much more appropriate to adopt the construction of Musst than that of Astra in that its construction is more consistent with business common sense. </p>

However, if, contrary to the above, the instigatory conduct relied on must be after the Effective Date, then Musst is able to rely on its conduct and especially of Mr Siddiqi in and around the meeting of 4 December 2012 either by itself or in conjunction with the conduct prior to the Effective Date.  The reason for this is that prior to 21 November 2012, Mr Septon had not decided that he would invest.  That depended on the due diligence of and around the 4 December 2012 meeting.  That was not a box ticking exercise, but a detailed appraisal with very substantial input from Mr Siddiqi on behalf of Musst in providing detailed technical information.  That therefore satisfied the second limb of the definition of introduction in that the investment was instigated by the detailed satisfaction of the queries of Musst and by his showing that the product would be a suitable investment for 2B.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">What of the argument that the conduct of Mr Siddiqi was at all material times personal or on behalf of Musst Investments LLP and not Musst?  Astra point to emails which show Mr Siddiqi acting in a personal capacity or for Musst Investments LLP.  They contend that the use of Musst as a corporate vehicle thereafter does not mean that the conduct of Mr Siddiqi was on behalf of Musst and therefore no introduction was made by Musst.  Given the factual matrix of the agreement that the parties intended to capture the introductory conduct of Mr Siddiqi prior to the Octave Contract being made, to the extent that his conduct was for Musst Investments LLP, it must have been the intention of the parties to treat the same as carried out as delegate on behalf of Musst.  This is consistent with Clause 2.2 of the Octave Contract.  This refers to the delegation of functions by Musst to Musst Investments LLP to which Octave consented and could not revoke.  In the context of this agreement, such delegation of functions can be by retrospective adoption as much as by prospective appointment.  If and to the extent that the relevant introductory conduct was that of Musst Investments LLP, Musst adopted that conduct as carried out on its behalf.  Likewise, the point was never taken at the time of the payments being made because it was understood by the parties concerned that Musst was adopting acts of Musst Investments LLP as its delegate.</p>

I reach this conclusion starting off with a textual analysis and reaching that conclusion.  Even if the construction of the Octave Contract on a textual analysis did not without more support the construction set out above, this is not a case where the language used in the Octave Contract and the natural meaning of the words used supports a conclusion that there was no qualifying introduction in this case.  However, applying a contextual analysis, I am satisfied that the Musst is to be regarded as an Introducer of 2B.  Returning in the iterative process on this alternative footing to the textual analysis, I am satisfied that this is not a case where the language used and the natural meaning of the words used support the construction of Astra.</p>

It looks to any circumstance where its being made has been at the instigation or on the initiative of the Introducer.  In the case of Crown, the investment was not made until June 2013.  As in respect of 2B, for the reasons set out above, I do not accept that the solicitation of customers had to start after the Effective Date.  I adopt the same iterative approach of construction.  As in respect of 2B and for the same reasoning, it did not negate the instigation or initiative of Musst that it acted with Matrix in the securing of the custom of Crown.  </p>

He had known the representatives of LGT for years before.   The fact that Mr Elliott jumped in and made the first approach to Crown, and that thereafter pursuant to industry etiquette Mr Elliott was not removed as the point of contact, does not prevent Musst from qualifying as introducer under the Octave Contract.  This follows from the fact that the overall arrangement was still that Musst was the overall co-ordinator and Mr Siddiqi was creating the technical literature, presenting technical information and participating directly at meetings.  The reasoning above in respect of 2B has application as regards the textual and contextual approaches and the iterative process.  </p>

The reason for this is that prior to 21 November 2012, Crown had not decided to invest.  That depended on the further meetings, consideration and due diligence thereafter.  That involved a detailed appraisal with very substantial input from Mr Siddiqi on behalf of Musst in providing detailed technical information and showing that the product would be a suitable investment for Crown.</p>

If in fact the communications were corrected so as to say that the contract as drafted did not specify that there should be any sharing of fees in respect of 2B and Crown (or other introductions made before the Effective Date), the matter at that stage would have been put right so that, if it did not do already, the terms of Octave Contract would have made it explicit that the fees would become payable.<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Mr Mathur accepted in cross-examination that he would have agreed to have the contract altered to reflect the parties’ true intentions if he had thought that there was a mistake in the Octave Contract [T7/42/8 – T743/8].  </span>Further, following the drafting of the Octave Contract, when the requests were made to agree to Astra LLP and then Astra UK taking over the obligations, if the matter had been put that the Octave Contract did not provide an obligation to pay the fees, it can be inferred that the parties would have tidied up the written contract so as to give effect to the common assumption of the parties.  In the event that Octave/Musst had resiled from the assumption before the summer of 2016, then, although it is put in very general terms, it can be inferred that Musst would have arranged its affairs in a different way and would have sought clarification both at the time of the Octave Contract and the arrangements subsequently with Astra LLP and Astra UK.  If that had been indicated at an earlier stage, then Musst would have sought to amend the contract to reflect the common understanding of the parties.  On the basis of my findings above, there would or ought to have been no argument to the contrary.  It is now inequitable in the circumstances to resile from that state of affairs.</p>

The common assumption was a convention in respect of 2B and Crown which overrode an argument of construction that there was no contractual entitlement due to the Effective Date clause or the involvement of Matrix or otherwise.  Notwithstanding any argument of construction, the convention of the parties was that the introductions in respect of 2B and Crown were understood to be effected by Musst.  It would be unjust or unconscionable for Octave or Astra to resile from an agreement on the basis that it applied to the 2B and the Crown Contracts.  </p>

The actions after the Octave Contract therefore provide some assistance to shed light on what was intended by the parties at the time of execution of the Octave Contract.

However, even taking this submission into account, the Court rejects the submission that there ever was a November Arrangement in the light of the discussion in this judgment about the same.  For the avoidance of doubt, this submission of Astra does not affect the overall result.  The effect is that the factual matrix of the Octave Contract is very different from that on which the arguments of Astra are premised.  In part, this informs or reinforces the conclusion on construction above, which renders the questions of rectification/estoppel otiose.  However, if in fact rectification is required in order to give rise to an obligation to pay management/performance fees in respect of 2B/Crown, in my judgment, the requisite requirements have been satisfied, and the Octave Contract should be rectified so as to reflect the intention of the parties that the 2B and Crown Contracts are subject to the same fees in favour of Musst as if they too were introductions as defined in the Octave Contract.</p>

If, contrary to that which I have held, the agreement is to be construed as per Astra’s submissions, then notwithstanding the involvement of lawyers on both sides, this mistake has occurred, and it should be corrected.  There is nothing specific in the communications between the lawyers that indicates that the agreement as contended for by Astra was intended to have subjectively the meaning contended for. As regards the fifth point, this is a not an <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton</span> point of a party who has entered into an agreement which was not as favourable as Musst would now wish.  The rectification, an alternative finding in this judgment, would be to reflect the terms of the agreement as the parties intended it to be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It therefore follows that the primary findings are of construction of the Octave Contract that Musst is entitled to introduction fees in respect of both the 2B and Crown Contracts.  Alternatively, the argument that no fees are due in respect of 2B or Crown would be barred by an estoppel by convention. In the alternative, and to like effect, if the findings of construction were wrong, then the agreement would be rectified so as to give rise to liabilities as regards the introductions of 2B and Crown.   In fact, it is not necessary to make declarations about an estoppel by convention or to order rectification in view of the primary findings of construction of the Octave Contract. </p>

However, the contractual claim in this case is against two Astra entities, namely Astra UK and Astra LLP (referred to in this judgment collectively as ‘Astra’). The very names of the entities evidence how at its inception, the Astra companies were intended to carry out the same functions of manager and investment manager respectively as the Octave companies.

The Octave Contract was therefore carried out by the Astra entities, such that any breach of contract taking place after that take-over of functions is actionable against the Astra entities.  Astra deny that there was ever such a take-over of functions.  On the contrary, a draft contract was sent to Musst, but it was never agreed.  There was an issue as to an effective date provision which was never resolved.  Hence, no novation was ever agreed, and there was no contract between Musst and the Astra entities.  For this reason (in addition to the other grounds of defence), Astra deny liability to Musst.</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Many of the reported cases in English law have arisen either out of the amalgamation of companies, or of changes in partnership firms, the question being whether as a matter of fact the party contracting with the company or the firm accepted the new company or the new firm as his debtor in the place of the old company or the old firm. That acceptance may be inferred from acts and conduct, but ordinarily it is not to be inferred from conduct without some distinct request.  Thus where a banking firm consisted of two partners and one died, the acceptance by a customer from the surviving partner of a fresh deposit note for a balance of a debt due was held sufficient evidence of novation to discharge the estate of the deceased partner, as the customer took the money out of a current account and placed it on deposit at the request of the surviving partner.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“The effect of a novation is not to assign or transfer a right or liability, but rather to extinguish the original contract (between A and B) and replace it by another (between A and C). It is therefore necessary that consideration should be provided for the new contract. As novation is different from assignment, it follows that the rule that assignment is “subject to equities” does not apply to novation. Say, for example, a contract was induced by a misrepresentation and there has then been an assignment by the person making the misrepresentation: the debtor can rely on the misrepresentation vis-à-vis the assignee. In contrast, it is irrelevant to a novation that the original contract was induced by a misrepresentation. Once there has been a novation, the original contract has been extinguished and with it the power to rescind for the original misrepresentation. Note also that, under a novation, it would appear that the new party (C) cannot recover in an action for a pre-novation breach of contract against A for pre-novation losses that were suffered by the original contracting party (B).”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The evidence supported this intention to spin out of Octave.

As far as Musst was concerned, and relying upon what was related by Mr Mathur, it would deal in effect with the same people, and it was no different from a name change so that Astra would replace Octave.  Further, the evidence was that Mr Mathur knew that under clause 9.4 of the Octave Contract, Octave was not entitled to transfer over the management of the 2B and Crown funds. (T7/54/7-55/23)</p>

This conduct, looked at objectively, was an unequivocal waiver of its rights under these clauses, and an unequivocal acceptance that Astra LLP, as the new manager of the funds and therefore the new recipient of fees from Crown, was now the party responsible for paying 20% of them to Musst.  Even if Octave was not a party to this exchange, Astra LLP still agreed with Musst (i.e. on a two-part basis rather than tripartite basis) to take on Octave’s liabilities in relation to the Crown Contract.</p>

Further, the parties then proceeded for the next year or so on the footing that the Octave Contract had been novated to Astra LLP (or at least Astra LLP had taken on Octave’s liabilities) in relation to both the 2B Contract and the Crown Contract, because from now Astra LLP, with Musst’s consent, was managing Crown’s and 2B’s funds pursuant to those contracts, receiving the fees there from, and paying over to Musst its 20% share.  </p>

However, Musst says that the parties were already acting on the common assumption that it had been novated, and Musst had changed its position in reliance on this (i.e. by accepting the transfer of management from Octave to Astra without complaint). Further, the draft proceeded upon the premise that Octave was no longer a party, as it was not a party to the draft; and its purpose, as said by Mr Murray to Ms Galligan on 6 May 2015 was: <span style="font-style:italic">“just to ensure that there was you know a transitioning of accounts and that payments would be made directly from Astra rather than from Octave from the effective date so … existing contractual entitlements with Octave up until the effective date remain in place” </span>(see para 138 ARDCC).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Court has well in mind the submissions of Astra, not least, that absent an express agreement about novation, it is wrong lightly to infer a novation.  The release from obligations on the part of one party and the replacement of another party in its stead is a matter of grave consequence for the three parties concerned and for others affected.  Even in the context of the released party and the new party being closely associated, it is a matter of serious consequence for the third party concerned and for third parties such as creditors.  Further, there is Astra’s submission that the language of novation was not used, and that the agreement contended for is at highest only a partial novation.  It is said that the language is so imprecise that at highest there was simply a request for payments to be directed to Astra companies, and that this by itself does not alter the identity of the contracting parties or to whom obligations are owed.  </p>

I accept the evidence especially of Ms Galligan as to how she accepted the position related by Mr Murray that it was in effect a name changing exercise.  The lack of formality is therefore not surprising.  As far as Musst was concerned, and relying upon what was related by Mr Murray, it would deal in effect with the same people, and it was no different from a name change so that Astra would replace Octave.  </p>

The business of Mr Mathur formerly conducted through the vehicle of Octave with the advantage of its regulatory registration would from August 2014 be conducted by Astra LLP.  This was the context of the termination of the Crown Contract and a new contract between Crown and Astra LLP.   Likewise, there was a termination of the 2B Contract and a new contract between 2B and Astra LLP. All fees payable to Octave Ltd would transfer, subject to the agreement of contracting parties, to Astra Capital. Likewise the fees earned by Octave would henceforth be charged by Musst to Astra LLP instead of to Octave LLP.  The summary of facts above sets this out in more detail.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In this context, the request on the part of Astra LLP to Musst to be invoiced the money instead of Octave was not administrative but substantive.  Astra LLP was not acting as agent for Octave in and about the receipt of the moneys.  It was acting for itself as a consequence of the transfer of business from Octave to Astra LLP.  There are no documents showing that the moneys received by Astra LLP were accounted for between Astra LLP and Octave which would have happened if they had been received by Astra LLP as agent on behalf of Octave.  With this transfer from Octave to Astra LLP and then to Astra UK went a transfer of the relevant income stream.  The request to Musst to send its invoice to Astra LLP instead of to Octave LLP reflected an intention that the company receiving the income stream (Astra LLP and then Astra UK) should pay the agreed percentage of the moneys to Musst.  This was the corollary of the transfer from Octave to Astra LLP and then to Astra UK.  </p>

It was not asked.  By the time that Musst was asked to send the invoices to Astra LLP instead of to Octave, the matter was a fait accompli.  Astra say among other things that if anything this would have given rise to a right to damages for a failure to seek consent in advance.  On that analysis, the claim would have been to damages against Octave, but it did not give rise to a contractual claim against Astra LLP and subsequently Astra UK.  The fallacy of this argument is that subsequent to the transfer and in the light of the same, the invoicing chain was altered by agreement so that the customer (Crown/2B) paid to Astra LLP instead of to Octave and Musst was asked to send its invoices from a point of time to Astra LLP instead of to Octave in effect to follow the money.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is this context which provides the answers to the arguments of Astra.  The fact that there was no express agreement of novation does not preclude an agreement by conduct.  The fact that the possibility of an express agreement was canvassed but not finalised does not show that no agreement was made.  In my judgment, the draft agreement was intended not to create a new agreement but to reflect and formalise an agreement which had already been made.  The stumbling block to the finalisation of that agreement was a concern about the Effective Date.  In the light of the issue between the parties about the significance of the Effective Date in the Octave Contract, this may have been an issue of substance.  It was important at least from the perspective of Musst that this provision should not have as its effect that only introductions made after the new Effective Date should be caught by the new written agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The argument of Astra that Musst did not make an introduction to Astra LLP is not an answer to the claim.  The agreement occurred in circumstances where Astra LLP had acquired from Octave the income stream of which a percentage was payable to Musst to the extent that it had introduced the same.  The invoicing was so that the percentage, where applicable, should be paid by Astra LLP as the recipient of the income stream to Musst.  It made commercial sense for the obligation to pay the percentage to go with the receipt of the income.  That was not administrative: it was substantive, and it involved Astra LLP, and latterly Astra UK, taking on the obligation to pay the same percentage which Octave had agreed to pay under the Octave Contract.</p>

Astra Capital was authorised by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and was appointed as the manager of Astra’s funds (ASSCFL and ASCIL), and Astra LLP was appointed as the Investment Manager to the Astra Funds.  This was not an arrangement that Astra LLP would act as the Investment Manager to Octave Limited as Manager or that Octave Limited would delegate powers to Astra LLP.  It was that Octave Limited and Octave LLP would drop out of the picture and that Astra Capital as Manager and Astra LLP as Investment Manager would take over.

(3) The fact that the transaction is executed rather than executory can be very relevant. The fact that the transaction was performed on both sides will often make it unrealistic to argue that there was no intention to enter into legal relations and difficult to submit that the contract is void for vagueness or uncertainty. Specifically, the fact that the transaction is executed makes it easier to imply a term resolving any uncertainty, or, alternatively, it may make it possible to treat a matter not finalised in negotiations as inessential. This may be so in both fully executed and partly executed transactions.

That ignores the context of Astra Capital and Astra LLP respectively becoming Manager and Investment Manager instead of Octave Ltd and Octave LLP respectively.  The suggestion then that Astra LLP was acting in simply an administrative capacity also ignores this context.  If it had been, it would have been acting on behalf of Octave as principal, but the evidence is clearly that it did not do so but must have been acting for itself.  Receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds and paying over 20% to Musst for a period and not passing it on to a principal is not an administrative exercise.

He must also have been involved in the engagement of Mr Holdom and Mr Murray, and he relied upon them to effect the transfer from Octave to Astra.  The emails relied upon by Musst and the offer and acceptance identified by Musst were part and parcel of this transfer.

Further, from the perspective of Musst, the moneys were received in consideration of Musst treating the obligations of Octave to it as discharged to the extent of the moneys received.  Going forward, Musst either accepted the liability of Astra LLP and Astra UK  as being in discharge of the liability of Octave or as being additional to Octave with the promise that Musst would accept payments pursuant to the same in discharge of any ongoing liability of Octave to the extent of the moneys received.</p>

The introduction of new parties is not a variation as between the new parties and the old parties, but a new contract.

It is therefore not necessary to consider whether in fact written consent was waived in the circumstances of this case.  It is simply necessary to consider whether there were obligations assumed by Astra LLP/Astra UK on which Musst could sue.  For all the reasons stated above, this is answered in the affirmative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As regards the novation to Astra UK, I accept the submissions of Musst.  In particular, when asked to charge Astra UK instead of Astra LLP, there was no objection from Musst.  There was an administrative error to send the bill to Astra LLP, but in context that was a clear mistake and understood as such.  Had it not been, the invoice would have been accompanied by protest, but there was none.  Further, the subsequent payment would not have been made at all until this point had been sorted.  Since there was nothing to sort, the payment was made by Astra UK, and it was accepted by Musst.  Thereafter, albeit at a time when no information about receipts was provided, in July 2016, invoices were made out by Musst to Astra UK, confirming that it had no objection to the transfer from Astra LLP to Astra UK.  This acceptance of the transfer to Astra UK is to be seen in the context of the earlier transfer from Octave to Astra LLP.  It was a matter of no significance in that the infrastructure of the business was moving over as was the income stream.  There was no reason to object: it would have been objectionable had it been the case that the business was moved to Astra UK, Astra LLP had given up the income stream and Astra UK was not taking over its position vis-à-vis Musst.  That was not the case: this was a second novation.</p>

I accept Musst’s submission relating to the timing of the invoices, and despite concern that Astra might not honour its obligations, this did not bring to an end the ability of Musst to commit to accept the offer of novation and that all further invoices would be to Astra UK.

Musst and Astra LLP and Octave or Musst and Astra LLP acted on the common assumption that, in relation to the Crown and 2B Contracts and the fees receivable thereunder, the Octave Contract had been novated from Octave to Astra LLP from 5 November 2014.  The common assumption was manifested by Astra LLP asking Musst to make out invoices to Astra LLP in place of Octave and by Astra LLP providing information to enable this to take place. It was manifested by the email of 30 April 2015 from Mr Holdom referred to above to the effect that payments would continue to be made under the Crown Contract, but not under the Crown 2 account.  It was also manifested by Musst making out invoices to Astra LLP in place of Octave and accepting payments made by Astra LLP in place of Octave.  The common assumption thereby crossed the line from which its being shared can be properly inferred.  Astra LLP conveyed to Musst that it expected Musst to rely on it.  </p>

Musst acted in reliance upon the same by making out invoices and accepting the payments made by Astra LLP.  Further, Musst did not chase Octave for payment or complain about Octave’s breach of clause 9.4 of the Octave Contract or about Astra LLP procuring such breach by agreeing to receive the transferred assets.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The same applies also to the transfer from Astra LLP to Astra UK.  Against the background of the transfer to Astra LLP, this was more of the same.  Musst, Astra LLP and Astra UK acted on the common assumption that, in relation to the Crown Contract and the fees receivable thereunder, the Octave Contract had been novated from Astra LLP to Astra UK from April/May 2016.  The common assumption was manifested by Astra UK asking Musst to make out invoices to Astra UK in place of Astra LLP.  When asked to charge Astra UK instead of Astra LLP, there was no objection from Musst.  Musst made out an invoice in May 2016 (albeit in obvious error to Astra LLP), and payment was duly made by Astra UK and accepted by Musst.  Astra UK reminded Musst that the payee should be Astra UK and there was no protest.  Thereafter, in July 2016, albeit when no further information about revenue was being provided by Astra UK, further invoices were made by Musst to Astra UK, which was further confirmation that there was no objection to the latest transfer.  The sharing of the common assumption takes its character in the context of the transfer from Octave to Astra LLP: this was a further transfer this time from Astra LLP to Astra UK which was also accepted by conduct.  Musst acted in reliance upon this common assumption by sending invoices without protest and accepting the money from Astra UK and not insisting on its rights against Astra LLP.  It would be unconscionable for Astra UK to resile from the common assumption having taken the benefit of the income stream on the latest transfer and in view of the reliance by Musst.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This fourth issue is said to arise if there had been a novation to Astra LLP, but not to Astra UK.  Although there are complexities in the argument about unjust enrichment, the matter would be considered in the context of the business of Astra LLP being transferred to Astra UK in a contract dated 29 April 2016 signed by Mr Mathur on both sides and providing obligations in the nature of (a) an assumption of liabilities in the widest terms of Astra LLP by Astra UK (Clauses 3.1 and 3.2), and (b) an undertaking by Astra UK to perform the obligations of Astra LLP and an indemnity arising out of any failure to perform (Clauses 6.4 and 6.5. It would also be considered in the context of the argument of MUSST that receipt of fees by Astra UK was sufficient to give rise to a claim for those fees against Astra LLP.  This was on the basis that Astra UK was an affiliate, as per the Octave Contract, of Astra LLP.  This would then found an entitlement to an indemnity against Astra UK under the deed of transfer dated 29 April 2016.A long and detailed consideration is not proportionate in circumstances where if an argument in restitution failed, it appears that ultimately the liability would be enforced to the advantage of Musst, if necessary, through Astra LLP’s rights against Astra UK.  Having determined the issue of novation in favour of Musst and against Astra LLP and Astra UK, then it is not necessary to reach any findings in respect of the fourth issue. </p>

On Astra’s construction, whether it was a new fund or an old fund, whether at the time of the making of the investment or at any time thereafter, in the event that it no longer followed the Current Strategy, the right to fees thereafter would cease.   If that had been the case, it would not be necessary to refer to the case of the New Fund.  It was necessary to do that because the emphasis is on the time of the making of the investment, the original investment and the new investment.  Clause 3.7 says that it is not sufficient that the investor makes a new investment arising out of redeemed funds of an investment which was made for the Current Strategy.  The next investment must be for the Current Strategy for it to be an Eligible Investment.  I accept the submission of Musst that Clause 3.7 supports the construction that the key time for an entitlement to fee is the point of the making of the investment, and not what happens thereafter.  There is a necessary implication or inference from Clause 3.7 that, provided that the investment was at its inception for the Current Strategy, it remains an Eligible Investment attracting fees.  </p>

In my judgment, the provision in context was saying that the other funds and securities were still similar to the Current Strategy.  If it had been intended to say that it had to remain as such in order to qualify as an Eligible Investment, much clearer words would have been required, especially bearing in mind the consequences of such construction.</p>

The question is whether this might mean, as Astra contend, for so long as the Eligible Investments are in the Current Strategy.  In my judgment, the words are not sufficiently clear to bear that meaning.  It is possible that if the words had been transposed to say that it was for so long as the Eligible Investments were maintained in the Current Strategy that there would be a better textual argument.  As written, Clause 13.2 appears to be saying that the words are to emphasise that, for so long as the investment is maintained by the investor, there is an entitlement to the revenue share.

In the instant case, that might mean that, even if the meaning of Astra which with hindsight did not serve the interest of Musst, Musst is still saddled with the interpretation (<span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton</span> at para. 19).

The highest that the matter could be put on this alternative footing is that the words themselves are not clear, and that there are rival constructions.  It is at that point that consistent with the unitary exercise of construction the Court can give weight to the implications of rival constructions by reaching a view which is more consistent with business common sense.

The terms of the Octave Contract were clear that payment does not become due until fees have been earned and received by Octave.  That may be a long period of time.  There is the original lock up period which may be three years, that is the period of time during which the investor is unable to release the investment.  Thereafter, the investor may choose not to release the investment.  In the event that the investments were a success, the main fee would be likely to be the performance fee.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On Astra’s construction, that fee could be removed from that point onwards by Musst moving away from the Current Strategy.  That could happen because Octave would rather keep the benefit from future performance for itself.   The sensible commercial result is that the determining factor should be at the point of the making of the investment, and it is not a sensible commercial result to be deprived of a future performance fee as a result of a modification or change of the strategy in the years prior to the performance fee ever becoming due.  </p>

It is so difficult to discern that the payment of the management fees until 2016 is a strong indicator that Octave/Astra did not see the point.  Their case is that the payments were made pursuant to the November Arrangement, but on the basis of the analysis above, I have found that the payments were made pursuant to the Octave Contract.  This defence, like others, in this case, appears only to have come following non-payment and as a retrospective attempt to justify the non-payment.

It is only in respect of the original investment or any additional investment if they are made for the Current Strategy at the point that they are made.  The agreement can be terminated for breach under Clause 13, and Clause 13.2 would then provide for the fees ceasing to be payable.  In the ordinary course, the investment would be the subject of a redemption, and the nature of strategies changing would be that future investments may not follow the Current Strategy at inception.  The Octave Contract does not require a payment in respect of any further investments (not emanating from the original investment) in the event that the further investment is not following the Current Strategy.  Likewise, it does not require a payment in respect of an investment in a new fund (emanating from the original investment) where there has been a redemption of the old fund.   </p>

The nature of the controversy in this case illustrates the virtual unworkability of the construction of the clause on the construction of Astra.  It is straightforward to be able to ascertain at the inception of a fund that the investment is for the Current Strategy: that was intended from the start, and unsurprisingly, this is not the subject of controversy that, at their inception, the investments of 2B and Crown were for the Current Strategy.  It might be more difficult in respect of a new investment (not being the proceeds of the original investment) at a future time, but it is a binary question at the point in time when the original investment is made.  </p>

So it has turned out with the calling of expert evidence in this case and the numerous points of dispute between the experts.  That evidence is accepted to be complex by the parties in the context of a court case.  The construction of Astra presupposes that there would have to be consideration at any point in time whether the investment was subject to the Current Strategy without experts being enlisted and a court case in which the evidence of the experts was tested.  Even in this case, the submissions of the parties are not particularly precise as regards each point of time when it is said that the investments were following or were departing from the Current Strategy.

All of this provides a reason contextually for the interpretation that the relevant time for determining whether there was an Eligible Investment for the purpose of an entitlement to management/performance fees was at the time of the making of the investment and not from time to time thereafter.</p>

In my judgment, that is to ignore the nature of the Second and Third 2B and Crown Contracts and the nature of the novation.    There was not a new investment which was made at the point when the Second and Third Contracts were made.  Those contracts were headed “Amended and Restated Investment Management Agreement”.  They were substantially in the same terms as the Crown Contract and the 2B Contract.  Their purpose was that there was a change of investment manager from Octave to Astra LLP and then from Astra LLP to Astra UK.  In my judgment, the operative date for considering whether the Current Strategy was being operated was the time when the investment was made.  Otherwise, the change in the corporate vehicle used by Mr Mathur would have an effect beyond what was intended.  It was intended that there would be a seamless transition of companies.  This is reflected in the reasoning and conclusions above in respect of novations.  It was not intended that there would have to be a question as to whether the introductions were made in respect of the investments transferred to Astra LLP and then to Astra UK.  The original investments had been made in 2013 and whenever they were made thereafter.  The amended and restated agreements or the taking over of the management of the investments by Astra LLP and then Astra UK was not the making of the investments all over again.  </p>

The argument of Musst is that if it is not the case that the Octave Contract is to be construed as per Musst’s primary argument, the parties acted on the common assumption that the right of Musst to management and performance fees would continue in relation to each Eligible Investment.  This would be until and to the extent that it (or an asset acquired by it) was sold or converted into a non-Eligible Investment, at which point a right to performance fees would accrue: see RAMPOC para. 113C.  It is pleaded that the reason why they did this was because they realised that the Claimant’s right to fees continued to subsist even if the accounts had ceased to follow the Current Strategy (if that was the case): see RAMPOC para.113D.  In addition to payment of fees, Musst also relies on conversations in April 2015 and June and July 2016 referred to in paragraph 5 of Appendix 1 RAMPOC, because the premise of all of  those conversations was that the Claimant was entitled to management fees and performance fees even though (according to the Defendants’ Defence) the managed accounts had ceased by then to follow the Current Strategy. It is also evidenced by Mr Holdom’s emails to Mr Mathur of 14 June 2016 and 28 June 2016 disclosed by the Defendants, which proceed upon the same premise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Astra challenges the existence of an estoppel by convention both as regards the facts and the law.  Factually, at [T6/176 – 181], Mr Mathur said that he communicated his view that the fees should only be payable when the funds were invested in the Current Strategy, and that Mr Phillips and Mr Siddiqi then came to an agreement about this <span style="font-style:italic">“that it would only be applicable so long as the funds are invested in the current strategy”</span>. Mr Mathur then expanded on this evidence in re-examination at [T9/45-46].  I reject this evidence.  Had it been true, then it would have been a part of the pleadings and Mr Mathur’s witness statements, particularly following a detailed pleading in paras. 113A – 113E of RAMPOC setting out the common assumption.  The evidence of Mr Mathur contradicted an email of Mr Phillips of 14 December 2012 copied to Mr Mathur telling Musst that the fee obligation would continue to subsist for as long as the funds are in place, on which Mathur commented: <span style="font-style:italic">“Looks like we are there now on the agreement”</span>.   There was no email or other communication from Mr Phillips or Mr Mathur backtracking on this.   Although the internal communications between Mr Siddiqi and Ms Galligan and SRZ have been disclosed, there is no internal communication recording any discussion by Mr Mathur to the effect that the introduction of the phrase “the Current Strategy” meant that Musst’s rights would expire upon a change in the strategy, even in relation to investments already made.  The evidence of Mr Mathur suited the case of Astra, and it matters not for this purpose whether his evidence was divined at this later stage consciously or unconsciously.  It is not credible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Astra’s argument as to the law is that the elements of the estoppel by convention are not satisfied.  The case of Musst is summarised in the skeleton argument in the following terms, namely for the reasons set out in paragraphs 113A to 113E of the RAMPOC that all parties acted on the common assumption that the Octave Contract meant that the Current Strategy was only by reference to the time of the making of the investments and/or that the 2B and Crown managed accounts continued to follow the Current Strategy, in reliance on which Musst made no alterations to the Octave Contract before it was signed. Musst says: <span style="font-style:italic">“Why else did Octave and then Astra keep paying Musst right up to May 2016, when on Astra’s (now) interpretation, the Octave Contract did not require them to do so?”</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment, there was no common assumption about the meaning of the Current Strategy in the sense that there is no evidence that the parties applied their minds to it, or communicated their understanding of the phrase.  When the phrase first appeared in the travelling draft, there was no explanation as to what it meant, nor was there some specific accord as to what it meant.  The reason for the payments was not then because of a specific assumption about the meaning of the Current Strategy.  It is likely that the parties never applied their mind to this alleged defence until after the inception of the dispute.  It is possible that they did not think that there was any change in the Current Strategy and so they never had to apply their mind to the construction argument.  In my judgment, the common assumption that the fee would be payable because a possible defence (if that is what it was) had not occurred to Astra is not specific enough to give rise to a relevant common assumption.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Likewise, there is no specific case as to how Musst acted on the common assumption to its detriment.  It does not suffice to say that Musst entered into the Octave Contract without seeking to change its terms because there is no relevant common assumption in respect of the words “Current Strategy” before the Octave Contract.   As regards the understanding that there would be payments thereafter and the course of conduct of making payments of management fees and making admissions in respect of what would be paid, it is difficult to see how this gave rise to a detriment.  Again, it is not sufficiently specific to the “Current Strategy” terms so as to indicate that had it been pointed out, Musst would have insisted that the relevant contractual clauses would have been amended.  There is an argument that in the event that the admissions about payment had not been made, Musst would not have consented to the transfers to Astra LLP and Astra UK respectively, but I am not satisfied that that is sufficiently specific to give rise to an estoppel by convention about the meaning of the Current Strategy.  Likewise, it does not indicate that the parties believed that they were following the Current Strategy, since it is perhaps more likely that they did not consider what was the strategy at the relevant time or that this might afford the basis of a defence.  </p>

First, for the above reasons, there is no estoppel by convention.  Second, as a matter of law, such conduct after the contract, and absent an estoppel, cannot be an aid to construction of the contract.  Third, it is possible that the behaviour of Astra in connection with payments is evidence that the paying party did not understand that the Current Strategy had been altered.  However, this is far from conclusive evidentially, because it may simply be that, at the material time, Astra did not apply its mind to the Current Strategy point.  </p>

A list of points of disagreement between the experts would be vast.

These are only the most significant characteristics.  It is therefore a multi-factorial and evaluative analysis.

Since the Current Strategy was either disregarded or analysed differently at the time by Astra, and hence the payments continued to be made and this point did not arise until the litigation, the evidence as to the Current Strategy appears to be based on reconstruction.  Dr Adler has given evidence that he was not concerned with the terms of the Octave Contract at the time.  It follows that he was not considering the Current Strategy at the time.  Mr Mathur has given evidence that he was concerned with the Current Strategy at the point when the contract was being negotiated, and he has given evidence about this.  However, for the reasons set out above, I have not accepted that evidence.  This does not form a sound start to consideration of his evidence about Current Strategy.  Just as his evidence which has been rejected has been self-serving, so too there is the risk of his analysis being after the event and tailored consciously or unconsciously to the case.

It is that, with the assistance of experts in foreign law, although it is deciding a question technically of fact (because foreign law has been treated as such), it has the advantage of being familiar with the subject matter.  This is very different from many areas of expert evidence where the court is asked to go into more unfamiliar fields.  On the other hand, in a case such as the present where it is said that there are conflicting decisions, and the Court would have to treat itself as if it were the Supreme Court of the United States of America, the task is considerable.  </p>

First, many US courts including the Federal Courts of New York, would consider the 2B’s Contract itself a “<span style="font-style:italic">security</span>” because it provided for Octave LLP to manage the funds and be compensated in part by the account’s profits, and is therefore an “<span style="font-style:italic">investment contract</span>”. Second, any US court would conclude that the account’s underlying swaps and bonds are securities, for these are paradigmatic securities under US law.</p>

As noted above, there is a conflict of authority in the federal courts, both at first instance and in the appellate courts on what a “<span style="font-style:italic">common enterprise</span>” means [T10/214/5 – T10/215/9]. There is a question as to whether the doctrine of “vertical commonality” applies.  As noted above, there is not consistency in this regard because many court decisions (according to Professor Thel, the majority) have held that a managed account advised by an investment adviser is not a security, whereas there is a consistency of the courts of the Southern District of New York to contrary effect.  Professor Thel says that the cases relied on by Mr Riely are limited to cases where the investment was obtained by fraud both of the introducer and the investment manager.  Mr Riely says that the cases do not say that they hinge on fraud in finding a common enterprise, and so there is no distinction between a case with or without fraud.  Attention is drawn to <span style="font-style:italic">SEC v Ranieri </span>which has been referred to as a case where fraud had not been established, but which Professor Thel regards as an <span style="font-style:italic">“outlier”</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Although the facts come close to amounting to a shared assumption that the performance by Musst does not require registration of the contractual investment of 2B, I am not satisfied that an estoppel by convention or an estoppel by representation are made out.  The context of the letter of comfort could be understood as follows.  Octave was saying <span style="font-style:italic">“we will not proceed without a letter of comfort because we do not wish to expose ourselves to liabilities.”</span>  This does not mean that Octave was necessarily saying that the various terms of the contract requiring an investment not to contravene the law were to be modified.  In particular, if notwithstanding the letter of comfort, the investment was not regarded as an Eligible Investment due to payment of the Revenue Share contravening the law, there is no clear and unequivocal promise that the agreement to accept the letter of comfort overrides those words.  That being the case, the estoppel by representation and estoppel by convention are not established.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As for the suggestion that Musst is approbating and reprobating, I am not satisfied that this founds the equivalent of an estoppel for the same reasons as the previous paragraph.  The premise of the argument is that at the point of the transaction with 2B and the Octave Contract, it believes that there is no contravention.  Years later, when it comes to payment, it asserts that there is a contravention by the payment itself.  If that is true, it has in particular Clause 3.5 to deal with that, the consequence of which is (according to Astra) that the investment is not to be treated as Eligible Investment and so no payment would be due.  In fact, the answer is in the paragraphs above such that the payment of the Revenue Share does not contravene any law.  Further and in any event, the broader concepts of the inequity of having the benefits of the introduction without having to pay the fees for the introduction still resonate in connection with the equitable defences.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is convenient to set out the factual analysis of the Defamation Claim separately from the Contract Claim despite the fact that the facts of the two claims are intimately connected in time and in content.  They nevertheless give rise to different claims.  The Defamation Claim is brought by Astra, and it is against Mr Siddiqi in addition to Musst.  The alleged disparaging remarks are also relied upon as a defence to the Contract Claim on the ground that it is said to be a ground for termination of the Octave Contract.  In one sense, it is logical to complete consideration of the Contract Claim before going on to the Defamation Claim.  However, since there is a large overlap between the two claims, it makes sense to consider the Defamation Claim first and then to revert to the Seventh Issue in the Contract Claim.</p>

Mr Glen in his final closing submissions for Astra referred to the question of whether the Statements were made as being the <span style="font-style:italic">“first and primary issue of dispute between the parties”</span>.  Mr Glen referred to <span style="font-style:italic">“diametrically conflicting factual accounts”</span> of what took place at the Rome conference on 23 June 2016 between Mr Siddiqi and Mr Plotke.  The second issue is the correct approach to the issue of serious harm and damage for the purpose of the malicious falsehood claim and the evidential issues in this regard.  There were issues other than publication and damage, but rightly the parties concentrated especially on publication and damage in the closing submissions.</p>

It is important to consider the background because Astra say that the concerns which Musst entertained about the Defendant at this stage provides a motive for Musst to make disparaging remarks in connection with Astra especially to LGT.  This makes it more likely, Astra submit, that Musst did make the remarks, and the less likely that the anodyne account of Mr Siddiqi of the conversation was correct.  Further, a false denial would raise obvious question marks as to what did take place. </p>

Mr Mathur went on to say that he had received redemption requests from two other investors, Mr Chandaria and Mr Edwards.

Dr Chander says in his witness statement that he did not wish to get involved in any dispute between Mr Mathur and Mr Siddiqi. He says that he hoped <span style="font-style:italic">“they would resolve matters amicably”</span>.

Dr Chander gave evidence of a chance meeting in the underground on 23 June 2017 when Mr Siddiqi said that Mr Mathur was <span style="font-style:italic">“unreliable”</span> and had a <span style="font-style:italic">“dark side”</span> and he also used the expression <span style="font-style:italic">“one trick pony”</span> and that Astra was a <span style="font-style:italic">“sinking ship”</span>.  There were also related to Mr Mathur, according to his evidence, instances of reports of what Mr Siddiqi had said, namely: (a) on 7 July 2016, Mr Septon related to Mr Mathur that Mr Siddiqi had made <span style="font-style:italic">“inappropriate statements about Astra”</span>, and he asked if anything was wrong, and, (b) another investor mentioned that he had heard similar disparaging remarks to <span style="font-style:italic">“one trick pony”</span>.</p>

However, the basis of the <span style="font-style:italic">“implication” </span>cannot be tested because Mr Rigter does not recall what exactly was said which apparently implied this. Again, despite this apparently being reported further within LGT, there are no records or notes which have been disclosed of what was said. It does not appear that it was raised with anyone else at the time, or at the meeting in July 2016 when he says that he told Mr Mathur of the statements set out at paragraph 20 of his witness statement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Siddiqi sent an internal email summarising his conversation with Mr Rigter in November 2016. His account was that Mr Rigter had asked him about his conversation with Mr Plotke in Rome and Mr Siddiqi had replied <span style="font-style:italic">“All I had said to Ralf (sic) was LGT were the last remaining investor and since Musst was integral to the deal construct and coupled with our fiduciary responsibility to LGT, we knew Shamil had redeemed and 2B was in the process of redeeming.” </span>The point is made by the Defendants that if the conversation of 23 June 2016 was as entirely as per the evidence of Mr Siddiqi, it would not have been recalled five months later.  That is a point of comment, but it does not bear out the construction that the conversation must have involved disparaging remarks.  The email records that Mr Siddiqi was not negative about Astra. <span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Mr Rigter disputed the accuracy of <span style="font-style:italic">“some” </span>of the contents of that email but does not say what, other than that he and Mr Siddiqi had not known each other for “<span style="font-style:italic">a near-decade</span>”. <span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Mr Rigter does not bring up any allegedly disparaging statements, nor does he suggest that such statements were made. Mr Rigter’s witness statement at para. 28 is carefully worded in relation to the November 2016 encounter and is silent as to what exactly was said, and the context of the discussion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It was suggested to Mr Siddiqi that his account of what he told Mr Rigter he said was <span style="font-style:italic">“tantamount” </span>to saying that <span style="font-style:italic">“Astra’s investors were pulling their money out … don’t be the last man standing”</span> [T5/230/8-14]. Mr Siddiqi explained that this was not the case: it was not a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>of Astra’s investors, but to that particular strategy. Mr Siddiqi’s evidence was that his email was not clear that he was explaining the position as of June 2016 or November 2016 [T5/230/15-19; 232-234].<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>Mr Siddiqi’s explanation was credible; what was said in the internal email of 30 November was not a disparaging comment of the sort alleged in the Defamation Claim. It does not suggest that Astra cannot pay its staff, that Mr Mathur is a <span style="font-style:italic">“one-trick pony”</span>, or that the business is about to <span style="font-style:italic">“go under” </span>so LGT should <span style="font-style:italic">“get out while it can”</span>. I accept the submission that this does not enable the Court to draw an inference after the fact as to what was said during the lunch in Rome in June 2016, still less that the disparaging words alleged were used.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Nevertheless, Astra submit that there was an obvious question why Mr Rigter and LGT would have taken the measures that they did, as described in paragraphs 22-24 of Mr Rigter’s witness statement, <span class="VerbatimChar" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">if something serious had not been said about Astra shortly before the 7 July.  He says that he carried out an on-site due diligence exercise on Astra and used a pre-arranged meeting for this purpose.  He says at para. 24 that he and Mr Plotke asked: </span><span class="VerbatimChar" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">“detailed questions of Mr Mathur and Dr Adler about the business, portfolio, new investment opportunities and the overall performance”.</span><span class="VerbatimChar" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">  Mr Rigter was broadly satisfied with the answers, and he reported this to the next meeting of LGT’s Investment Committee.  These were referred to as </span><span class="VerbatimChar" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">“extraordinary measures”</span><span class="VerbatimChar" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> in the concluding oral submissions for Astra.  In my judgment, this characterisation is not justified.  There is nothing from that description to show that the questions that were being asked were significantly greater than a routine current updating about the investment and current performance.  If, in fact, the Statements had just been made, one would have expected a real escalation including questions in writing, requiring written responses.  It is also difficult to see how Mr Rigter and Mr Plotke would have been satisfied by information provided orally in this way, without wishing to go through precisely what had been said.  Far from demonstrating a likelihood of disparaging remarks, this evidence undermines rather than supports the case of Astra.  It also dovetails with the failure on the part of Musst to confront Mr Siddiqi with the allegations as soon as they were reported on 7 July 2016.  It therefore calls into question whether the Statements were reported in the manner alleged, and whether the Statements were made in the terms alleged.  </span></p>

It does not assist the Court in its task of determining – with a degree of precision – what was said on 23 June 2016. Mr Rigter could give no evidence as to the context in which the words were apparently spoken, or whether Mr Plotke reported them in full. There is no contemporaneous note or recording that assists in that task. Musst therefore had no opportunity to test these crucial aspects of the evidence. </p>

After the statement, he claims that he immediately reported his conversation with Mr Siddiqi (although not the details) to Mr Mathur, but he did not take them up with Mr Siddiqi.  This did not seem the action of a neutral party.  There was no contemporaneous note about the meeting in the tube.  The evidence did not feature in the pre-action correspondence in 2017, nor in the pleadings before amendment.  He made his first statement in October 2018, that is more than one year after the conversation.

In the light of the above findings regarding the partisan approach of Mr Mathur and Mr Murray, and the way that the other witness statements were prepared as regards the words complained of in the Statements, it is probable that Dr Chander was aware of the precise words <span style="font-style:italic">complained of</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">before </span>he wrote his witness statement, which contaminated his recollection of events that had taken place some considerable time earlier, and in respect of which he has no written note.  If the words which he said in 2018 had been said on 23 June 2017, namely <span style="font-style:italic">“one trick pony”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“sinking ship”</span>, he would have in all probability related those words in 2017.  The fact that he did not made it likely (despite his evidence to the contrary) that he was shown these words by Astra: see [T11/77/6-21].<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span> I therefore find that nothing in connection with Dr Chander makes more likely that the offending words were said on 23 June 2016 to Mr Plotke.  </p>

Instead of adducing evidence, the case that Mr Huyghebaert was anxious about the safety of his investment due to what he had been told by Mr Siddiqi is a case based on speculation and conjecture, and not inference.

Mr Mathur was unable either to answer these objective points or to explain why this did not form a part of the witness statements or the disclosure.  He was seeking to bolster the case that the Statements were made.   The Court does not have to find that the evidence was dishonest, but in my judgment the fact that he was wrong in his evidence and that he was seeking to bolster the case of Astra (whether consciously or sub-consciously) shows that his recollection was strongly influenced by a desire to support Astra’s case.

The evidence of Mr Mathur and Mr Murray are to be treated with considerable caution at least in respect of their evidence as to whether they ever received information relating to the Statements.  The fact that they have both sought to bolster the evidence about the Statements by evidence about a note, irrespective of whether they did or did not believe that there was such a note, makes their evidence generally regarding the Statements unreliable.  In the case of Mr Murray, his evidence went beyond identifying the making of the note, but extended to the information being provided to lawyers and his realising 7 weeks before his oral testimony that the note had been lost without this point being pointed out to the solicitors for Musst.  If it were otherwise, and there had not been produced a note which existed, Mr Murray, despite being a lawyer, has failed to preserve this critical evidence, to ensure that it was disclosed and to mention this in his witness statement.  In either event, his reliability as a witness was severely undermined.    </p>

Second, the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of Mr Mathur and Mr Murray, who were trying to prove a case and whose evidence was unreliable as to the Statements, is such that their corroboration, far from enhancing the case, adds to the likelihood of contamination by discussions and recollections from others.

Thus, the concern about contamination was particularly serious in this case.  The evidence about the conversation of 7 July 2016 is already odd with a meeting of about 1.5 hours according to Dr Adler, and the reference to the alleged words only at the end and thereafter.  All of this affects the ability to test properly what exactly was said and/or its full gist.  Overall, the discrediting of the evidence of Mr Mathur and Mr Murray undermines the evidence of the recollection of the alleged conversations of 7 July 2016 of Mr Mathur with Mr Rigter and Mr Plotke, and of Mr Murray with Mr Mathur and Dr Adler.  Just as the evidence about the note is, in my judgment, false (whether intentionally or unintentionally), they both have been shown to have had a demonstrable desire to support the case that the Statements were made.  To this end, the falsity of the evidence of the note taints also the recollection about what was said in these conversations of Mr Mathur and Mr Murray respectively. </p>

If the Statements had been made, then it would be expected that they would be passed on as a matter of urgency to Astra and from Astra to Musst in order to prevent the publication of further statements.  However, the evidence is that this did not occur.  In fact, the chronology is that it was over 7 months before the earliest written record in evidence of any (and, even then, not all) of the words allegedly spoken.  There was a delay of over a year before any attempt was made to put Musst on notice of the precise words complained of.

Firstly, in the Defamation Claim, the onus of proof is on Astra and not on Musst.  Second, if Musst were to call him, it would have been unable to cross examine him on his evidence, and given his continued employment with LGT, still a client of Astra, it seems unlikely that he would have been cooperative.

Musst is forced to meet a case based entirely on oral hearsay accounts. These accounts are necessarily a ‘snapshot’, provided a long time after the making of the alleged Statements, of what is alleged to have happened. They refer only to the words complained of, in most cases simply repeating them verbatim from the amended claim form and pleadings. They do not offer any context to the words spoken, as, contrary to the case as initially pleaded, none of the witnesses in this claim were even present at the lunch between Mr Plotke and Mr Siddiqi.

The evidence of Ms Galligan and Mr Siddiqi was that they formed the view that to agree with LGT for them to hold back Musst’s share of the fee would have been inflammatory and would have damaged significantly the relationships of Astra with its key investors.  It was an idea which was not implemented.  Likewise, I accept the explanations given regarding the matters of statements allegedly made to third parties, which is an answer both to the allegations that the statements were made or that they evidence the alleged Statements made to Mr Plotke.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“The financial loss envisaged here is not the same as special damage, in the sense in which that term is used in the law of defamation. Section 1 is concerned with harm to reputation, whereas (as I have pointed out) special damage represents pecuniary loss to interests other than reputation.  What is clear, however, is that section 1(2) must not refer to the harm done to the claimant’s reputation, but to the loss caused or is likely to cause. The financial loss is the measure of the harm and must exceed the threshold of seriousness. As applied to harm which the defamatory statement “has caused”, this necessarily calls for an investigation of the actual impact of the statement. A given statement said to be defamatory may cause greater or lesser financial loss to the claimant, depending on his or her particular circumstances and the reaction of those to whom it is published. Whether that financial loss has occurred and whether it is ‘serious’ are questions which cannot be answered by reference only to the inherent tendency of the words.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">There is no evidence that Astra’s overall financial position worsened after 23 June 2016, less still that it worsened as a consequence of the words complained of. The focus of the evidence has been on the individual redemptions and their impact on a particular managed fund. When asked about Astra’s overall financial health, Mr Mathur accepted that since 2016, Astra had continued to do well financially [T7/113:4].  There is an absence of evidence as to how any serious actual financial losses impacted on the overall financial position of Astra, or on Astra’s <span style="font-style:italic">“bottom line”</span> in the words of <span style="font-style:italic">Gubarev </span>referred to below at para. 89. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Astra suggested that the matter escalated to due diligence in respect of Astra, showing that the words must have caused loss.  However,<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>a due diligence exercise was carried out at a meeting on 7 July 2016.  It was arranged before the Statements were even made, showing that it was a routine meeting at its inception.  It lasted approximately an hour to an hour and a half.   To the extent that there were any concerns about the Defendants’ <span style="font-style:italic">“operational risk”</span>, these were clearly addressed as of 7 July 2017.  It did not lead to a complaint by Mr Mathur at the time.  There was no evidence of financial loss in respect of the audits.  In the light of the matters set out above, there is no evidence of actual loss, nor was actual loss a natural and probable result of the words spoken.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Rigter’s evidence was that at the conclusion of the meeting of 7 July 2016, LGT was <span style="font-style:italic">“broadly satisfied.”</span>  Mr Mathur accepted that LGT did not at any stage say to him, or to Dr Adler, that they were taking into account comments made by Mr Siddiqi in their investment decisions [T8/53-54].  Further, he <span style="color:#000000">accepted that at the 5 October 2016 meeting, Mr Seeholzer asked the Defendants to make some purchases for Crown I as well as for Crown II and III [T8/59] if the opportunity arose. The obvious inference here is that Mr Seeholzer, if he was aware of the statements at all, was unconcerned when it came to making investment decisions.  The continuance of the relationship and the making of new investments strongly indicates that the alleged Statements did not cause actual financial loss. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On the contrary, if there was a problem which might have been caused by the alleged words used, a reasonable investor would not simply pull its money or reduce its investments unless satisfied that it was the right thing to do. This was accepted by Mr Mathur [T8/52-53]. The natural and probable result was that any issue would be resolved by disclosure of the financial position of Astra, which would have demonstrated the true position.   In this case, a small amount of due diligence would have resolved the position without the need for detailed inquiry to the satisfaction of LGT.  It should also consider the context in which the publication occurred. It should not assume that a publishee would take immediate or unreasonable action in relation to the statement. This was the approach of the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Brady v Express Newspaper</span> [1997] EMLR 192,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in which a claim for malicious falsehood brought by a prisoner on the basis that the falsehood could have resulted in the loss of a discretionary weekly allowance was struck out on the basis that no reasonable prison authority would withdraw a privilege without further inquiry.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">That is what ensued here, and so not only are Astra not able to establish any loss, nor are they able to show that there was or would have been any natural and probable loss.  Some of the proof of this is what happened after the statements were allegedly made.  There was no likelihood of serious loss because it was likely that LGT would inquire of the true position and would ascertain that there was no problem, and the alleged words were not borne out by the true financial position of Astra.  It is also to be borne in mind that if the Statements were made, they were not committed to writing, they were not widely published, but related to Mr Plotke.  Further, the effect of not calling Mr Plotke is that there is no direct evidence of the way in which the words were uttered and the precise context which would be of value in order to prove a natural and probable effect of the words used.   In all the circumstances, Astra have failed to prove that Mr Siddiqi and/or Musst caused or was likely to cause Astra serious financial loss.</p>

The submission of Astra is that Mr Siddiqi made the statements maliciously in that he wanted 2B and/or Crown to withdraw the investments and thereby to bring about what he perceived as an entitlement to a performance fee.  He did so because he was short of money, and he either knew that he was saying was false, or he did not care whether it was true or false.</p>

The scheme of seeking to get investors to leave or to pay the fees directly to Musst has not been established.  He was interested in seeking to persuade Mr Mathur to pay what he believed was owed.  That did not mean that he would make up matters intentionally or recklessly.  The approach of him and his wife was more analytical than that, and they would know that falsehoods would not assist their cause.</p>

The reasons here are very similar to those in the Defamation Claim relating to the Rome Conference.  The alleged statements did not cause Astra to make a complaint or LGT to stop its business with Astra.  On the contrary, on the basis of his statement at para. 19, Mr Rigter said that he reported this to the Chief Investment Officer of Liquid Alternatives at LGT.  It was decided to take no action given Astra’s positive performance. Mr Rigter suspected some personal reason on the part of Mr Siddiqi.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">As regards the Rome conference, the findings in the Defamation Claim are repeated.  Although that was a finding about slander, whereas disparaging statements are broader because they might include true statements, it has not been proven that disparaging statements were made about Astra or Mr Mathur.  The rationale is substantially the same as the reason why the Statements were not found to have been at the Rome Conference.  In any event, even if the statements were made there is no evidence that either the statements caused or were likely to cause loss to Astra for the reasons set out in the Defamation Claim.  They were not taken up for months with Mr Siddiqi.  Since Mr Plotke has not given evidence, there is no contextual evidence from which to shed light on how the alleged words were uttered and how grave any alleged breach of contract was, which would be relevant to materiality and whether any breach was remediable.</p>

The Court does not find proven the allegations made by Dr Chander and bears in mind the absence of contemporaneous record, the absence of contemporaneous challenge and the real risk of contamination in respect of Dr Chander’s evidence.  It is arguable that the admitted comments of Mr Siddiqi, namely his belief that Mr Mathur was unreliable and had a dark side were disparaging statements about Astra and therefore amounted to a breach of contract: see the fourth statement of Mr Siddiqi para. 184.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span style="font-style:italic">“The question then is what is meant in this context by the word ‘remedy’. It could mean obviate or nullify the effect of a breach so that any damage already done is in some way made good. Or it could mean cure so that matters are put right for the future. I think that the latter is the more natural meaning. The word is commonly used in connection with diseases or ailments and they would normally be said to be remedied if they were cured although no cure can remove the past effect or result of the disease before the cure took place, and in general it can only be in a rare case that any remedy of something that has gone wrong in the performance of a continuing positive obligation will, in addition to putting it right for the future, remove or nullify damage already incurred before the remedy was applied. To restrict the meaning of remedy to cases where all damage past and future can be put right would leave hardly any scope at all for this clause. On the other hand, there are cases where it would seem a misuse of language to say that a breach can be remedied. For example, a breach of clause 14 by disclosure of confidential information could not be said to be remedied by a promise not to do it again. So the question is whether a breach of Wickman’s obligation under clause 7 (b) (i) is capable of being remedied within the meaning of this agreement. On the one hand, failure to make one particular visit might have irremediable consequences, e.g. a valuable order might have been lost when making that visit would have obtained it. </span><span class="Emphasis">But looking at the position broadly I incline to the view that breaches of this obligation should be held to be capable of remedy within the meaning of clause 7. Each firm had to be visited more than 200 times. If one visit is missed I think that one would normally say that making arrangements to prevent a recurrence of that breach would remedy the breach.”</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(emphasis added)</p>

Further, under clause 4.7 and/or pursuant to section 35A of the Senior Courts Act 1981, Musst is entitled to interest running at 2% above the base rate from time to time on all unpaid fees from May 2016, from the time such fees should have been paid.  However, the Court wishes to consider making an order reflecting the conclusions in this judgment which works in practice.  To this end, it will want to receive the information about the accounts in order to make an order as to the revenue share with the benefit of this information.  The precise order to be made can again be considered as a part of the consequentials.</p>

It is not apparent whether that means in this action or in another action.  There was not an express plea as regards non-payment in relation to Crown II and Crown III.  An application to amend this action so as to include reference to Crown II and Crown III was withdrawn by consent.

It relies on para. 105(1) and 105(2) of RAMPOC seeking production of statements <span style="font-style:italic">“in relation to </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">all payments</span><span style="font-style:italic"> made to it … since May 2016 by 2B, Crown and any other entity introduced by the Claimant ….” and</span> see also paras. 105(3) and 105(4) and 113 (which claims the same relief against Astra LLP if there was no novation to Astra UK).  This is said to arise also out of the wide requirements of clause 13, which provides an obligation to keep books and records, and to allow inspection, in relation to <span style="font-style:italic">“its activities relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to recording any Eligible Investments”</span>.  It also relies on the last words of clause 3.1 referring to “<span style="font-style:italic">additional investments </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">made</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for the Current Strategy (</span>emphasis added)<span style="font-style:italic"> directly or indirectly by an Investor into a Fund whether before or after the Cut-off Date are also Eligible Investments.”  </span>It submits that there is an argument that the investments in Crown II and Crown III are additional investments, and that is therefore sufficient to open the door to disclosure relating to Crown II and Crown III.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Since this part of the judgment had been prepared in draft, the Court has been provided with the evidence in support of an application to strike out the 2021 action claiming management and performance fees in respect of Crown II and Crown III.  It comprised a 40-page witness statement of Lucas Julian Moore dated 29 September 2021.  This was forwarded to the Court on 13 October 2021 by solicitors for Musst with relatively short letters summarising its position.  It is not necessary or reasonably possible at this stage to consider that in any detail.  One feature of the witness statement is that Astra disagree with the submission of Musst that there was agreement that a claim in respect of Crown II and Crown III might be made in a second action.  The submission is that Musst could and should have brought any claim relating to Crown II and Crown III, if at all, in this action.  It is submitted by Astra that a fuller analysis of the documents between the parties shows that Musst was not misled as to the strategy adopted in respect of Crown II and Crown III, and there is nothing in the suggestion that there was a recent discovery that the position was not as previously represented.  It is also submitted on behalf of Astra that the claim in respect of Crown II and Crown III ought to be struck out on a whole variety of grounds, including abuse of process and no reasonable prospect of success.  Astra also say, in any event, that the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“other entity”</span> in RAMPOC is not sufficient to open the door to a disclosure in respect of Crown II and Crown III if the claims in respect of those entities are not being dealt with in this action.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This recent development has the effect that it is premature at this stage for the Court to make findings as to whether there ought to be disclosure in this action about Crown II and Crown III.  The different understandings of the parties regarding the consequences of the abandonment of the amendment application in respect of Crown II and Crown III require further consideration.  Musst may wish to consider which way to turn in respect of any claim in respect of Crown II and Crown III, and in that context, Astra will wish to submit that whichever way Musst turns, it will be to no avail.</p>

The like of this has not been identified in respect of other entities or customers, despite the reference to other entities in paras. 105 and 113 of RAMPOC.  Without further consideration of the matter with the parties, the Court will not make an order for disclosure which is broader than in respect of 2B and Crown.   No other entities have been identified.  It would beg the question as to whether such entities, if there were any, had been introduced by Musst, and whether the Octave Contract had been novated to Astra LLP and/or to Astra UK in respect of such entities.  I do not rule this out, but without further consideration with the parties, I confine the order made at this stage to 2B and Crown.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This judgment has already referred to Musst’s indemnity claim that in the event that there has not been a novation to Astra UK, but only one to Astra LLP, that the indemnity which Astra UK agreed to provide in the context of the relevant transfer, Musst should have the benefit of the same.  MUSST argued that receipt of fees by Astra UK was sufficient to give rise to a claim for those fees against Astra LLP.  This was on the basis that Astra UK was an affiliate, per the Octave Contract, of Astra LLP.  It is said that Astra LLP would have a right of indemnity against Astra UK under the deed of transfer of 29 April 2016.  This is widely drawn, but it provides in Clause 16.4 to no person other than the parties thereto having any right to enforce any term of the deed (including the indemnity) under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.  It is not necessary to consider how this would be enforced in practice.  Having found that there was a novation on to Astra UK, this point does not arise.   </span>
