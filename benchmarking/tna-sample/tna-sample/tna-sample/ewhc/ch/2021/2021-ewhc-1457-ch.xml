Given the shortcomings in some of the witness evidence, to which I refer below, I have been mindful of that guidance.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">On 10 March 2016, Mr Aird sent an email to Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark.  In that email, Mr Aird stated that he was not prepared to introduce further funds into TTL until it was “commercially and financially” viable.  He suggested that TTL be put up for sale in order to recover his investment, but that Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark should each be entitled to 5% of any proceeds.  As an alternative, Mr Aird put forward a proposal under which, if Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark could procure that TTS entered into the licence agreement with TTL: TTL would, on certain conditions, enter into service agreements with Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark; Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark would each receive 7.5% of the shares in TTL provided that Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark agreed to pay a proportionate share of any option fee which would be payable under the licence agreement to acquire an interest in the intellectual property; and Mr Aird would make interest free loans of £18,000 to each of Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark, which were intended to fund them for a further six months and which would be repayable after two years. </p>

As part of the correspondence, Mr Aird expressed his concern that TTL did not have access to property and intellectual property which he regarded as assets of the company.  Mr Kriisk’s and, to an extent, Mr Clark’s principal concerns remained securing their financial futures. </p>

He agreed with some of the matters disclosed in the email but raised issues with others.  The negotiations continued in particular in relation to the level of Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark’s potential stake in TTL if the relevant milestones set out in the Joint Venture Agreement were achieved, board composition, whether Ms Currie should be on the board, the terms of Mr Aird’s loan stock and the proposal for that loan stock to be repaid after a period of three years.  In the course of those discussions and correspondence Mr Aird sought to reassure Mr Burnell that the dilution provisions in the Joint Venture Agreement would allow Mr Aird (through Monogram) to limit the proportion the share capital of TTL that would ultimately be owned by Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark.  Mr Aird also put forward proposals to ensure that equality of voting on the board would be maintained.   </p>

In advance of that meeting, Mr Aird sent an email to Mr Burnell confirming that he was happy with the broad outline of the proposal in relation to Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark’s future participation.  He also reminded Mr Burnell that the arrangements for monthly payments to be made to Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark would also come to an end on 3 August 2016.  He suggested that those arrangements could continue for a short period, say two or three months, but that as a quid pro quo Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark should be prepared to forgo any bonus to which they might be entitled for the production of a saleable product in the light of the continuing delays in product development. </p>

In my view, that is a more accurate description of the position that was reached.  There was no agreement on the changes required to the arrangements with Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark at this stage.  The position was simply deferred for review at a later date.  </p>

TTL had an arrangement with Axiom to produce OneBox and an arrangement with Appian to provide printed circuit boards (PCBs).  There were numerous difficulties with both and Mr Kriisk was often having to lend his experience to resolve these difficulties.  The problems with the hardware led to it failing to obtain CE accreditation on three separate occasions.  The changes required to correct these problems would have required significant additional cost and Axiom, who were not being funded by TTL to undertake the development, ultimately refused to continue the development as costs mounted.  </p>

Once again, TTL was not paying TTS to fund the development so TTS would divert resources to other projects and this led to delays.  The additional pressure which Mr Aird and Mr Burnell sought to place on TTS to meet product development targets was, if anything, counter-productive.  </p>

However, the transfer took some time to accomplish.  In the autumn of 2016, Mr Burnell engaged the IT manager of Kona, a Mr Thomas, to assist with the transfer of data to a rented cloud-based server.  The transfer was finally completed in January 2017.  The transfer allowed for the creation of a central email account, allowing equal access to all emails, and for the central storage of data.  Mr Aird was aware of this transfer and did not object to it.  Again, the creation of central email and document storage systems were one of Mr Aird’s priorities in his earlier discussions with Mr Burnell.  Mr Aird was not, however, given access to the email account.  </p>

He produced a model pursuant to which, on the achievement of certain milestones, and the repayment of loans, Mr Aird’s participation over time would be reduced from 45% to 10%.

Following an exchange of emails with Mr Burnell on 8 November 2016, the equity model was changed to remove the increase in the equity stake attributable to Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark so that the fall in Mr Aird’s participation would accrue to Mr Burnell alone, leaving Mr Burnell with an 80% stake.  It was Mr Julian Gover’s evidence, which I accept, that although the equity model showed the fall in Mr Aird’s participation as accruing to Mr Burnell, this was intended to provide the fund out of which Mr Julian Gover and Mr Lucien Gover would obtain a participation in the company.   </p>

That is not true.  The first iterations of this model were prepared in advance of that meeting.  At the meeting on 9 November 2016, Mr Burnell introduced Mr Julian Gover and Mr Lucien Gover to Mr Aird for the first time.

Mr Aird says that, although he was not averse to giving up equity in the business to true “value creators”, he gave no such impression at the time.  It seems clear to me, however, that Mr Julian Gover and Mr Lucien Gover must have left the meeting with at least some hope or expectation of an equity participation in the company; there was no other reason for them to continue to work in the business, as they did, for no remuneration.  In due course, Mr Aird met with the Gover brothers, in January 2017, to discuss a more developed proposal for them to acquire a stake in the business and there is no reason why they would have continued to develop that proposal unless the prospect that an equity stake might be forthcoming had been held out to them.   </p>

Mr Murphy again refused to complete the order for OneBox units.  Mr Burnell made an offer to purchase the intellectual property in the OneBox hardware so that TTL might be able to manufacture the hardware itself or procure the manufacture of the unit by another supplier.  Mr Burnell made a formal offer in this respect by email following the meeting.  Axiom did not respond. </p>

Mr Burnell and Mr Lucien Gover attended the meeting on behalf of TTL following which Mr Burnell prepared an email for submission to the Home Office setting out TTL’s position.

At the time at which the software was tested by the Home Office, there were three levels of certification: “green” for use with low risk vehicles, “yellow” for intermediate risk vehicles, and “red” for high risk vehicles such as articulated lorries and emergency vehicles.  In the period after the initial Home Office testing, the certification criteria were changed by CAST and this threetier system was intended to be replaced by a different two-tier system.  Nonetheless TTL received a “green” level certificate for Restore under the outdated three-tier system. </p>

This has an impact on the valuation issues, which I address later in this judgment.  For now, I should record that, although the certification was limited to the “green” level, Mr Kriisk’s evidence was that TTL’s software was the only software ever to obtain this level of certification.  I accept his evidence.  That said, the certificate required was not the full level of certification that TTL had hoped for and which may have permitted a more rapid commercialization of the product notwithstanding the contractual difficulties with Axiom.  A higher level of certification would have allowed the products to be marketed to owners of higher risk vehicles (such as emergency vehicles and articulated lorries) and those users may have been more able and more prepared to bear a higher unit price for the product, which may well have justified the costs of further development to produce a working product.   </p>

All it took was one meeting and the possibilities seemed endless. I am embarrassed to admit that it made me irrational economically. TTL with its history and structure was always going to struggle. The lack of actual IP and strategy of not owning anything was in hindsight flawed. RK was the key man and your relationship with him was fraught. I mistakenly believed I could control that. </span>

You can perhaps understand that next week means you begin loading the Board with connected parties and can basically do whatever you want. You own 90% of the company and control the Board. Your first move to is remove all current Directors , and then my only avenue of return of my loan is a creditors route which although we can both agree will be successful, takes time and money.

Mr Aird says that the timing of the issue of the invoices is not a coincidence and that the issue of the TTS invoices was orchestrated by Mr Burnell.  I agree with him that the timing of the invoices was not a coincidence, but not for the reasons that Mr Aird gives.  There is no evidence of collusion between Mr Burnell and Mr Laul regarding the issue of the invoices.  I make no finding on this matter, but it is far more likely that the issue of the invoices by TTS was triggered by the resignation of Mr Kriisk, who remained in regular contact with Mr Laul.  Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark were also in communication regularly at this time, so there is good reason to believe that Mr Laul acquired his knowledge of the events at the meeting on 15 March 2017 from Mr Kriisk, having spoken to Mr Clark. </p>

Indeed the agreement refers separately to obligations which are placed on Mr Aird and others which are placed on Monogram.  The agreement bears all the hallmarks of an agreement between Mr Aird and Mr Burnell to which Monogram has been made a party so that its obligations can be enforced directly against it.  For that reason, in my view, Mr Aird should be regarded as having negotiated the February 2017 agreement in his personal capacity as well as acting for and on behalf of Monogram.   </p>

In support of his submission that Mr Aird must also be regarded as acting on behalf of TTL and so the agreement must be regarded as binding on TTL, Mr Leiper notes that the agreements in June 2016 and February 2017 contain obligations which relate directly to the operation of the business of TTL, for example, the appointment of Mr Burnell as CEO and Mr Aird as chairman.  He says that it would be surprising for such provisions to be included in a document to which TTL was not regarded as a party.  This point is at best equivocal; it would not be uncommon for such provisions to be included in a shareholders’ agreement without the need for the company to be a party.   </p>

He therefore says that Monogram, acting through Mr Aird, was authorized to agree terms with new investors, such as Mr Burnell, and that those terms would be binding on TTL. </p>

As I have described, although the agreement initially provided for the transfer of 45 shares in TTL by Monogram to Mr Burnell, this obligation was replaced by an obligation on TTL to issue 90 shares to Mr Burnell to reflect the agreement between Mr Burnell and Mr Aird that they would be equal partners in the venture.  However, there was no change to the timing.  Mr Aird agreed in his response to the email from Mr Burnell on 11 February 2017 that the new shares would be issued when Mr Burnell had advanced his further £150,000.

Mr Burnell did not agree to Mr Aird’s original draft of clause 18.  The replacement language to which Mr Leiper refers was more of a comment by Mr Burnell on the previous wording than a contractual commitment.  At most it represented a commitment at some point in the future to discuss the issues concerning the Joint Venture Agreement with Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk.  It was not intended to be a precondition to the issue of shares to Mr Burnell or to defer the obligation to make the issue of shares to Mr Burnell.  Although Mr Burnell subsequently acceded to Mr Aird’s suggestion that Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk should be offered an opportunity to match the funding provided by Mr Aird and Mr Burnell to avoid a dilution of their holdings, it did not affect the obligation under the terms of the agreement to issue shares to Mr Burnell.  As I have described, the agreement was, in all economic substance, an agreement for Mr Burnell to make an equity contribution to the company.  The issue of the shares to Mr Burnell was inextricably linked to his advance of the funds to TTL, it was not subject to other conditions.   </p>

Most of the cases of which I am aware relate to the payment of a contractual sum in circumstances where the performance of the contract becomes ineffective.  I was not referred by the parties to any case in which the contractual payment was in the form of a loan with its own agreed repayment terms.  That having been said, I can see no reason why the basic principles should not be applicable in this case.  When Mr Burnell made the advances to TTL, the principal benefit for which he bargained was the transfer or issue of the shares to him so that he would become an equal partner in the business.  The fact that the loan terms included provisions on which his advances may at some future point in time become repayable by TTL was not Mr Burnell’s main concern.  Mr Burnell’s main objective was to become an equal partner with Monogram in the business.  Without the issue of the shares, Mr Burnell did not receive the main benefit for which he bargained.  In the circumstances of this case, I agree with Mr Davies that Mr Burnell should be entitled to repayment of the Loan by way of restitution. </p>

Mr Clark confirmed in his oral evidence that, although he assumed that Mr Burnell would become a director, it was not mentioned when Mr Burnell was introduced as a potential investor.  This is perhaps not surprising, given that Mr Burnell’s role as CEO was initially seen as, in effect, an interim appointment in order to allow him to conduct some due diligence on the company over the first three months of his involvement with the company. </p>

The intention of the parties appears to have been that Mr Burnell would become a director when he had advanced all of his funds.  For example, following the renegotiation of the terms of his investment in February 2017 and the advance of the second tranche of the Loan, Mr Burnell immediately asked Mr Aird to progress the issue of his shares and his appointment as a director.    This understanding appears to be shared by Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk: Mr Kriisk questioned Mr Burnell about his status at the beginning of the 7 March meeting including whether and how he had been appointed i.e. after Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk became aware that Mr Burnell had advanced all of his funds.   </p>

Mr Burnell was aware of the filing, requested it and, as I have mentioned, it is not credible that he was not aware of the date on the form.  But, this meeting was part of the discussion between Mr Burnell and Mr Aird.  The filing of the form did not reflect a common understanding of the directors.  Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk had not participated in the negotiations which led to the February 2017 agreement between Mr Aird and Mr Burnell, they were not present at the meeting with Mr Pfister, nor were they aware that the form had been filed. </p>

In particular, he notes that in his email to Mr Burnell of 2 March 2017, Mr Clark refers to the filing as “confirming” Mr Burnell’s appointment as a director. Mr Leiper says this shows that Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk were already aware that Mr Burnell was a director of TTL.  I disagree.  In my view, the evidence shows that until this date Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk were not aware of any appointment.  As I have mentioned, whether or not Mr Burnell was a director did not form part of the discussion which took place with Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk in advance of Mr Burnell’s appointment as CEO in July 2016.  After that time, for the most part, whether or not Mr Burnell was also a director had not been relevant; no board meetings had been called since that date.  The minutes of the meeting on 7 March 2017 record that Mr Kriisk questioned Mr Burnell on whether, how, and when he had been appointed, which suggests that, until that time, Mr Kriisk – and, in my </p>

I will return to the extent to which they did so later in this judgment.  For now, I note that this was the case even though it must have been apparent to Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk that the basis on which Mr Burnell had been appointed was unclear.  At the meeting on 7 March 2017, Mr Burnell was asked by Mr Kriisk whether he had been appointed by Mr Aird in the exercise of his power under the Joint Venture Agreement.  Mr Burnell was unable to confirm the position.  The minutes record that it was then accepted by Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk that Mr Burnell must have been appointed by Mr Aird under the Joint Venture Agreement provisions as no board meetings had been held.  The matter was left on the basis that Mr Aird would “advise on this”.  At this stage, therefore, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk assumed that Mr Burnell had been appointed under the Joint Venture Agreement.  They also assumed, incorrectly, that their approval was not required for the appointment.  Yet even when Mr </p>

So the question is whether the continued treatment of Mr Burnell as a director by the other directors on or after 7 March 2017 (or possibly on or after 2 March 2017) was an “indication” that they shared a common view, and can be regarded as a “decision” under Article 8(1).   </p>

It refers to circumstances in which the directors “indicate to each other <span style="text-decoration:underline">by any means</span>” (my emphasis) that they share a common view.  However, the provision must be read in its context.  The following provision, Article 8(2) provides an example of the circumstances in which the directors will be regarded as having made a decision which meets the requirements of Article 8(1); namely, a resolution in writing signed by each director or to which each director has indicated his or her agreement in writing.  Article 8(2) is only an example of the circumstances in which the requirements of Article 8(1) might be fulfilled.  It is not exclusive.  However, it does to my mind demonstrate the scope of Article 8(1).  In my view, without wishing to restrict the means by which this might be done, Article 8(1) does require a </p>

There is no such communication in this case between Mr Aird, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk.  Any communication that there is demonstrates that they do not share a common view: Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk assumed that Mr Burnell had been appointed as a director under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement and Mr Aird quickly rejected that proposition.  The subsequent acquiescence of each of the directors in Mr Burnell’s attendance at meetings does not in my view amount to an indication to the other directors that they share a common view for the purposes of Article 8(1). </p>

However, for the sake of completeness, I should also record that I agree with Mr Davies that Mr Burnell was not appointed as a director under the provisions of the Joint Venture Agreement.  As I have mentioned, at the meeting on 7 March 2017, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk assumed that Mr Burnell had been appointed by Mr Aird under clause 5.1.1. of that agreement.  However, Mr Aird denied this, and subsequently appointed Ms Currie and Mr Christian Aird as the two directors he was entitled to appoint under clause 5.1.1.  In any event, as Mr Davies points out, Mr Burnell was not a non-executive director, as required by clause 5.1.1, nor was he appointed with the support of a resolution of the members or a decision of the directors as required by clause 5.1.1. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.54in">When Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk became aware of the purported appointment of Mr Burnell following the filing of the AP01 on 28 February 2017, as demonstrated by the minutes of the meeting on 7 March 2017, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk proceeded on the incorrect assumption that Mr Burnell had been appointed by Mr Aird under the terms of clause 5.1.1 of the Joint Venture Agreement.  Mr Clark confirmed in cross-examination that he had assumed incorrectly that Mr Aird could unilaterally appoint Mr Burnell under that provision.  He failed to recall that the provision was limited to the appointment of non-executive directors or that a further resolution of the directors or the shareholders would be required.  I infer that Mr Kriisk was proceeding on the same false premise at the time. </p>

They simply acquiesced in the purported appointment in that they did not challenge Mr Burnell’s right to attend meetings.  There is no evidence of the reasons why Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk adopted this course of action.  They simply went along with it.  Given Mr Aird’s autocratic style of management and his control of the company more generally, that is perhaps understandable.  However, they were not at any stage requested to give their consent to the appointment and remained unaware that their assent may have been necessary. </p>

Any strategic matters regarding the business were decided by Mr Aird: he approved the accounts without reference to Mr Clark, Mr Kriisk, or for that matter Mr Burnell; he took the decisions to terminate Mr Clark’s consulting arrangements and to activate Mr Kriisk’s service agreement.  Although Mr Burnell referred to himself as a “director” in the period after 28 February 2017, his own viewpoint is not relevant.  It is an objective test.  Mr Burnell did not undertake any “directorial” acts.  He attended a meeting on 7 March which the Defendants say was not a valid board meeting.  His attendance at and participation in a meeting cannot of itself amount to a directorial activity.  Mr Davies challenges the Defendants’ reliance on Mr Burnell’s resignation as director on 8 June 2017.  He says that resignation is irrelevant to the concept of a de facto directorship.  It all depends on the facts.  Resignation itself is not a directorial act.   </p>

He asked Mr Aird to arrange his appointment as a director.  He was treated by all the other directors – Mr Aird, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk – as if he was a director, even though he had not been validly appointed.  He represented to third parties, including Mr Pfister, that he was a director.  He instructed the company’s solicitors to provide advice in his assumed capacity as a director.</p>

In all of these cases, Mr Burnell participated on the basis that he was a director and was treated by those who attended on an equal footing with each of the other directors.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Davies refers to the fact that Mr Burnell links his shareholding in the company to his position as a director and that Mr Burnell was not, at any point, issued any shares in the company.  I agree.  After the completion of his loan, Mr Burnell viewed his appointment as a director and the issue of shares to him as inextricably linked; they were both important aspects of his “equal partnership” with Mr Aird.  In his negotiations with Mr Aird, Mr Burnell sought to increase the importance of his proposed shareholding and reduce the importance of the board, for example, by restricting the matters that might be referred to the board of directors and increasing the number of decisions that might be taken by him and Mr Aird as shareholders.  However, he also saw his directorship as an important part of the “partnership” with Mr Aird.  This can be seen from his emails following the advance of his funds on 24 February 2017 – in which Mr Burnell asks Mr Aird to arrange for the issue of his shares <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> his appointment as a director – and his concerns that Mr Aird should not control the board by introducing his nominees as directors.  In the final analysis, however, although he was not issued any shares in the company, Mr Burnell acted as a director, was treated by others as a director and sought to exercise his powers as a purported director. </p>

Mr Burnell’s purported resignation on that date is part of circumstances which have to be taken into account in deciding when, as a matter of fact, Mr Burnell ceased to assume the position of a director and ceased to be treated as a director.  However, in the present case, it is clear that Mr Burnell had ceased to assume the position of a director of TTL some time before it was drawn to his attention that he was still registered as a director of TTL.   </p>

I have also considered Mr Aird’s view, in crossexamination, that Mr Burnell’s position became untenable after the statutory demand was served.   However, the fact remains that, after the meeting on 15 March and the service of the statutory demand on 16 March, Mr Burnell continued to be involved, in particular, in the preparation for the meeting on 29 March 2017.  That meeting was again called as a board meeting (notwithstanding the challenges to its validity).

There is no particular evidence pointing to any other date on which Mr Burnell ceased to assume the position of a director, but he took no action in his capacity as a director after that time and, as I have described, he was clearly being treated as a former director by the other directors (and the company’s solicitors) by the time the process of the recovery of the company’s property and information was being conducted in April 2017.  </p>

In particular, he says it is clear that a fiduciary duty does continue after the termination of the directorship; and although the type of property, information or opportunity which cannot be exploited remains consistent with the pre-CA 2006 case law, it is no longer a necessary requirement of a breach of duty, as some authorities suggest, that a director’s resignation must have been prompted or influenced by his or her wish to acquire a business opportunity for him or herself.   </p>

However, by virtue of s170(4), it is necessary for the court to have regard to the corresponding common law rules and equitable principles in interpreting and applying the general duties.

Premier Waste Management Limited</span> [2011] EWCA Civ. 923 at [4]).  In addition, CA 2006 does not seek to codify the common law rules and equitable principles governing the consequences of a breach of the general duties.  Section 178 simply provides that the consequences of a breach are the same as would apply if the corresponding common law rule or equitable principle applied and that the general duties (with the exception of the duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence) are, accordingly, enforceable in the same way as any other fiduciary duty owed to a company by its directors.

My starting point for determining the scope of this provision in accordance with s170(4) is therefore the pre-existing case law governing the circumstances in which a former director might be regarded as being in breach of duty by reference to acts which took place after he or she ceased to be a director. </p>

However, the question remains whether the codification has had any material effect on the scope of the duty that it is intended to “replace”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The extension of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest in s175 by section 170(2)(a) is limited to cases involving the exploitation of “any property, information, or opportunity” of which a director became aware whilst he or she was a director.  The phrase “any property, information, or opportunity” appears in s175(2).  The interpretation of that phrase in the context of a breach of the duty in s175 during the existence of the fiduciary relationship would naturally have a broader meaning than would be accommodated by the pre-existing case law governing liability for breach of duty arising from post-resignation acts.  However, it was common ground between the parties that the phrase “any property, information or opportunity” in s170(2)(a) (and accordingly when applying s175 in accordance with s170(2)(a)) should be given a narrower meaning consistent with the existing case law and, in particular, the case law concerning the need for a “maturing business opportunity” (such as <span style="font-style:italic">Canaero</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">CMS</span>).  To my mind, that is the correct approach; it is consistent with the interpretation of the scope of the duty in s175 as extended by s170(2)(a) in accordance with the principles of s170(4) and permitted by the application of s175 in those circumstances with “necessary adaptations” in accordance with s170(2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">There was however a difference between the parties on the question of whether the effect of s170(2)(a) is that the duty continues after the termination of the directorship and accordingly whether a breach of duty could be founded solely on post-resignation acts and so, for example, without a requirement to show that the resignation of the director was prompted or influenced by the director’s desire to exploit a business opportunity for his or her own benefit.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">On this point, as I have mentioned above, the better explanation of the preexisting case law is, in my view, that conduct of a director after he or she has left office cannot of itself amount to a breach of duty.  This is on the basis that a fiduciary duty must terminate with the fiduciary relationship from which it is derived.  A claim of a breach of duty must therefore be based on actions of the director before or at the time of resignation.  This is the approach adopted by Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Foster Bryant</span>, where, in analysing the decision of Lawrence Collins J in <span style="font-style:italic">CMS</span>, he took the view that the rationale of Lawrence Collins J’s judgment was not that the fiduciary duty survived the end of the relationship as a director, but rather that the lack of good faith with which the further exploitation of the relevant property was planned whilst the defendant was a director constituted the breach of duty which ultimately (and with the relevant causal link) was diverted to the defendant’s future enterprise (<span style="font-style:italic">Foster Bryant</span> [69]).  A similar approach was taken by Cockerill J in <span style="font-style:italic">Recovery Partners </span>at [75] to [77].   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with that analysis in the context of the provisions of CA 2006 is that s170(2)(a) expressly provides that the duty in s175 to avoid conflicts of interest “continues” after the relevant person ceases to be a director.  The implication is that conduct of a director after his or her resignation can give rise to a breach of that duty.  Notwithstanding the instruction in s170(4) and the ability to apply s175 with “necessary adaptations”, in my view, it is not permissible as a matter of construction to ignore the plain words of the statute.  Accordingly, I agree with Mr Leiper that the extended duty imposed by s170(2)(a) is a continuing duty and that it must therefore be possible for a breach of that continuing duty to be founded on acts which take place after a director has resigned his or her directorship.  It follows that, following the introduction of the general duties by CA 2006, it cannot be an absolute requirement for a breach of the extended duty that a director’s resignation must have been prompted or influenced by his or her wish to acquire a business opportunity of the company. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Such a conclusion is of course contrary to the reasoning in some of the cases which discuss the common law rules and equitable principles on which the general duty in s175 is based, in particular, that of Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Foster Bryant</span> and Cockerill J in <span style="font-style:italic">Recovery Partners</span> to which I have just referred.  However, the courts did not have to address in <span style="font-style:italic">Foster Bryant</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Recovery Partners</span> the question of the interaction of the existing case law principles with the statutory code.  My conclusion also, in theory, risks creating circumstances in which duties are extended beyond the scope of the duties imposed by common law rules and equitable principles on which the general duty is based and imposing liabilities for breach in cases where liability might not arise based on those principles.  However, it is, in my view, an inevitable result of the codification. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It might be said that this interpretation also threatens the delicate balance which the courts (in the cases to which I have referred, and others) have sought to maintain between the protection of the fiduciary relationship (by preventing a director from resigning his or her position in order to make a profit at the expense of the company) and avoiding a regime which acts as a restraint on trade (by barring a former director from competing with a company of which he or she was formerly a director).  However, I would not expect that to be the case for two reasons: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.54in">First, the circumstances in which the extended duty can apply are limited to cases involving the exploitation of “any property, information or opportunity” of which the director became aware at a time when he or she was a director.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.54in">Second, it remains necessary – and consistent with the requirements of s170(4) – to give effect to the extended duty in accordance with the case law applicable to the common law rules and equitable principles underlying the relevant general duty to the extent possible (and so far as consistent with the words of the statute).  So, for example, in deciding whether a breach of duty has occurred and the consequences of that breach, the court may take into account the nature of any pre-resignation and post-resignation conduct as part of the merits-based assessment approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Foster Bryant</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The first relates to the position of the Gover brothers.  TTL asserts that during this period and for that matter in the period prior to 28 February 2017, Mr Burnell was acting in conjunction with the Gover brothers to take control of the company’s assets for his own benefit.  Notwithstanding the statement made by Mr Julian Gover in his witness statement that the Gover brothers ceased all material involvement with effect from 8 February 2017, the evidence shows that the Gover brothers were, to an extent, involved in matters relating to the company after that date, principally in assisting Mr Burnell, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk in relation to some corporate matters.  That having been said, the more general assertion on behalf of TTL that the Gover brothers were not acting independently or that their actions can be ascribed to Mr Burnell is not made out. </p>

TTL’s broad claim appears to be that, throughout this period, Mr Burnell was working, with the assistance of the Gover brothers, to engineer the collapse of TTL so as to permit him to acquire the intellectual property in the products either himself or through an acquisition of shares in TTS.  This assertion does not bear much scrutiny.  In particular, there is no evidence of any plan on the part of Mr Burnell to acquire TTS at this stage.  The opportunity for Mr Burnell to acquire the shares in TTS had not arisen.  Mr Burnell had limited, if any, contact with Mr </p>

Mr Aird approved the transfer of the business to the Farm and the involvement of the Gover brothers.  The failure to require other parties to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements can hardly be described as a significant breach of duty and, in any event, is a matter to which Mr Aird could have attended on his own. </p>

The suggestion is that there is no other good reason for the resignation of Mr Kriisk as he had just been given the financial security that he had been asking for in the form of his service agreement.  The inference that I am invited to draw is that Mr Burnell orchestrated the resignation as a step in his plan.   </p>

He was frustrated by the treatment of himself and Mr Clark by Mr Aird (and Mr Burnell).  He was angry at the failure of Mr Aird to honour the obligations to Mr Clark, whom he regarded as his co-founder of the project, to activate his service agreement and he considered the demands placed on TTS to be unreasonable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In my view, the more likely reason for the breakdown in the relationship between Mr Aird, Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk, and in particular the relationship between Mr Aird and Mr Kriisk, was Mr Aird’s hard-line and autocratic approach to the management of Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk.  The resignation of Mr Kriisk was not orchestrated by Mr Burnell.  I can find no breach of any of the general duties by Mr Burnell arising from the breakdown of the relationship and Mr Kriisk’s resignation.  It was principally Mr Aird’s own doing.  The related assertion that this breakdown caused Mr Kriisk to assist TTS was not, at this stage, the work of Mr Burnell.  Once Mr Kriisk had resigned, there was always going to be a significant risk that Mr Kriisk would revive his contacts with TTS in Estonia. </p>

However, the opportunity for Mr Burnell to acquire the TTS shares arose at a later stage, after he had ceased to be a de facto director of TTL and there is no evidence of any contact direct or indirect (for example, through Mr Kriisk) with Mr Laul and Mr Ploompuu at this stage.  Once he had come to the view that it was unlikely that Mr Aird was going to permit TTL to issue shares to him, Mr Burnell’s primary motivation was to secure the return of his investment.  In this respect, I take into account the Gover brothers’ arrangements with Mr Clark, Mr Kriisk and Mr Ploompuu, but as I have said I cannot attribute those actions to Mr Burnell.  </p>

Mr Burnell’s investigation of the potential weaknesses in the licensing arrangements – including seeking advice from the company’s solicitors – is the action of a director seeking to understand the potential threats to the company’s business.  This was particularly the case given TTL’s reliance on development work being undertaken by TTS for which TTL was under no obligation to make any financial contribution until a marketable product had been produced.  Mr Burnell was also concerned about the potential impact of Mr Aird’s hard-line approach to the negotiation of the service agreements with Mr Clark and Mr Kriisk given the risks that would be posed to the business if Mr Kriisk were to leave.  These were legitimate concerns.  Mr Burnell took a different approach to these matters, but a difference in approach is not a breach of duty. </p>

In his evidence, Mr Clark referred to his being aware that there was some “filtration” of the data.  Mr Clark was not able to point to any specific way in which the data was manipulated and there is no independent evidence that Mr Burnell orchestrated the process in order to deny TTL or Mr Aird access to information or to  retain information for his own use.

However, I have not seen any evidence to this effect and as I have mentioned above, it is accepted that business contacts and personal connections ordinarily form part of the general fund of knowledge and skill which a former director is entitled to exploit for his or her own account.  The relative importance of individuals working for TTL (i.e. the importance of Mr Kriisk to the business) could not, to my mind, constitute information which should be regarded as akin to property for these purposes.

He did not exploit the intellectual property rights of TTL in the products for this purpose.

It is a reasonable inference that those steps, in particular the termination of the Licence Agreement, must have involved the use of information regarding the terms of the Licence Agreement and the concerns surrounding its enforceability of which Mr Burnell became aware when he was a director of TTL.  Furthermore, the purpose of those steps was to terminate the Licence Agreement and to secure for TTS the unfettered rights to exploit the intellectual property in the licensed products (and so deprive TTL of its rights under the Licence Agreement).  By acquiring shares in TTS and then taking action to terminate the Licence Agreement whether pursuant to the Chancery Division Proceedings or otherwise, Mr Burnell put himself in a position in which his personal interests conflicted with the interests of TTL as regards the exploitation of property of TTL – its rights under the Licence Agreement – of which he was aware when he was a director.

The reliance of the valuation on Mr Gover’s models as the basis for the valuation is in my view misplaced; the models were hypothetical and aspirational and created for a particular purpose.  They were not a sound basis for valuing the company.  The base levels are set by estimates from Mr Kriisk and Mr Clark as to the realistic and optimistic expectations of sales at the time.  However, they assumed that the company would develop marketable products.  The company had no marketable products at the time, no source of funding other than Mr Aird and Mr Burnell, and no orders for the products.  The assumptions for many of the inputs are simply multiples of others and designed to be illustrative rather than based on any meaningful reality.  </p>

For the reasons that I have given, even if damages were to be assessed by reference to the value of the business as a whole, it does seem to me that an enterprise value is the more appropriate starting point for the measure of the loss to the company itself.   </p>

It also seems to me to be consistent with facts on the ground.  Mr Burnell in his evidence confirmed that he regarded the acquisition of the shares in TTS as the purchase of “several possible options”.  The option was, on the assumption that TTS would be successful in the litigation, in effect, to acquire the rights under the Licence Agreement for a price being the relatively nominal price for the TTS shares and the costs of defending the Chancery Division proceedings.   </p>
