	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The corporate structure of the group of which the Defendant is a part (“the UD group”) is complex and made more so because some company names have changed since 2010. During the course of the trial, except when it was necessary to do so, the parties did not make bright line distinctions between the different companies (or divisions within those companies). In fact, different speakers referred to the same entities by different names and, at times, I had to check which company or division was being talked about. All this is hardly surprising. As I shall explain, in the management of the group’s companies (so far as that is relevant in the present case) and in events leading to the share sale and purchase agreement (“the SPA”), there were few distinct corporate boundaries.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It is necessary, however, to briefly sketch the formal corporate structures of the UD group and of WEG prior to the sale, referring to company names as they were in 2010. It is also helpful to identify, at the same time, some of the key individuals within those companies in 2010; noting, however, that some individuals had a formal role in more than one company in the UD group and that some of them appear to have had informal roles in other companies within the group.  </p>

Equally importantly, it enables the judge to keep the trial within manageable bounds, so that public resources as well as the parties’ own resources are not wasted, and so that the judge knows the issues on which the proceedings, and the judgment, must concentrate…That is not to say that technical points may be used to prevent the just disposal of a case or that a trial judge may not permit a departure from a pleaded case where it is just to do so (although in such a case it is good practice to amend the pleading, even at trial), but the statements of case play a critical role in civil litigation which should not be diminished.” </p>

The 2012 bar is annotated £5.6 million and the 2013 bar is annotated £6.1 million. Each bar is split into three different coloured parts. There is no dispute that the middle parts (“the blue bars”) are intended to show UniversalProcon’s EBIT contribution to the total for the years in question. The blue bar for 2011 is annotated £2.7 million (a sum which is close to UniversalProcon’s budgeted EBIT for FY2011 of £2.77 million). The blue bar for 2012 is annotated £2.9 million and the blue bar for 2013 is annotated £3.1 million. The top part of the bars are coloured green (“the green bars”) and the bottom part of the bars are coloured yellow (“the yellow bars”). The parties agree that they are intended to represent WEG’s EBIT contribution to the total for the years in question and savings for those years. The parties disagree which of the green bars and yellows bars relate to these two elements. The Claimants contend that the green bars relate to savings and the yellow bars relate to WEG’s EBIT contribution. The Defendant contends the opposite; that the green bars relate to WEG’s EBIT contribution and the yellow bars relate to savings. The green bars are annotated £1.3 million for 2011, £1.5 million for 2012 and £1.5 million for 2013. The yellow bars are annotated £900,000 for 2011, £1.2 million for 2012 and £1.5 million for 2013.  </p>

It is not disputed that an earlier proposal for an upside was put to the WEG shareholders present at the Meeting. That earlier proposal provided for an upside of up to £500,000. To be paid that upside, at £0.50 in the £1, the combined WEG-UniversalProcon business would need to achieve £1 million EBIT is excess of the £14.1 million target EBIT. The second bar was intended to represent that possibility.  </p>

They contend that, had they not entered into the SPA, the Defendant would have completed the transaction for £16.2 million as contemplated in the August Heads of Terms and, in consequence, they claim about £1.94 million. They contend, alternatively, that they would have retained and increased their shareholdings, they would have continued to receive dividends, they would have continued to receive their remuneration as directors of WEG and would then have sold their shares to a third party. They claim for all that loss, less the consideration they actually received and their earnings for about two years.

Because I did not want Mr Pipe to commit to an answer before I was sure that he had taken instructions from the Claimants and because I did not want the Claimants to feel under undue pressure to confirm their instructions to Mr Pipe, I invited him to take the lunch adjournment to confirm what his instructions were. Following the adjournment, he did confirm to me, on instructions, that the Claimants were proceeding with their claim only on the alleged misrepresentations summarised in paragraph 8 of his closing submissions. Out of an abundance of caution, I spelt out the consequences, as it seemed to me at the time, of that decision; that is, that I do not have to determine the balance of the Claimants’ pleaded allegations and that, if they do not succeed on their claim as summarised in paragraph 8 of Mr Pipe’s closing submissions, their claim will fail.

In 2007, it had acted for Universal Conference and Incentive Ltd. when that company was acquired by the UD group. In 2008, Precision was engaged by WEG to find a buyer for the company and it introduced WEG’s directors to the UD group. The transaction did not proceed then but, in early 2010, the possibility of an acquisition of WEG by the UD group was resurrected; although which side resurrected the transaction is not clear. It was always expected that, if WEG was acquired by the UD group, it would form part of the CSMS Division, so that Mr Corbin and Mr McIntosh were individuals whose support for the transaction was important.  </p>

It has not been disputed that, by 2010, pharmaceutical companies were seeking to engage events management companies which had a global presence and, for that reason, events management companies were beginning to face competition from travel management companies, such as American Express Co., which already had a global presence.  UniversalProcon had a presence in the US and in the UK but not elsewhere. WEG had opened a number of offices globally; particularly in Europe and South-East Asia. WEG was one of the few events management companies which had done so.  </p>

The paper identified two alternatives to the acquisition of WEG. The first alternative was for UniversalProcon to remain as it was, based in the US and the UK, which the paper identified as a serious threat to the business. The second alternative was for UniversalProcon to grow organically (rather than by acquisitions). This alternative was rejected because of the cost and time it would take for UniversalProcon to be in a position to compete with those competitors which already had a global footprint. The paper suggested that WEG’s adjusted EBIT forecast for 2010 (once losses incurred in relation to the overseas (i.e. not UK or US) offices were added back) was £1.382 million. The paper noted that WEG’s fee income was forecast to decline in 2010; amongst other reasons, because, according to the WEG management team, “lead times on new events (from time the contract is awarded) have shortened so WEG has less visibility to events expected in the months to come”. The paper set out the same synergy savings as had been set out in Mr McIntosh’s draft paper. The paper noted that UniversalProcon was forecast not to meet its budgeted EBIT for FY2010 (as, I understand, in fact it did not) because of the performance of UPUK but the paper also noted: </p>

He emailed Mr Logue on 15 July saying that “the strategic rationale, Lilly, globalization etc. makes this deal irresistible…” He suggested that “without the deal [UniversalProcon] will give up approx. $1m profit from the Lilly deal, that we are in partnership with WEG over at the moment and couldn’t possibly win without them…” He added that “…without WEG we are unable to present ourselves as a global supplier, which could cost us some existing business and preclude us from winning some new business…” He acknowledged that the consideration was a “premium price which is now even higher than expected” but he continued to be enthusiastic about the transaction and saw it as vital. </p>

He said that Mr Saxby understood that the UD group’s proposal was “a good deal but [he] feels we are taking the “pain” on our own”. He said that Mr Saxby had suggested that, if they could not persuade Mr Keene to “bear his share”, they should try to re-negotiate the deferred consideration element of the proposal so that the WEG shareholders, Mr Keene excepted, received an extra £50,000 a year. Mr Dickinson continued that Mr Saxby agreed “that it could be difficult to put in a performance piece to catch up the 300k and negotiate decent go-forwards contracts”.   </p>

The note begins by setting out the consideration for the acquisition of WEG (£16.2 million). It then says: “14.1 EBIT over 3 yrs”, which is clearly a reference to the earn out target. Then there is a reference to “11.4m”, which a reference to the EBIT which had to be achieved for any contingent consideration to be payable. Adjacent to the columns of writing which include the “11.4m” note, Mr Wilson wrote: “0.5m upside. £1m over 14.1m split 50/50”. This is a reference to an upside under which the WEG shareholders might share in £500,000 additional consideration. Below this section of the Wilson note, Mr Wilson wrote “£1.5m =&gt; £750k 50p/£1”, which is clearly a reference to the upside which was set out in the SPA in due course. Immediately below this note is a table labelled “UP Budget” comprising three columns “UP”, “WE” and “Savings”, with the figures for the “WE” column higher than those in the “Savings” column. At the bottom of the note, Mr Wilson wrote: “pound for pound from 11.4 =&gt; 14.1. Then 50p/£1 to £15.6m i.e. £750k upside”. This too is clearly a reference to the upside which was set out in the SPA in due course.   </p>

The ongoing directors had reservations about the fact that the 7% discount was still being incurred.

The parties’ cases depend, a little more, in the Claimants’ case, or a little less, in the Defendant’s case, on the testimony of their witnesses. The Meeting took place ten years ago. The claim was begun four years ago and the parties have been in dispute for longer still. They have had many years, and many opportunities, to reflect on and rationalise the contemporaneous documents and to discuss, and tell and re-tell, their stories, and they have done so. They have had the assistance of specialist lawyers who have supported them in the preparation of comprehensive witness statements and their thorough preparation for the trial; a trial at which the Claimants made a number of fraud allegations. How then should I approach the testimony of the parties’ witnesses? This is a question which trial judges often have to ask themselves.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">While everyone knows that memory is fallible, I do not believe that the legal system has sufficiently absorbed the lessons of a century of psychological research into the nature of memory and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people’s memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time. In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called “flashbulb” memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event…External information can intrude into a witness’s memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.05in;text-indent:0.00in">Memory is especially unreliable when it comes to recalling past beliefs. Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs. Studies have also shown that memory is particularly vulnerable to interference and alteration when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where his or her memory of it is already weak due to the passage of time. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party’s lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial. A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness’s memory has been “refreshed” by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness’s memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events. </p>

This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose – though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="39">

Those tend to be the documents where a witness’s guard is down and their true thoughts are plain to see. Indeed, it has become a commonplace of judgments in commercial cases where there is often extensive disclosure to emphasise the importance of the contemporary documents.

The allegations, even if true, have very little, if any, relevance to this claim. Mr Mistry was not called to give evidence, even though a witness summary in relation to his evidence had been filed and served. The allegations were not put to Mr McIntosh, and Mr Corbin was not asked to comment on them. I therefore attach no weight to Ms Fantoni’s witness statement.  </p>

My wife and I were living in Princeton downtown at the time, and we met with Mark because he was coming over to Princeton to help me present to an industry meeting about what was going on in the pharmaceutical meeting industry at the time.  And it was very convivial, we actually went out for dinner, the three of us, and I was asking Mark: well, how had it gone, how did the meeting go down, what happened?  Mark just basically gave me the top line in terms of what had happened, and that whilst he was still not a hundred per cent happy with the terms and was still a little bit -- I think we were all a little bit aggrieved that Mr Keene was walking away with all this money and we had to wait for ours, he convinced me, and again the words at this stage I can’t remember but he convinced me that he had been assured by UDG that these numbers --- they had done it before and these numbers, we could achieve these numbers over the next three years, and that it was fine, and that he had turned – and he was going to sign the deal…I also would add that it wasn’t just Mark; he was kind of speaking on behalf of the other three, so Mr Winterburn, Mr Wilson and Mr Parry. </p>

The UD group was not prepared to release him from those obligations, even to a limited extent to allow him to give evidence voluntarily. At a pre-trial review, following a suggestion which I made, the parties agreed a way in which Mr Gordon could give evidence at the trial. The Claimants obtained a subpoena from the US District Court in the District of Massachusetts, unopposed, to compel Mr Gordon to being deposed by the Claimants before trial. The deposition was ordered to be, and was, in accordance with the procedures which apply in this jurisdiction. So, for example, Mr Gordon affirmed in accordance with those procedures. That deposition took place, in the presence of Mr Woods on behalf of the Defendant, and it was transcribed. The transcription was provided to the Defendant before the trial and I directed that it would stand as Mr Gordon’s evidence in chief. The subpoena also compelled Mr Gordon to attend the trial to be cross-examined, as he was, by video link.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="44">

In cross-examination, he said that, at the start of the 5 November meeting, Mr Corbin said that GT had raised concerns, that he (Mr Corbin) did not agree with all of them but that Mr FitzGerald had instructed that GT’s concerns were so significant that the transaction could not proceed on the basis of the August Heads of Terms. Mr Logue accepted that GT’s conclusions were not laid out at the 5 November meeting, because Mr Corbin thought there was no point in doing so, and he agreed that the attendees on WEG’s behalf were not shown any of the due diligence reports. He said that Mr Corbin outlined the options which were then agreeable to the UD group; which were (1) to delay completion of the transaction until 2011 so that the WEG shareholders could establish that WEG’s underlying profit was higher than GT thought, (2) to revise (downwards presumably) the consideration payable for the acquisition (which would have impacted Mr Keene to the same degree as the other WEG shareholders) or (3) to revise the structure of the deal (i.e. so that part of the consideration would be contingent on meeting an earn out target). Mr Logue said that Mr Parry said that Mr Keene would never agree to the sale of his shares in return for contingent consideration, so that the risk of any earn out target being met would fall on the Claimants and Mr Parry. Mr Logue said that he responded that that seemed an unreasonable position for Mr Keene to take, but that that was not a matter for the UD group. He said that, at the end of the 5 November meeting, it was agreed to proceed in principle with the third option and that he (Mr Logue) would work out a contingent consideration proposal and present it to Precision. </p>

He explained that, because of the reduced net revenue forecast, to bring the forecast EBIT into line with the budgeted EBIT, a decision was taken not to employ extra staff whose employment had been budgeted. This, he said, was a “major” part of the task to ensure that UPUS was on budget for EBIT.

Mr McIntosh suggested in his second witness statement that the Pfizer account referred to in the Bates note was the HCAM account. I am clear that that is incorrect and that the reference is to EMOP. In crossexamination, Mr McIntosh maintained that he did refer to the loss of HCAM work. Mr McIntosh was taken, in cross-examination, to his June draft paper for the Plc’s board which referred to EMOP work being lost. He thought that he had meant to refer to HCAM. He was wrong about that. Not even informal notice of the loss of HCAM work had been given by then. Mr McIntosh also seemed to think that EMOP and EM were the same. They were not. I bear in mind that Mr McIntosh’s recollection on these points of detail is faulty.

However, he may actually have been referring to the £4.9 million, £5.6 million and £6.1 million sums shown on the Joint Budget 2 slide which each comprised a WEG EBIT contribution, a UniversalProcon EBIT contribution and savings. The earn out target was a proportion of those sums. I remain unclear about to precisely what Mr McIntosh was referring because counsel did not always clearly distinguish between the earn out target itself and the larger “joint budget” which comprised the WEG and UniversalProcon EBIT contributions and a savings element and because Mr McIntosh did not give his oral evidence clearly.   </p>

He talks about me being supportive, explaining the problems we were having with the earn out and he states very clearly in it that the auditors would not allow weak targets. And that email that Mr Keene sent is copied to Mr Parry. Mr Parry was in the meeting. I just found it interesting that Mr Parry isn’t part of the complainants. So, he knew weak targets, which then you could transfer I suppose into this phrase that everybody likes to use of “easy and soft”, were not going to be applicable.

And I had previously asked some time ago, if we remember, on 30 September, I think you showed me an email yesterday, where I asked for easy to achieve targets. And it was obvious that had been declined. And Mr Parry was aware that it had been declined and I think potentially, it looks from the previous witness statement that you showed me, that Mr Wilson knows what the content of the email that Mr Keene sent out was and the email clearly stated that weak targets were not acceptable to the auditors.” </p>

I think the business environment is tough. Some things are more achievable than others in business and in the world and I was trying very clearly, as part of that presentation Mr McIntosh has put together and his team, to demonstrate that here is something which is, I could have said “eminently achievable” or “seriously achievable”. It was achievable and from what I can see, particularly with the point I made about savings, and so on, and the lack of expected sales growth from World Events, which according to that chart they were already achieving more than 1.3 million when we purchased the company, these targets seemed very achievable to me. They seemed eminently achievable. They didn’t seem easy and the reason they are not easy is something can always go wrong. And I’ve been in business too long to think that things can’t go wrong and sometimes things do go wrong. But as I stood there in November of 2011, they seemed reasonable and achievable to me. </p>

Mr Winterburn, Mr Saxby and Mr Wilson were senior managers in a company which, on any basis, was valued in millions of pounds. They were experienced in the healthcare events management industry and, I am satisfied, were proficient in analysing financial data. There is no dispute that they were told at the Meeting, effectively, that gross profit equated to net revenue. The UP Group Sales 2009 v 2010 slide (which Mr Winterburn annotated “net revenue”) showed a decline in sales in FY2010 from FY2009. The Financials for UP Group and Margin Analysis for UP Group slides showed the correct figures for what was described in terms in those slides as “gross profit”. The Monthly Financials UP Group and Cumulative Financials UP Group slides showed the same information, but labelled as “sales”. I appreciate that “gross profit”, “net revenue” and “sales” were used interchangeably at the Meeting but, if nothing else, the Financials for UP Group and Margin Analysis for UP Group slides showed the correct information labelled as “gross profit”. It was, therefore, a striking contention that Mr Winterburn, Mr Saxby and Mr Wilson were led into error by the UP GP slide as they contended in their witness statements.  </p>

I am satisfied that a reasonable person would not have inferred such a statement from the Presentation and from what Mr McIntosh said. The UP Group Sales 2009 v 2010, Monthly Financials UP Group and Cumulative Financials UP Group slides showed, in terms, that UniversalProcon’s “sales” had declined in FY2010 from their FY2009 level and, in the light too of what was admitted in cross-examination Mr McIntosh said at the Meeting, it is improbable that Mr McIntosh said anything which suggested that sales had increased year on year. </p>

More importantly, the contemporaneous evidence supports that proposition. GT recorded that the WEG management team had commented that “bigger events are not systematic”. As early as July 2010, it was </p>

Mr Ackroyd himself reported, about the same time, that Mr Keene and Mr Wilson had told him that lead times had shortened. This was also something which the WEG management team apparently reported to GT in the due diligence exercise later in 2010. In the 13 October DD report, GT noted that the lead time for the majority of WEG’s work was only about three to six months. In the 28 October DD report, GT reported that the WEG management team had spoken of lead times being short, which was consistent with GT’s financial analysis.  </p>

As Mr Winterburn’s cross-examination revealed, the criticism was unwarranted. It was entirely reasonable to attribute the profit, which Mr Winterburn contended was wrongly attributed to UWE’s UK office, to that office when the related costs were being attributed to the same office. </p>

Mr Wilson’s evidence about the teleconference, in his witness statement, was also striking. He did not need to recount what happened at the teleconference in his witness statement. Indeed, his evidence was, on a fair reading, contrary to his interest, because it suggested that he had not been persuaded that the earn out target was soft and that Mr Keene put pressure on him (“put [him] in [his] place”) to proceed with the transaction; which may explain why his witness statement then continued with his justification for entering the transaction as being what he was told at the Meeting. In the present context, the important point is, though, that, if it is right that Mr Wilson had already been persuaded that the earn out target was soft, then, on a fair reading of his witness statement, he gave Mr Keene a false picture of what he perceived to be the degree of risk in the transaction. </p>

All it said was that, if contingent consideration was to be a feature of the transaction, due diligence of UniversalProcon was likely to be required.

He was taken to the 4 November DD report, which had apparently recorded WEG’s forecast about the net revenue it would receive from Lilly work in 2011 and its forecast of the profitability of that work. Mr Pughe accepted that this showed that WEG thought, by 4 November 2010, that the Lilly work was not at risk. He said that he had not taken this information into account when he had prepared his reports. He maintained that there was a risk in relation to the Lilly work on the ground that the Lilly Master Services Agreement had not been signed but he said that, if I concluded that that was a mere formality, his conclusion about the risk relating to the Lilly work on this ground would change. </p>

I think at the time the budget was produced would they have had a separate forecast saying something different? It seems unlikely. There is obviously an element of target, as you say, in a budget, and especially if the budget is saying: “We are looking for growth,” then there is an element of target in there to motivate people to achieve that result. No doubt people’s remuneration – it would typically be the case that if there are incentives for performance, then usually they would be linked to overachievement of budget. </p>

Not necessarily, my Lord, because again if the people applying their judgment have said: “Okay, we still think our budget is as good as anything for where we think we will end up,” then the budget is still the forecast. What typically happens in large corporate environments and Plc environments is a budget is produced and then perhaps at the end of each month or possibly at the end of each quarter they would revise – they would take the actual for the month and add that to the budget for the rest of the year. It is quite common to say that is now the revised forecast. Sometimes they produce a full revised forecast, but during the first month or with the benefit of the first month’s account, can I say that somebody applying their judgment says: “We are just not going to hit budget, so our forecast needs to come down”? I am not sure I can. If they did not think they could achieve the budget at that time then, yes, it is wrong to show the forecast at the budget level.” </p>

Put another way, his opinion was that, if work was not on the radar at least, net revenue from it was not something which a forecaster could properly think was realistically achievable. I reject that opinion so far as it relates to UniversalProcon. It fails to recognise that, whether the Claimants’ or the Defendant’s view about lead times is correct, before the beginning of a financial year, when a budget is being prepared, and in the first month or so of the financial year (when the Job Log was prepared), the experience of client account managers and senior management heavily involved in the business (such as Mr Gordon, in the case of UPUS) could justify them forecasting for work which was not even on the radar but which might be awarded at relatively short notice. If Mr Pughe’s approach was the right one, net revenue from Lilly work should had been forecast by US Logistics in November 2010 at about $920,000 when, in fact, the net revenue which was actually achieved in FY2011 was $2.118 million. Lilly was an established client of US Logistics and, as I say below, the outcome of the Lilly competition was substantially settled. It would be uncommercial to conduct a business on the basis that an established client is only going to provide about 45% of the net revenue which, as it turns out, it is willing to provide. Even Mr Gordon, an apparently conservative forecaster, did not take that approach.   </p>

WEG believed as much, otherwise it would not have increased its 2011 forecast EBIT by £372,000 to reflect Lilly work. Mr Gordon felt able to increase the forecast net revenue from Lilly work in the Job Log from the budgeted net revenue figure and all the contemporaneous documents indicate that all those involved in the Lilly competition believed that the arrangements were substantially settled. In those circumstances, by Mr Pughe’s own admission, the fact that the Lilly Master Services Agreement had not been signed did not give rise to a risk in relation to the Lilly work. </p>

Whether those predictions can amount to actionable misrepresentations turns, in part at least, on whether they carried any factual implication. From time to time during the trial, the predictions were characterised as opinions, but ones which carried a factual implication. One has to be careful, however, not to label the predictions in issue (if made) as “opinions” and then to try to fit them into the jurisprudence which establishes when opinions can amount to actionable misrepresentations.

The mechanism provided by the law for remedying such mispredictions or promises is the contract itself. If a contract contains as a term guaranteeing that a future event will happen, or that the party will do some identified act, then there will be a breach of contract if that event does not happen, or if the party fails to keep his promise. Put this way, it ought to be clear that a person who receives a statement of future fact or intention ought generally not to be entitled to rely on it: if he wishes to obtain a remedy he should ask for a warranty in the contract to the effect that the fact will turn out as represented, or that the promise will be kept. </p>

Critically, so long as the representation is material (that is, it is a representation which was capable of causing the representee to act (in cases such as this one, by entering into the contract in issue)), the representor has the evidential burden of establishing that the representee did not rely on the misrepresentation.

But if a representation is such that it was likely that a person in the representee’s position would rely on it, a court may find it easier to believe the representee’s assertion that he did rely on it: the materiality of the statement is evidence that goes towards establishing reliance. Materiality is not necessary to establish reliance: the question is whether the court is satisfied that the representee actually relied on the statement. And materiality of the statement is not sufficient of itself to establish reliance. It was once said that there is an inference in law that a statement, if material, was relied on by the person to whom it was addressed. But this has been rejected in favour of a rule, now well established in the context of a range of remedies for misrepresentation, that materiality of a statement raises an inference in fact that it was relied on…. </p>

But in substance the effect of the rule is that, once a statement is shown to be material, the representor will have the burden of adducing evidence to rebut the inference that his representation was relied on by the representee. It has sometimes been suggested that this inference (of fact) of inducement is limited to cases of fraud; it may well be easy to establish the representee’s reliance where that was the fraudulent representor’s intention, but it is not limited to such cases.” </p>

He also made clear that there were real concerns about the profitability of WEG’s overseas offices. Bearing in mind how the 26 October meeting came about, and bearing in mind the timing of the meeting, it is likely that Mr Parry and Mr Wilson then appreciated that one of GT’s concerns was the profitability of WEG’s overseas offices. It may well have been at this meeting that the WEG management team informed Mr Corbin that they believed that GT had failed to “gain a good understanding of the WEG business” as Mr Corbin’s 1 November email suggested they did.   </p>

There is no contemporaneous document which suggests that, after the teleconference, Mr Corbin, in particular, or Mr McIntosh were still actively promoting the transaction in writing within the UD group as they had done before 1 November and there is no document in which they suggested soft targets. Instead, as Mr Corbin’s 8 November email suggests, his focus, at least, was on “reasonable” targets. It is likely that he sought to keep the transaction alive by pressing for an upside for the WEG shareholders, as he suggested in evidence.

It was Mr Ackroyd, as the lead advisor at Precision, who probably proposed a solution which might meet Mr Keene’s likely unwillingness to accept a reduction in price for his shares but which might also meet the UD group’s concern that it was at risk of paying too much; namely, a meeting to discuss solutions which might include a contingent consideration proposal. Perhaps Mr Ackroyd had in mind the contingent consideration proposal in the June Heads of Terms. These conclusions are supported by the 1 November email chain which was belatedly disclosed by the Defendant. I have considered this email chain carefully. I do not regard it as ambiguous and I do not believe that my view of what it says would have changed had the Claimants or their witnesses been cross-examined about it.

GT was still expressing concern about WEG’s profitability and it was still suggesting that there were doubts about the profitability of WEG’s overseas offices. Whilst GT suggested that WEG’s adjusted EBIT for 2011 was forecast to be £1.379 million, GT emphasised that that took into account an addback for overseas office losses. It was clear from the 4 November DD report that GT was still waiting for information from Mr Wilson and, as matters then stood, that it did not support that addback. Ignoring the addback, the forecast for WEG’s adjusted EBIT for 2011 was about £1.157 million, significantly below what the August Heads of Terms had contemplated.   </p>

There was no particular reason for Mr Logue to believe, at the time of the Meeting, that it was to be a key event about which he would be cross-examined ten years later. He had already developed the contingent consideration proposal. Mr Corbin, rather than Mr Logue, is likely to have led the Meeting on the UD group’s behalf and, in the light of the conclusion I reach below about the UD group’s willingness to provide further information to the WEG shareholders, the Meeting was unlikely to appear to Mr Logue, at the time, as having the importance it has gained since.  </p>

It is equally probable, at least, that the possibility of due diligence of UniversalProcon in the summer of 2010 was not pursued, because Mr Keene had indicated an unwillingness on the part of the WEG shareholders to agree any form of contingent consideration proposal, and because, at that stage, on the limited information then available, the UD group was willing to effectively substitute £700,000 deferred consideration in place of £1 million contingent consideration.

Perhaps most significantly, I am satisfied that Mr Logue did indicate, at the 26 November meeting, that the WEG shareholders could request further information. I have already commented favourably on Mr Logue as a witness. His evidence was corroborated by Ms Bates, as I have already noted. His indication at the 26 November meeting is consistent with the other matters I have referred to in this paragraph and, most strikingly perhaps, that he gave the indication is consistent with Mr Wilson’s evidence in his witness statement that such an indication may have been given. That evidence is contrary to the Claimants’ interest. It did not have to be volunteered by Mr Wilson.

	      </authorialNote> As Mr Pughe acknowledged in cross-examination, the whole purpose of the contingent consideration proposal was to de-risk the transaction for the UD group, so that the price which the WEG shareholders sought (£16.2 million) would only be payable if WEG was actually almost as profitable as WEG had forecast and almost as profitable as the August Heads of Terms had contemplated. That the UD group might be prepared to pay £16.2 million for WEG (i.e. the price contemplated in the August Heads of Terms) if WEG’s EBIT contribution in 2011 was only £900,000 (as shown in the yellow bar for that year) makes no sense. Such an approach would be wholly contrary to the UD group’s stance in its internal paperwork (for example, the 15 November paper written for the Plc’s Acquisition and Finance sub-committee), and to the concerns being expressed by Mr Logue internally and externally and by Mr FitzGerald internally. It would be contrary to the concerns about overpayment raised during the 26 October meeting. It would be wholly contrary to the UD group’s decision to renegotiate the terms of the transaction at the 1 November teleconference.  </p>

It is unlikely therefore that in October or November its FY2011 net revenue was forecast to increase by the Pounds Sterling equivalent of $557,393; £352,394 at the lower £:$ exchange rate of 1: 1.58.          </p>

Instead, somewhat less (about $557,000 less) revenue was being forecast. It follows that the representation, that net revenue of £11.197 million for FY2011 was UniversalProcon’s forecast at the time of the Meeting, was incorrect. I am not satisfied that it was substantially correct or that the difference between what had been budgeted and what was being forecast (about $557,000) was immaterial. At the lower exchange rate, the forecast was only marginally (£172,169) above UniversalProcon’s FY2010 net revenue and further below its FY2009 net revenue than the FY2011 net revenue budget indicated. I have concluded, therefore, that these slides misrepresented that net revenue for UniversalProcon of £11.197 million was being forecast for FY2011 at the time of the Meeting.  </p>

They had no reason to think that, after the Meeting, the WEG shareholders would not test the accuracy of, or ask for further details about, the information. Mr McIntosh’s claim that he thought he was presenting the budget figure for UniversalProcon’s FY2011 net revenue is credible and one I accept. £11.197 million was the budget figure, as Mr McIntosh is likely to have recalled. I was taken to no evidence which indicates that, in the couple of days before the Meeting, Mr McIntosh saw any document which had a different combined FY2011 net revenue figure of UPUS and UPUK. It is just as probable as any other scenario that whoever provided the data in the slide believed that they were providing FY2011 budget data. I am therefore not satisfied that the significance of Mr Acaster’s 25 October email or the accompanying data was appreciated or was brought to mind in the couple of days before the Meeting.

Indeed, the Defendant admits in the Defence that it was represented that the forecast was UniversalProcon’s actual forecast. As I have already noted (and, as Mr McIntosh accepted and Mr Parry explained), UniversalProcon was not forecasting at that level at the time of the Meeting. The difference between what the slide shows and what was actually being forecast was substantial; probably about £1 million.

By 17 November, only five days after the Meeting, that figure had increased to $3.307 million; an increase of $392,000 in eight days. By the same date, so from 1 October to 17 November 2010, Get and US UCS had obtained about $406,000 booked business, the majority of which business is likely to have become booked business before the Meeting, because the Meeting was so close in time to 17 November. It is likely too that the difference between UPUS’ actual booked business at the date of the Meeting and $3.31 million was not material.

Mr McIntosh’s admission about how he introduced the slides was volunteered, as was his acceptance that, by removing the word “Logistics”, the US Net Revenue Booked slide gave a false impression. His evidence, particularly in this context, struck me as credible and truthful. He rejected the suggestion that he intended to mislead by his introduction. I can think of no good reason why Mr McIntosh would have consciously given a false impression of what the slides showed if he knew the truth. The much more probable explanation is that, in the haste to put together the Presentation and prepare for the Meeting, Mr McIntosh had noted that the UK Net Revenue Booked slide was limited to booked business, so excluding nonbooked business (including radar), had noted that that slide was one he had initially distributed on 9 November and had assumed that, as he suggested in his 9 November email they should, the UPUS team (Mr Gordon and Mr Acaster) had taken the same approach in the preparation of UPUS’ equivalent slide.   </p>

A firm decision was taken, particularly by Mr FitzGerald, that the terms of the transaction had to be re-negotiated. From then on, Mr Corbin’s approach to the transaction also changed. He had not promoted soft targets for some weeks. He knew that, as an option, they had already been rejected. His became less vocally enthusiastic about the transaction, at least in writing. At the 5 November meeting, he presented a more downbeat picture; effectively indicating that Mr FitzGerald had made a decision that the terms of the transaction had to be renegotiated and that he was bound to give effect to Mr FitzGerald’s wishes. He is likely to have been party to the discussion at that meeting during which commercial earn out targets were discussed. Mr Corbin began to talk of the earn out target as “reasonable”. His focus thereafter appears to have been on providing an upside as a term of the transaction.  </p>

There is no reference to such a description of the earn out target in the Bates note and, had that description of the earn out target been given, it would have been recorded in the Bates note, as she later recorded “Way in excess of earn out targets” when the Joint Budget 2 or Joint Budget 3 slide was being presented. Rather, the point was made that the UD group had to “show a return on capital employed”.

Nevertheless, the reasons I have given for rejecting the Claimants’ contention that the earn out target was described as soft apply with almost equal force in the case of the other words ascribed to Mr McIntosh.

That is likely to refer to the £4.9 million, £5.6 million and £6.1 million sums shown on the Joint Budget 2 and Joint Budget 3 slides and the extent to which the earn out target fell below those sums. To similar effect, in cross-examination, Mr McIntosh accepted that the earn out target “represented a significant discount on the total of combined forecasts plus expected synergies”. I accept that the £4.9 million, £5.6 million and £6.1 million sums were described as being “way in excess of” the earn out target. Whether or not that was so was something which the WEG shareholders present could easily judge for themselves, as I have noted. On careful reflection, I have concluded that the assertion that that those three sums were “way in excess of” the earn out target gave no indication about the achievability of the earn out target.  </p>

As I have said, in the 9 November email, Mr McIntosh explained that the transaction would only proceed if the WEG shareholders agreed “combined EBIT numbers over the next three years”. I am satisfied that Mr McIntosh’s “objective” was to explain to the WEG shareholders present at the Meeting why he, in particular, then believed, as he is likely to have done at least, that UniversalProcon was then on course to meet its FY2011 EBIT budget, that there was a realistic prospect that it would increase its EBIT in later years and that it had at least good prospects of contributing to the savings as shown on the Joint Budget 2 slide for example.

As I have already said, it is clear to me that Mr Corbin does not recall any details about the transaction. In any event, as Mr Corbin effectively suggested in his answer, I am satisfied that it does not follow that because an earn out target is very achievable, eminently achievable or seriously achievable, it is a breeze or easy to achieve, or should be easily beaten.

I am not sure that I do have to find an alternative explanation (as, in fact, I understood Mr Pipe to suggest) for the Claimants’ decision to enter into the SPA, because if I had to, that might come dangerously close to reversing the burden of proof, but, as it happens, I have come to a clear conclusion about why the Claimants entered into the SPA having previously been unwilling to accept an earn out target, which I consider below when I discuss whether the Claimants relied on any of the misrepresentations which they have established.  </p>

Further, Mr Winterburn has misannotated slides. He misannotated the 2010/11 Savings slide (or, perhaps, did not update his initial annotation, once he was told that the Indianapolis office might not close) and he misannotated the green bars and the yellow bars. Additionally, the annotation in issue relating to Lilly appears on the US Net Revenue Booked slide and does not make clear what was the same as “2010 Lilly”. </p>

Nor did any of them appreciate that the budgets shown on the booked business slides, when combined, were, in Pounds Sterling equivalent, similarly lower than the £11.197 million sum apparently forecast; although I accept, in this latter case, this inaccuracy in the booked business slides would have been much more difficult to immediately pick up by someone not experienced in financial analysis.  </p>

Their opposition was somewhat more nuanced and complicated. As Mr Saxby’s 3 July email and Mr Dickinson’s 26 July email indicate, what the Claimants objected to were the risks inherent in a contingent consideration proposal, particularly absent appropriate due diligence being carried out, without a sufficiently counter-balancing benefit. As Mr Saxby said: “any earn out I have heard of has upsides too”. The Claimants’ opposition to contingent consideration was also complicated by the fact that it was in part as a result of what they saw as the imbalance created by Mr Keene’s unshakeable unwillingness to share any contingent consideration.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">By October 2010, a good relationship had developed between some of the WEG management team, or Mr Parry at least, and Mr McIntosh. As Mr Parry’s 9 October email suggests (and as Mr Corbin suggested in evidence), the WEG management team (Mr Keene excepted), expected to have key roles in the combined WEGUniversalProcon business and so, to a degree, control over its direction and success. The combined business would be part of the UD group, the ultimate parent of which was an Irish plc and the transaction would allow them, they believed, “to develop [their] careers”, as Mr Parry suggested in his email. Before the 13 October DD report, the Claimants were, for these reasons, enthusiasts about the transaction. As Mr Winterburn was still saying, in his 14 November email: “the management team see this deal as the best way forward for the business”.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">So GT’s adverse due diligence conclusions, the fact that the UD group would not proceed with the transaction on the basis of the August Heads of Terms and the fact that, by 5 November, there was a real risk that the transaction would collapse, are likely to have been a significant disappointment to the Claimants; particularly after they had agreed the August Heads of Terms and the transaction had been proceeding for many months.  </p>

By the end of the Meeting, they are likely to have been pleasantly surprised about its terms.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="77">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-right:0.04in"> I accept that it is likely that Mr McIntosh was positive when he made the Presentation both about UniversalProcon and the transaction, but his positively about UniversalProcon is likely to have stemmed from his belief that it could achieve an EBIT of £2.77 million in FY2011 (which the evidence suggests was how its success was measured) and because of his enthusiasm for, and success in the UK in, business development. It is unlikely that he paid any, or any real, attention to the points of detail which I have held to be misrepresentations. </p>

It is to be remembered that the Joint Budget 2 slide was presented only shortly after the slides relating to savings had been presented, and it was at this point that the contingent consideration proposal was considered a second time, it having been presented initially at the beginning of the Meeting. It is also to be remembered that, when the contingent consideration proposal was presented at the beginning of the Meeting, the earn out was said to be based on “trading profits of [UniversalProcon] and WEG”, according to the Bates note. The Joint Budget 2 slide presented the £900,000 savings the UD group had apparently assumed as additional to the trading profits of the combined business. Importantly, as the Joint Budget 2 slide suggested, the UD group had assumed that savings, including synergy savings, could be made in addition to UniversalProcon’s and WEG’s EBIT contributions, and this Mr Winterburn, Mr Saxby and Mr Wilson are likely to have recalled. (They are likely to have appreciated, in any event, that on the combination of WEG and UniversalProcon there were likely to be synergy savings).  </p>

Looked at another way, with an earn out target for 2011 set at £4.4 million, and on the assumption that WEG’s actual EBIT contribution would be £1.657 million, to meet the 2011 earn out target the UniversalProcon EBIT contribution and the savings achieved only had to be £2.743 million, £857,000 less than, or about 76% of, a UniversalProcon EBIT contribution of £2.7 million and savings of £900,000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The transaction was not an imperative for Mr Keene, as Mr Winterburn’s 14 November email suggests, for example. Mr Keene was the majority shareholder. He had complete control over whether or not the transaction proceeded at all and whether or not the Claimants benefited at all from their share option agreements. As he was entitled to, he was unwilling to share with the other WEG shareholders any part of the risk of the contingent consideration proposal or to support the offering of the Cleckheaton property as security for the contingent consideration, and, as the evidence indicates, he was unmoveable on these matters. He was keen for the transaction to be completed (as he had been from July when he cautioned Mr Dickinson against a renegotiation of the terms of the transaction) but only on the basis that the shareholdings of the other WEG shareholders alone were disposed of in return for any contingent consideration. If the Claimants were then to realise any value at all from their share option agreements, they had to accept the contingent consideration proposal and, more than that, they had to accept it disproportionately because Mr Keene was unwilling to accept contingent consideration for his shareholding.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is inherently probable that, for these reasons, or, to put it another way, in the circumstances which existed in November 2010 (which were very different from those which existed at the early stages of the transaction), the Claimants concluded that there was a real and appreciable risk to accepting the contingent consideration proposal (as Mr Parry acknowledged at, and after, the Meeting and as some of the Claimants did after the Meeting), but that the risk was one they would take; in the case of Mr Wilson, probably also because he did feel under pressure to accept the proposal at the 17 November meeting. He was the youngest of the WEG management team. None of his colleagues expressed reservations about the transaction at the Meeting. Keen for the transaction to be completed, but keen too that others alone accepted the contingent consideration proposal, Mr Keene did put pressure on Mr Wilson, at the 17 November meeting, to accept the contingent consideration proposal. That to me seems to be what most probably occurred at the 17 November meeting, in the light of Mr Wilson’s evidence and the description of Mr Keene, by Mr Winterburn and Mr Dickinson, as a strong personality. To be clear, I do not criticise Mr Keene for putting pressure on Mr Wilson. The WEG shareholders were businessmen. The transaction was a commercial one. There is no reason why self-interest could not feature in the approach they each took to the transaction.  </p>

The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the trial as it has had on so many aspects of daily life. Until shortly before the trial began, it was anticipated that the trial would be a hybrid trial and a lot of work was done to ensure that that hybrid trial would run smoothly. At almost the last moment, I had to order that the trial proceed as a fully remote trial. That the trial was to be a fully remote trial meant that further work had to be done to make sure it ran smoothly. Almost inevitably, there were some problems with the videolinks. Counsel and the parties’ solicitors, in particular Ms Fantoni of Clarion Solicitors and Mr Mitchell of Pinsent Masons, deserve much of the credit, and my thanks, for ensuring that the trial ran without interruption and so efficiently, and so that the technical problems had no impact on it. The trial participants used an electronic trial bundle managed by XBundle. I must thank the team at XBundle, in particular Mr Agombar, for all the support they gave to the trial participants, especially me, even outside court hours. Having a managed electronic trial bundle allowed the trial to run much more smoothly than it ever could have done with only a paper bundle or a non-managed electronic bundle.  Because of the hard work of counsel, the solicitors and XBundle, the trial, although fully remote, was as fair as a face to face trial would have been.   </p>
