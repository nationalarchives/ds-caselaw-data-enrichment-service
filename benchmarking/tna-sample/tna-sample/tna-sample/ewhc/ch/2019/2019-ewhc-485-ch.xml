His appointment as trustee of the Staff Scheme ceased at the same time as that of Mr Hillman and Mr Woodford (i.e., on 1 November 2011). </p>

Mercer’s approach appears to have been that it was appropriate for Mercer to act in this way, with Mercer keeping an eye on potential conflicts of interest.

In this case, Mercer assessed the future savings as amounting to £30,000 per annum as regards post-21 July 1997 joiners and £540,000 per annum as regards pre-21 July 1997 joiners.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="35">

Because the later joiners received the <span style="text-decoration:underline">lesser</span> of RPI or 5%, self-evidently if inflation remained low, they would not lose very much by this change. By contrast, the earlier joiners – guaranteed year-on-year increases of 5% however low inflation – stood to lose a great deal.

The effect of this change was that, going forward, <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> the Executive Members retained these benefits. For the future, therefore, the distinction between pre-21 July 1997 joiners and post-21 July 1997 joiners ceased to matter.

For this reason, the label is potentially quite a dangerous one. It is quite possible for someone not versed in pensions law either to consider that one particular Revenue Limit – e.g. the Earnings Cap – itself constituted all the Revenue Limits or (conversely) for the term Revenue Limits to be used to refer to only one of several Revenue Limits (to e.g. the Earnings Cap only).

However, even if the Court is not satisfied that fraud is proved, then KeyMed relies upon the non-fraudulent breaches of duty committed by the Defendants. The non-fraudulent breach claim can only succeed against Mr Hillman, as Mr Woodford will be protected by his Compromise Agreement unless fraud is proven.”  </span>

These duties were then codified in the Companies Act 2006. Generally speaking, this statutory formulation of the duties of a director can be taken as a codification of the pre-existing common law. Indeed, these sections are to be interpreted in light of the common law. Thus, section 170 of the 2006 Act provides as follows: </p>

That – provided it does not harm the company – might be said to be a key duty and proper purpose of the directors. I find that the improper purpose alleged against the Defendants is the purpose pleaded in relation to the Conspiracy in paragraph 7 of the Particulars of Claim. No other alleged improper purpose emerges from the pleading. Equally, questions of dominant or subsidiary purposes do not appear to arise in the present case: the allegation, as it seems to me, is that furthering the Conspiracy was either the only or else the dominant purpose as to why the Defendants exercised their powers in relation to the Executive Scheme in the way that they are said to have done. </p>

A minority director is not thereby in breach of his duty, or obliged to resign and to refuse to be party to the implementation of the decision. Part of his duty as a director acting in the interests of the company is to listen to the views of his fellow directors and to take account of them. He may legitimately defer to those views where he is persuaded that his fellow directors’ views are advanced in which they perceive to be the best interests of the company, even if he is not himself persuaded.

For example, where a director makes a prior agreement to vote in a third party’s interests on a particular transaction, thereby leaving himself no independent discretion as to how to act, he will be in breach of section 173(1).” </span>

That is the question that arises out of the pleadings here: is the reference to section 174 purely a duplicative one, repeating allegations which – if made good – arise out of the Conspiracy or does KeyMed allege a distinct breach by the Defendants of the duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence founded on the failure of the Defendants to exhibit the degree of skill that may reasonably be expected from a person having that director’s knowledge and experience?<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="72">

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">I can discern nothing in the Particulars of Claim that amounts to a proper plea that the Defendants or either of them fell short of an objective standard of care, skill and diligence. It is certainly true that some of the allegations of breach can be read in insolation as a falling short in such an objective way. But there is no plea, anywhere in the Particulars of Claim, setting out the manner in which the Defendants’ conduct fell objectively short of the level of skill and care that the Defendants (given their experience) should have had. In my judgment, the section 174 breach of duty allegation turns also on the allegation of Conspiracy, and goes no further than this.</p>

Thus, a fiduciary cannot act for the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. In the pension scheme context, there is obviously potential for the interests of members and the sponsoring employer to be different. In these circumstances, it is impossible for the trustees to owe funding and investment duties to both the members and the employer simultaneously, such as to render the trustees liable to compensate both for the losses caused by a breach of that duty to either of them. The position is that the trustees owe their duties to the beneficiaries, i.e. the members.

The conflict between a director’s duty to the company and his personal interest does not disappear merely because the strict equitable rule against selfdealing has been excluded. On the contrary, if the conflict remains, there is a distinct danger that the director will be tempted, in breach of his duty to the company, to place his interests before that of the company. It is, indeed, this very danger that gave rise to the strict equitable rule. When the rule has, as I see it, been excluded, it becomes the duty of the court, in my judgment, to scrutinize the transaction with great care so as to determine whether in carrying it out the director has truly managed to avoid the temptation of putting his personal interests before that of the company.” </span>

For instance, Mr Craig was a friend of Mr Woodford’s and although retired from Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite, and not in the best of health, was at the time of the trial working as a consultant at a provincial law firm, and capable of giving evidence. KeyMed suggested that adverse inferences should be drawn from the Defendants’ failure to adduce the evidence of Mr Greengrass and their failure to obtain evidence from Mr Craig.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="161">

This is not a reflection on the experts, all of whom clearly were expert and who did their best to assist the court. Rather, it is because the issues framed for expert evidence had little bearing on the issues that I actually had to decide, which turned on questions of the honesty or otherwise of the Defendants. I would have been assisted by Mercer’s insight into these questions, but the experts could obviously not provide this insight. Their evidence was clearly directed to filling this gap – thus, I heard a great deal about the sort of advice an actuary would have tendered to KeyMed, had that actuary been asked – which, I am afraid, fell far short of </p>

Of course, the financial consequences to the employer of not applying the Revenue Limits could – and generally would – be significantly adverse. Thus, many companies chose to continue to apply the Revenue Limits as new (voluntary) limits to the rights of scheme members. This is what happened at KeyMed. The timing of this decision is, however, significant. The decision voluntarily to apply the Revenue Limits, including the PIP Limit, was made <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> the decision to establish the Executive Scheme, but <span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> the Executive Scheme was in fact established.

Mr Hillman suggested, as a possibility, that the agenda had been prepared before the Board meeting on 14 December 2005, and that the issue of the Executive Scheme cropped up between that meeting and the meeting on 20 December 2005. That is speculation, and I see no reason why that should have been the case. As will be seen, there were discussions regarding a possible Executive Scheme between Mercer and the trustees of the Staff Scheme well before 14 December 2005. I therefore doubt that this is the explanation. Mr Woodford suggested that the meeting on 20 December 2005 was specifically to deal with the establishment of the Executive Scheme: Day 9/p.53 and p.60 (cross-examination of Mr Woodford).

Given that the specific wording regarding declarations of interest was inserted at the suggestion of Mr Craig, it is entirely possible that Mr Virgo’s name was inserted, even though he was not present. As I say, however, I conclude – on balance – that the wording is suggestive that he was there. In Hillman 1/§14.7, Mr Hillman says that he recalled Mr Virgo asking some questions about the effect on his benefits under the new Executive Scheme, which obviously suggests Mr Virgo’s presence. </p>

Mercer’s IR Report had stated that KeyMed may wish to consider compensating for the effect of the additional tax liability to put the individual in the same position as before the changes. However, I remember that Michael felt strongly that the impact of this change should be borne by the relevant individuals (including Michael and me), without any compensation by KeyMed, to which the directors agreed.

However, the cost of pensions set by insurance companies makes no such allowance for this equity out-performance.

		<span style="font-size:11pt">“12.2 I recall that the situation, as it then was, created an issue for all the scheme members, because the liabilities of the higher paid members, principally the Executive Category, created a distortion in the [Staff] Scheme. The overall funding level was disproportionately affected by movements in the liabilities in respect of these members and my pension represented a significant percentage of the overall total. An example I recall that we discussed at this meeting was the impact on the funding level of the scheme of the recent increase in my salary, in recognition of being appointed Managing Director of the medical business for Europe, and the surgical business in the US, earlier that year. I recall that this had increased the scheme’s liabilities by around £3 million and was one major factor in the current deficit. </span>

If the trustees failed to ensure the scheme was sufficiently funded over this period, at the point of retirement (assuming annuities were purchased, which was the intention), if the scheme was not fully funded on a buy-out basis, this would lead to a drop in the proportionate level of the assets available to fund the liabilities of all the other members, and materially affect the security of their pensions. </span>

From looking at the minutes, I can see that we considered the possibility of making a special contribution against the existing shortfall, and asked [Mr Wright] to advise on the implications for [KeyMed’s] P&amp;L. This was also to include a review of mortality rates, the impact of which was a continuing cause for concern. I remember discussing how best to minimise the risk of a material funding deficit recurring, and that [Mr Wright] explained that the essential issue was to ensure the scheme’s liabilities were fully funded on a continuing basis.” </span>

Although Mr Calcraft and I were junior directors at the time the Board of KeyMed considered the establishment of the Executive Scheme in December 2005, this was not and would not always be the case. Not only were we younger than both Defendants, but I was running the surgical device business in the US having been promoted to the position of Senior Vice President of Olympus Surgical and Industrial America and Mr Calcraft was the Managing Director of the European Medical Business.

The point is a remarkable one, since Mr Williams was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> an Executive Member and his benefits were by definition different. The <span style="font-style:italic">raison d’être</span> for the Executive Scheme arose out of Mercer’s advice to KeyMed as to the effect of the PPF Risk on the Executive Members. I find it remarkable that Mr Williams should raise this point in his statement, and I regard the point as fundamentally irrelevant. At most it shows a failure to consider other classes of Member within the Staff Scheme. That would amount to a failure on the part of the trustees of the Staff Scheme (including Mr Craig) rather than a breach of director’s duty to KeyMed.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="266">

One of the conclusions of this review was that the creation of the Pensions Protection Fund, with the allocation of assets in the case of a winding up that this implied, created a risk (the PPF Risk) for the more highly entitled Members of the Staff Scheme. These Members were, essentially, the Members of the Executive part of the Staff Scheme, whose rights under the Scheme were considerably better than the rights of non-Executive Members.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="267">

Both Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman would have been well able to answer this obvious question, and that is what I find they did. Answering the question would, inevitably, have identified the interest of all the Executive Members in the establishment of the new scheme. </p>

That, as I find, is the reason why the formal wording being proposed by Mr Craig was necessary: Mr Craig was not seeking to rectify an omission on the part of Mr Woodford or Mr Hillman in explaining their (and Mr Virgo’s) interest in the transaction, but rather was seeking to capture in short and formal language what Mr Woodford and/or Mr Hillman would have expressed more discursively. </p>

True it is that Mr Virgo was not a trustee of the Staff Scheme, and so would have been less involved in the detail concerning the PPF Risk.

I have heard no evidence from or about Mr Virgo. Absent evidence, it seems to me that I cannot properly conclude that Mr Virgo was either a knave or a fool: and that confirms me in the findings (set out in paragraph 267 above) that I would, in any event, have reached, even absent the special case of Mr Virgo. </p>

However, as I have described, this matter was not considered at any meeting of the Board or of the trustees. Nor was I taken to any other document evidencing such consideration. The letter may, of course, have been shown by Mr Rowe to Mr Hillman or Mr Woodford. But there is no paper-trail to suggest that this occurred, and I am afraid that I do not consider that I can rely – in the absence of such a paper trail – on the unassisted recollections of the witnesses as to what Mr Rowe would have done with this letter, when he received it. </p>

All of the executive members had joined the Staff Scheme prior to this date and I therefore believed that they would all benefit from these increases. At the time, I was aware that certain limits existed in relation to maximum pensions but I did not realise that there were any limits applicable to me in relation to increases to pensions in payment. </span>

My recollection is that the Staff Scheme Trustees discussed the Earnings Cap and agreed in principle that they should recommend to the company that the Earnings Cap should be retained. However, I cannot remember exactly when these discussions took place or when this decision was made. I believe that it is likely that it would have been at or around the Staff Scheme Trustee meeting on 04 April 2005. This is because that was the first Staff Scheme Trustee meeting after which Mercer had issued its letter dated 27 July 2004 (which discussed the removal of the Earnings Cap) and the IR Report (which referred back to the July letter and gave further detail regarding the A-Day changes). The 27 July 2004 letter in particular placed considerable emphasis on whether or not to retain the Earnings Cap. </span>

His role was a responsible one, which (throughout his evidence) Mr Rowe sought to underplay. Any decision of any moment, he claimed, would not have been taken by him without consultation with Mr Hillman, if not Mr Woodford. This exchange constitutes one such example of Mr Rowe seeking to pass responsibility upwards. </p>

But the documentary record suggests that Mr Rowe was mistaken. It is not just that Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman were cogent in their denial of any involvement in this decision, but their denials are buttressed by the documents. It is, of course, quite possible that the documents simply fail to record a decision that was made: but, having considered the evidence in the round, I have concluded that, in this case at least, Mr Rowe signed the Mercer letter without reference to anyone. Doubtless he did so because Mercer had made clear in the past that retaining the Revenue Limits was important for KeyMed, and I have little doubt that had he run the letter past Mr Hillman, Mr Hillman would have agreed. But I find that this did not occur. </p>

		</authorialNote> One can readily understand why such advice was given. The costs to KeyMed of not continuing to apply the Revenue Limits were material and entirely adverse.

Whilst I regard that argument as specious – Members rights <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> change post-A-Day, for the better, <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless the Scheme rules were changed so as to maintain the IR Limits</span> –, it was clearly an argument that Mercer considered to be valid.

My understanding was that, in practice, none of the members of the staff category would be likely to earn more than a maximum 2/3 pension under the rules of the Staff Scheme and, accordingly, the PIP Limits would have no effect. This was because members of the staff category would only achieve a maximum of 2/3rds pension after 40 years’service (compared with 30 years for executive members). We asked John to consider this further and to let us know whether there were, in fact, staff members who would be affected.

Mr Woodford had a short temper and was always liable to reprimand anyone in forceful terms for a perceived failure in front of their colleagues.

Essentially, Mr Rowe has no recollection of the decision regarding the PIP Limit or the Revenue Limits generally, and bases his suggestion that events did not occur in this way on the fact that, had they done so, he would have remembered them. I am afraid that I can attach very little weight to this evidence. Not only does it fly in the face of the documentary evidence – Mr Rowe, like it or not, signed the Mercer letter approving the continuation of the Revenue Limits – but it is contradicted by the clear evidence of Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman, which evidence at least has the virtue of being consistent with the documents and (as significantly) the fact that the documents disclose no consideration by the Defendants of the Revenue Limits <span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> July 2006. </p>

What I do not accept is Mr Williams’ assertion that he would have remembered such discussions because of the unfairness to himself and Mr Calcraft. Mr Williams’ evidence appears to wrongly conflate <span style="font-style:italic">(i) </span>the fact that his (and Mr Calcraft’s) pensions when in payment increased by significantly less than the pensions in payment of Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman (and Mr Virgo) with <span style="font-style:italic">(ii) </span>the effect of the PIP Limit (which might, in certain circumstances, operate to limit increases on pensions in payment). The underlined parts of Mr Williams’ evidence show a clear conflation of what were two very different matters. In short, I do not believe that Mr Williams would have had any sense of unfairness and that he would have regarded the matter in an altogether less emotional way. I consider that the recollection set out in Williams 2 and quoted in paragraph 309 above represents an attempt at reconstruction on the part of Mr Williams that has gone badly wrong. </p>

		</authorialNote> Mr Wardell, QC objected to the question, on grounds that Mr Williams – having said he could not remember the conversation – could say no more. I overruled that objection, on the basis that it was necessarily a hypothetical conversation that was being put, because (<span style="font-style:italic">pace </span>Mr Williams’ own statement) had a conversation of a certain sort occurred, Mr Williams’ considered that he would have recalled it.

The issue only came to the attention of the Defendants and – indeed, more generally – when Mercer were considering the value of the rights of the Executive Scheme members, in the context of an actuarial valuation of the Staff Scheme. That exercise inevitably raised the question of what rights the Executive Members actually had under the Staff Scheme. That is a necessarily anterior question to the question of valuation, and it necessarily raised the question of whether the PIP Limit did, or did not, apply. </p>

I reiterated that this was in contradiction to what Paul and I had always been told in our benefits statements and scheme booklets, that we would receive 5% increases. I remember this clearly because of my frustration that the decision to retain the HMRC limits was made without due consideration and referral to the directors. I am therefore certain that [Mr Williams] and [Mr Calcraft] knew that this change was in the deed when they signed it and that this was different from the position in the [Staff] Scheme. I note that all the directors and trustees had signed the deed amending the rules of the [Staff] Scheme, retaining the HMRC limits generally, dated 2 November 2007. </span>

I regard the evidence of the scanning of the Interim Deed and the emailing of that document to Mercer as compelling. It seems to me that Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman must be wrong if and to the extent that they contend that this document was signed on 13 November 2007. The documentary evidence, supported by Ms McBrearty’s evidence, strongly suggests that this document was sent – signed by all – to Mercer on 12 November 2007.</p>

I think that it is likely that I did this at a different time from taking the Interim Trust Deed around for their signature because I created a pdf copy of an incomplete version of the Debenture (as the signatures of Mr Hillman and Mr Woodford were not witnessed and Mr Craig had not signed) on 13 November 2007 at 10:06. I witnessed the signing of the final version of the Debenture by Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman, unlike the signing of the Interim Trust Deed, where I only witnessed Mr Hillman’s signature, with Mr Woodford’s signature being witnessed by Mr Hillman’s PA, Rosemarie Spencer. This suggests that the Interim Trust Deed was signed at a different time from the Transfer Agreement and Debenture. I would then have walked around the final versions for signature by Mr Williams and Mr Calcraft, and sent them to Hugh Craig for him to sign. </span>

Those discussions, as I have found, proceeded on the basis that the PIP Limit would <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> apply to the new Executive Scheme.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:0.04in">It was Mr Williams’ evidence that he would have been willing to sign simply because Mr Woodford, Mr Hillman and (perhaps) Mr Calcraft had already signed. I reject that evidence. Whilst it may be that Mr Williams adopted a cavalier attitude towards Board minutes that he thought did not concern him, he would not have so disregarded his duties so as to sign a document simply on Ms McBrearty’s assertion that it related to the Executive Scheme and because others had signed before him. If this was the first time Mr Williams had heard of the Executive Scheme, he would not have signed the document at all. He would have wanted to know why a new pension scheme was being established. I do not, therefore, accept that this was the first occasion on which Mr Williams heard of the Executive Scheme. Had this been the case, then Mr Williams would have wanted to know much more. </p>

There would have been many occasions on which he could have done so, given the elapsed time between the Board meeting in December 2005 and November 2007. I consider that, in seeking to reconstruct his actions, Mr Williams understated the extent to which he would have competently performed his duties as a director, and was too willing to accept that he had been less than diligent as a director. It may be that he took this course because it was the surest way of enabling KeyMed’s case to prevail: but whatever the reason, I do not accept this part of Mr Williams’ evidence. I do not find that Mr Williams was deliberately seeking to mislead the court. However, in the course of preparation of his statements and his evidence, I find that he mislead himself into minimizing the extent to which he, personally, would have had regard to information relating to the Executive Scheme that crossed his desk. </p>

Even that, as I have found, had been debated since the summer of 2006. </p>

None of them were answered completely satisfactorily during the course of the trial. It is necessary to note these deficiencies in process, because the questions of Conspiracy, bad faith and dishonesty remain at large, and the criticisms that KeyMed makes of the process are relevant to these issues. </p>

However, it seems likely from the documents that it was due to the relevant minute inadvertently being omitted from the final version of the meeting minutes. I note that a second, different, set of draft minutes regarding the Executive Scheme was produced for 29 March 2007 that dealt solely with the KeyMed debenture. From an email sent on 16 April 2007, I can see that Mel proposed to John that this section be moved to a separate set of minutes for the Executive Scheme. </span>

Bonds might not have had such a dramatic potential for growth, but they provided a secure and stable year on year return. Moreover, high quality fixed income vehicles provided the most predictable matching of known liabilities for a scheme which had been closed to new entrants for several years, with an increasing profile of maturing members. The critical point was that by investing in gilts and AAA-rated corporate bonds, the scheme’s capital value would be preserved, compared with the potential for sudden and unpredicted falls in equity values.

The converse seems to me to be the case: the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme investment policies went in the same direction because that was in the interests of <span style="text-decoration:underline">both</span> schemes.

If they were unreasonable or inappropriate strategies, why were they retained? KeyMed’s attempt to answer this point is to suggest that there is some fundamental difference between the position when the strategy is first decided upon and the position when the strategy has been in place for some time. That distinction (which is not based on any evidence) makes no sense: if it was inappropriate not to invest in more return-seeking assets in 2009, 2010 and 2011, it would have been equally inappropriate to adopt that course in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and so on.” </span>

If the change to the investment strategy had been unreasonable or inappropriate, then Mercer would have said so. Moreover, none of the experts who gave evidence before me criticized or sought to criticize Mercer.

Therefore, when setting their basis, due in part to capital and regulatory considerations, insurers assume that any assets taken on will be invested in very low risk investments, such as gilts and high quality corporate bonds (irrespective of the past asset allocation of a scheme).

Moreover, the existence of the Staff Scheme – with its longer-tail liabilities – meant that if there was a risk of a surplus in the Executive Scheme (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e.</span> if, having discharged the liabilities to the Defendants, there was money left over<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="464">

That does not, however, mean that “conservative” investment and funding strategies are contrary to the scheme employer’s interests. The scheme employer’s interests may, equally, favour a “conservative approach”. In this, much turns on the employer’s calculations regarding the likelihood of a riskier investment strategy reducing the need for higher levels of funding because higher returns will be generated; and on the employer’s appetite for risk. </p>

In short, I do not consider that Mr Williams actually understood what he was approving. In a Board member with responsibility for making decisions for the company, this is a serious failing. More to the point, given this failure of understanding, criticisms made of the Defendants based upon Mr Williams’ evidence, must be treated (and I do treat them) with caution.

Because the focus of the meetings was usually on operational matters, I would scan the minutes to see if there was anything that had been discussed at the meeting which might affect that part of the business for which I was responsible or any action points that were listed for me. This was particularly the case when I was working in the US, as much of the information that was covered in Director’s meetings and recorded in the minutes dealt with matters local to the UK that were, at that time, of lesser concern to me as I was primarily focussed on the US business. Because of the time difference between the UK and the US, the minutes would, at that time, be seen first by my secretary, Ms Arlene Perry (“Ms Perry”), who was based in the UK, and we developed a very efficient way of working. Ms Perry would read the minutes, identify the action points for me and draft emails for me to send. I would then call her when I was travelling to the office in the morning, US time, to discuss the action points and emails for me to take forward when I arrived in the office. Given the length of the minutes, I found this to be an efficient way of identifying action points quickly. I came to rely on Ms Perry and I would not look at the minutes which she had reviewed for me unless there was something specific I wanted to check. In the interests of speed and efficiency, Ms Perry continued to review minutes for me when I returned from the US and would highlight to me anything that I needed to action. I believe other Directors also had their secretaries do this for them. </span>

I do not recall regularly receiving minutes of Trustee Meetings before I became a Trustee of the Staff Scheme in 2011, although I see from the minutes of Trustee Meetings that were produced to me whilst making this statement that I was on the distribution list for copies of the minutes of the Trustee Meetings of the Staff Scheme…”  </span>

It may very well be that Mr Williams’ failure to engage on questions relating to pensions caused or contributed to his demonstrated lack of understanding of the decisions KeyMed was making in the areas of the Staff and Executive Schemes. The consequence is that the decisions of the Board on pensions questions received inadequate and incompetent supervision from Mr Williams, in breach of his own duties as a director. This is, of course, precisely the kind of situation that would have enabled Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman to take advantage of the company, as KeyMed alleges. Whether or not they did so is, of course, a central point to be addressed in this Judgment. There are two points that will need to be resolved in order to establish whether this was a situation where Mr Williams’ approach allowed the Defendants’ alleged breaches of fiduciary duty to flourish: </p>

He was determined to see the background documents about which he was being questioned and would read them from end-to-end. I make no criticism of this: a witness is perfectly entitled to refresh his memory of documents before testifying about them. The problem with Mr Rowe was that – having looked carefully at the documents he was being asked about – he almost always had nothing to add. Subject to the three points Mr Rowe was keen to advance, which I consider below, substantially Mr Rowe’s witness statements and his oral evidence recounted the bare content of documents, then adding that he could recall nothing more.  </p>

I accept that Mr Rowe was not at the top of the organization; and, as I shall find, Mr Woodford, at least, was a demanding and controlling leader of KeyMed. But that does not mean, and I do not accept, that Mr Rowe’s role was solely administrative. He took, and had the power to take, substantive decisions. Most importantly, in this case, </p>

Whilst I accept that Mr Rowe was subordinate to both of the Defendants, that does not mean his role was itself not a responsible one. Mr Rowe sought to underplay his responsibility, and I reject this description of his role. At least in the context of the pension schemes, he played an important role in interfacing with Mercer, particularly when seeking to consider the implications and effects of ADay.  </p>

At Trustee meetings, Mr Wright would sometimes flag that a particular decision on a matter was something for KeyMed, at which point Mr Woodford would tell him he was making the decision on behalf of KeyMed. I believe that any reference in the Trustee minutes to the Board making a decision or consulting with KeyMed was purely for the purposes of the minutes. The decisions were taken by Mr Hillman or Mr Woodford. I assumed that Mr Hillman and Mr Woodford would update their fellow UK Directors on any decisions that were made but, as I did not attend Director’s meetings until I became Company Secretary for KeyMed in April 2009, I cannot say whether this in fact occurred before that date…” There were, according to Mr Rowe, “no real checks and balances on Mr Woodford in his management of KeyMed.”  </span>

In practice, by the time of my involvement, Mr Woodford and Mr Hillman exercised exclusive control over Staff Scheme decision-making. They also in practice exercised exclusive control over Executive Scheme decision-making from both the Trustee and company side from the date of its establishment. At Staff Scheme Trustee meetings, there was rarely any difference of opinion amongst the Trustees. Mr Craig might make points, rather than disagree, but the views of the three Trustees almost always seemed to be aligned.

Mr Hillman presented as an articulate and precise witnesses. He appeared to have a reasonably good recollection of events and sought to differentiate between what was recollection and what was reconstruction. I fully recognise that in a case such as this, the distinction between recollection and reconstruction is a difficult, even an impossible one, to draw. Mr Hillman gave two, extremely detailed, witness statements. Both make detailed reference to the contemporaneous documents that Mr Hillman considers that he would have seen at the time. That is an entirely appropriate way of preparing a witness statement, but the corollary is that in seeking to reconstruct – from documents and recollection – what must have happened, a witness’s memory will be distorted, even augmented.

		<span style="font-size:11pt">“Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time. In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called ‘flashbulb’ memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description ‘flashbulb’ memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness’s memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).” </span>

He obviously was a powerful and decisive businessman, who (in exchanges with Mr Wardell, QC) more than held his own. Yet he was also highly intelligent and reflective. He had an instinctive grasp of conflicts of interest, and the difficulties they presented, and was quite willing to accept when mistakes had been made, as indeed was Mr Hillman. Mr Hillman’s focus was more on the inadequate way in which matters had been documented. Mr Woodford tended to look more to the substance. He was, for instance, quite frank that the decision made in April 2005 that (with the exception of Executive Members) the future pensions in payment of pre-21 July 1997 joiners should be reduced had, with hindsight, been a mistake. </p>

His salary increased with his responsibilities, and he was concerned to ensure that he received his due. When – due to the A-Day changes – he found himself faced with a present tax charge for future pension entitlements, he persuaded Olympus to pay these charges. That, to my mind, is both a measure of Mr Woodford’s value to Olympus, and Mr Woodford’s perception of his own value to Olympus. I stress that I see nothing improper in this: I am simply recording that I found Mr Woodford to be a hard-but-fair businessman, capable no doubt of decisiveness, even ruthlessness, and of great determination. KeyMed benefited from these qualities, but Mr Woodford deployed them also to his own account. Subject to the duties imposed on directors and trustees, there is nothing wrong with this. </p>

I am quite prepared to accept – as indeed, Mr Woodford did – that road safety was something of an obsession with Mr Woodford. However, I do not consider – in this collateral area – that I can properly make findings about whether the campaign had no benefits to KeyMed. Nor can I properly make findings about whether matters were concealed from Olympus. These points were put to the Defendants, and they denied them. On this, collateral issue, I consider that such denials are final.

Thus, both exaggerated their medical qualification, relying upon their training as salesmen of medical equipment to this end. Mr Hillman even became – for the purposes of the road safety campaign – “Dr” Hillman, a clear untruth. It may be that the evidence deployed by the Defendants was “beefed up” to show, more emphatically, vehicle skid marks and the effect on lines of sight of vegetation. Certainly, the Defendants were caught in an embarrassing incident where Mr Hillman, at a meeting, masqueraded as Mr Woodford. None of these matters adds lustre to the reputation or character of the Defendants. But these matters all spring from the same obsession regarding road safety: the Defendants were advocates – passionate advocates, Mr Woodford to the fore – of road safety and – as advocates – they wrongly allowed themselves to exaggerate and misrepresent. But that is all that these matters amount to: I am entirely unpersuaded that even if Mr Woodford or Mr Hillman lied in the course of their campaign, that this is in any way probative of <span style="font-style:italic">(i)</span> dishonesty when conducting the affairs of KeyMed or <span style="font-style:italic">(ii)</span> dishonesty when giving evidence before me. </p>

I reject this allegation. One reason – probably the most usual reason – for a coincidence of evidence is that the witnesses are recounting the same (true) version of events. That, I consider, is what happened here. Of course, the level of similarity would be heightened in this case, because both Defendants would (in the course of what were, I find, <span style="text-decoration:underline">independently</span> produced witness statements) be shown and asked to consider the same or very similar universe of contemporary documents. Those documents – self-evidently – will have influenced the evidence of the Defendants; equally, the fact that both Defendants would have had to have input into, and approve, the Defence, renders the similarity in their evidence unsurprising and entirely explicable.

I have considered the execution of the documents relating to the Executive Scheme principally in relation to the removal of the PIP Limit. However, in executing these documents, Mr Williams and Mr Calcraft not only approved the removal of the PIP Limit, but also approved the establishment of the Executive Scheme on the terms of these documents. Accordingly, the findings that I have made in Section F(5)<span style="font-style:italic">(c)(v)</span> support my conclusions in paragraph 479(1)(a) above.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.70in;margin-right:0.04in">The fact that the PIP Limit had been retained without due consideration came to the attention of the Defendants in about July 2006. From that time on, the Defendants were of the view that the decision needed to be revisited and – with the involvement of Mercer, Mr Rowe, Mr Williams and Mr Calcraft – the provisional decision was made to remove the PIP Limit from the Executive Scheme, and Mercer prepared the Scheme documents on that basis.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:0.04in">Inevitably, the process of establishing the Executive Scheme could have been better documented. KeyMed have identified a number of issues with that process, which I set out in paragraph 372 above. Mercer’s concerns regarding the cost of the PIP Limit, the failure to obtain legal advice and the fact that Mercer (wrongly) linked the removal of the PIP Limit with certain tax consequences caused by A-Day are all significant matters, and the question is whether they cause me to alter the conclusion that I have otherwise reached that the decisions to establish the Executive Scheme and remove the PIP Limit were honestly and properly made. They do not. If there was more material suggestive of the dishonesty of the Defendants, it might be possible to use these failings to buttress a finding of dishonesty. But I do not consider that there is any evidence of dishonest or improper conduct on the part of the Defendants, and in my judgment the failings that KeyMed has identified are just that: failings. They are not evidence of dishonesty: they are instances where – recognizing that this was a busy company, and the protagonists (including the Defendants) busy people – things that could have been done better, but where the failure is attributable to an innocent failure of process.</p>
