	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is not the outcome of a public enquiry into the reverse takeover by Lloyds TSB Group plc (“Lloyds”) of HBOS plc (“HBOS”) at the start of the great credit crunch in 2008. It is a judgment following the trial of specific allegations made by a group of Lloyds shareholders (or former shareholders) who seek to make each of five former directors of Lloyds personally liable to pay some £385 million to that group for alleged carelessness or breach of fiduciary duty (or more accurately “equitable” duty). It has not been my task to investigate or to seek to answer all questions that arise from the takeover. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor am I required to make an overall assessment of whether in the light of a decade of financial tumult, hesitant recovery and historic claims the takeover was ultimately justified. Some shareholders (especially those who, perhaps because they were members of an employees’ share scheme as about 98% of employees were, had put all their eggs in one basket) have emphasised that for them it has been a personal financial catastrophe: and so, it has been. That can only elicit sympathy for the small investor. It has provoked amongst some of those who entrusted their entire nest-egg to an investment in Lloyds a level of distress such that it caused one retired clergymen to write to the Chairman of Lloyds and say in as Christian terms as was possible, that the Chairman was a mountebank and a blaggard. Members of Lloyds’ management have, on the other hand, emphasised that what has emerged from the turmoil is the largest and best capitalised bank on the High Street, notwithstanding the enormous challenges subsequently presented by at least £18bn-worth (and continuing) of claims arising from PPI miss-selling and other such activities (which activities themselves had produced the high dividends which made shares in Lloyds so attractive to investors like the Claimants before 2008). But even management must (and does) acknowledge that matters did not turn out as intended because the bank faced “things that were unanticipated but which the real world delivered” (as Mr Truett Tate put it during the trial).  </p>

Emphasis is placed upon particular voices in what was at the time a cacophony competing for attention. Reliance is placed upon a careful selection from amongst those documents that have survived and from amongst the conversations and debates that are noted or recorded (for the unrecorded maybe forgotten or misremembered). Those documents themselves may not disclose the nuances apparent to the contemporary recipient, and are now read and understood in the light of knowledge that the actual recipient lacked at the time. The mere existence of a document frequently does not establish who saw it and in what circumstances so that one cannot tell whether the scrutiny and analysis to which it is subjected by the Court process bears any relationship to how it would have been received and treated at the time. The case management process identifies the issues </p>

Recollections are coloured by this process and by the challenges to that process of recall presented by knowing what eventuated: recollection and reconstruction (to the extent that they can ever be separated) become completely undifferentiated. What might have seemed unimportant at the time emerges as significant once the whole narrative is known, and the knowledge of what did in fact occur exerts a subtle pressure to think that at the time it must have been seen as a real possibility. Changes in culture brought about by the response of the market or of the supervisory authorities to the consequences of unfolding events present particular difficulties for retrospective assessments. </p>

The Bank of England (“BoE” or “the Bank”), HM Treasury (“the Treasury”) and the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”), who together tried to maintain the integrity and overall health of UK markets (and were together known as “the Tripartite”) determined to restore confidence in the banking sector by providing an unprecedented package of financial support. The announcement came on 8 October 2008. The key elements were (a) measures to provide sufficient short-term liquidity to enable banks to lend in the real economy; and (b) a requirement that banks should strengthen their balance sheets by raising more capital (in which exercise the Treasury would participate) with the object that banks should increase what was known technically as “the Core Tier 1 ratio”.  This latter element was to be the subject of further discussion with individual banks.

First, Lloyds would now raise £5.5 billion of new capital. Of this the Treasury would take £1 billion of preference shares: and the remaining £4.5 billion would be raised by an open offer of new shares at a discount which would be subscribed by the Treasury but with existing Lloyds shareholders having the right to claw-back their proportionate entitlement. The effect of taking Government money was dilutive as regards existing shareholders, and was acknowledged to be so.  Second, the effective price paid for each HBOS share was reduced. HBOS shareholders would now receive only 0.605 of a Lloyds share for each 1 HBOS share. </p>

Part of this work involved assessing what impairments there might be of the HBOS loan book. “Impairment” is the term used to describe current expectations about future events, namely, what lesser performance, then the face of the loan book might suggest, is to be expected because of flaws in the loan quality or because of diminished performance in a recession. (Technically, impairment loss calculations involved the estimation of future cash flows of loans and advances based on (i) observable data at the selected date and (ii) historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics, those calculations being undertaken on a portfolio basis). This involved the statistical modelling of the performance of the portfolios on different assumptions (which might or might not eventuate), and then making a judgment about the relevance of the various sets of assumptions in what was anticipated to be “the real world”. The principal contributors to this exercise were Patrick Foley (the highly respected Chief Economist at Lloyds) (“Mr Foley”), and Stephen Roughton-Smith (the Deputy Head of Risk and Head of Credit Risk at Lloyds) (“Mr Roughton-Smith”). </p>

The amount of the capital adjustments takes into account the elimination of the HBOS available for sale (“AFS”) reserve at 30 November 2008 and includes the effect of the application of market-based credit spreads at September 2008 to HBOS’s portfolio. A comprehensive assessment of the fair values of HBOS’s assets will be undertaken following completion of the acquisition, the provisional results of which will be published in Lloyds TSB’s 2009 interim report.

Two points may be made: (i) this is not a direct claim against Lloyds, e.g. because its employees failed properly to investigate the Acquisition and failed to put the necessary materials before the Lloyds board for consideration by them, but a secondary claim dependent on proof that the Defendants are liable <span style="font-style:italic">as directors</span>; and (ii) if the Claimants succeed and Lloyds is vicariously liable the effect will be to transfer value from the present shareholders in Lloyds to a group of shareholders who held shares a decade earlier. </p>

But those parts of their case that did require positive proof (what a Claimant knew, where he or she got the information from (including from sources other than Lloyds), in what way and to what extent reliance was placed on that information, what the decision made actually was and how it had been reached, what the witness would have done if things had been different) were touched upon to varying extents in evidence from  only 7 retail investors and 6 institutional investors out of the 5800+ claimants. Of those the retail investor statements of Stembridge, Owen and Scott stand out as models.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The evidence adduced on behalf of the Defendants was much more extensive. I am seduced neither by its length nor by its dependence upon a documentary structure. I begin with three general observations. The first is that with the passage of 9 years the grasp on detail concerning a fast-moving and intense activity has inevitably slackened. The fact that in the witness box an individual might seem somewhat hapless in the face of detailed questions about particular emails or specific figures in a report, and resort to the (entirely honest) answer that they cannot remember, does not mean that they were not completely on top of the detail during the crucial events themselves: nor does it mean that at trial they are being evasive and slippery. On the other hand, the ability of a witness to answer matters of detail may simply reflect a mastery of the documentary structure.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The second observation is that the times themselves were so extraordinary, and the events themselves so unprecedented, that the broad sense of what happened and the occurrence of individual events are quite likely to be remembered. Moreover, the consequences of the transaction emerged within a matter of weeks as the economy plunged into the deepest recession for centuries: and those involved began immediately to review the decisions they had just taken, and how and why they had reached the decisions they did. Whilst this may well lead to a retention of the main thrust of an argument I am sceptical that it could lead to an accurate recollection of a precise thought process (unless this is recorded somewhere). This process has continued as the controversy surrounding those decisions has rumbled on. The evidence tendered in the witness box has been shaped by that process of review and justification: and the evidence tendered in the witness statements is in some cases further shaped by knowledge of and interpretation of key contemporaneous documents (though plainly there were many documents that witnesses had not viewed for 9 years). This observation casts no imputation upon the honesty of any witness. No witness concocted anything or told me anything they did not truly believe. Nor does it mean that I regard the evidence of these witnesses as mere commentary upon selected documents which is of itself without value. Certainly not. It fills in undocumented gaps and provides a necessary corrective to applying a 2017/18 understanding to documents generated in 2008. </p>

Each witness was therefore unprepared for challenges based upon inconsistency or difference in expression between statements. </p>

Before becoming chairman of Lloyds in May 2006 he had (in consequence of his expertise as a solicitor in public offerings and acquisitions) headed the corporate finance department of the merchant bank Charterhouse Japhet, and in due time had become Chief Executive and Chairman of the Charterhouse Group. When Charterhouse was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland he served on the board of RBS (whilst remaining at the Charterhouse Group). He had subsequently become Chairman of the Mirror Group Newspapers and chairman of The Great Universal Stores plc. He was the Chairman of Lloyds from May 2006 until September 2009, when he resigned in view of the decline in the Lloyds share price. But in the witness box he displayed none of the vigour or authority that his expertise and experience would have commanded at the time. Whilst his recollection of detail failed him he retained a clear understanding of the roles of the relevant personnel, and of how he supervised the proper discharge of those roles by exercising oversight, testing and questioning the proposals of the chief executive officer (Mr Daniels) and his team.  </p>

He was centrally involved in events, sometimes working long hours under high pressure. Unsurprisingly, sometimes events coalesced in his recollection. He was an extremely well prepared witness who engaged completely with the process of giving evidence (though he tired somewhat towards the end of his seven day crossexamination). I do not confuse confidence in delivery with accuracy of recollection: but I found that his answers provided an insightful, if on occasion defensive, narrative and an instructive commentary on the recorded events, demonstrating that the documents on their own did not present a wholly reliable picture. The very nature of his thorough cross-examination over those days meant that on many occasions he was not telling me what he recollected of events at the time, but in answering those challenges he was advancing arguments justifying positions that were taken at the time using material that was still available.  The process of rationalising decisions could not be separated from telling me what he remembered: and if he had purported to tell me that his evidence was based solely upon accurate recollection what was actually in his mind in the seconds after he saw (say) a figure in a briefing paper in October 2008 I would have found that hard to accept. When deciding whether to accept or reject particular points by assessing the coherence of the justification now advanced I have therefore had to bear in mind the very different circumstances in which I am making that assessment.  </p>

He had joined Lloyds in 2003 with a depth of experience in corporate banking (including work on the corporate side of investment banking). The wholesale bank at Lloyds included corporate business, the bank’s overseas retail business, and the bank’s day-to-day liquidity and funding requirements: and Mr Tate had oversight over the various teams which conducted the operations. He was therefore in tune with market conditions and able to assess potential funding difficulties. He was thoroughly cross-examined over three days, during which he gave some confident and clear passages of evidence. He was accused at one point of giving “totally unrealistic” answers: but I thought that the charge was unjustified, and that Mr Tate was an impressive witness who gave considered and nuanced answers and often made sensible acknowledgements and concessions.     </p>

She had joined Lloyds in April 2004 from Kingfisher plc (where she had been Group Finance Director): and in April 2008 had been appointed Lloyds Group Executive Director of UK Retail Banking Division. In consequence, given the stressed market conditions pertaining and the market events that were occurring during the course of 2008 her focus was upon Lloyds’ retail banking operations (in particular its retail loan portfolios and its deposit base): and her principal concern in any merger would have been to consider the integration of the Lloyds and HBOS retail businesses. So that was the nature of her participation in the negotiations. But she was a full board member, and subject to the obligations of that office.  In her position this meant that to the extent that she was not party to the more general aspects of the negotiations her obligation was to report to the full board accurately and frankly </p>

She was totally frank as to her inability to recall which documents went to which meeting and as to her inability (when presented with a document she had not seen for nine years) to explain figures in the witness box: the latter inability was occasioned to a significant degree by the fact that throughout her time in the witness box she was evidently tense and discomfited by the process. I thought her acknowledged limitations for the most part to be genuine, and not a stratagem to avoid difficult questions (save that I did not find her inability to remember much about the Northern Rock affair to be credible). </p>

His focus was naturally in that sphere of the bank’s business and, being based in Edinburgh, he sometimes participated in board meetings by telephone in the course of which he would make notes (some of which survived). These notes were not a verbatim record of what was said, nor were they intended to be a record of the meeting: they were simply matters which Mr Kane considered at that time to be worth jotting down as the discussion flowed. Some care must therefore be taken in interpreting the literal words on the page: having seen him, I felt that I could trust him fairly to assist me in that task. It is unsurprising that whilst he had a recollection of the general shape of events (such as the time pressure to do a deal rather than waiting for everything to fall apart) he no longer recalled much of the detail.

Dr Berndt joined the Lloyds’ board in March 2003 having previously held senior executive roles with Proctor and Gamble and being then a non-executive director of Cadbury Ltd and of GfK AG. Because of their roles as non-executive directors of Lloyds they retained a grasp of the strategy behind the Acquisition and the rationale for various of the decisions made, but they have a patchy recollection of matters of detail (even though each had sought to refresh his memory from a selection of contemporaneous documents). </p>

He had in 2008 been the Chief Executive of the Financial Services Agency, and at the centre of the maelstrom around the Lehman collapse. Before trial there was an issue about whether his state of health would permit him to attend trial for cross examination. An application was made on his behalf that his written evidence be accepted on a “hearsay” basis: one of the grounds of that application was that the relevant events occur occurred nine years ago, that Sir Hector’s recollection was not assisted by any contemporaneous notes of his own or any FSA records, that all he could reference were those documents exhibited to the witness statements of other parties, and he did not believe that he had any material recollection over and above the events they recorded. In the event Sir Hector attended the trial and was cross-examined in public on detailed matters. Shortly before he gave his evidence he served a supplemental witness statement, apparently addressing issues that had arisen during the cross-examination of other witnesses. This belied the evidence of his solicitors that Mr Sants was not thought to have any recollection above what was to be found in the documents: but having weighed it carefully at the time and scrutinised it on review I do not consider that this additional material was either fabricated or the product of suggestion, but rather that learning what others said had prompted remembrance.  </p>

But his CV revealed no main board experience with an enterprise of any size: he had never worked as an investment banker (and his role as an analyst would have kept him isolated from all investment banking and corporate advisory work i.e. from the decision making process).

His first report made a crucial error about what is called “the Core Tier 1 ratio” (which I expand upon later). Once the error had been pointed out, his second report corrected it: but it did not revisit the conclusions expressed in the first report to see whether the error affected the conclusions expressed: and he still had not done so when he gave oral evidence, although he did say that he did not believe that his error had affected his fundamental analysis.

He presented his critique with vigour, principally directed at quantum questions: but his evidence suffered from the limitation that he proceeded (so far as I could see) entirely on the premise that the Acquisition had never been announced (“the unaffected share price”), and upon the assumption that no market events of significance to Lloyds (other than the announcement of the Acquisition) had occurred since 17 September 2008. Thus it seemed to me that in his insistence that if the Acquisition had been abandoned the Lloyds share price would revert to the “undisturbed share price” he did not give sufficient weight to the fact that in the meantime the world had changed for Lloyds. </p>

He was not a satisfactory witness. As I shall explain, his methodology was very strange. But of equal significance was his reliability. According to the record of interviews, none of the interviewed journalists had been asked if they knew of a contemporaneous story that Lloyds had lent HBOS £10bn. Prof Schifferes said that each interviewee had been asked that question but it was simply not recorded, because none of them knew about it (even though one interviewee had himself written up the story). He was pressed with the oddity of this but repeatedly stood by his answer. When he returned after the short adjournment he told me that all of that part of the morning evidence had been wrong, and he provided an entirely unconvincing new explanation for the admitted omission to ask the question.

He addressed these questions from the standpoint of an experienced regulator who had been a director of the FSA (serving as director of Prudential Policy from April 2008- March 2013), and as such had been responsible for formulating the FSA guidance on capital adequacy, liquidity, stress-testing and risk management- though he had no role in the calculation of either the Lloyds or the HBOS capital requirements over the Recapitalisation Weekend. I found him to be a precise, accurate and authoritative witness, though I thought unduly defensive in his reluctance to accept the evident vulnerabilities of HBOS. He was careful to confine himself to considering whether the outcome of the FSA stress-test was plausible (in the context of ascertaining additional capital requirements for Lloyds), and not to attempt to build a model as a basis for the sum required (as to which there was insufficient material).

His personal involvement did not, he acknowledged, give him any better insight into those events than that of any other publishing analyst (whose reports I have in several volumes); but it did give him a sense of where the balance of views lay. It was instructive to compare the views which he published contemporaneously (in particular he did a “buy” note on 5 December 2008) with the terms of his report. He had a tendency in his evidence to keep repeating the content of that report: the more exotic the alternative assumptions being put to him in cross-examination the more difficult he found it to undertake instant analysis, and the more he resorted to repetition of the considered view expressed in his report.

He achieved a position of considerable eminence during and after the financial crisis. His evidence was clear, firm and analytical and well referenced. A key part of it was that emergency liquidity assistance is not dependent upon whether it is sector-wide or bilateral, covert or transparent; and that SLS was a “sub-set” of ELA so that both SLS and ELA were “lender of last resort” facilities (where the bank was providing liquidity which the market would not provide), ELA simply being a bridge to other support schemes. But it seemed to me that the question I would have to address would involve not only technical analysis but also market perception and common understanding. This constituted a limitation on the value of his evidence. </p>

There were 60 quarters of continuous expansion, a steady rise in property prices (the Halifax House Price Index rose 2.3 times between 2000 and 2007) and strong growth in financial services, all underpinned by stable inflation and low interest rates. In particular the banking sector grew both in nominal terms and also relative to the size of the UK economy as a whole. As the demand for loans (especially for property-based activities) outstripped the supply of retail deposits the banking sector turned increasingly to the wholesale money markets, offering those markets asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, holding such securities on their balance sheets, and using such holdings as collateral in repurchase lending (“repos”). In so doing the sector became highly exposed to commercial and residential property. There is little doubt that policymakers, banks and other market participants became increasingly confident about the assumed continuation of this new paradigm, and increasingly complacent in their assessment of risk.   </p>

But its retail base (depositors with Northern Rock) did not grow at the same pace as its loan book. So, it adopted a business model which was given the label “originate to distribute” (in contrast to the “originate to hold” model).  The loans which it made were not held to maturity (“originate to hold”), but were parcelled up and sold on (“distributed”) to investors who purchased bonds secured on the collateral of the relevant parcel of mortgages: a process called “securitisation”. The proceeds of the bond issue then became available to fund further loans (which themselves would then be securitised). This process provided about 50% of Northern Rock’s funding requirement: and another 25% was raised on the wholesale market on a short (&lt;1 year) or medium (1&gt; year) term basis. Retail deposits supplied most of the remaining funding requirement.  </p>

Accordingly, it sought to make “backstop” arrangements to address the contingency of illiquidity.

These movements were caused by unsubstantiated rumours that it had asked the Bank of England for emergency funding. The rumours were false. But they (and the reaction to them, even allowing for the influence of algorithmic trading strategies) evidence a perception in the market that HBOS had potential vulnerabilities. It had an above-average dependence on wholesale markets to provide short-term funding for a medium-term loan portfolio. That loan portfolio itself had a concentration on commercial property lending, on “self-certification” mortgages and on “buyto-let” mortgages: and the market could see that any increase in funding costs would squeeze the net interest margin. That perception led to an increase in the proportion of sell recommendations from analysts. The Claimants’ expert Mr Ellerton (relying on a report prepared by Citigroup Global Markets Limited (“Citi”) for Lloyds in October 2009) says that the percentage of HBOS “sell” recommendations amongst analysts surveyed rose from 32% in March to 42% in April, and then to 46% in May.  </p>

The swap was for a term of one year, renewable up to 3 years: and this was anticipated to give the markets time to recover or the funded bank time to diversify its asset base. There was a specified drawdown window: the first lasting until 21 October 2008 (though this was later extended until January 2009). This was to permit the securitisation of eligible <span style="font-style:italic">legacy</span> loans. A bank that availed itself of drawdown by swapping securitised assets for Treasury bills could then use such high-quality sovereign collateral either (i) as part of its regulatory liquidity buffer or (ii) for raising finance in the active repo markets. The reluctance of the wholesale markets to accept mortgage-backed securities was thereby overcome.  </p>

The use of the “swap” mechanism meant that the Bank was not obliged to report the transaction on its balance sheet (as would have been the case with a cash transaction). The Bank did not disclose individual uptake in any of its Reports or Bulletins, and it imposed upon participating banks strict confidentiality clauses preventing the giving of any indication whatsoever about any utilisation.

Foreign acquisitions proved unattractive because of the difficulty in generating synergies with Lloyd’s existing business. Domestic takeovers or mergers of entities with the right “fit” would likely be frustrated by competition issues. A potential merger with Abbey National plc in 2001 had foundered upon that very obstacle, following a reference to the Competition Commission.  Shortly after Sir Victor had become chairman in May 2006 he had an informal conversation with Mr Hornby of HBOS (instigated by the latter) which led to some very preliminary exploratory talks at a high level about the potential for a merger. In many respects a combination with HBOS was the most attractive goal for Lloyds: but the very reason that made it attractive also raised the most difficult competition questions. So these talks did not develop on account of the perceived competition obstacle. But the idea remained on the table. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The events of the first half of 2008 afforded a fresh opportunity to approach a takeover or merger between the two entities once again. Lloyds continued to see the desirability of non-organic growth by acquisition to enhance shareholder value. Whilst some shareholders valued the stolidity of Lloyds the Board was aware of pressure from other shareholders to grow the business (as the bank’s peers were doing). Some 200 possible targets were considered, and 20 shortlisted for potential further consideration. During June 2008 Lloyds actively investigated acquiring both Dresdner Bank and also Deutsche Postbank: but neither provided sufficient synergy benefits. On the otherhand Lloyds regarded the HBOS brands (Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Clerical Medical) and areas of market penetration (HBOS was overweight in areas where Lloyds was underweight) favourably. Noting that by July 2008 HBOS’s share price was on a downward trend and stood some 60% lower than at the beginning of the year Sir Victor asked Mr Daniels to approach Mr Hornby again. This chimed with an emerging view in the market, for Mr Daniels himself had been approached by a number of investment bankers (Mr Costa of Lazards amongst others from Rothschilds, UBS, Citi and Merrill Lynch) suggesting such a move. It resulted in some new high-level preliminary meetings during July, in which Mr Daniels, Ms Weir, Mr Tookey and Mr Tate took part, with each side agreeing to instruct their respective legal advisers to prepare a paper on how the competition issues might be addressed.  </p>

This was due to a significant degree to the fact that HBOS had the biggest non-institutional shareholder base in the UK, to whom the rights issue was unattractive.  So the issue was a “flop” and (after a placing of a further 29.53%) nearly two-thirds of the new shares were left with the underwriters, creating a huge market overhang. That day Sir Victor was sharing a flight back to the UK with the Prime Minister. During a discussion about the economy Sir Victor raised with Gordon Brown Lloyds' interest in acquiring HBOS but observed that such a deal would not realistically be viable if there was to be a reference to the competition authorities. In the then current climate no bank could have lived with 9 months’ uncertainty about its future. Gordon Brown said he would discuss the matter with colleagues in government.  </p>

Addressing this fall in profits Mr Hornby told analysts that it had been impacted by valuation adjustments and the first sign of increasing impairments largely as a result of asset price deflation in both residential and commercial property (and significant “write-downs” were taken in addition to some that had been disclosed at the time of the rights issue). But he said the underlying performance of the business “remained extremely robust”. </p>

Some saw the bank’s structured credit exposure and the large wholesale funding needs as generating serious risk and warranting an underweight position. Others thought that the then-current share price offered a compelling investment case with current and prospective risks already priced into the discount to book value and recommended an overweight position. One put a target price of 430p (as against the then current 290-300p). Some were neutral. For example Deutsche Bank analysts, looking at a current share price of 291p and estimating that to be 0.7x book value, considered the HBOS shares a “hold” and put a target price of 325p notwithstanding the deterioration in credit quality which they observed and the higher levels of default which they anticipated. </p>

Mr Pietruska himself had performed a similar role at ABN Amro before joining Lloyds: and in that capacity, he had looked at Lloyds itself as a potential takeover target, and had rejected it because of its limited opportunities for organic growth. It might therefore be thought that Mr Pietruska would be predisposed to favour exploiting the opportunity that was now presenting itself. But he characterised his approach as “naturally conservative” (by which he meant that his tendency was to seek first to identify the problems and see if they could be solved, rather than to jump at an opportunity): and when he drafted a presentation for the board (identifying HBOS as “Dover” and Lloyds as “Lion”) it was to the effect that, on the basis of what was currently known, a merger between HBOS and Lloyds should not be undertaken. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, Mr Pietruska’s core workings assumed an “all share” offer pricing the HBOS shares at approximately 295p. At that level he thought the transaction would be EPS dilutive until 2012, but noted that the return on investment (on the basis of consensus earnings) would be 13% by 2009 and 20% by 2012. He was concerned not so much with the immediate dilutive effect of the proposed transaction, but rather that any adverse reaction by analysts might provoke a decline in the Lloyds’ share price which itself might render the completion of any announced transaction impossible. He felt that if analysts understood that a capital raise of some sort was inevitable because of the “bancassurance” issue then market reaction to a dilutive deal might be moderated. (In relation to this concern Mr Pietruska was later to be assisted by Merrill Lynch whose view, in essence, was that the market would be more receptive than Mr Pietruska feared). The period for which a transaction is forecast to be “dilutive” and how the market might react to a transaction with an immediate dilutive effect were, I think, important insights. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Under the Basel Capital Accord published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2004 (“Basel II”) (and implemented by Lloyds and by HBOS from 1 January 2008) a bank was required to maintain a minimum capital requirement calculated as a proportion of its “risk weighted assets” (or “RWAs”). The “assets” in question were the loans which the bank had made. The “risk” in question was the “credit risk” (i.e. the risk of loss due to the failure of the borrower to meet its obligations). This credit risk for each borrower could either be assessed by an external ratings agency (such as Moody or Standard and Poor’s) (which was dubbed the “standardised” approach) or by the bank itself using internal models (which was dubbed the “Internal Ratings Based” or “IRB” approach). In general the standardised approach was more conservative than the IRB approach. The assessed risk was not fixed, but could vary over the life of each loan as available information emerged or the economic environment changed. The raw “weighting” was achieved by multiplying the amount of the loan by the risk-percentage. I describe this as the “raw” weighting because in addition to credit risk a bank had to assess its RWAs overall taking into account (a) “market risk” (the risk of loss due to a change in market prices such as interest rates, which risk could be assessed either on a standardised or an IRB approach) and (b) “operational risk” (the risk of loss resulting from inadequate internal process or systems or from external events). In this way the RWAs were calculated. </p>

Basel II divides capital into two categories. Tier 1 (which has the greater loss-absorbing capacity) is the primary capital and consists of issued and fully paid ordinary shares, perpetual noncumulative preference shares, perpetual subordinated debt, other innovative capital of a similar nature and disclosed reserves. All these types of capital are available to the bank for unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks and losses as soon as they appear, and they rank low in the waterfall on a winding-up. Within Tier 1 was a category of “Core Tier 1 capital” viz. that which displayed to the greatest extent the characteristics of permanency, absence of servicing costs and exposure to loss. In essence Core Tier 1 consists of permanent ordinary share capital and disclosed reserves, and excludes all non-perpetual subordinated debt. Tier 2 is the supplementary capital and consists of all other capital, revaluation and similar reserves and provisions (including other subordinated debt). Tier 1 and Tier 2 together constituted the “eligible capital”.  </p>

This additional tranche was called “Pillar 2”. Its objective was to provide additional resilience in response to stress testing Pillar 1. At the beginning of 2008 the FSA had required Lloyds to have a Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.4% and a Core tier 1 capital ratio of 2.2%. In mid-2008 the FSA used this process to communicate to all large UK retail banks that their expected Core Tier 1 ratio was to rise to 5%  (but the FSA had not explained in detail how that ratio was to be calculated). </p>

If the fair value of HBOS’s net assets were to be <span style="font-style:italic">more</span> than the price that Lloyds was to pay for them (so that Lloyds was getting something of a bargain) then that element of bargain was frequently called “negative goodwill”. But because vendors do not generally sell assets at below the price upon which knowledgeable parties dealing at arm’s length would agree, before booking “negative goodwill” the fair value of the assets in question must be scrutinised and reassessed.

But his provisional view (as an experienced corporate strategist and not as an accountant who would actually apply the standards to given facts) was that the prospect of capturing all of any “negative goodwill” was remote. So he built a scenario in which if Lloyds acquired HBOS at below book value it was assumed that only half of any negative goodwill would be captured (by which he meant that the “negative goodwill” would be half of the postulated maximum, all of which reduced “negative goodwill” would be captured). </p>

The report is clearly a draft: and it proceeded on the assumption (never a reality) that Lloyds would pay £14.75bn for HBOS. The evidence does not establish how widely the draft was shared. Mr Tookey and Mr Tate acknowledge seeing it at some point: Mr Daniels denied doing so. But in my view the very broad issues identified by Mr Pietruska  (if not the detail or his underlying argument) are likely to have been known to the small team undertaking discussions with their HBOS opposite numbers as they prepared for their meetings. But two qualifications are needed. First, those undertaking the discussions would equally have known of the general views of others as to the opportunities and obstacles that might present themselves: Mr Pietruska’s was not the only voice in the room. Second, Mr Pietruska’s draft addressed one aspect of the transaction: he himself knew that there were many other aspects – from valuation methodologies to the potential impact of PPI to the market shares of the combined entities to the shape of the future business model - which he had summarised in an email copied to the core team on 6 August 2008 (to which I have already made reference). </p>

Mr Tookey as part of his routine work prepared a survey of “Current Capital Considerations” in preparation for a meeting with Mr Daniels on 21 August 2008, reviewing whether the Lloyds’ capital position was adequate up to the year end and in the medium term irrespective of any potential acquisition. He noted that the market expected a Core Tier 1 target of 6%, and that the group needed to be confident that it could deliver that ratio at the year-end during a deteriorating economic environment in which there might be reduced business volumes and increased impairments (and also following any capital adjustments arising out of the impending “bancassurance” insurance consolidation rules). He identified Lloyds’ high dividend policy as a potential obstacle to repairing the balance sheet, and posited a “significant cut” in the dividend and a programme of disposals as potential solutions.

This noted amongst other things some confusion in the market perception of Lloyds’ capital position. Lloyds had generally appeared better capitalised than its peers. In its half-year figures as at 30 June 2008 Lloyds had reported its Core Tier 1 capital ratio as standing at 6.2%: this was above what the FSA required, but now placed Lloyds firmly “in the pack”. I note this because it further demonstrates that capital ratios were constantly under review, and as an illustration of the facts that (although Lloyds did not at that time have a formal internal Core Tier 1 target ratio) the market expectation was that it should be about 6%, and that Lloyds was concerned to manage and address that expectation: this reflected the work Mr Tookey had undertaken in preparation for his meeting with Mr Daniels in the latter part of August. </p>

Those attending for Lloyds were Mr Tookey, Mr Tate, Mr Daniels and Ms Weir. They and their trusted lieutenants had also prepared lists of questions to be put to their opposite numbers. The enquiries were based on publicly available information about HBOS: those attending knew that the amount of non-publicly available information which a competitor bank like HBOS was prepared to disclose about its business and affairs might well be limited. During this meeting Mr Hornby of HBOS shared with Mr Daniels the thought that any deal between Lloyds and HBOS would have to be done “within weeks”.

The former event was hugely disruptive across the globe because it brought home that perhaps there were no institutions that were “too big to fail”, and that it could not be assumed that governments would always provide a “bail-out”. The “Daily Telegraph” described it as “another heart attack for the money markets incapacitating them for who knows how long this time”: and it is right to note that the true extent of the disruption and its aftershocks was not to become apparent for many, many months. The instant reaction was that the wholesale funding markets virtually closed as each market participant viewed each other market participant with deepening suspicion. Term loans would continue relentlessly to mature: but they would only be replaced in the market with “overnight” money that required daily refinancing. Banks, such as HBOS, that were heavily reliant upon the wholesale markets could see </p>

Conscious of this, the Federal Reserve immediately enlarged the range of collateral it would accept within its funding programme bid and provided a massive injection of liquidity. The BoE immediately injected £5bn into the system to provide liquidity and on 17 September 2008 announced an extension of the SLS scheme from its intended close on 21 October 2008 to January 2009 (a remarkable reversal of the position it had adopted when giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee only days before). The market reacted by marking down HBOS shares by 36% at one point, wiping £5bn off its value: though the shares recovered to end the day at 232.5p (down 18% in a market that had declined 4% overall).  </p>

First, there were discussions with the FSA and with the Bank of England as part of an attempt by Lloyds to obtain assurances from the Tripartite that they would provide funding support for HBOS until the completion of any takeover, and for the enlarged group following completion. Discussions were led by Mr Tate (as the Group Executive Director, Wholesale and International Bank since August 2004). He met with Mr Sants (CEO of the FSA) who expressed support for a merger: and he met with Mr Bailey of the BoE (who indicated that HBOS and the enlarged group would have access to Bank-sourced liquidity, but without providing any details of exactly how). The liquidity issue was to that extent covered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, Mr Tate created a small team under the leadership of Mr Ian Firth (Managing Director, Treasury and Financial Markets Trading Division) specifically to address funding issues. This small team would engage with the HBOS team, using both publicly available information and Lloyds’ own insights into HBOS’s assets and funding requirements (derived from (i) syndicated loans in which both HBOS and Lloyds participated (ii) propositions which Lloyds had rejected but HBOS had accepted (iii) competitive bids in which Lloyds had lost out to HBOS, and (iv) positions which Lloyds had decided to sell and HBOS had bought). This material would provide a basis for interrogating the HBOS liquidity needs prior to any acquisition and thereafter, and for seeking the provision of such further information as HBOS (as a continuing competitor bank) was prepared to disclose. HBOS was much the larger of the two institutions and its funding needs exceeded £680 billion (as against the £370 billion required by Lloyds). This team began work on 16 September 2008. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Amongst Mr Firth’s early thoughts on HBOS was the question of funding after an acquisition. He pointed out that funding counterparties generally (in order not to exceed their own internal limits of lending to individual institutions) would probably mark a lower limit for a combined entity than the sum of the limits marked for separate entities. This, he thought, might present Lloyds with a difficulty: but, on the other hand, he thought that new management might well improve the market’s perception of the combined bank above its current perception of HBOS as excessively dependent on the short-term market and as an entity in which the market had lost confidence. The funding issue was thus identified. </p>

But Mr Hill QC did suggest to various of Lloyds’ witnesses that the views of Mr Greenburgh should have been discounted by competent directors because they were the views of an investment banker, and investment bankers are only paid (and are handsomely paid) if transactions proceed: so “He would give that advice, wouldn’t he?”. Of course Mr Greenburgh was not “independent” in the sense that there was absolutely no overlap of interests. But that does not necessarily mean that professional objectivity was absent. Barristers seem to have no difficulty in viewing the advice they tender on the merits of a case as “objective” even though they will only earn fees if the case proceeds. Whilst the ethical training of investment bankers before the credit crunch may not have been nearly as rigorous as that of the Bar it is altogether too cynical to regard investment bankers as being so devoid of integrity as to warrant a discounting of their views. Investment bankers also have personal and corporate reputations to protect. Indeed a board that did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> seriously consider the advice of an investment banker on a significant takeover (given that it would be required under the Listing Rules to appoint a sponsor in relation to the ensuing circular) would almost certainly be negligent.

The evidence does not establish that these revised assumptions were imprudent. The postponement of the “bancassurance” capital adjustments was emerging as a possibility. Preliminary work had been undertaken on synergies. As I have noted, it came to be realised that HBOS had already taken some “writedowns” in its interim statement. </p>

If the merger does go through without any government money (and this is conjecture – the merger stories are still only stories) this may actually be a positive sign that the market can behave as it is supposed i.e. if a bank gets into trouble it is taken over by a stronger bank. The problem will be if Lloyds walks away or has to be offered tens of billions of pounds of public support to do it (Northern Rock was tiny in comparison to HBOS).

No case was run that Lloyds shareholders have lost out because they could have obtained HBOS more cheaply. Their whole case has been that HBOS should not have been acquired at all because it was valueless. Rather, the settlement of the price was used (i) as an illustration of a suggested approach that the Board was simply determined to acquire HBOS irrespective of the price required and equally irrespective of the risks involved; and (ii) to a lesser extent as a magnifier of economic risk in the transaction (because of its impact on EPS and capital).

The level of premium remained to be examined. The extent of any premium will in part reflect the strength of the desire of the predator to acquire the target (including offering a price that will discourage interlopers): and in part will reflect the strength of the target board’s view that the market is fundamentally undervaluing its business. Mr Daniels proposed (and stuck to) 232p per HBOS share. In terms of asset value HBOS was much the bigger bank: but its market capitalisation was about half that of Lloyds. So, even at the premium proposed and eventually negotiated, Lloyds was acquiring the HBOS business at a significant discount to book value (giving considerable margin for impairments and write-downs). It is unsurprising that HBOS should seek a significant premium over the highly volatile daily spot price before agreeing to a transaction that could be recommended to <span style="font-style:italic">its</span> shareholders: but it is equally unsurprising that Mr Daniels should be unwilling to agree to pay the 275p per share which HBOS sought (given that pricing at that level was rejected by HBOS shareholders themselves in the failed rights issue). Nor is it surprising that the view might be taken that a reference point for the “undisturbed” share price was an averaged price prior to the Lehman’s collapse (and the speculation which it generated), as to which both the pre-crisis market price of around 285p and analysts’ target prices following the release of HBOS’ half year figures  provide an indicator.  </p>

But I think all that can be fairly said (viewing matters <span style="font-style:italic">as at the time of the meeting</span>) is that if Lloyds had not made an offer within the timeframe indicated by the Government then it was known that the Government would have had to consider “alternatives”. Those alternatives might have included an approach to another suitor: Lloyds was one of two banks that the Tripartite might have approached. They might have included a break-up. They might have included the taking of a majority stake or some other form of nationalisation (but not necessarily one that wiped out the entire equity value of HBOS). But even if nationalisation on “wipeout” terms was a real possibility it is clear that Lloyds was not seeking to compete with others to salvage planks from the wreckage of HBOS. Lloyds wanted the entire ship, even if it was storm tossed and veering towards the rocks, because Lloyds thought the ship could be saved and, with somebody fresh at the helm, could be brought to a safe harbour as a great prize.  </p>

Mr Pietruska in his evidence expressed the view that the due diligence prior to the announcement was satisfactory and was comparable to pre-announcement due diligence that had occurred in other transactions in which he had been involved (in particular referencing the sale of La Salle Bank to Bank of America for $21 billion where the due diligence had been undertaken in 36 hours for a transaction completing two days later). </p>

Whilst I accept this evidence, in my judgment one has to be careful not to overstate the weight that can properly be attributed to these features when weighed in the scale with hard numbers. As to the disadvantages (in particular arising from the HBOS exposure to the commercial property market) Sir Victor considered those to be manageable in the economic climate as it was anticipated at the time.

Sir Victor’s answer to these charges was that the acquisition proceeded (as do all acquisitions) on the basis of published information, information that was published to a regulated standard: on the basis of that the board had identified areas of concern (including impairments and the risks to capital noted in the Board Minute) which, at that stage, did not appear to be “highly troubling”.

She was supported in her view by a small team led by Mr Kenyon, a senior member of the retail banking team, which assessed the specific retail synergies and benefits of a merger. In addition, over the days preceding 17 September 2008 due diligence work had been undertaken by Mr Dale, the Head of Risk in the retail banking team, aimed at assessing HBOS’ mortgage asset quality (in order to determine the potential risks involved in acquiring the retail bank). It was this that informed Ms Weir’s comment to the board that there was a risk of rising impairments which could consume more capital. (It is fair to point out that Lloyds itself was facing the same risk in relation to its business, though the degree of risk was different because of the difference in the nature and quality of the HBOS mortgage book).

He was therefore supportive of a merger proposal, but aware of the risk that HBOS’s assets were concentrated in areas that were more likely to be exposed to and affected by any economic downturn. On 17 September 2008 he had met with his counterpart at HBOS to discuss with her at a high level the key issues in HBOS insurance and investment business; and in particular to satisfy himself that the merger presented an opportunity to create value. Whilst lacking exact recall of what those discussions produced, Mr Kane was confident “that no red flags had been raised”. His cross-examination did not undermine the strength of his evidence: it did not suggest that there was anything of concern in the insurance and investment business.

But he correctly identified the real question for the board at that stage as being whether the transaction stacked up at the price that <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> been agreed: so he confined his observations to informing the board that concerns about the price would have to be managed. Secondly, he was cross-examined as to the adequacy of the explanation to this meeting of the due diligence exercise and its outcome. I find that it is likely that he explained to the meeting in outline the process than had been undertaken, communicated his view that it was satisfactory for the purpose of considering whether to announce an acquisition, but warned that further work would need to be undertaken. I find that it is likely that impairments were discussed, that Mr Pietruska is likely to have contributed to that discussion, and that he would have conveyed the view that some further impairments were likely to be required but that they were of a manageable magnitude (even if above the levels discussed at the previous board meeting earlier on 17 September 2008).

He thought there was a steep discount to book value which would cover all sorts of potential write-downs and impairments. In crossexamination he acknowledged that at the second board meeting of 17 September 2008 there had been no quantification of impairments, nor had there been any updated analysis which looked again at the underlying economics in the light of the emerging due diligence information: but he stressed that all of this was a work in progress, and underlined his recommendation that more work was required. </p>

But even he commented upon future funding issues (notwithstanding that HBOS had in fact managed to fund itself satisfactorily up to that point, as the FSA had confirmed to the market): and he gave free rein to others to express their own cautionary views. Neither Mr Daniels nor any other member of the executive team presented the opportunity as risk-free or as involving negligible risk. It is clear that this experienced board knew that advocacy of the deal was Mr Daniels’ role and that testing his proposition and considering the support for it was their role. </p>

The Claimants have characterised this as “the Government putting pressure on the Lloyds board to acquire HBOS” and in an eye-catching phrase in opening described the Lloyds shareholders as having been “mugged”.

It was prepared to invite market participants to assess opportunities. It was prepared to lend every assistance to a market participant who wished to exploit an opportunity. That was what Lloyds had done. Government assistance (in smoothing away competition obstacles or in giving comfort as to available funding) enabled Lloyds to do what it otherwise could not have done (and had conspicuously failed to do over the preceding 5 years and more), namely, expand through inorganic growth. But both the Government and Lloyds knew in mid-September 2008 that their influence in a panicky global market was limited, and potential movements in the equity and debt markets imposed severe time constraints. The Lloyds board knew that it had to operate within those limitations, and that this might entail taking decisions on available information and within a timeframe that was less than optimal. In my judgment that is not succumbing to pressure. The Lloyds board did what it thought best for its shareholders; not what the Government wanted even though the Lloyds board did not think it for the best. It bears, and has throughout this case acknowledged, that responsibility.</p>

The Announcement said that the boards believed that the Acquisition presented a compelling business combination offering substantial benefits to shareholders and to customers. It recited that the board of Lloyds had received financial advice from Merrill Lynch (though the body of the Announcement made clear that that financial advice had itself incorporated the commercial assessment of the Lloyds board) and considered the Acquisition to be in the best interests of Lloyds shareholders. At the same time Lloyds and HBOS entered into an implementation agreement in which they undertook to use reasonable endeavours to implement the Acquisition. Mr Daniels was at pains to tell the market that the merger had been struck on commercial terms and was not merely a government-brokered rescue of HBOS. So was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling when denying in a Radio 4 interview that day that he had “pushed” Lloyds into the Acquisition whilst acknowledging that he had “helped in every possible way”. Whilst some might be cynical about such statements, they are in my view an accurate summary of the respective objectives.  </p>

Mr Daniels commented upon the robustness of the capital position, upon the strength of the liquidity position and upon the ability of the combined entity to access wholesale markets (where the strength of Lloyds rating would assist). He expressed the opinion that the transaction would be EPS accretive from mid-2011. Mr Tookey told the meeting that he anticipated being within the target Core Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 to 7% during 2010.

The questioner commented that the merger had not “changed the fundamental underlying dynamics of the funding market” i.e. that the combined entity would still have to address the problems that troubled HBOS. The message received in the room was that HBOS’s funding pressures meant that it had no other real option than to be acquired by Lloyds. That was the evidence of Mr Mike Trippitt, one </p>

I have already drawn attention to its extension on 17 September 2008 of SLS as a mainstream source of funding: a total of £185bn was to be drawn by banks under this scheme. On 18 September 2008 BoE took part in coordinated global measures to relieve pressures in the US dollar funding markets by embarking upon direct US dollar repo operations (i.e. itself providing dollar funding to UK banks against eligible collateral) backed by a reciprocal swap arranged with the Federal Reserve. The terms of the US dollar repos were individually settled under a variable rate auction process.  Initially this provided overnight money (because, as a later review by the Bank of England was to record, at this stage money was not being distributed between banks even in the overnight market). Within days the facility was enlarged and was expanded to offer one-week money. Days later the classes of eligible collateral were widened.  The enlargement of the classes of eligible collateral was applied also to the Bank’s existing Extended Collateral Long Term Repo scheme. The Bank consulted on further extending the range of collateral acceptable in its money market operations, and also upon accepting pledges against asset pools of highly rated corporate loans in unsecuritised form. In short, the Bank was taking unprecedented steps to support the market. It was assuming the role of a mainstream provider of liquidity (operating in effect an alternative wholesale market) and beginning radically to alter the role of a central bank. </p>

On 18 September 2008 HBOS approached Lloyds seeking additional access to Lloyds’ interbank overnight funding facility. Lloyds agreed to increase the existing unsecured overnight lending facility to HBOS by £1.5 billion to more than £3.0 billion.  (To put this in context, according to Mr Short Lloyds itself took up to £35bn from the overnight markets, and had drawings on the overnight market supplied by other banks and central banks of over £12bn on 25 September 2008). A “roll-over” of the HBOS overnight facility was reviewed each day through a process  which involved Mr Firth (Managing Director of Trading within Lloyds Corporate Markets) liaising with his counterpart at HBOS, and then submitting the proposed transaction for approval by Mr Cumming (Senior Sanctioning Director), Ms Sergeant (Chief Risk Officer) and Mr Tate. On 19 September 2008 Mr Tate had sought from the FSA approval for the way that Lloyds and HBOS intended to communicate, plan and execute the management of their respective funding positions, and was told (though the FSA declined to record it in writing) that the FSA heartily encouraged such exchanges. </p>

In tight wholesale markets it is entirely understandable that HBOS should look to its intended acquirer as the market participant most likely to look favourably upon a proposed transaction: and the more understandable given that the Announcement itself had had the effect of cutting HBOS’ credit lines as funders began to look at their exposure to the enlarged entity (rather than to each of its component parts). Recognising this reality, the FSA supported and encouraged Lloyds to take an engaged role in the joint management of the funding issues. In relation to any such proposal for a secured term facility the Lloyds executive team and board might, as regards the interests of the company, be expected to have in mind both commercial and strategic considerations: but they would need to have clearly in view possibility that the Acquisition might not proceed. </p>

This further deflated earnings and therefore the share price which then began to make depositors nervous – so they started withdrawing funds, and the  £1 deposits became 80p, and the cost of borrowing the extra new 90p (original 70p plus new 20p) rose from 5½% to 9%. This happened not in the space of years, months or weeks but in days, if not hours. So the crisis became tangible. Confidence had gone, and the banks would not lend to each other, let alone us.

They were not, of course, bound to agree with the views expressed: but they were cognizant of unusual features of the proposal. The transaction immediately agreed (the first part of the Lloyd’s Repo) was for an advance (in repo form) of £2.4bn secured by Euro- and US-dollar denominated  marketable securities valued at £2.8bn  and at a margin of 20bps over one-month LIBOR. (The securities, although marketable, were not eligible collateral under the SLS because of the currency denomination, nor were they eligible collateral under similar schemes operated by the European Central Bank or the Federal Reserve). In the view of Mr Firth at the time this was “in the range of pricing seen elsewhere on other similar style deals”, though he acknowledged that his approach had been “to lend in as commercially prudent a manner as possible, not to savage [HBOS] on pricing” in circumstances where there was no directly comparable benchmark.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">I find that the £2.4bn first tranche of the Lloyds’ Repo itself was a repurchase transaction done on commercial terms that met Mr Firth’s profile. A bank is not required to “savage” a counterparty (whether that counterparty is another bank or a retail customer) on pricing: and the fact that it does not do so does not render a deal uncommercial. The nature of the collateral was unusual (not being eligible for repo at certain sources), but the transaction resembled a repo in that the £2.4bn was made available against securitised assets that were themselves capable of being repo’ed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">I hold that the first tranche of the Lloyds Repo was a transaction in the ordinary course of business. It was business conducted on ordinary commercial terms. I have noted above that it was commercial business which also had a strategic objective: enabling HBOS to survive in a form in which Lloyds could acquire it and thereby generate value for Lloyds’ shareholders. So its context was certainly unusual (Mr Tate thought it “unique” and acknowledged that in ordinary and normal markets Lloyds would not ordinarily execute such a transaction).  But many loan transactions will have unique features which require adjustment to a standard lending template: that of itself does not take the transaction outside the “ordinary course of business” provided that the eventual transaction is on proper commercial terms. In the instant case it cannot be said that the £2.4bn interbank loan was commercial business that would, in the then-state of the market, have been declined but for the desire to achieve the strategic objective. The Claimant’s expert Mr Benkert approached the Lloyds Repo on the footing that the first tranche was a “business as usual” conventional repo of marketable securities: and in his evidence the Claimants’ expert Mr Ellerton described it as “a £2.4 billion repo facility secured conventionally on securities”. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Lloyds would not have entered into such a conventional transaction in the ordinary course of business. </p>

To that end HBOS and its advisers were preparing a funding plan to show the Bank, embodying an assumed £10bn facility from Lloyds, and making certain assumptions about the ability of HBOS to access the SLS using different collateral from that within the then-current restricted range: but it is apparent from the surviving notes of the contemporary conversations that there was sensitivity about the market knowing of any approach by HBOS to the Bank for support outside the standing facilities and SLS as it then existed, lest this reignite an outflow of corporate and consumer deposits.  </p>

In outline, the HBOS plan proposed to the Bank an industry-wide solution to the severe difficulties being experienced by all banks (by pumping in extra liquidity and by extending the classes of eligible collateral under the SLS scheme); and in the alternative, it suggested that (i) Lloyds would create a deal-specific facility of £10bn for HBOS (the Lloyds Repo had not at this stage been agreed) whose term would be defined by the closing of the deal; (ii) the Bank would make an additional £25bn available to HBOS under the SLS scheme; and (iii) the Treasury would make available a back-up facility of up to £60bn to be drawn upon if necessary. The first proposal, of an industry-wide solution, was prescient (in that the BoE was in the course of implementing those very measures): the alternative proposal was not taken up by the Bank, though the seed of the idea that Lloyds should provide a specific facility in addition to normal liquidity facilities and that the Tripartite should help Lloyds to get to a successful completion of the Acquisition (because in doing so it would aid financial stability) was sown. </p>

What HBOS could now offer by way of collateral was not some marketable asset-backed security but the benefit of part of its loan book (“raw loans” as they were called in argument). This was a type of security that was being considered by the Bank as acceptable. The benefit of the raw loans could be given to Lloyds by way of assignment by way of mortgage: this would have the disadvantage both that Lloyds would itself have to manage the loan book and that the assignment by way of mortgage would have to be registered (putting the arrangements into the public domain) or would otherwise become void. So HBOS proposed a trust structure under which legal title to the raw  loans would remain with HBOS, but HBOS would declare that the benefit of the loans was held upon trust for Lloyds under a repo arrangement as security for the proposed facility. Such an arrangement could be kept confidential. </p>

Lloyds was a listed company. The Listing Rules required it to observe the principle that it must “act with integrity toward holders and potential holders of its listed equity securities”. As an aspect of that, Chapter 10 of the Listing Rules sets out circumstances in which shareholders have to be notified of transactions to be entered into by a listed company which may change the shareholders’ economic interest in the company. Sometimes the shareholders have to be notified and their approval sought (“Class 1”). Sometimes they simply have to be notified (“Class 2”).   But the transaction will not be a notifiable transaction within Class 1 if it is of “a revenue nature [made] in the ordinary course of business”. So the practical point being made by Linklaters was that if the second tranche of the Lloyds Repo was a Class 1 transaction it could not be entered into unconditionally without shareholder approval: and since that approval would take at least four weeks to obtain (requiring the preparation of a circular and the convening of a meeting) if the second tranche of the Lloyds repo was urgent then the transaction could not be entertained. </p>

On 26 September 2008 the Lloyds team set about mitigating the risks to which Linklaters had referred. Instead of being a single transaction the facility was structured as a line of credit that could be drawn down in tranches each of which had, at the time of drawing, to satisfy the Lloyds risk criteria. There was a review by a team of 25 credit analysts and 2 senior sanctioners of each of the raw loans underlying the collateral that was offered for the initial tranche.

The term of each advance was limited to 14 days (not the 6 months sought by HBOS) with no commitment to “rollover”: that period was selected so that if Lloyds decided not to renew and if HBOS defaulted on repayment then Lloyds could register its interest as a registrable charge within the 21 days limited for so doing (thereby protecting itself against the risk of that categorisation of the transaction prevailing in an insolvency). Although legal title remained with HBOS, Lloyds was granted a power of attorney enabling it to take specified actions in the event of default. Amongst these was the ability to establish the default market value of the security by selling the underlying loans (though this could not overcome any illiquidity problem). As so structured this was clearly not an “off the shelf” repo transaction: and Mr Parr of Linklaters thought the structure “not great from Lloyds’ perspective”. </p>

From Mr Kane’s notes Mr Daniels seems to have linked this tightening to an analysis of liquidity, capital and impairments. HBOS had suffered an outflow of deposits (losing about £17 bn in 10 days).

But in his oral evidence in chief he explained that these notes occurred in a section dealing with (i) the collapse of Bradford &amp; Bingley disclosed in a telephone conversation with Shriti Vadera (the Minister for Business) that morning, and (ii) with a potential bid by HBOS for some Bradford &amp; Bingley assets.

Mr Kane’s surrounding notes indicate that the board was being told that HBOS was being encouraged by the Tripartite to bid for this Bradford &amp; Bingley branch network (probably because the resulting inflow of customer deposits would have eased HBOS’ own difficulties). The board minutes crisply record that Mr Daniels “briefed the board on HBOS’s possible participation in this arrangement”. So I think the “transaction” in respect of which it was possible HBOS would be granted an especial credit line was its bid for the Bradford &amp; Bingley branch network (not its acquisition by Lloyds). I find that at this board meeting there was probably no discussion relating to the grant of emergency assistance to HBOS in relation to its general funding difficulties in order to preserve it for acquisition by Lloyds: on the other hand there is no doubt that the board was aware that it was anticipated that the BoE would provide, in some form, supportive funding to HBOS to enable it to maintain its position in the market. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Whether the Lloyds Repo was a Class 1 transaction was a difficult question, the answer to which was fundamental to the whole transaction: if it fell within Class 1 , the transaction could not in practice proceed, and nor could the Acquisition. Under the Listing Rules (in particular Listing Rule 8.3.3) a sponsor to the Acquisition (such as Merrill Lynch) owed a regulatory duty  (reflecting in this instance also a legal duty) to exercise due skill and care in giving advice to a client about the interpretation of the Listing Rules. A sponsor would not want to be responsible for getting advice or guidance wrong: there would be every incentive to “lay off” that risk by obtaining a watertight UKLA approval. There would be no incentive to conceal material information from a regulatory authority (particularly one that formed part of a regime that was generally supportive of the transaction and of the Acquisition) if that might produce a challengeable approval. There would be every incentive to tell a generally supportive regulatory authority whatever it said it needed to know before it commented on the guidance that the sponsor intended to give.   So the probability is that the UKLA was given as much information as it sought from Lloyds’ advisers about the transaction before commenting upon it (which did not descend to the minutiae of the transaction, or the “detail” of the unusual features): so it was not misled as to the circumstances, and so far as the evidence shows the UKLA has never suggested that its categorisation of the Lloyds Repo was given on a mistaken basis. I am glad to reach this conclusion, because I would have been very reluctant to make an implicit finding of deception against a professional man like Mr Ross in his absence and based solely upon inference drawn from the terms of a document he did not write.  </p>

They of course underpinned the conclusions (i) that the Lloyds Repo did not fall within Class1 and so (ii) did not require shareholder approval and so (iii) could proceed within a transactional timetable that would enable HBOS to securely fund its operations in the immediate future and so (iv) thereby enable HBOS to remain a worthwhile acquisition target without overt Government intervention. Furthermore, the arrangement afforded the possibility that HBOS might continue in that state (so long as it could continue to offer acceptable collateral). These were very highly desirable conclusions - both for Lloyds and for the Tripartite. So I can understand why Mr Hill QC should suggest to some of the Defendants’ witnesses that the participants were “straining” to reach those conclusions (a charge they denied). But the issue is not whether they were conclusions which it was easy to reach, but whether the conclusions ultimately reached were honestly held and tenable by competent executives and competent board members. </p>

That market knew that HBOS had no independent future; so for how much longer such funding would remain available was very uncertain. The very request being made of Lloyds by HBOS already evidenced the diminishing availability of other market funds. It was to cope with that decline (and to avoid the systemic threat posed by a disorderly collapse) that the Tripartite was embarking on supportive measures to facilitate the Acquisition. The second tranche of the Lloyds Repo had a function as a bridge to that secure funding. But it was not a loan made to “bail out” HBOS having no commercial or strategic benefit for Lloyds. </p>

In relation to the mortgage book the team applied Lloyds’ own methodologies to the £170bn prime book and to the £65bn buyto-let, self-certified and sub-prime book. In respect of the corporate book it adopted a sampling technique (and in this was assisted by the fact that HBOS had to provide ready access to all of those corporate loans that were being offered as security under the Lloyds Repo): about £30bn out of a total book of £120bn was sampled and the results extrapolated and discussed with the HBOS team. Further work could not be undertaken because of client and commercial confidentiality. In relation to the retail book of consumer loans and overdrafts (current and historic) the work showed that HBOS was performing better than Lloyds itself. In respect of treasury assets, the Lloyds team was provided with detailed asset level data and it reviewed prices on a statistically significant sample of 50% by value. In relation to the international portfolios there was a review of the management information and a series of discussions with local managers to discuss major exposures: this was the limit of what was possible having regard to client and commercial confidentiality.  In relation to private equity the team was able to undertake a high-level review of the portfolio and brief reviews of the top six investments (which constituted 54% by value). Again further work was not possible because of client and commercial confidentiality: nor was it considered necessary because the Lloyds team assumed that most of that value would be written off. Work of the same nature was carried out on the joint venture portfolio, concentrating on the most significant packages and all those where Lloyds had its own insight into the joint venture and could therefore compare its work with that undertaken by HBOS. </p>

Initially HBOS was not cooperative in the disclosure process and it took until about 6 October 2008 before real progress could be made. The process was also affected by the global disintegration that occurred in the latter part of September 2008. Thus when the Lloyds board met on the 28 September 2008 it expressed its concern to ensure that any adverse developments in HBOS should not impact adversely on Lloyds’ existing business or its shareholders, and decided that further consideration needed to be given to both capital and funding issues in the light of the outcome of the financial due diligence that was then current. This was, I consider, an appropriately cautious approach. </p>

This material had indicated that HBOS’s risk appetite was far greater than that of Lloyds; that there was a very large real estate exposure; that the principal joint ventures were the residential construction, hotel and real estate investment fields (including to customers to whom Lloyds itself also lent); it had disclosed the private equity position; and it had suggested incremental fair value adjustments and additional impairments of some £3bn.

Mr Taylor’s individual view was communicated to Mr Pietruska (on whom the board called for advice) and it no doubt was considered by him and informed the advice that Mr Pietruska gave to the extent he thought right.

In addition, they reported on the fair value adjustments  required to treasury assets (such as asset-backed securities, the “AltA” securitised loans, senior bank paper etc) in the last quarter of 2008 (but not for 2009, such a forecast being regarded as too speculative to be of value).

He had also indicated that the enlarged group would be likewise supported. (It was this that lay behind Mr Tate’s comment, noted above, concerning the circumstances in which advances under the second tranche of the Lloyds Repo might be made). So when Lloyds was considering whether to enter the Lloyds Repo Mr Tate prepared in consultation with his counterpart at HBOS a joint funding proposal. Mr Parr said (and I accept) that it was probable that during the course of these discussions the HBOS team indicated the great funding difficulties which HBOS faced, and their understanding as to the potential availability of additional central bank funding should such be necessary. </p>

In outline, it suggested an industry-wide solution to the severe difficulties being experienced by all banks (by pumping in extra liquidity and by extending the classes of eligible collateral under the SLS scheme); and in the alternative,  it suggested that (i) Lloyds would create a “deal specific” facility of £10 bn for HBOS (the Lloyds Repo having not at this stage been agreed) (ii) the Bank should make an additional £25bn available to HBOS under the SLS scheme, and (iii) the Treasury should make available a facility of up to £60bn to be drawn upon if necessary. The first proposal was prescient (in that the BoE was in the course of implementing those measures and duly did so): the alternative proposal was not taken up, but the idea of the provision by the Treasury or the Bank of a special facility to assist in the Acquisition (in fulfilment of the indications given by Mr Bailey) was clearly put on the table.  </p>

The collateral offered by HBOS was a pool of mortgages that were already in the process of being securitised. The Bank was, in fact, prepared to consider lending against a much wider range of assets, but in the event HBOS was able to offer a total of four mortgage pools which afforded access to sufficient liquidity for its purposes. It was the nature of the collateral offered and of security interest taken (an interest under a trust of the mortgage pool) that took this lending outside the parameters of the SLS. Unsecuritised loans were not eligible in any of the bank’s market wide operations - though securitised loans of similar quality were. (Indeed, 70% of the ELA collateral was eventually securitised and accepted into either the SLS or the Long Term Repo scheme). The mechanism of the facility (and the repo documentation itself) mirrored SLS, and the transaction followed a familiar procedure. The collateral was valued and the “haircut” assessed in the same manner as in the Bank’s conventional market operations: the “haircut” averaged 48%, but varied with the quality of the underlying loans. (In the event, none of the collateral was ever realised because the ELA was repaid in full). The facility itself was for the term of one month, but each swap within it had a 14 day maturity, with the repo being renewable. The facility was therefore temporary and gave the Bank regular opportunities to review the necessity for and the scale and terms of it. At its largest the facility amounted to £25.4bn (about 4% of HBOS’ funding requirement). </p>

Neither the initial grant of ELA to HBOS nor its periodic extension was detected by the market or the press. As the Plenderleith Report observed, since the structure of the ELA was very similar to the structure of SLS, the provision of additional Treasury bills to HBOS, and the use by HBOS in the market of those bills, was indistinguishable from liquidity provided under SLS, and the emergence of the recapitalisation scheme also provided “camouflage” for the operation.  </p>

The committee noted the alternative which was for the group to raise capital under [the Treasury] scheme and continue on a standalone basis. The choice recommended by the committee would be influenced by the price at which an acquisition of [HBOS] could be renegotiated, and the structure of any acquisition.

These suggested structures had different starting points as regards the assumed fair value adjustments and excess provisions on the HBOS book that might need to be made, the assumed impairments and adjustments lying at the lower end of the range estimated by Mr Roughton-Smith on the “1 in 15” scenario. (His latest work had estimated the range of impairments and FVAs for the second half of 2008 to be in the range £9.7bn-£15.4bn and for H208 and 2009 combined to be £16.2-£25.5bn).  But, after deducting the assumed cost of new capital to be injected, each gave a negative net value for HBOS (ranging from £4bn to £10bn). The nub of the pro-active proposal was that the Government should nationalise HBOS for a nil consideration, should then inject £15.5bn into HBOS (and £5bn into Lloyds) and that Lloyds should acquire a nationalised HBOS for £15.5bn (i.e. a sum equal to the new capital, giving nothing for HBOS as it stood pre-recapitalisation). Deferred shares were to be issued to the original HBOS shareholders which would be extinguished on a £1 for £1 basis if HBOS incurred losses actually exceeded the estimated impairments and FVA, and otherwise converted into preference shares. Depending on various configurations the Government would end up owning between 66% and 48% of the Enlarged Group. </p>

That is why Mr Greenburgh’s analysis focuses on downsides (impairments) and ignores upsides (synergies and brand values); why Mr Tookey was not provided with the paper; and why the GEC continued to consider the Acquisition as a possibility dependent upon “the price at which an acquisition of [HBOS] could be re-negotiated”.  Mr Daniels also gave strong evidence that there was no discussion about the net value of HBOS being zero.

This Proposal referenced both events since the Announcement and the identification of further substantial losses within HBOS, and it recorded the belief that HBOS would be greatly enhanced by the application of Lloyds’ management approach and risk practices. The Proposal grounded itself upon the assumptions that for the period to the end of 2009 additional impairments and fair value adjustments of £17.5bn were required to HBOS’s books, and that the enlarged group should have a Core Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% (rather than the 6% minimum). On that basis it sought (i) an injection of £17bn Core Tier 1 capital into HBOS, coupled with (ii) a loss sharing arrangement under which the Tripartite would bear 80% of any losses in excess of £17.5 billion (subject to a cap of £5bn). Lloyds would issue £4.5bn ordinary shares and £5bn of preferred dividend ordinary shares at a price of 189p per share to acquire HBOS (a total price of some £13.5bn). Lloyds itself would raise additional capital to reflect the increased risk profile resulting from acquiring the HBOS portfolio, namely, by the issue to the Government of £2.5bn of ordinary shares and £2.5bn of preferred dividend ordinary shares. The Proposal stated that in the absence of the Acquisition Lloyds would not propose a capital raise <span style="font-style:italic">of this extent</span> or Government involvement.  (In fact, the  calculations undertaken by Mr Greenburgh showed that on a “standalone” basis it was possible that Lloyds required £5bn additional capital if it aimed to reach a Core Tier 1 ratio of 7% by 31 December 2008, assuming a “1 in 15” scenario). </p>

The Indicative Conditional Proposal does not represent a “red line” below which Lloyds could not justify the Acquisition. Even so, there were voices within Lloyds which felt the Indicative Conditional Proposal itself did not go far enough in providing for anticipated losses within HBOS. It was again Mr Taylor who emailed Mr Pietruska to say that “… at £17bn pre-tax this is less than ½ what we think it could be on the one in 25 scenario….” (an indicator that sufficient work had been undertaken on that more adverse scenario to arrive at that rough figure).

Like SLS the extent and terms of the facility were confidential to the Bank and HBOS: but unlike SLS the very existence of this bilateral facility was kept secret (for reasons which the Plenderleith Report later considered were entirely reasonable having regard to the fragility of the market). However, because of the potential Acquisition and the cooperative approach to the funding of HBOS (where the funding plans developed by HBOS with BoE were shared with Lloyds in order to facilitate drawdowns under the Lloyds Repo), Lloyds was in a position different from the market in general, and some of its personnel knew directly or indirectly of the special facility. </p>

The FSA was later to refer to this as “weightings tailored to …specific institutions”. The outcome was not the product of a mathematical calculation but included an element of judgment. The outcome was then shared with each bank. It was intended that each bank should then have the opportunity to proffer updated balance sheet data (and the FSA would decide whether it was appropriate to incorporate it in its modelling). Once the amount of the new capital to be raised had been determined there would necessarily follow discussion as to how it could be raised (by management action such as disposals or a reduction in the RWAs, by accessing the market, or by using the Treasury programme). </p>

When the Announcement was made there was a view in the market that, because of possible provisions for impairments and FVAs Lloyds would need to embark on a capital raising exercise. A note from Credit Suisse on 25 September 2008 put the suggested amount at £10bn: one from Deutsche Bank the same day put it at £4.5bn. As the Indicative Conditional Proposal acknowledged the Lloyds executive team also accepted that whether or not the Acquisition proceeded a capital raise was required (though they thought it could be argued that more was required if the Acquisition proceeded than if Lloyds remained a “standalone” bank). So following the Government announcements of 7 and 8 October 2008 and before the start of the Recapitalisation Weekend the Lloyds team (Mr Daniels, Mr Tate, Mr Tookey and Ms Sergeant) met with the BoE and the FSA and discussed a provisional estimate that Lloyds would need about £5bn additional capital and the combined entity about £17.5bn additional capital (though which entity was to take what portion remained to be determined). In the light of those preliminary discussions the Lloyds team considered the internal preparatory paper put together by Mr Greenburgh, and formulated and then prepared and submitted the Indicative Conditional Proposal. This was rejected at about 4.30pm on 11 October 2008. The Tripartite was not prepared to let Lloyds take over HBOS (as entirely recapitalised with Government money) and at the same time waive all competition considerations. </p>

It would not assist clarity were I to set out the Stress Assumptions (which consist of percentages and acronyms). Nor are the calculated figures resulting from the application of the Stress Assumptions illuminating, because there are no workings to show the underlying figures derived from Lloyds balance sheet or from “the data within the building” to which those Stress Assumptions were applied and which resulted in the calculated figure. But the result was that it appeared that in the scenario contemplated by the Stress Assumptions Lloyds needed to raise additional Core Tier 1 capital as a “standalone” bank sufficient to cover £6.494bn of adverse adjustments (of which £3.56bn resulted from losses, impairments and valuation adjustments, and £2.934  resulted from increased RWAs). </p>

On the morning of Sunday 12 October 2008 Mr Sants telephoned Mr Daniels and told him that Lloyds had to raise £7bn in additional capital as a “standalone” bank, and that the capital requirement for the Enlarged Group would be an additional £17bn of which Lloyds would be required to raise £5.5bn and HBOS £11.5bn. If HBOS remained a standalone bank then it required £12bn. Mr Daniels described these requirements as “a completely different order of magnitude than what we expected”. £7bn was equal to 60% of Lloyds’ entire market capitalisation at the Friday closing share price. The numbers were indeed at first glance odd. Given the size and nature of Lloyds’ asset base and the much larger, higher risk profile HBOS book, it was curious that Lloyds had to raise £7bn but HBOS only £12bn as “stand-alone” banks; and further that introducing the HBOS high-risk book into the Enlarged Group actually reduced the amount of capital required from Lloyds.  </p>

The variance may, for example, depend upon differing views taken by the respective FSA Supervisory Teams as to the level of provisions already made by the respective banks; or the extent to which the consequence of an internal ratings-based approach to valuing RWAs differed from a standardised approach in a stressed scenario; or how the incremental impact of a severe recession in which all stresses occurred simultaneously (as opposed to the economic model currently used for a particular bank) differed; or upon how the proportion of business exposed to a general vulnerability to a downturn in the UK economy (as opposed to the proportion of business exposed to calculable risks arising from specific lending structures) produced different requirements; or the impact of any insurance business element; or whether it was thought that Lloyds’ management techniques would reduce anticipated losses on the HBOS book in the scenario of an enlarged group. The Defendants’ expert Mr Sharma noted, for example,  that from publically available information it could be demonstrated that Lloyds had a much higher proportion of  “credit risk RWAs” to total RWAs than its peer group: of course he could not say that that feature <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> affect the additional capital required, and I do not find that any of the possible factors advanced in evidence (some of which I have listed above) were actually in play in the assessment of the Lloyds capital requirement.

With a £7bn capital injection it would have had a Tier 1 ratio of 13% (the joint highest of its peer group) and (if the new capital was raised as planned through ordinary and preference shares) a Core Tier 1 ratio of 8.5% (compared with 6.4% as part of the Enlarged Group and the 6.8% Core Tier 1 ratio of  an HBOS recapitalised with an additional £12bn). One must exercise considerable caution about comparing Lloyds with its peer group, because (i) there was no common agreement as to what precisely “Core Tier 1 capital” was and different banks assessed it differently and (ii) Lloyds’ undertaking the Acquisition meant that its accounting treatment would differ from that of its peers. But on a more limited comparison one could certainly say that since the quality of the Lloyds asset book was higher than that of the HBOS asset book (and might therefore be less vulnerable in deteriorating conditions) one might in a general sense have expected the recapitalisation requirement of Lloyds to be proportionately lower than that for HBOS: but at £7bn it was not. </p>

With the benefit of knowing things about HBOS that were not known to Lloyds at the time (e.g. that HBOS was underrecognising impairments or not correctly assessing its RWAs) and with the benefit of knowing what in the event happened (e.g. the true extent of HBOS’ losses in the actual recession that occurred) it is possible to demonstrate that the relationship between the capital requirement for HBOS and that for Lloyds was disproportionate. But that disproportion might be because the assessment of the capital requirement for HBOS was flawed as being too low. What Lloyds would have had to persuade the FSA of during the Recapitalisation Weekend was that on the FSA stress scenario the Lloyds requirement was too high.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">As Mr Hill QC submitted there was some material available. The requirement to raise an additional £7bn  entailed Lloyds having a higher capital ratio than any other UK bank, with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%. (as compared with 6.8% for  a standalone HBOS). This was surprising given that Lloyds had a more conservative lending policy (and a higher quality book that was probably less vulnerable to deteriorating conditions) that ought to have been reflected in a lower capitalisation requirement if a consistent stress testing framework was applied across all banks. It was also surprising given that the market seemed to have more confidence in Lloyds than in HBOS. That was reflected in the fact that the Lloyds’ Credit Default Swap (“CDS”) spread was at the material time significantly narrower than that of HBOS. Of course, pursuing these general themes would also have compelled analysis of Mr Greenburgh’s negotiating suggestion of £5.5bn additional capital for a “standalone” Lloyds adopted in the paper underlying the Indicative Conditional Proposal, of the £3bn/£4bn requirement suggested by Mr Tookey (and felt to be right by Mr Daniels), and of the figures produced by Mr </p>

There is, I think,  a real difference between Lloyds seeking to renegotiate the size of the proposed alternative “standalone” capital raise immediately after the public announcement and in the context of a continuing potential merger on the one hand, and re-assessing the size of the “standalone” capital raise at some later point in the context of the merger having been abandoned. In the former case, the attitude of the Tripartite would almost certainly have been “We stick by what we said unless you can show an error” because the Government wanted to foster the merger and to cut off alternatives. In the latter case, because the proposed merger appears to be off the table (itself a very disruptive event for the banking system as a whole with a threat of contagion for Lloyds and other banks) and because the Government is going to have to find a different solution for HBOS, the attitude of the Tripartite to an attempt by Lloyds to renegotiate its “standalone requirement” would probably have been have been: “How much you have to raise – be it more or less than £7bn– and the extent to which you can look to us to take some of the new capital on the original terms will have to be renegotiated: you cannot assume that what we said on 13 October holds good now because things have changed”.

Mr Tate stated in his evidence that he considered by that time that the terms of the Acquisition needed revising but that Mr Hornby of HBOS was also resistant to a renegotiation.

They were conducted on the Lloyds’ side by Mr Daniels and by Mr Greenburgh in “face-to-face” and “breakout” sessions (with reference back to Mr Tookey). HBOS was looking for a price per share of about £1.60p. But as part of the recapitalisation package it had had to offer new shares to the Government at £1.11p. The Lloyds team went into the negotiation armed with the work that had been done by Mr Roughton-Smith on impairments, with Mr Foley’s views on the economic outlook and with their own recent experience of the cost of capital: and (it appears) with the aim of securing the agreement of HBOS to a takeover at £1.11p per share. This HBOS would not agree. One of Mr Tookey’s contemporaneous notes records a report that HBOS was “astonished” that Lloyds should offer below the Friday closing price. There followed a lengthy and tense negotiation. The outcome was an “in principle” agreement on a revised ratio of 0.59 Lloyds share per one HBOS share. This was  intended to represent the close of market prices of the respective shares on Friday, 10 October 2008, but with a 10% haircut applied to the HBOS price i.e. the same as the Government price. In broad terms this represented a reduction in the price that Lloyds was paying from approximately 60% of the HBOS book value to about 30% of the HBOS book value, reflecting a discount of approximately £14bn for potential after-tax fair value adjustments and write-downs (which Mr Roughton-Smith had estimated at £9.7-15.4bn for 2008). </p>

He noted that the Bank was “becoming increasingly reluctant to fund HBOS”. (A surviving handwritten note of the meeting made by Mr Kane records that the Bank was looking to Lloyds to fund HBOS to completion of any acquisition). The Minute is not expressed in sufficiently full terms to treat this as notice to the board that HBOS was in receipt of some specific and entirely discretionary line of funding (such as ELA). Mr Daniels disclosed that the Tripartite was supportive of an enlarged group with a combined capital injection of £17.5 billion. Taking that into account he told the Board that a revised proposal had been put to HBOS based on a share exchange ratio of 0.59 Lloyds share for each HBOS share. He explained that if accepted this would result in the Government owning approximately 40% of the Enlarged Group (assuming Lloyds shareholders did not themselves take up any of the new capital).  </p>

[Lloyds] could either decide to proceed with the acquisition of [HBOS] (assuming the board of [HBOS] agreed the revised terms) and raise capital jointly with [HBOS] for a total of £17.5 billion or to proceed without the acquisition of [HBOS] and raise capital of £7 billion. ” </p>

In comparison the acquisition of [HBOS], compared to the stand-alone position, whilst also dilutive was enhancing when the synergies were taken into account. The new terms proposed to [HBOS] had also contributed to a de-risking of the transaction. Whilst therefore, there was value destruction inherent in the capital raising required by HM Government the acquisition of HBOS was far less destructive of value and offered the potential to create value as a result of the transaction… [T]here was currently no market for the issue of bank preference shares and he was of the view that it would also not be possible to raise £5 billion in equity capital particularly when the other issues currently being undertaken by banks were taken into account. Consequently, the bank’s only access to share capital at the current time was through the government’s scheme and the better way to access that capital was by accessing it as part of the [HBOS] transaction.” </p>

Mr Wilmot-Sitwell advised that he was reasonably confident that it should be possible through a process of clawback to reduce HM Government’s shareholding as well as by means of a share placing in due course.

The terms of the Minute enable some of the topics covered in that discussion to be discerned.  First, the board looked at the progress of due diligence and was satisfied that it was now proceeding more smoothly. Second, the board looked at impairments and noted that the due diligence had been reviewed on a “1 in 15” basis but had not been stressed on a “1 in 25” basis, so that there was a risk of higher impairments should that scenario be relevant. Mr Daniels said (and I consider it probable) that that brief note records the occurrence of a discussion but does not attempt to summarise its extent or content. It is not possible to identify what papers were tabled at the meeting but given that the board looked at “impairments” it seems to me inherently probable that they had available to them in some form the impairment figures produced by Group Risk in the range £16.2-£25.5 bn, but knew them to be provisional and subject to work that was even then being undertaken on further data.  Third, the board considered the impact upon the Lloyds’ franchise of the Government becoming a major shareholder. Fourth, the board compared the alternative proposals.  </p>

Looking at the inherent probabilities it seems to me that it is likely that it was robust, but acknowledged that the proposal had a history. At the meeting on 26 September 2008 the board had adopted a cautious approach and had not evidenced any desire to proceed headlong with the proposed transaction. There was now the new element of enforced recapitalisation: and the amount of additional capital that the Tripartite was requiring a standalone Lloyds to raise was above the expectation of the executive team and greater than anything that had previously been put before the board. Moreover, the terms upon which capital would be made available to the combined entity were in some respects stringent. Further, the market had deteriorated since the Announcement to the extent that the original deal no longer stacked up. It is unlikely that this highly experienced board decided to plunge ahead with the acquisition of HBOS, carried away by the prospect of a “once-in-a-lifetime deal”,  without testing whether the strategy of growth by acquisition could survive the Tripartite’s requirement for the “bullet-proofing” of the banks.  </p>

It is not realistic to expect any detailed recollection of the course of the debate. But it is entirely credible that the participants should have a recollection of the sense of this crisis meeting. Mr Daniels (who was not present for all of the meeting) recalls a wide ranging discussion in which the board members generally participated, with a number of good questions being asked. When cross-examined about the brevity of the note concerning impairments in a “1 in 25” scenario and invited to accept that there was no attempt to discuss or factor in or identify or analyse the consequences of those risks he said: ”That is absolutely a conclusion I do not agree with”. That was the tenor of his response to other similar questions. But he readily acknowledged that because the relevant information was recent and the situation complex and developing, any analysis presented to the Board could not be thorough: in another passage of cross-examination he said of the emerging material that he had the benefit of calculations, albeit not as thorough as they eventually ended up undertaking, but enough to provide “a pretty good indicator”.  Mr Tate (who participated by telephone) thought the Board conducted a robust and considered examination of the relative attractions of the courses open.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Kane recalls that notwithstanding the pressure put on Lloyds by the Tripartite to reach a decision that evening the Board carefully reconsidered the Acquisition to see if it still made commercial sense: and he felt that if HBOS did not renegotiate a sensible price (based on a discount to the Friday closing price) then Lloyds would have considered walking away. He thought that the board pondered the various inputs. Dr Berndt thought that the directors had remained firmly focused on ensuring that the proposed acquisition was appropriately scrutinised from all angles. Mr Pietruska recalls the agitation of the board at learning of the Tripartite’s requirement of a £7bn capital injection into a standalone Lloyds, and the collective intake of breath as the investment bankers were asked whether Lloyds could raise that sum without Government aid. There is no question but that this is the honest recollection of each of them: they are not lying. I have of course had to consider whether it represents a collective self-delusion: this is what they ought to have done and so each of them believes it is what they actually did. But having seen them (and having seen some of them cross-examined at very considerable length) I do not believe this to be so. Their evidence is supportive of what I regard as the inherent probability. </p>

Mr Tookey gave evidence that at about 4.00am on Monday 13 October 2008 he was telephoned by the Bank’s legal advisers who informed him that the Bank required (effectively as a condition of continued support) the removal of the “material adverse change” clause which the initial acquisition agreement had contained, and which empowered the Lloyds’ board to withdraw from the Acquisition without penalty in defined circumstances. The choice as he saw it was whether to acquiesce in the change or whether to attempt to reconvene a board meeting at 5.00am. The advantage to the Bank was that the change cut off one exit route from the transaction (into which the Tripartite was increasingly anxious to tie Lloyds). The consequence for Lloyds was (i) that in the perception of the market the change would signal a reduction in the risk of the transaction not proceeding, and so reduce the share price volatility which that risk generated; (ii) it left unaffected the power of the shareholders to reject the Acquisition should any materially adverse changes actually occur (though, I would observe, it did leave Lloyds exposed to material adverse change after shareholder approval but before completion); and (iii) co-operation with the Bank reduced the risk of the Bank restricting Lloyds’ access to SLS or to guaranteed funding or reducing its assistance to HBOS. Putting on one side for the moment Mr Tookey’s analysis of the pros and cons of the change, taking the evidence as a whole I do not think this account is wholly accurate. </p>

This strikes me as a more probable account of the actual events (and accords with the recollection  of Sir Victor, though not of Mr Parr): however, I consider it probable that Mr Tookey’s analysis of what drove the request and what drove the acceptance is entirely correct. The evidence of Mr Parr (which I accept) was that in terms of the transaction itself (as opposed to signals and levers) the alteration was not of great practical consequence, MAC clauses not being regarded as especially commercially valuable since the circumstances in which the Takeover Panel will permit them to be activated are extremely limited. </p>

The Acquisition would proceed but with 0.605 Lloyds share for each HBOS share. There would be a recapitalisation of the Enlarged Group of £17bn. Lloyds would be raising £5.5bn of new capital: £4.5bn of ordinary shares would be taken by the Government at £173.3p per share (an 8.5% discount) subject to clawback by existing Lloyds shareholders, together with £1bn of preferred shares. The Revised Announcement explained that Lloyds had had discussions with the Treasury on the additional capital that the Government required Lloyds to have if it was to retain access to Government-backed provision of liquidity. HBOS was to raise £11.5bn (split as to £8.5bn in ordinary shares and £3bn in preferred shares). The commercial logic behind the takeover was explained again: and a number of indications were given about the shape and objectives of the Enlarged Group. The Revised Announcement explained that the Acquisition was conditional upon the absence of any reference to the Competition Commission, the passing of the necessary resolutions at an EGM of Lloyds’ shareholders, and the requisite approvals from HBOS.  </p>

First, the effect of the recapitalisation was that Lloyds (in common with those other banks who submitted to the Government directive to cease dividend payments in order to fund lending to SMEs and other businesses) had ceased to be an “income” stock, resulting in the emergence of sellers. Second, the terms of the announcement by the Government gave the impression that Lloyds was to be ranked alongside HBOS and RBS, whereas the Lloyds’ team had understood that they would be clearly differentiated. So Lloyds had to embark on a communications offensive to re-assure investors.  </p>

The legislation was passed. On 31 October 2008 Lord Mandelson (who had become the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on 3 October 2008) decided not to refer the Acquisition to the Competition Commission. In doing so he relied on a submission from the BoE that a failure of HBOS risked contagion of other financial institutions, the re-emergence of a loss of confidence, and significant negative consequences for  the UK economy overall. He also received and took into account advice from the FSA that temporary public ownership would not cure the structural weaknesses in HBOS’ balance sheet, whereas a merger would provide a sustainable medium term future for HBOS: by this the FSA meant that through a change of management and the introduction of Lloyds’ expertise there would arise an opportunity to revise, reform and refocus the HBOS business model. Domestic competition issues were therefore overcome in the way envisaged since the possibility of the Acquisition was first canvassed. </p>

On 11 October 2008 the European Commission was notified of the UK Government's proposed support measures, though there is no suggestion in the evidence that anyone in the Lloyds team was aware of that. However, the thought did occur to Mr Parr of Linklaters on the Saturday of the Recapitalisation Weekend (11 October 2008) that the proposed Government recapitalisation might be regarded as State aid, and would therefore raise issues of European competition law.   The evidence establishes that he raised the possibility in discussion and that Slaughter &amp; May (legal advisers to  the Treasury) gave oral comfort that State aid issues were being addressed by the Government. This is reflected in the terms of the Revised Announcement which indicated that EU requirements in relation to state aid issues would be met by a restriction upon the growth in balance sheet volumes. </p>

The Slaughter’s view was that the plan would show how recipients were planning to wean themselves off the guarantees and seeking to exit structurally loss-making businesses… It will also need to cover the likely duration of the Government stake and plans for redeeming/otherwise dealing with the prefs.

But after about a week it became apparent that in order to satisfy the EC the Government might require a more formal restructuring plan (possibly requiring a downsizing of the Enlarged Group). Such a move would tend to negate the synergy benefits of the Acquisition. So by 23 October 2008 Mr Daniels was recommending the Board to send a clear message to the political establishment that any intervention to restrain or break up the Enlarged Group was unnecessary and would frustrate the achievement of the public interest benefits of the merger (so as to influence the direction of travel, which was far from clear). The inchoate risk of restructuring could be mitigated by adopting a relatively conservative approach to the estimation of such prospective benefits: and this was done. Although at a stretch the synergies might amount to £2.4bn Lloyds generally said that they would “exceed £1bn”. (The slant of this litigation has meant that there has been little consideration of synergies: but it is important to appreciate that when a figure is put upon anticipated synergies the figure is an annualised one. In total Lloyds anticipated synergies of between £5bn - £8bn). </p>

When considering the question of a reference to the Competition Commission the Secretary of State had a power (under s. 43(4)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002) to require Lloyds and/or HBOS to give undertakings as to restructuring in order to address or mitigate anticipated competition concerns. Notably he did not do so. I take this as an indicator that the Secretary of State did not at that point anticipate that any significant divestment programme would be required to address the competition consequences of any state aid issues. </p>

These, Mr Sants is recorded as saying, were “absolutely discussable” and that he would be flexible. In cross-examination Mr Daniels accepted that if the capital requirements for the combined group were “discussable” then so also must have been the capital requirements for a “standalone Lloyds” (insofar as that remained a relevant comparator). </p>

He pursued the matter with the FSA. On 16 October 2008 Mr Sants said that he would not re-open the historical discussion of the Recapitalisation Weekend, but he invited Mr Daniels to come forward with a series of management actions to reduce the capital requirement of the Enlarged Group. The same day the supervisory team for Lloyds at the FSA told Mr Tookey that no new capital numbers would be agreed at that time, but that a process of “understanding” could begin. </p>

They expressed the view that the Recapitalisation Weekend had run to a very compressed timetable  which had left them with the feeling that they had not been able fully to explain their capital position, the conservative nature of their forecast and the robustness of their marks. Their presentation to the FSA sought to demonstrate that the preference shares were not required (and indeed in some respects had adverse consequences), and that only £13bn (not £17bn) was required as additional capital for the Enlarged Group. On that footing Lloyds was predicted to have a Core Tier 1 ratio of 8.2%  in 2009 on its central case, and 6.6% on a pessimistic case. The Lloyds team stated that they wanted to put in the proposed Circular a lower figure for additional capital than that presently required.  </p>

In these discussions the additional capital requirements of the Enlarged Group “got more airtime” as Mr Daniels put it, because that was the publically announced plan. However, it is not the case that all mention of the “standalone” alternative for Lloyds was entirely overlooked (and there is documentary reference to it, in particular the Lloyds’ presentation worked out the comparative Core Tier 1 ratio for a “standalone” Lloyds on the basis of £5.5bn capital contribution which eliminated the preference shares). But since the objective of the campaign was to secure a lower capital requirement for announcement in the shareholder circular I do not consider that there was any concentrated attempt to renegotiate the capital requirements of a “standalone” Lloyds. However, any such a discussion would inevitably have covered substantial parts of the same territory, in particular whether anticipated managerial actions, in this case relating to Lloyds alone, should be taken to reduce capital requirements. </p>

In the course of that conversation the FSA made clear that on their stress assumptions the Core Tier 1 ratio of the Enlarged Group under the present recapitalisation plan was projected to be 4.6% at the end of 2008. That was, of course, above the 4% minimum in extreme stress which the FSA required: but a reduction of £2bn in the proposed recapitalisation would have put that at risk.    </p>

On 24 October 2008 the FSA team made clear its expectations on capital. Banks had to meet a 6% Core Tier 1 ratio and an 8% Total Tier 1 ratio on their base case. If a bank were to fall below the 6% ratio then the FSA would expect that bank to discuss the reasons for this and to agree an appropriate course of action to restore the ratio to 6% within an appropriate timescale. In an extreme stress scenario a 4% Core Tier 1 ratio would be acceptable, but that was the minimum amount necessary to give the FSA comfort that a bank would survive a deep recession. The FSA considered that with a capital addition of £17bn the Enlarged Group would have a Core Tier 1 ratio of 4.6% in a deep recession. If this view prevailed then the elimination of the preference shares was not achievable. </p>

To ensure consistency the FSA used a framework which had a number of variables, the most important of which was that, by the end of 2008, each individual institution had to have a total Tier 1 Capital of at least 8% and that their Core Tier 1 Capital, as defined by the FSA, had to remain above 4% after the stressed scenario and above 6% on the company’s central case forecast… It is important to recognise that this approach has been adopted in the context of implementing the Tripartite support package. This included access to Government support through the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the level of capital required for that was determined by a thorough and consistent application across institutions of the framework described above.

In my judgment the former is essentially the correct understanding of the requirement (though some nuance is required). Outside circumstances of extreme stress a bank was required to maintain a minimum Core Tier 1 ratio of 6%: if for idiosyncratic reasons it fell below that ratio then it had to agree with the FSA an appropriate timetable to restore the “buffer” over the 4% absolute minimum. In a general climate of  extreme stress (as applied to an individual bank) a 4% Core Tier 1 ratio for that bank was acceptable to the FSA as sufficient to enable the bank both to withstand the challenging economic conditions and to enable that bank to continue to lend on normal commercial criteria. The ability of that bank to continue to lend was a necessary palliative in an economically distressed scenario: as the stress eased or as the bank accommodated continued lending during the stressed circumstances then the level should be restored to 6%.  </p>

Following the Recapitalisation Weekend there was some improvement in money market conditions, but the markets had not returned to normal functioning. So on 20 October 2008 the Bank announced a modification to its standing facilities and the immediate introduction of a Discount Window Facility (“DWF”). One of the modifications to the standing facilities was that the Bank ceased publication of various data about the use of its standing facilities and about which banks had signed up for access: the market was therefore deprived of this information flow in the interests of stability.  The DWF enabled UK banks to obtain either cash or gilt-edged  stock in exchange for certain assets not otherwise acceptable as collateral under other liquidity schemes, and then to use those gilts in the market or in the BoE open market operations. However, the purpose of the DWF was to provide liquidity insurance for (an extendable) period of 30 days: it was not intended for banks facing fundamental problems of solvency or viability.   </p>

Foremost amongst these is the risk of leaving HBOS without a credible long term strategy and the associated loss of confidence amongst depositors and market counterparties that would be likely to emerge. Both could seriously undermine confidence in the consistency and effectiveness in the authorities’ recent interventions which have been  key to re-establishing confidence in and the stability of the UK banking sector.” </p>

This was explained by Mr Pietruska in his written evidence and by Mr Daniels in his oral evidence (and is referred to in a 17 October 2008 update of the Group Strategy and Corporate Development document prepared for Mr Tookey). The short point is that the interaction between impairments and net negative capital adjustments is tenuous because they are different approaches to the valuation exercise.  The former adopts a “bottom-up” analysis of individual samples. The latter applies adjustment factors (derived from movements in interest rates or credit spreads) across a portfolio. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Thus Mr Roughton-Smith’s writedown/FVA adjustment of £15-£21bn was (in unvarnished form) <span style="font-style:italic">one</span> of the inputs into a calculation of the anticipated net negative capital adjustment, which calculation included comparative valuation approaches (using interest rates and credit default swap rates), potential crystallised loss on Available for Sale (“AFS”) assets, HBOS’ own impairment forecast, adjustments for different valuation methodologies (“mark-to-model” in place of “mark-to-market”) and an assumed ability to write off losses against tax. So an increase in impairments does not automatically lead to a corresponding increase in the figure for net negative capital adjustment. There is nothing in the documentary evidence itself to suggest that the figures deployed in the memorandum resulted from a conscious manipulation or juggling of the figures to reduce the impact of impairments, and Mr Roughton-Smith’s raw impairment estimates appear on the face of the document from which the memorandum figures derive. </p>

This was intended to reflect the recent government actions on capital and funding which together were intended to alleviate the credit crunch. The scenario was prepared for planning purposes, to support a refocusing of the planning and budget strategy upon capital affordability and funding sustainability. The assumptions in the “mid-case” postulated a dip in H208 and 2009, but an increasingly strong recovery through 2010 and the years following. The dip was not severe: GDP was assumed to grow 1% in 2008 and to fall 0.5% in 2009. House prices were assumed to fall 16% in 2008 and a further 10% in 2009. The GDP assumptions made by Mr Foley were more testing than the consensus view of a substantial body of a prominent financial and economic forecasters as that time, including the BoE and the Treasury. Mr Foley recognised it was unclear to what extent the real economy would react to the government initiatives and also to what extent the stronger capital and funding positions would support credit growth. So he thought that whilst the mid-case scenario was “now the highest probability outcome”, the “credit crunch” scenario  remained a distinct possibility (though with a lower probability than before). Mr Foley incorporated this “mid-case” scenario into a presentation intended to be placed before the GEC in draft and subsequently before the board. Mr Foley attended the meeting of the GEC on 14 October 2008 on the item of business called “November board meeting preparation” and it is probable that he put before the meeting his draft presentation in its then state (so that his views on the economic outlook for planning purposes were communicated to Mr Daniels, Mr Tate, Ms Weir, Ms Sergeant, Mr Tookey and Mr Pietruska). </p>

In the meantime there was a significant refinancing risk, because the funding plan was dependent on access to Government funding (the newly extended SLS, the newly announced guaranteed loan facility and the opening up of the market generally).  The forecast was prepared too late for presentation at the Board meeting: but its contents were communicated to Mr Tate and to Mr Tookey (and thus could inform their actions over the night of 12/13 October 2008). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I turn to consider working capital. Lloyds retained its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”), to tender advice in relation to the working capital requirements of the Enlarged Group. Their letter of engagement (eventually dated 31 October 2008) required them to prepare a working capital report both on Lloyds and on the Enlarged Group to be addressed to the directors, the joint sponsors and the bookrunner. Amongst the inputs would be Lloyds’ management’s projections prepared down to 31 March 2010, and cash flow projections and the working capital requirements of HBOS prepared by its auditors KPMG (whose report on HBOS would be addressed to PwC amongst others). PwC would then conduct a review of the systems and controls of Lloyds and of the Enlarged group in the management of liquidity risk and regulatory capital, including a review of the regulatory capital requirements on a base case and stressed scenarios. As to those, it would be for the addressees of the report to form their own opinions on the reasonableness of the assumptions, but PwC undertook to report if any material assumption was in their view unrealistic. </p>

PwC’s strong recommendation was that Lloyds seek written confirmation of the oral indications given on behalf of the Tripartite that adequate funding would be available to the Enlarged Group. I think the point of the advice was to ensure that it was clear that Government funding would be available in some form not only to secure the completion of the Acquisition but also during the period that it was thought had to be covered by a working capital statement.  </p>

But working capital statements for trading banks pose difficulties because fundamentally their business model is in part to borrow “short” (customer deposits) and lend “long” (mortgages and corporate term loans). So such working capital statements tend to focus on the processes and controls which the bank employs to manage liquidity and monitor its regulatory capital requirements.

The nature of the case advanced has meant that at trial attention focused on the downside risks of the Acquisition: no equal attention was paid to the perceived benefits. The board meeting on 24 October 2008 was the first opportunity that the board had had to look in detail at the benefits. The anticipated synergies referred to at the time of the Announcement where of the order of £1bn. Further work now identified a range of £1.9-£2.6bn, but the proposal before the board was to include a deliberately conservative  estimate of  only £1.5 billion in the intended circular. Some 250 people had been engaged in this work, including a team from Deloittes (who thought the process undertaken by Lloyds was thorough and of high quality). The work of this team was cross-checked by PwC in order to verify its suitability for inclusion in the Circular. The outcome of the work on synergies arising from the integration of the two businesses (whatever form the board decided that should take) was a key part of the Acquisition, because Lloyds was not simply buying assets (book value less write downs and FVAs) but also the business opportunities afforded by the HBOS brands, and the contribution they would make to the income of the Enlarged Group (which would feed through to the EPS enhancements) partly through synergies. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">It is apparent from Mr Tookey’s note that Mr Daniels did not simply repeat the memorandum.  For example, he told the Board that there was “growing heat” over the conditions attached to the capital injection, over “taking over HBOS” and about “why not go it alone?”. This warned the Board that their provisionally favoured course was not free from controversy. He told them that the Tripartite had set the Lloyds’ capital requirement at £7bn and £5.5bn which was “[a] clear push towards [the] HBOS deal”. He told them that Lloyds objected to the capital setting methodology and wanted changes, one of which was an immediate £2bn reduction in the amount to be raised (because management action and proposed disposals had not been taken into account). This warned the Board of potential pressures to adhere to their provisionally favoured course. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Although there was no pleaded case that, in breach of his duties as director, Mr Daniels, in the preparation and presentation of this memorandum negligently or deliberately misled the Board as to the risks inherent in the Acquisition, this was the undertone of Mr Hill QC’s cross-examination. Mr Hill QC suggested that the reference in the memorandum to the impact of fair value adjustments and write-downs upon capital as being of the order of £3.1bn-£10bn was misleading because Mr Roughton-Smith’s figure for fair value adjustments and write-downs was £15-£21bn. Mr Daniels responded that one cannot not simply apply anticipated impairments to the figure for negative goodwill at completion: it was necessary to assess the impact of impairments on capital, taking into account existing provisions, tax recoveries and so forth. Mr Hill QC suggested that the board was not aware of the range of Mr Roughton-Smith’s figures. Mr Daniels responded that he could not be sure that at that stage all of the board had seen Mr Roughton-Smith’s latest schedule: but that he believed the board was aware of the range of figures. (As well as Mr Daniels the other participating directors who had certainly seen in full the latest Roughton-Smith figures were Mr Kane, Mr Tate and Ms Weir). Mr Hill QC suggested that the figure of £3.1bn-£10bn was not fairly compared with the earlier forecast of £3.5bn. Mr Daniels responded that the figures were comparable since each of them was a figure over and above existing HBOS provisions. Mr Hill QC challenged the way that the memorandum dealt with the EPS uplift. Mr Daniels responded that a financially aware board (such as Lloyds’) would understand that <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> recapitalisation would involve a dilution, and that the point being made was (given the new requirement to take additional capital) to compare the dilution involved in the recapitalisation of a “standalone” Lloyds with the dilution involved in the recapitalisation of an enlarged group with beneficial synergies (and to note that synergy benefits were deferred). Mr Hill QC suggested that the memorandum failed to draw out that the requirement to take £7bn was “discussable”. But Mr Tookey’s note shows that the board was told of the challenge to the FSA’s methodology, and of what seemed to be the desire of the Tripartite to give a clear steer in favour of the Acquisition. (Mr Daniels was insistent that although the capital requirement of the Enlarged Group </p>

But, as Mr Daniels said, the memorandum (to the criticism of which he responded well) has to be read along with the body of work that accompanied the board papers and has to be seen in the context of other meetings: and it is clear from Mr Tookey’s record that the contentious aspects of the Acquisition </p>

I do not think that Mr Daniels misread the situation in presenting matters on 24 October 2008: and the FSA’s view was to become clear over the next  few days.    </p>

The directors would have to take responsibility for the entirety of the class 1 circular and therefore a key issue for them is to ensure that the contents of it are correct, complete and accurate not only as regards the group but also in respect of HBOS and the enlarged group. Mr Parr explained that it is possible for the directors to minimise the potential for liability arising and to avail themselves of the defences should liability arise by conducting an appropriate legal and financial due diligence exercise…. The main way to address this issue is to seek to ensure that the due diligence processes are completed as far as possible in advance of the publication of the circular and the results reflected in the circular. Efforts continue to be made to obtain to obtain some direct comfort for the directors from the HBOS directors in connection with the Lloyds TSB circular. However, the fact that HBOS will be publishing an interim management statement on the day both the Lloyds TSB and HBOS circulars are published, a draft of which Lloyds TSB will be able to review (and the final version of which will also be reviewed by Lloyds TSB) should give the board further comfort in relation to the HBOS information in the Lloyds circular. ” </p>

This included work to comply with a US standard shortly referred to as “the 10b-5 process”. In the light of this work he was able to update his report in the evening of 28 October 2008.  He identified his starting point for forecasting HBOS’s H2 2008 and 2009 impairments as a high level risk-based review of the entire balance sheet using only publicly available information: he thereby indicated that attention had focussed upon where the perceived risks were most material. He had taken a “1 in 15” “credit crunch” mild recession as the base case, but had subsequently undertaken a high-level estimate of a “1 in 25” “deep recession” scenario. After the latest work undertaken down to 27 October 2008 Mr Roughton-Smith presented a revised assessment of the reduction in net values to December 2009 (resulting from the impairment and fair value analysis) of £16.9bn-£22.3bn in a “1 in 15” scenario (a modification of his earlier range of £15bn-£21bn).

He considered that the relative impact of a “1 in 25” deep recession on HBOS would be greater than upon Lloyds because of the size of the HBOS specialist mortgage book, corporate concentration in relatively risky counterparties and exposures to private equity and joint ventures. </p>

The Lloyds team working alongside PwC on the preparation and testing of the capital model were also conducting a cross-checking exercise: they concluded (as at 4.30pm on 27 October 2008) that the impairments suggested by Group Risk were adequately covered by the credit spread adjustment and that the fair value adjustment was prudent. </p>

The due diligence process enabled the measure of impairments to be assessed in various assumed scenarios. But as a basis for action it would be wise to assess the likelihood of the occurrence of any of those scenarios: this was the role of Mr Foley. By 7 October 2008 Mr Foley was articulating the understanding that the shareholder circular and the prospectus relating to the open offer “should, I assume, be based on what we think is the most likely outcome rather than a deliberately prudent planning assumption”. In advising the GEC for planning purposes he told them at that time that the combined adjusted base case (or “mid-case”) and “1 in 15” recession scenarios had a probability of 70% (each having a 35% probability) and that the prospect of a “1 in 25” recession was 15%.  His further work during the remainder of October did not lead him to advise GEC or the board of any change to that. By 28 October 2008 he had prepared a paper showing that the UK economy had entered a recession, but (as he was to confirm at the “awayday”) he adhered to the view that the “mid-case” scenario represented the most likely outcome. Thus Mr Roughton-Smith’s “1 in 15” scenario (if treated as a base case for risk assessment purposes) was a prudent and cautious one. </p>

As to that review of HBOS material the authors advised the board that the report’s assumptions on corporate insolvencies  were more conservative than those of HBOS, and that for the purposes of capital protection the report had made a conservative estimate of the adjustments that needed to be made to FVAs. The outcome of that was that the Group Corporate Treasury felt that the net adjustment that needed to be made to the Core Tier 1 capital ratio in respect of FVA’s was £10bn negative in the pessimistic scenario and £8bn negative in the cautious case.

He caused to be prepared a draft letter (to be signed by the Bank) confirming the existence of sufficient facilities under ordinary programmes (SLS, LTR, DWF and guaranteed issuance) to support the anticipated (itemised) needs of the Enlarged Group. But the draft also referred to the possibility that (notwithstanding the recent Government action) the markets might return to their state of chronic seizure so that the Enlarged Group’s access to market funds would be cut off at a “pinch point” some three years in the future. In that event, the letter noted, the Enlarged Group would need access to additional Government funds outside the ordinary programmes and to an extent beyond its anticipated needs. The draft letter sought an assurance that the Government would give an unlimited commitment to make available whatever funds were necessary. Mr Tate acknowledged in his correspondence with PwC that it was “a bold shot to seek an unlimited commitment”. </p>

Mr Bailey was willing to confirm the existence of sufficient facilities within the ordinary programmes for the anticipated needs of the Enlarged Group, to say so in writing, and to help in obtaining the like written assurance from the Treasury. But unsurprisingly he was unwilling to give a written commitment, openended in time and unlimited in amount, as to the availability of additional funds some three years hence. PwC appear to have understood the sensitivities around the Bank committing to give a blank cheque to the Enlarged Group, but asked Mr Tate to explore with the Bank whether it would clarify what it had meant when it said publicly that it would “take all actions necessary to ensure that the banking system has access to sufficient liquidity” and that it would “extend and widen its facilities in whatever way [was] necessary to ensure the stability of the system”. The question was a fair one, given that the scenario postulated by PwC (a chronic seizure of the markets) was a systemic one, not one that affected the Enlarged Group alone. </p>

Amongst the assumptions being made was that adjustments would be required to the fair value of HBOS assets as at the date of acquisition, which were expected to result in substantial reductions to the carrying value of those assets, thereby reducing Core Tier 1 capital. The assumed adjustments were £8.7bn negative on a base case and £10.3bn negative on a downside scenario (these being the amounts estimated by HBOS as adjusted by Lloyds, drawn from the work of the Group Corporate Treasury). In its own estimates HBOS had already factored in impairments of £8.4bn on its base case and £11.3bn on its pessimistic “stagflation” scenario, so PwC was being asked to adopt a manifestly cautious approach. The working capital report noted that the Lloyds risk team had reviewed these estimates “in mid October”, had compared the results against their own analysis and considered the estimates to be prudent. (In fact the documents show the review process continuing until 28 October 2008). </p>

(thus providing a 1.1% buffer over the absolute minimum). The pessimistic case was aligned with stressed circumstances in which the FSA would accept a reduction on the Core Tier 1 ratio to 4%, but (depending on the duration of the stress and the ability of the Enlarged Group to continue to lend commercially) would expect the restoration of the “buffer” by means of an appropriate plan. </p>

Drawing on a Funding Plan submitted to the HBOS board in October 2008 the memorandum noted a continued attrition to customer deposits before an anticipated recovery to pre-September 2008-crisis levels in March 2010, and, in consequence, the significant reliance being placed on “various UK Government supported funding arrangements”.

The end result of these initiatives is that our capital plans look robust and our funding liquidity position is also improved though clearly dependent on continuing Government and BoE support throughout the period under review… Taking into account all these sources of capital and liquidity and based on the results of management’s review of working capital requirements the Board is requested to conclude that HBOS has sufficient working capital for its present requirements. Assuming that the Board is satisfied that the above conclusion can be reached the Board is requested to approve submission of this assessment of working capital to the Directors of Lloyds TSB group plc.” </p>

First, that the wholesale markets upon which HBOS depended for funding were difficult, and that its funding model assumed the availability of BoE facilities and the Government’s bank funding and liquidity schemes. Second, the degree of dependence on such funding could be affected by abnormal withdrawals of deposits (over which HBOS did not have complete control).  Third, that capital sensitivity was driven by losses (which reduced capital resources) and by the effect that a worsening economic climate had upon RWAs (which increased capital requirements): but that </p>

Fifth, that there was a possibility that the immediate economic future would be worse than the assumed severe economic downturn given that most economists were now predicting a recession, that the main impact of such an event would be on forecast capital requirements,   but quantification was impossible. Last, that whilst the scope of KPMG’s work was simply to comment on the funding and working capital projections prepared by HBOS and the assumptions which underlay them, the usual production processes and governance and review procedures had been observed by HBOS management. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The board meeting of 29 October 2008 was clearly an extremely important one, because the board was being invited to “press the button” on the Acquisition (subject to a meeting of a committee of the Board pencilled in for 31 October 2008). Those attending would have known that there was an “awayday” planned for shortly after publication of the Circular at which the Medium Term Plan for the Enlarged Group was to be discussed and decided, including a review of the liquidity profile of the Enlarged Group and of regulatory capital adequacy. This compression of events (each addressing aspects of the purpose  and consequences of the Acqusition) means that there is a risk that the Court cannot confidently ascertain what were the decisive arguments or what were the compelling convictions on 29 October 2008 (as opposed to later). But this risk is countered by the fact that the participants were called upon to reflect upon why they did what they did so soon after the events themselves that for some participants the memory will have acquired a vivid (if not immutable) form. The documents are of little assistance in this regard because they record the decisions made but not the way in which the decisions were reached. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Each of the Directors (Mr Tookey was still not a director) had squarely to address whether they could conscientiously be part of a unanimous body of opinion recommending the Acquisition to the shareholders: because both the draft Chairman’s Letter and the draft Circular contained such a recommendation. Mr Tookey knew that he was due to be appointed a director on 31 October 2008 and would be a director at a time when the Chairman’s letter and the Circular were published: so he knew that he had at 31 October 2008 to address the same issue. Each director also knew that he or she would be required to confirm that the best of his or her knowledge and belief (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such was the case) the information contained in the Circular was in accordance with the facts and did not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information. </p>

Dr Berndt and two other directors participated by telephone: all other directors were present. In attendance (amongst others) was Mr Tookey (still not a board member), Ms Sergeant (Chief Risk Director) and Mr Parr. It is the evidence of Mr Tookey (supported in hesitant terms by Mr Tate and in general terms by Mr du Plessis) that Mr Roughton-Smith was also in attendance though his attendance is not recorded on the signed minutes and there is no record of him saying anything.  </p>

Mr Daniels was also clear in his evidence that there was a “rigorous and full-bodied” discussion around Mr Roughton-Smith’s paper including a wide ranging discussion regarding what could have an impact upon the capital requirements.  </p>

The compression of events makes such a mistake understandable. Ms Sergeant  (who otherwise bore the executive burden of risk issues and to whom Mr Roughton-Smith reported) is likely to have required the attendance of Mr Roughton-Smith to be recorded in the Minutes if he was there: and the absence of such a record is on analysis significant. Further, if Mr Roughton-Smith had attended and there had been a rigorous and full-bodied discussion of impairments in his presence I would have expected it either to have generated some further traces in the documents or to have produced answers (particularly relating to the severity of his assumptions) that lodged in the memory of the participants at the meeting. But the only contribution from Mr Roughton-Smith that is recalled is one relating to the accuracy of his impairment and fair value estimates and any potential improvement to be gained from further work (a matter covered in the tabled report anyway).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The position in which the Board found itself was therefore that there was a late-tabled paper from Mr Roughton-Smith containing some specific figures not previously placed before the board (estimating impairments below his original figure but above his last revised figure) and a draft working capital report from PwC which took account (under the ordinary flow of information) of the trend of due diligence work being undertaken by Mr Roughton-Smith and his team but which did not explicitly bring his late-tabled figures into the text of the report. It was no part of the Claimants’ case that consideration of this item of business should have been adjourned for further consideration. It was accepted that the Board had to make a decision and to do so on the basis of the material with which the Lloyds’ management had provided it.

But one can gain a sense of his thinking from the evidence which he gave to the Treasury Select committee in early February 2009. He considered the Acquisition to be a “prudent” one, albeit one that would be “painful” in the short term. Looking beyond the potential short-term risks Mr Daniels considered the Acquisition to be “strategically …very good” and that the Enlarged Group would have a leading market share in a large number of markets and one which ultimately (probably by 2011) would sustain a 19.8% increase in EPS (compared to proceeding on a ‘stand-alone’ basis and having to raise £7bn the additional capital).  </p>

This is the tenor of Mr Daniels’ evidence on the subject. In his written evidence he explained that it was indeed his personal view that Lloyds was well capitalised and not in need of Government money: but that the Tripartite had altered the rules about what “well capitalised” meant. The bare answer to the Select Committee  does not convey that message and (in my view) does not square with the realities of the Recapitalisation Weekend. I do not see how Lloyds could realistically have resisted submitting to the Tripartite’s requirements over the Recapitalisation Weekend and I do not see how (if they did submit) they could realistically have avoided taking Government money (or why Lloyds would have wanted to, given the relatively attractive terms upon which it was available when compared with likely deep discount the market would have required). </p>

Her recollection is that within her own field or speciality she and her team were comfortable with HBOS’s estimated impairments in respect of the retail bank: and I have no doubt that that influenced her approach to other impairment estimates. She had no actual recollection of the meeting. But her present belief as to what she would then have thought about those other estimates is (i) that it would be inappropriate to use internal estimates based on less than full access to HBOS’s books coupled with an assumed downside scenario as a basis for commenting on HBOS’s impairment figures as signed off by HBOS’s management and tested by its auditors; and (ii) that it  would not be appropriate to attempt to put Mr Roughton-Smith’s figures into the HBOS “stagflation” model because of the need for internally consistent assumptions (particularly in relation to RWAs). She asserted that the function of Mr Roughton-Smith’s impairments estimates was to assess how significant the risk would be in a potential downside scenario: “a piece of information to be thoughtful about as part of the overall review of the acquisition”. </p>

He made the points that (i) the impairments analysis was performed at the time when Lloyds was taking a conservative view of the HBOS portfolio and (ii) as an experienced banker he did not think that the Enlarged Group would actually realise all of those impairments as actual losses if the Enlarged Group continued to hold the portfolio of assets until such time as asset prices recovered (and in oral evidence he gave a specific example). In cross-examination he acknowledged that the board did need to understand the impact of impairments upon capital, and that he could not recall an “on-paper” analysis of capital requirements in the light of Mr Roughton-Smith’s latest impairment figures: but he made two points. First, that he would not recommend a capital level to cover a low probability event at the extremity of a range, and that he had never seen a modelling of the most extreme positions. Second, that “factoring in” an input does not necessarily mean taking it as a “driving number”, so that (on his evaluation of the severity of the assumptions made by Mr Roughton-Smith) he factored in his range but did not find it as compelling as to be realistic.  </p>

For his own particular area of responsibility the due diligence returns had been favourable and he regarded the Acquisition as excellent for insurance and investments (as in the event it proved to be). In relation to the broader business it is likely that he stood by his belief that the perceived advantages flowing from the Acquisition outweighed the perceived risks. The advantages he saw were principally (i) the strategic value of HBOS as creating market share for the Enlarged Group, making it No.1 in current accounts, mortgages, savings accounts, personal loans credit cards and household insurance and No.3 in commercial and corporate loans (ii) the creation of synergies which in the near term (2 or 3 years) produced cost savings and (iii) access to HBOS’ successful savings and investment products. The risks he saw were (i) taking on HBOS assets that were exposed to and likely to be affected by an economic downturn (with the consequences that that entailed) and (ii) dealing with HBOS’ liquidity and funding pressures.   As to those, his evidence was that the board tried to make “a probable realistic set of assumptions given a base case and then a stress case”: and where those cases did not produce a single answer:- </p>

He recognised that there were risks for Lloyds in proceeding with the Acquisition, and that the economic circumstances in which the deal was being proposed were unusual: but he considered that it was those very circumstances which provided Lloyds with an opportunity to do a transaction that would not have been possible in more normal circumstances. Overall he considered the Acquisition to be a relatively low risk way of creating significant value for Lloyds shareholders.  </p>

(This last item was clearly his belief: the Claimants’ experts Mr Ellerton and Mr McGregor say the belief was incorrect, whilst the Defendants’ experts Mr Williams and Mr Deetz say it was correct. What matters for present purposes is the existence of the belief and its communication to the board, not its correctness).  </p>

Its relevance to the issues before me is that the attempt generated some material upon which Mr Hill QC relied (i) in support of his argument that there was flexibility in the Government’s views on recapitalisation (and that the requirement upon Lloyds to raise £7 billion as a stand-alone entity was not set in stone); (ii) as undermining what I consider was the general (but not universal) view that HBOS had no independent future; and (iii) in suggesting that it generated confounding “noise” which distracted attention from a story relating to a “leak” of the existence of the Lloyds Repo.  </p>

For example a Newsnight Scotland broadcast on 10 November covered the Spowart intervention, challenged the idea that the nationalisation of HBOS was really the only serious alternative to the Acquisition (not a Scottish intervention) and that Lloyds’ was the “only deal on the table”, raised the issue of the Lloyds Repo and asked whether this surely meant that HBOS was weaker than everybody thought. A fair dissection and canvass of the key issues. The “Daily Telegraph” set the Burt/Mathiewson intervention in a well delineated context which included questions about the Lloyds Repo, whether Lloyds had agreed to take extra financing really destined for HBOS after the merger and the Government’s willingness to nationalise HBOS. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment this is not a true interpretation of the Chancellor’s letter. What I believe the Chancellor was saying was that in the event that the Acquisition collapsed (which would itself be a disruptive event) then it could not be assumed that the current proposed level of recapitalisation would continue to be regarded as sufficient nor could it be assumed that the manner and level of Government participation in any recapitalisation would remain the same. The FSA, having made its assessment of the needs of Lloyds and of HBOS as “stand-alone” banks in current circumstances, would need to make a reassessment in those changed circumstances. My judgment is that the Government was careful to cultivate the element of uncertainty about what would happen to each component part of the Enlarged Group if the Acquisition did not complete, not least because it was anxious to support the Acquisition as a commercial solution to a problem that it would otherwise have to resolve through executive power. That resolution (what the OFT was to describe in its report on competition issues as “the more realistic counterfactual scenario”) was Government intervention to prevent the failure of HBOS by bringing it at least into partial public ownership (if not full public ownership). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The other letter was to Mr Alex Salmond, then the Scottish First Minister. In it the Chancellor explained that when the recapitalisation scheme was triggered the boards of Lloyds and HBOS were minded to merge, and that it was in that expectation that the recapitalisation figures for each bank had been set; but that if for any reason the merger did not go ahead then the FSA would need to reassess <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> banks to determine the extent to which each would need to recapitalise. Once again, I do not think this can be read as an indication that Lloyds might (if it pressed) have been able to negotiate a figure lower than £7bn. The Chancellor was clearly warning Scottish interests that neither the HBOS share of the recapitalisation of the merged bank nor its provisional requirement as a “standalone” bank would stand in the light of a failed merger: but that is all. </p>

The probable inability of HBOS to continue as an independent entity (should the Lloyds takeover fail) was a strong theme, with some form of nationalisation mooted as the probable outcome. Some commentators characterised the Acquisition as a rescue by Lloyds of HBOS from the brink of insolvency (underwritten by a Government guarantee to waive competition issues). Several commented on the disclosure that there had been outflows of corporate and retail deposits in September and early October (prior to the Government “bailout”): the very fact of disclosure by HBOS showed that these were significant, but the absence of any measure left the market guessing exactly how significant. </p>

It is appropriate to deal with it at this point, although in terms of narrative it falls naturally into the next section. In his written evidence Mr Ellerton (called by the Claimants) was inclined to dismiss the work of RiskMetrics as “a single research paper”. In crossexamination he conceded that this under-estimated its significance: and he was right to do so. As cross-examination of some of the Claimants (and disclosure by the Claimants) established:- </p>

He stood by the analysis that he had undertaken in early October 2008, that a base case (that is, the “new base case”) had a 35% probability, a mild recession also a 35% probability, and a “1 in 25” a 15% probability. When challenged he maintained the view that the “mid-case scenario” remained “the most likely outcome”. By “mid-case” Mr Foley meant the midpoint on the spectrum between the “new base case” (“significant downturn”)  and the “credit crunch” scenario (“1 in 15” recession). That was the approach being adopted by Mr Tookey for his medium term plan. Notwithstanding that affirmation the Board asked for further work to be done on different scenarios. </p>

Mr Foley was (justly) a very highly respected economist, conservative in approach and thorough in analysis. He could not know, as he made his presentation, that the economy stood on the brink of a “1 in 60” or possibly a “1 in 200” recession. His forecasts as to the course of the recession were more conservative than those currently being adopted by BoE, the Treasury and the IMF.

It is difficult to discern from the surviving slide presentation exactly what was said. But the thrust seems to have been that Lloyds itself had made impairment provisioning in accordance with the views of Ms Sergeant and Mr Roughton-Smith, that the HBOS plan for the same period used similar assumptions, that “fair value adjustments will protect group income from further HBOS impairments beyond their plan”. Mr Tookey’s notes indicate that he spoke (or intended to speak) about “fair value” issues (alongside which he had written “Be very careful”). The topics  covered (or to be covered) were the issue of “unwind” and the impact of Mr Roughton-Smith’s views. Certainly the board would have needed an explanation that FVAs assessed as at the date of completion would have an immediate impact upon capital (subject to adjustment as events unfolded) whereas forecast impairments would not impact upon capital until the impairments were recognised as losses.  </p>

The article stated that Lloyds was secretly providing financial support to HBOS through £10 billion loan facility, but it did not develop the story. It instead moved on to a proposal by two Scottish businessmen (rivals to the Spowart bid that I have referred to above) that HBOS should kept independent with additional capital provided by the government because they felt that HBOS shareholders were getting a raw deal. (There were, incidentally, rumours of interest from Bank of China and the Spanish bank BBVA). The “Daily Telegraph” picked up the “Lloyds’ loan” story on 10 November 2008,  reporting that analysts considered that £10bn was a small figure compared to HBOS’s balance sheet of some £700bn but a very large loan for a normal transaction in the interbank market.

Mr Hill QC fairly pointed out that this was in part because the Lloyds’ news management machine swung into action. This promoted the view  that there was no £10bn “loan” (an accurate statement since that was the ceiling on a particular facility and one which had never been fully drawn), that as part of “ordinary course” Lloyds provided interbank funds of various maturities, and that Lloyds was very comfortable that the Circular made appropriate disclosure of everything required. Whether this was (as Mr Hill QC charged) an attempt to dampen public attention or was (as Mr Parr preferred) a proper response to press speculation in the light of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules matters not. The fact is that the strong story had no statistically significant impact on the Lloyds or the HBOS share price. </p>

There is a range of different central bank funding arrangements in which HBOS is eligible to participate, both within the United Kingdom and overseas. As with many other banks, HBOS makes use of a number of these arrangements to assist with its funding and liquidity management. The general purpose of such arrangements is to allow a bank to pledge or enter into a repurchase agreement in respect of collateral for varying periods of time in exchange for Treasury Bills or cash funding. The HBOS Group expects that it will substantially rely for the foreseeable future on the continued availability of these government-sponsored arrangements, including central bank liquidity facilities such as those offered by the Bank of England as well as HM Treasury’s guarantee scheme for short and medium term debt issuance. ” </p>

Sir Victor replied by stating that that was the figure that the FSA had determined was appropriate, and that satisfying the government was a prerequisite for access to some government funding. A later questioner returned to the topic, asking why Lloyds had to raise £7bn as a “standalone” bank but only £5.5bn as part of the Enlarged Group, and why that £7bn was greater in proportion than the additional capital required by a standalone HBOS, and what steps the Lloyds board had taken to investigate raising additional capital on the market. Sir Victor responded that those were the figures required by the government, but if the £7 billion was not raised then the bank would not have access to the liquidity funding arrangements that the government has made available, that the view of investment bankers was that it would not be possible to raise the money privately and that if it had been then it would be very expensive. </p>

Fair value adjustments represent a point in time assessment of the value of the assets and liabilities and whilst there is some relationship, there is no direct link to future impairment losses.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">There was, however, one countervailing factor emerging. It related to the acquisition accounting treatment of HBOS’ own debt in issuance. On the occasion of an acquisition the accounting standards (IFRS3 “Business Combinations”) require that the assets and liabilities of the target should be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as at the acquisition date at “fair value”. “Fair value” is not face value of the debt, but that value adjusted by reference to movements in interest rates since issue and any movement in the issuer’s credit spread. It may be recalled that a comparison between (i) the price that the acquirer is paying and (ii) the net fair value of the fair valued assets and the fair valued liabilities being acquired will produce a figure for “goodwill”: and that an ability to capture “negative goodwill” has a favourable impact on regulatory capital.  </p>

But further consideration of the detailed accounting standards (led by UBS but with review by PwC) led to a revision of this view. The Lloyds specialist team came to think that it <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> appropriate to include the effect of a “fair value” adjustment to HBOS’ own debt, thereby reducing its face value. This had a favourable effect on regulatory capital: the eventual benefit was about 100bps. When the point was put to the FSA (in January 2009) it agreed : the FSA had no objection to Lloyds “fair valuing” the HBOS debt on completion in calculating the consolidated group regulatory capital ratios. Thenceforth, market deterioration which had the effect of reducing the fair value of the net assets being acquired also had the effect of reducing the fair value of the liabilities of HBOS. The point was neatly put in an Enlarged Group Audit Committee paper of 10 December 2009 (from which I quote to illustrate the point, not to establish the figures):- </p>

This seems counterintuitive given the credit risk concerns surrounding the HBOS loan book.

On the afternoon of 18 January 2009 the Chancellor informed Mr Daniels that the Government would be releasing unfavourable economic news on the Monday along with further measures to support bank lending in the light of the intensity of the downturn over the preceding two months.   Amongst the unfavourable economic news was that the final quarter of 2008 had shown a decline in GDP of 1.5% (the sharpest quarterly contraction for 28 years). HBOS informed UBS and Merrill Lynch that all HBOS lending businesses were under extreme pressure with respect to impairments as the economy continued to deteriorate and at great pace, but stood by its impairment assessment (which as at 10 December 2008 was £7.25bn, and confirmed at that figure in the “out-turn status report” a month later).

With the merger with Lloyds assured (having been approved by the both the Lloyds and the HBOS shareholders) and the proceeds of the open offer and the recapitalisation in immediate prospect (and further boosted by the sale of the Bankwest business unit on 19 December 2008), HBOS began paying down the ELA. The process was eased by the fact that HBOS was able to securitise the collateral that supported the ELA into a form acceptable for mainstream SLS. By 16 January 2009 HBOS had repaid all ELA and was reliant on SLS and market funding (including debt issued under the credit guarantee programme). </p>

Its importance in the present context is that it a clear indicator that the economic situation was significantly worse than had been anticipated in October and called for an additional response from the Tripartite over and above that provided during the Recapitalisation Weekend, which had been intended to “bullet-proof” UK banks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">It was in this context that HBOS (which post-Acquisition had a new board) issued a revised impairments forecast on 23 January 2009. The total impairments for 2008 were now estimated to be £9.3bn (in place of the original HBOS estimate of £3.7bn uplifted only a few days before first to £7.25bn and then to £7.6bn). This certainly reflected an acceleration in the anticipated impairments (bringing forward into 2008 impairments that had been anticipated to occur in 2009): but did not of itself indicate an overall increase in impairments. However, there was also an increase in the anticipated impairments for 2009: HBOS now estimated £10.2 bn (in place of  an original figure of £4.2bn). As Mr Hill QC emphasised, these increased HBOS figures in fact remained more-or-less within Mr Roughton-Smith’s 29 October 2008 range. In an assumed “1 in 15” scenario for 2008 Mr Roughton-Smith had estimated a top-of-the-range figure of between £8bn-£9bn.  In an assumed  “1 in 15” scenario for 2009 Mr Roughton-Smith had estimated impairments at £6.5bn-£10.1bn, and in an assumed “1 in 25” estimated impairments in the range of  £10.25bn-£16.6bn. It is notable that no director is recorded as suggesting that the Acquisition had proceeded on the footing that Mr RoughtonSmith’s views had been more benign: which I think tends to confirm that at the board meeting on 29 October 2018 Mr Tookey had conveyed the import of Mr RoughtonSmith’s then-current estimates. Lloyds of course had not proceeded on the basis of Mr Roughton-Smith’s most pessimistic impairments forecast (because of the low probability of its occurrence), but on the basis of the anticipated net negative capital adjustment of £10bn (informed by but not based on impairment forecasts). So the impact of these revisions upon Lloyds’ assumed post-acquisition scenario had to be examined.  </p>

In the case of HBOS the budgeted profit anticipated for 2009 as at October 2008 had been £2.1bn, but was now revised to a net loss of £2.3bn. The revision was attributable to a sharp rise in the HBOS impairments for 2009. This reduction in HBOS’ anticipated 2009 profits (because of increased impairments) in fact formed the budgeted loss for the Enlarged Group. The impact of this loss on capital was dramatic. Assuming  the least severe of the outcomes in a “1 in 25” scenario the Core Tier 1 capital ratio dropped to 5.2% during 2009 and on the most severe outcome “1 in 25” scenario to 4.1% even allowing for partial mitigation by means of a FVA “unwind”.

First, as Mr Hill QC noted in crossexamining Mr Tookey, Mr Daniels and Mr du Plessis, whilst it was true that the actual HBOS impairments exceeded the Lloyds due diligence estimate, the Acquisition had been approved not on the basis of the Lloyds due diligence impairment assessment but upon the PwC assessment of the net negative capital adjustment required, which incorporated HBOS’ estimates (the Lloyds own due diligence estimates serving only as cross-checks to the resulting conclusion). Second, the “capital position” at completion was now estimated to be 6.41% (and so within the target range). Third, the reference to the “benefit of a lower fair value charge” is a reference to fair valuing of HBOS’ own debt: this underpinned the capital ratio at completion but would have an adverse impact on future capital ratios as it unwound.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0.00in">Having completed his analysis of the current position Mr Tookey moved to predict the 2009 out-turn and to assess its impact on capital ratios. His central assessment was that the capital ratio would fall at the year-end to 5% (i.e. below the target range) even assuming the Enlarged Group set and achieved a targeted reduction in RWAs of £8bn. But on a slide entitled “Risks and Opportunities” Mr Tookey warned that adverse conditions (in particular further impairments in 2009 over and above those then forecast) might bring the ratio down further. In fact, if the upper end of Mr RoughtonSmith’s 2009 “1 in 25” impairment estimate was reached the Core Tier 1 ratio would be reduced to 4.1% (at which level the concern would not be limited to regulatory capital requirements but would extend to liquidity issues): the presentation slide did not so state.  </p>

The Government’s January 2009 investment of £17.7bn of new capital into the Enlarged Group lost £8.3bn of its value.

On 23 February 2009 Mr Tookey explained the latest provisional position to the board (“provisional” because the work would extend over months). The overall message was calming. In the Circular the shareholders had been told that net negative capital adjustments of £10bn after tax would be needed to HBOS’ financial position. The figure now anticipated (taking into account not only FVAs but also other accounting adjustments such as the elimination of the AFS reserves) was £3.7bn, giving a Core Tier 1 ratio at completion of 6.4%: but this was because the Enlarged Group was going to claim a credit of £11.3bn post tax in respect of HBOS’ own debt.

He was also asked about the due diligence undertaken. His response was that Lloyds had put 5000 man days into the effort (a great part of which was done not by Lloyds staff but by accountants and investment bankers). Asked if he had had more time, how many manhours he would have expected to put in he said:- </p>

This led to discussions between the Government and the Commission and between the Government and the Enlarged Group about whether a restructuring plan was required.  The view of those involved at the time was that Lloyds was a fundamentally sound bank, and that its taking over HBOS and subjecting HBOS to more conservative management was of itself a sufficient avoidance of “moral hazard”. So even if a restructuring plan was required  the Lloyds’ business plan would suffice without significant divestment. But on 25 February 2009 the Commission reversed this policy and announced that the submission of a restructuring plan would be required whenever a bank had received State aid in excess of 2% of its RWAs, the question of whether a bank was or was not “fundamentally sound” going only to the extent of the compensatory measures required. By now the HBOS horrors had emerged, jeopardising the view that Lloyds was “fundamentally sound”, and opening up the possibility of divestments being required. This undoubtedly coloured the consideration of the restructuring plan which the Enlarged Group submitted in July 2009. When eventually the Commission announced its decision in November 2009 it was to the effect that Lloyds had to dispose of the TSB franchise.   </p>

Its central observation is in these terms:- </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“The various HBOS impairments forecasts for aggregate 2008/9 are set out in the table below. These show that, even at 9 February 2009 - after intensive post Day 1 reviews by [Enlarged Group] teams – the due diligence forecast of 29 October 2008 was still remarkably accurate. It is worth noting that the accuracy of our due diligence based forecast (made in the depths of a severe recession) was very substantially greater than other banks forecasts of their own results. The actual HBOS impairments for 2008/9 of £29.6 billion are 14% greater than the £25.9 billion top end of our due diligence forecast range. This is because the recession suffered in 2009 was much deeper than the 1 in 25 year recession we had assumed in October 2008. The Economist magazine has stated (9 January 2010) that the UK recession is the longest and deepest since the Second World War. The recession has exhibited worst or close to worst simultaneous deterioration in many areas of the economy in the post-war period, including equity markets, interbank market, commercial property market and housing market. The recession has hit HBOS particularly hard because of its massive, highly leveraged exposure to commercial real estate both in the UK and overseas (Ireland, US Australia). We therefore consider the current recession to be a one in 60+ year event for HBOS. ” </p>

The sense I get from the evidence is that it was the speed of on-set and the all-embracing nature of the recession as much as its depth and length that caught the financial world unawares and generated the difficulties for the Enlarged Group. In October 2008 the IMF forecast that in 2009 UK GDP would dip by 0.1%. Within 6 months it had amended that to  -4.1%. In its PreBudget Report in November 2008 the Treasury said that growth for 2009 was going to be negative at -0.75% to -1.25%: it was in fact 4.8% negative. As Sir Mervyn King was to acknowledge in the “2012 BBC Today Programme Lecture” even the Bank of England had not imagined the scale of the disaster that would occur when known risks crystallised. When reviewing judgments made in October/November 2008 the subsequent sense of shock at what happened thereafter is vital context. </p>

It is the company that may bring an action for any breach of duty: if it does not, but an individual shareholder does wish to pursue the company’s claim, then the individual shareholder must obtain permission to commence a derivative action on behalf of the company. The directors are therefore not vexed (nor the Courts burdened) by multiple actions by individual shareholders each seeking to prove his or her own formulation of an alleged breach of a duty owed directly to him or her and to establish his or her own individual loss. If (as is argued by the Claimants) the Acquisition was not a good deal and Lloyds paid £6bn for a worthless HBOS through the failure of the directors to exercise the degree of skill and care required of them by s.174 of the Companies Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) in the performance of the duty imposed on them by s.172 of the 2006 Act to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, then that is something of which Lloyds can complain - either itself or through a shareholder acting on its behalf.  </p>

The duties of a bank director may differ widely from those of the insurance director, and the due duties of a director of one insurance company may differ from those of the director of another. In one company, for instance, matters may normally be attended to by the manager or other members of staff that in another company are attended to by the directors themselves. The larger the business carried on by the company the more numerous, and the more important, the matters that must of necessity be left to the managers, the accountants and the rest of the staff. The manner in which the work of the company is to be distributed between the board of directors and the staff is in truth a business matter to be decided on business lines… In order therefore to ascertain the duties that a person appointed to the board of an established company undertakes to perform, it is necessary to consider not only the nature of the company’s business, but also the manner in which the work of the company is in fact distributed between the directors and the other officials of the company, provided always that this distribution is a reasonable one in the circumstances, and is not inconsistent with any express provisions of the articles of association.” </p>

In so doing he was not, as I think, saying that something less than an ordinary degree of prudence might in some circumstances be acceptable: he was rather saying that the functions undertaken by the director (themselves affected by the nature of the company of which he was a director) might require something more than the ordinary degree of prudence but could never exceed the degree of skill that might reasonably be expected from a person having the knowledge and experience of the director in question. So the director of a life insurance company does not guarantee that he has the skill of an actuary or a physician, but is expected to have the degree of skill that might reasonably be expected of someone who has undertaken to discharge the functions of a director of a life insurance company. It is in that sense that I think his words must today (in the light of the statutory codification) be read. </p>

By this I understand him to mean that where the opinions of reasonably informed and competent directors might differ over, for example, some entrepreneurial decision, the mere fact that a director makes what proves to be clearly the wrong choice does not make him liable for the consequences. When embarking upon a transaction a director does not guarantee or warrant the success of the venture. Risk is an inherent part of any venture (whether it is called “entrepreneurial” or not). A director is called upon (in the light of the material and the time available) to assess and make a judgment upon that risk in determining the future course of the company. Where a director honestly holds the belief that a particular course is in the best interests of the company then a complainant must show that the director’s belief is one which no reasonable director in the same circumstances could have entertained. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">First, I do not think the facts objectively disclose any assumption of responsibility. The key concept underpinning company law is that the company is a separate person distinct from its directors. So, an announcement to the market made by a company is not to be treated <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto</span> as an announcement by its individual directors. The cardinal principle of company law is that directors owe their duties to the company but not (subject to established exceptions) to individual shareholders. The imposition of a direct duty of care owed by each director to each shareholder in relation to the contents of an announcement runs counter to those fundamental principles and requires strong justification. Mr Hill QC cited no case in support of the assertion (in paragraph 276 of the Claimants’ Closing) that the imposition of such a duty did not involve any extension to the law of negligence. To my mind, it is a big leap to make directors personally liable for an announcement to the market made by a company (even if that announcement records, as inevitably it will in a takeover context, that the directors believe the deal worth doing). I think that before the Defendant directors are to be treated as having objectively assumed personal responsibility to each recipient of the Announcement for the contents of that Announcement it would be necessary to establish something more than their routine involvement in its production. I have reached this view from a consideration of first principles:  but as will be apparent from the language I have used </p>

They also required (by LR 10.5.1(2)) Lloyds to send an explanatory circular to Lloyds shareholders: and the Acquisition had to be conditional upon the approval of the Lloyds shareholders in the light of that circular.

Rule 2.2 required Lloyds to make a public announcement of the offer once a firm intention to make an offer was notified to the HBOS board and/or when, following an approach by Lloyds, HBOS was the subject of rumour and speculation.

So, the Announcement was by Lloyds and HBOS saying that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition, and it set out the then-proposed terms. Rule 19.1 of the Code required the Announcement (as a document issued during the course of the offer) to be prepared with the highest standards of care and accuracy, and for the information given to be adequately and fairly represented. That ensured that the purpose of the announcement to the market (the protection of its integrity) was achieved. </p>

I agree. But as Oliver Wendell Holmes famously observed (<span style="font-style:italic">The Common Law</span>, 1881) “the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience”. In my view commercial experience tells us that a regulatory announcement by a company providing information to the market at the very outset of a transaction is something distinctly and immediately recognisably different from the personal assumption of responsibility by an individual director for the provision of advice to an individual shareholder about how eventually to respond to the transaction. Whether we identify this difference as a matter of “proximity” (that in a standard market announcement there are no special circumstances such as would create a special relationship between the individual director and the individual shareholder) or of policy </p>

I do not agree. As I understood the Defendants’ case it was that the function of the Announcement was for predator and target (i.e. Lloyds and HBOS) to inform the market generally of the existence of the proposed agreed takeover and of its terms so as to forestall the opportunity to conduct any “insider dealing” in the shares of Lloyds or of HBOS. The offer was plainly endorsed by both boards, and the market was so informed. That is my view of the function of the Announcement. In the light of the information provided in the Announcement some existing Lloyds shareholders might want to sell their shares (as at least one of the Claimants did), others to keep them: others in the market might want to buy Lloyds shares (as the evidence shows some did) or (as others did) HBOS shares.

The Announcement was to the market at large: it was not aimed at Lloyds shareholders.  If the Announcement functioned as advice and recommendation as to action then it is difficult to see why it was not advice to all addressees, potential purchasers of Lloyds or HBOS shares or current holders of HBOS shares as well as current holders of Lloyds shares. But that would be to create a liability to a large and indeterminate class, a contra-indication to the imposition of a duty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, Ms Davies QC draws attention to the fact that in a similar regulatory regime (concerning “investment-focused” disclosures to the market) section 90A of FSMA provides that an investor who has suffered loss as a result of reliance on misleading published information when buying, selling, or holding securities (other than information in listing particulars) may recover compensation from the company if the directors knew or were reckless as to whether the statement was untrue or misleading or were dishonestly concealing a material fact.   There the statutory regime both identifies the circumstances of recovery and also the nature of the conduct that establishes liability. By contrast in what have been called “governance-based disclosures” (see <span style="font-style:italic">Gullifer &amp; Payne “Corporate Finance Law” 2</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ed </span>para. 11.4.1.1) Parliament has not provided for recovery.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">This is not a strong point: but it suggests a cautious approach to the imposition of liability. In my judgment, in the context of governance-focused and investment-focused regulatory regimes Parliament has decided what should be done and how, and what the consequences of not doing it should be (and upon what basis). Given that regulatory context some caution is therefore required of a Court before (i) recharacterizing the action of making the Announcement (by treating the provision of information as the </p>

This does not mean that individual directors could with impunity make false or misleading statements to the market.  Each director was bound to act honestly and not deceitfully towards the market, and each director owed a duty to Lloyds to exercise reasonable skill and care in deciding what should be released to the market and in what terms.  </p>

The evidence they did adduce pointed in the opposite direction. The Claimants therefore set about seeking to establish that this was not a case of nuanced decision-making, but was well outside any margin of appreciation that might be allowed. It was a case of self-evident irrationality where the circumstances were of such a character, so plain, so manifest that no person with an ordinary degree of prudence would have recommended the Acquisition. The submission was that this was a case in which critical information was not subjected to any proper degree of evaluation, and where the consequences were neither scrutinised nor catered for. On the state of the expert evidence I doubt that this course is open. But since so much effort has been expended and after so many thousands of pages of expert evidence filed and so lengthy a trial it would be unjust to the Claimants not to address it. </p>

I accept that receipt of ELA eventually followed by full nationalisation under the Banking Powers (Special Provisions) Act 2008 might do so, as was ultimately established in relation to Northern Rock in July 2009 when the Court of Appeal decided <span style="text-decoration:underline">SRM Global Master Fund LP v Treasury Commissioners</span> [2009] EWCA Civ 788. But even there, before the announcement of that decision I consider that a reasonable director contemplating the possible consequences of a full nationalisation of HBOS might reasonably have held the view that upon nationalisation the government was acquiring assets of significant value to which its advance of ELA had made  no contribution and for which it would have to compensate the owners (the shareholders). So reasonable directors, considering an acquisition of HBOS in November 2008 against a backdrop of potential partial or full nationalisation could in my judgment reasonably take the view that the use by HBOS of ELA did not deprive HBOS of <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>value. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The essence of the Claimants’ argument was that receipt of ELA demonstrates cashflow insolvency. Insolvency means that HBOS was not a going concern. This means it had only a “breakup value”. A “break up” sale would have led to the disposal of (unattractive) assets on a value destructive basis such that there would have been a deficiency and no value for HBOS shareholders. Between 2008 and 2011 HBOS had impairment losses of £52.8bn (largely on its book as it stood in October 2008) which exceeded the value of its assets at June 2008. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept this argument. Because of the business model of banks (“borrow short, lend long”) there will be frequent mismatches which are covered by an injection of liquidity by the central bank: and support systems exist for the purpose of funding banks through periods of illiquidity. Illiquidity is not the same as insolvency. The state of insolvency requires more than illiquidity on a “snap-shot” view.  The Tripartite would not have advanced ELA if HBOS was insolvent (as opposed to temporarily illiquid) and it would not have permitted insolvency to occur. It would have met cashflow needs as they arose until such time as HBOS established a permanent and credible basis for future viability, which might have taken the form of a partially nationalised HBOS in which there would have continued to be a body of (diluted) HBOS shareholders (as Mr MacGregor and Mr Williams agree). If for strategic reasons Lloyds wanted HBOS, then Lloyds had to put an offer to such shareholders of more than nothing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, in assessing commercial logic one must in my judgment be careful to identify the precise “value” question. We are not here concerned with an abstract and acontextual valuation question: the issue is – did HBOS have value <span style="font-style:italic">to Lloyds</span>? The Claimants’ expert Mr MacGregor recognised this when he wrote in his report that “it is possible that HBOS had a value on the Acquisition by [Lloyds] which it did not have on a standalone basis”: and confirmed that view in cross-examination. Mr Ellerton for his part regarded it as “obvious” that the transaction could have value for Lloyds even if by some other measure HBOS was worth nothing. That offer had to be put in November 2008, before it could be known that over the next 3 years such a deep recession would occur that impairments on the loan book as it stood in October 2008 would not be covered by the earnings it generated and would wipe out its value. </p>

Such a move (and the attribution of value to these economic benefits) did not lack a rational basis nor was it a glaring and obvious commercial misjudgement.  To put it another way, Lloyds shareholders were not being asked to buy HBOS shares: they  were being invited to share in the “upside” of an Enlarged Group, and there was a rational basis for thinking that there was an “upside”.  </p>

My first reason is that Mr MacGregor acknowledged that he had not actually undertaken a valuation of HBOS, and that his opinion was founded (i) on the proposition that there was insufficient information available to the directors when they decided to proceed on 13 October 2008 and (ii) on the assumption that in the absence of sufficient information the default position was that HBOS was without value.

By October 2008 this was out-of-date because the HBOS rights issue was a postbalance sheet event.  This net asset disclosure plus the rights issue (plus the capital to be injected over the Recapitalisation Weekend) gave HBOS net assets of £33.6bn. From this Mr MacGregor deducted impairments and FVAs as estimated on 10 October 2008 (rather than impairments and FVA as estimated on, say, 29 October 2008). He did so on a pre-tax basis: PwC (along with the investment banks) worked on a post-tax basis, but Mr MacGregor did not explain why they could not (as competent practitioners) do so and why only his approach was permissible. He also made his deductions on the basis that these impairments and adjustments were certain to occur, rather than by reference to any probability of occurrence. He also assumed that there would be no offsetting income arising during the period over which the impairments arose. He then allowed nothing for the net present value of conservatively estimated synergies of £1.5bn per annum. Lloyds internally was putting the NPV of these synergies at £10bn and the market externally at some £7.5bn-£9bn: and Mr MacGregor acknowledged that if he had undertaken the exercise using his discount rates he would have come out at </p>

Having summarised Mr MacGregor’s approach, the short point I want to make is that in order to sustain his opinion that HBOS had no value Mr MacGregor has had to make a number of adverse assumptions or decisions (“adverse” in the sense that they have as their object  the reduction in the value of HBOS). But Mr MacGregor gave no evidence that reasonable directors would of necessity have assumed all the worst scenarios and ignored all the benefits: and I can see no reason why they should do so. Indeed, if one amended Mr MacGregor’s own table to take into account the fresh capital raised and to allow a low figure for synergies one soon reaches a positive value of £4.1bn. </p>

It relied on the accuracy and completeness of material that was publicly available (including a range of broker estimates) or had been provided by Mr Pietruska and his team (on a “realistic” scenario), or by HBOS (on a “realistic” and a “pessimistic” scenario). The different methodologies produced a wide  range of values, largely because in times of stress methodologies which rely on stock prices will diverge from those that do not. But all were positive i.e. HBOS was worth something between £4.6bn (price/tangible book value) and £44.1bn (historical market capitalisation). The wide range of course tells its own story about the reliability of any individual valuation: but the general picture was that HBOS was not valueless. It is the unchallenged personal view of Mr McGregor (for the Claimants) that this extensive UBS model with its multiple inputs and methodologies is not based on sufficient work and analysis to provide a reliable valuation of HBOS: but he cannot and does not say that every director of reasonable competence would have entirely ignored and placed no reliance upon it, for it used entirely conventional valuation methods current within the analyst community. </p>

I agree with Dr Berndt’s insightful comment  that as a reasonably competent director you do not base your judgment on extremes or on one input, because “the risk management team do not run the business”. It is necessary instead to take a fair and balanced view on what you think are the realities, based on probabilities. I think Mr Tate was making the same point when he drew a distinction between taking a figure (such as an impairment estimate) as a “hard number” that “drives” the transaction and treating  it as a number that  has to be “taken into account” in reaching “a reasonable number taking into account the extremes”.  I would note that by way of contrast with Mr MacGregor, Mr Ellerton was disposed to accept that there was a whole spectrum of views about what was  a reasonable price for HBOS at the time of the Announcement, and that that spectrum included the original offer price. So, it has not been established to my satisfaction that the only fair and balanced view on a proper assessment of the risks in November 2008 was that HBOS had no value at all, such that a share exchange should not have been contemplated. </p>

Second, because Lloyds had to prepare a prospectus for the open offer to be made by the Enlarged Group.

Of the retail book, he said that account-level analysis would take weeks and was unlikely to lead to an alteration in the present forecast. Of Treasury assets he said that a statistically significant sample had been analysed and that further work was unlikely to produce more precise results. Of the international portfolio (which included Australian and Irish business) Mr RoughtonSmith acknowledged that a greater level of comfort could be obtained by a deal-level review, but noted that that would raise confidentiality and commerciality concerns: he made no recommendation that further work be undertaken. In relation to the private equity and joint venture portfolios he said that the robustness of the calculations could be improved but that the anticipated output itself would not be materially different because of the existing forecast write-offs.

The capital summary showed a Core Tier 1 ratio at above 6% for the next 12-month period on a base case, but below 6% (and falling to 5.1%) during the next 12-month period on the downside. In both scenarios there remained a very substantial “buffer” over the 4% minimum Core Tier 1 ratio (which permitted an additional £6.9bn of impairments or FVAs to be taken). </p>

(Note that this is a maximum £14.2 billion since a portion of the FVA unwinds in 2009). This number is broken down as to £4.2 billion for HBOS full year 2008, £4.2 billion for 2009 and £5.8 billion for the impairment component of the FVA…. What I should say here is that the assumption of an unchanged impairment charge in 2009 was completely unrealistic and the scenario is made even more unrealistic and optimistic by the assumption that the £5.8 billion impairment component within the FVA would begin to unwind in 2009. The range identified by Lloyds for HBOS impairments for 2008 and 2009 was £14 billion-£19.4 billion. I get this range by taking the £10.8 billion-£15.4 billion referenced above (i.e. £9.5 billion-£14.1 billion and £1.3 billion for H1 2008 impairments) and adding to £3.2 billion-£4 billion of items reclassified from the FVA analysis. The difference between the top end of the range £19.4 billion and the number actually used in the Price Waterhouse scenario £14.2 billion was £5.2 billion pre-tax, equivalent to £3.74 billion after tax. The £3.74 billion, had it been incorporated into the projections, would have lowered the Core Tier1 ratio by 0.72 percentage points, from the low of 6.1% identified in the Price Waterhouse report base case to 5.38%. At this level I consider that the Enlarged Group would have been required to raise £5.8 billion to bring the Core Tier 1 ratio back up to 6.5% .” </p>

He believed that in doing so Mr Ellerton had made a number of high-level and ambitious assumptions and had distorted the outcome. Thus, in his commentary Mr Ellerton assumed that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio to be maintained by the board was 6.5% (the mid-point of the range announced to the market) rather than 6% (the regulatory threshold). But he conceded that the board might reasonably have looked to the 6% figure when assessing the Acquisition. Further, Mr Ellerton always took the highest figure in a range to be the material outcome and assumed that capital had to maintained at a level to cope with the extreme worst case scenario. Again, Mr Ellerton certainly had distorted the outcome by, for example, assuming that an entire year’s impairments fell to be taken in a single month (rather than accruing month by month over the year); and further assuming that the month in which they fell to be taken was the one month in which for other reasons the capital ratio was at its most stretched. </p>

Mr Tookey (as did Ms Weir and Dr Berndt) strongly resisted the propriety of lifting figures prepared on one set of assumptions and dropping them into a set of figures prepared on another. I am not convinced by this objection because (i) the assumptions, although different in detail, are meant to reflect overall the same macro-economic scenario; and (ii) the purpose of the exercise is to provide a cross-check and the PwC working capital model had incorporated some material from Mr Roughton-Smith’s impairments workings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The risk of a capital raise may be summarised in this way. Each of the Defendant directors acknowledged that if the Core Tier 1 ratio dipped below 6% then (i) that would be acceptable only on an interim basis and (ii) the board would have to formulate and submit to the FSA a plan to restore the ratio within an appropriate timeframe. (On reading my notes and studying the transcripts it has become apparent to me that the questions did not frame the scenario within which the Core Tier 1 ratio dipped. Did it fall below 6% in ordinary economic conditions? Or in a “credit crunch”? or in a deep “1 in 25” recession. That affects how long “interim” is and what is the “timeframe”). It was Mr Ellerton’s view that even before the regulatory minimum ratios were approached the market would have forced Lloyds to raise more capital. In my judgment this overstates the position. I accept this opinion to the extent that if the market saw or anticipated a downward trend in the Core Tier 1 ratio such that the regulatory threshold (and the bottom end of Lloyds’ stated target range) was going to be breached, then in the absence of a clear and coherent management action plan it would not tolerate that position for long but would begin to price in a capital raise. The period of tolerance would be influenced by the attitude of the Tripartite. In a period of real systemic stress the Tripartite was prepared to accept a Core Tier 1 ratio of 4% and would be unlikely to require a restoration of the 2% “buffer” by any means or according to any timescale that increased the stress within the financial system: so the “interim” was variable. </p>

These adjustments and their rationale were set out in the text of the report: a director reading the report would have seen it recorded that Lloyds and HBOS management and economists had compared their respective economic assumptions and made the necessary adjustments. The reader would know that PwC would  report upon any unrealistic assumption in that regard also: and would observe that the report did not so state. A competent director would see from the report that the Core Tier 1 ratio was forecast (i) to remain above 6% on the base case throughout the forecast period; (ii) to be below 6% in the stressed downside scenario returning (even in the absence of any management action) to 5.9% by March 2010; and (iii) to maintain a substantial buffer at all times over the 4% Core Tier 1 ratio acceptable in a severe stress (equivalent to further impairments of £6.9bn). Such a director would not ignore the warning that the economic assumptions on which these forecasts were based might worsen so that there was a residual risk  of a worse outcome. But there would be nothing on the face of the report itself to suggest to someone lacking Mr Ellerton’s skills and experience that PwC and the Lloyds specialist team had failed in some way to adjust fully for any optimism in the underlying HBOS forecasts.  </p>

Mr Ellerton would concede that it was “somewhat worse” than the consensus and was “faintly conservative” but “was reasonable”. So, if what was needed was “flex” or a margin for error in the forecasts, the Lloyds approach built that in. </p>

It is, of course, right that KPMG were the auditors to HBOS and were working on figures provided by HBOS. But that does not of itself mean (and the evidence certainly did not establish) that upon that account the figures should be ignored by any competent Lloyds director. This Working Capital Report was part of the “due diligence” package arranged by highly experienced solicitors who had ensured that KPMG acknowledged a direct duty to the Lloyds’ board. It was not suggested to any Defendant director that there was something on the face of the KPMG Report which indicated that its contents were suspect or that would have alerted any competent director to the need for further enquiry. </p>

Of course, the sponsor banks put their names to the Circular recommending the Acquisition to the Lloyds shareholders (and of itself that could properly weigh with the directors). But the precise point under consideration here is whether every competent director would have appreciated from the terms of the investment banks’ advice that there was a significant risk of a dilutive capital raise in the 12 months following the completion of the Acquisition. To expand upon “the terms of the investment banks’ advice”:  given that the advice given by each of the banks did not flag up any such risk, the question is really whether a competent director should have appreciated that the omission of such advice resulted from a deficit in information or analysis or the making of some unrealistic assumption by the banks (such as Mr Ellerton suggests occurred). The investment banks were addressees of PwC’s report and were retained to review it. No feature of their work was identified as alerting any competent director to some inadequacy of information, some shortcoming in analysis or the adoption of some unrealistic assumption.  </p>

The fact that some risks to Lloyds as part of the Enlarged Group did not eventuate whereas rather greater risks eventuated for HBOS than had been anticipated (so that the resources of the Enlarged Group ended up supporting HBOS not Lloyds) would not prove that the initial allocation was wrong: and certainly could not establish that any director of reasonable competence would see that the Tripartite had manifestly failed to “bullet proof” HBOS (whether as a “standalone” bank or as part of the Enlarged Group).

The question is not whether many competent directors would have disagreed with the course taken by the Lloyds board: it is whether no reasonably competent director could have shared the view of the Lloyds board, so that their recommendation of the Acquisition to the Lloyds shareholders lay outside the range of responses reasonably open to competent directors.  </p>

With one caveat, it was common ground between experts that it was reasonable for the Lloyds board to take into account forecast EPS and, indeed, that it was “a critical metric” or “a key focus for assessing the merits of the acquisition” (as the Defendants’ own expert evidence stated). The one caveat was that at one point Mr MacGregor seemed to suggest that in October 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>forecasting operation should have been undertaken.

This exceeded by a substantial margin what was required in the “downside” scenarios then in contemplation.

Indeed (i) the market regarded it as an understatement of what was likely to be achievable (ii) the internally produced “stretch” case went up to £2.3bn and (iii) the internally produced “base” case was over £1.8bn-worth of synergies, but Lloyds announced only £1.5bn (leaving “headroom” of at least £300m).   The estimate was the product of some 28,000 hours of work by Lloyds and by Deloitte, verified by PwC. It was a modest and wellgrounded target. But the Claimants expert Mr MacGregor nonetheless expressed the view that the directors could not have been sure of how much of the value of the synergies would actually be realised for three reasons. First, because of “dis-synergies”. Second because of a risk of restructuring. Third, because on a takeover the marriage value of synergies should be shared between predator and target. In my judgment none of these “deficits” would have caused every reasonably competent director to regard the anticipated synergies as so at risk that they should be left out of account in assessing the overall risk-benefit analysis the Acquisition. </p>

The board was not blind to this risk. It was warned on 24 October 2008 that the requirement to submit a restructuring plan could potentially require a breakup or significant downsizing of the Enlarged Group which might negate some of the merger benefits. The task for the board was (i) to estimate the significance of that risk to the achievement of the cost synergies and (ii) to assess what risk the non-achievement of the cost synergies posed to the benefit of the transaction as a whole. </p>

In his report he argued that since synergies were generated by the combination of predator and target and since all shareholders would share in the enlarged business it was appropriate to ignore synergies. If this is the approach that should have been adopted by any director of reasonable competence, then it is truly extraordinary that it was not an approach espoused by any of the specialist accountants or investment bankers involved in the transaction at the time or canvassed by any of the analysts who examined and commented upon it.

It was a plainly stated requirement of the FSA to which, in the circumstances, Lloyds was bound to submit during the Recapitalisation Weekend (even though the board could not understand the basis for it and were livid at its imposition). Once the market was informed that this was the regulators’ requirement there was a very significant risk that the funding market would react badly to a refusal by Lloyds to comply.

The requirement to raise £7bn additional capital was confirmed even as the directors were considering the terms of the Circular. An attempt by the directors to convey to the shareholders that perhaps less than £7bn would be acceptable (“at least £5.5bn”) was given the cold shoulder by the FSA. The judgment that there was no realistic prospect of persuading the FSA to reduce the assessed figure and that effort was best directed to negotiating how the assessed figure might be raised otherwise than through the issue of preference shares was, in my view, well within the range of judgments that could properly be made by competent directors. How to best use limited time and resources are decisions that have to be made in “real time”; and it will be a rare case in which it is possible to say that every director of reasonable competence would have spent less time pursuing Objective A and more time pursuing Objective B, less time in working out the detail of the strategic decision that had actually been taken and more time in working on a rejected alternative.

The clear advice was that raising £5.5bn was less dilutive than raising £7bn. The former course entailed the risks inherent in acquiring HBOS. It cannot be said that the Defendants were ignorant of those risks: for they approved a Circular which set out the risks. It cannot be said that the Defendants chose to ignore the risks when they were presented with them; for  the directors plainly considered them.

I do not think that that accurately identifies the focus of the Acquisition. The concern of the shareholders was with what HBOS would be as part of the Enlarged Group, not with what it was if left on its own; with how good an ingredient HBOS was in a larger mix, not with what it would be like if left on the shelf. Accordingly, the information that was material to the decision before them related to the impact that the incorporation of  HBOS would have upon the Lloyds business. When I speak of “the Lloyds business” I mean (as Sir Victor pointed out in the Chairman’s letter) not the Lloyds business as it had been before the Recapitalisation Weekend but the Lloyds operation as it emerged from the Recapitalisation Weekend with the choice of either completing the Acquisition or of pursuing a standalone future. </p>

The nature of the basis for the funding of HBOS post acquisition was anticipated to be different: it would be part of an enlarged group, with significant new capital injected. Rather, the critical point – which was well disclosed and discussed in the shareholder documents – was that the board was satisfied that the combined group would be able to fund itself following completion. ” </p>

Pre-completion funding was not entirely irrelevant. It was at the least an indicator of the sort of risks Lloyds was importing into the funding requirements of the Enlarged Group: and it gave a clue as to how far down the road HBOS had travelled away from viability as an independent “standalone” bank. To put the essential point in picturesque language: if the Lloyds Black Horse was joined by a spavined nag, how well would they work in harness?

The first is that at page 9 of the Circular in the Chairman’s Letter Sir Victor said that the Lloyds Directors believed that the combination of Lloyds and HBOS was in the best interests of the company and the Lloyds shareholders as a whole. This may be taken as a sufficient example of a category of individual representations scattered throughout the Circular which express the view that the merger was beneficial, would offer synergies and savings and would contribute to shareholder value.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that on the same page Sir Victor said that the FSA had advised Lloyds that if the Acquisition were not to occur then it would require Lloyds to raise £7 billion of additional capital and that “whilst Lloyds would be able to seek to raise such additional new capital in the public markets, there can be no certainty that [Lloyds] would be able to successfully raise such capital or as to the terms on which such capital could be raised, including the terms of any participation by HM Treasury in any such capital raising”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The third is that at page 22 of the Chairman’s letter it was said that Lloyds had made the preliminary assessment based on June 2008 figures that net negative capital adjustments of no more than £10bn would need  to be made to HBOS’s financial position for Core Tier 1 capital purposes as a result of the Acquisition, the effect of which would mean that the Enlarged Group would have a Core Tier 1 ratio in excess of 7%.

Page 247 of the Circular contained an explanation that the UKLA had agreed that a statement regarding the adequacy of working capital for the next 12 months was not required. There was however a statement at page 273 that HBOS’ “robust capital position….further enhanced by the injection of capital and liquidity facilitated by the UK Government” reinforced the ability of the Enlarged Group to meet challenges. The Claimants say that this was a representation that the £17bn of additional capital to be raised by HBOS would be sufficient to absorb the expected impairments of HBOS and enable the Enlarged Group to trade for 12 months with raising further capital. They say further that it was a representation that the £5.5bn was allocated to Lloyds on the basis of the balance sheet and business requirements of Lloyds rather than to cover the losses that HBOS had suffered and would continue to suffer (see the Claim at para.100(4)).  </p>

The Circular in that form was approved by the FSA. The Claimants say that that approval was motivated by a desire on the part of FSA to enable HBOS to avoid formal insolvency and nationalisation (which would have been hugely damaging to the banking industry) by pressurising the Lloyds shareholders into voting in favour of the Acquisition: and that such conduct did not relieve the Defendant Directors of the obligations they owed to the Lloyds shareholders.  </p>

The Claimants treated this as an express representation that the document <span style="font-style:italic">did </span> comply with English law, the Listing Rules and the City Code. They then sought to identify various breaches of the Listing Rules and the City Code. I do not consider that this endeavour added anything other than needless complexity. My attention was not drawn to any alleged breach of the Rules or the Code that was not otherwise an alleged breach of some duty at law or in equity. The one effect it might have is this. It represents (as the Claimants would have it) that there has been compliance with English law. If there was a breach of the equitable duty to provide sufficient information then that breach would also amount to a breach at common law of this “representation”.

Their assessment contained a misjudgement, about the rapidity and depth of the impending recession and about the likelihood of its occurrence. Indeed, at the time some analysts made that very point. When asked to comment on the Circular Adrian Frost of Artemis said that he thought Lloyds were complacent on their economic view, too “middle of </p>

Others also thought that banks generally were too optimistic on the outlook for the economy. But that misjudgement did not involve carelessness. There was a respectable body of opinion, of which Mr Foley was part, which shared the outlook of the Lloyds’ board. So the main thrust, that this expression of view involved a misstatement, is not made out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As part of the presentation of the benefits of the Acquisition the Circular stated (in the Chairman’s letter at p.16) that the implementation of costs synergies and other operational efficiencies would deliver pre-tax costs savings greater than £1.5bn by then end of 2011. A figure of £1.9bn was sustainable on the material available, but Mr Tookey spoke only to the lower figure – perhaps out of caution, and perhaps to avoid drawing attention to potential competition issues.  The Chairman’s letter then said (at p.18) that it was expected that the Acquisition would lead to accretion in Lloyds’ “cash earnings per share” of 20%. It explained that “cash earnings per share” excluded writedowns on intangibles and FVAs but did include the benefit of costs synergies. In their statement of case the Claimants criticised this as misleading because the computations leading to the 20% figure in fact did include FVAs: but their witnesses could not maintain the criticism under cross-examination. In his presentation of the Claimants’ case Mr Hill QC went further and suggested that the cash EPS figure would in fact be dilutive (rather than accretive): but the comparison he drew was with Lloyds as it was before the Recapitalisation Weekend, not with a “standalone” Lloyds recapitalised by an injection of £7bn additional capital (the comparison actually made in the Circular).  So, neither of the points about misstating the EPS enhancement was made out. </p>

The value of the synergies would be shared between the population of shareholders as it existed when the costs benefits came through in the course of trading, reflected in earnings per share. But in terms of the net present value of the anticipated synergies the then-current Lloyds shareholders gained 15.2p to 32.9p per share. The suggestion that they benefited from enhanced EPS was sound. The proposition was not oversold to Lloyds shareholders in the Circular. </p>

The complaints about EPS representations are, I think, illustrative of a process that appears to have been undertaken in the preparation of the Claimants’ case. What appears to have happened is that a trawl has been undertaken of the 286 pages of the Circular to identify statements which (in isolation and upon one reading) might <span style="font-style:italic">in the abstract</span> be taken to be misleading or insufficient, without any grounding in what anyone actually read (80% of the Claimants did not read the Circular) or in what sense they understood it or to what extent they relied upon it. Thus, of the 5800 Claimants only two say that they paid any attention to the statements about EPS (which in the event were not misstatements at all): and many of the Claimants voted against the Acquisition in any event. The Claimants’ evidence does not properly engage with the need to prove reliance. </p>

The difficulty with that approach is that whilst analysts (like institutional shareholders) undoubtedly took into account what was in the Circular, what needs to be demonstrated to establish indirect reliance is that the journalistic or analytic output on which the shareholder ultimately “relied” was substantially shaped by identified raw material in the Circular and not by journalistic comment. The analyst who says she notes from the Circular anticipated synergies of £1.5bn per year but thinks that this understates the position and would expect to see £2bn per year  is not “relying” on statements in the Circular.

This was reflected in the advice which Mr Greenburgh and Mr Wilmot-Sitwell had given to the Lloyds board as to the prospects for a capital-raise. It is unsurprising that in this context Mr Ellerton (the Claimants’ expert) acknowledged in cross-examination the difficulty that would have faced a “standalone” Lloyds seeking additional capital in the market. I consider that Sir Victor made an entirely fair point in the Chairman’s letter in saying the discount in the market necessarily get a pre-emptive rights issue away would have been of the order of 35%-45%. That was in fact the experience of those who tapped the market. HBOS had had to offer a 45% discount on its rights issue and could not get it away. Material referred to at trial showed that Bradford &amp; Bingley had offered a 55% discount, Standard Chartered a 48.7% discount and HSBC a 47.5% discount. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">I agree with the Claimants that the “net negative capital adjustment of £10bn” comes across as a grounded assessment (albeit preliminary), not as a purely hypothetical figure generated for illustrative purposes: a grounded assessment is what it was. Of course, when applied to pro forma figures even a grounded preliminary assessment can only produce an illustration and not a prediction of the “point in time” valuation that will be made at completion: and that is exactly what the Circular warned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">But I do not accept the rest of the argument of the Claimants on the impairment disclosure point. First, the capital adjustment exercise (“What will the opening balance sheet look like as at January 2009?”) is different from an impairments analysis (“What will be the impact be of anticipated defaults during the course of 2009?”). So bare disclosure of anticipated impairments would not of itself have facilitated a reassessment of the outcome of the preliminary capital adjustment exercise: a lot more context would have been required - to explain the somewhat tortured relationship between the net negative capital adjustment figure and the impairments figures, to inform the reader of the probability of the occurrence of the impairments disclosed and to explain the macro-economic assumptions underlying the impairment figures i.e. that the Lloyds figures had been prepared on much more pessimistic assumptions than the consensus view on the forthcoming recession. </p>

Risk Factor 1.4 went on to draw attention both to the lower rating of the HBOS loan portfolio and its greater exposure to leveraged finance and subordinated loans and to its concentration in the commercial real estate sector so that the corporate lending portfolio (like the mortgage portfolio) was “likely to generate substantial increases in impairment losses which could materially affect the operations, financial condition and prospects of the Enlarged Group”.

It included the calculation of fair value adjustments to HBOS assets by reference to credit spreads.

It could only be a “ballpark” comparison because the credit spreads  assessed by the market would not (in other than a perfect world) match the individual impairments assessed in a particular  scenario.

They plainly believed that they had reasonable grounds for making the assessment, for it was included in a document prepared for them by specialists whom they had retained for the very purpose of ensuring that the Circular was in accordance with English law, the City Code and the Listing Rules (and who had undertaken a thorough statement verification process). They did in fact have reasonable grounds for the belief they expressed. The estimated adjustment had been undertaken by senior HBOS personnel in close liaison with senior members of Lloyds’ Group Corporate Treasury and challenged by PwC. Reasonably competent directors could properly rely on them to have done a competent job unless some obvious error was apparent in the figures they produced. The assessment had been cross-checked by PwC for the purposes of their Working Capital Report, including a review of assumptions. The board had been told on 29 October 2008 by Mr Tookey that even the top end of Mr Roughton-Smith’s new figures could be accommodated within the working capital figures on which the board had been proceeding (and so the figures that would be reflected in the Circular). If and to the extent that Mr Tookey based that view on an adjustment of the impairment figures to take account of known HBOS impairments then there was a respectable basis for that view (as set out in the evidence of Mr Deetz), even if that was not the only view. As regards the board members, I hold that a reasonably competent director is not expected to deep-drill into acquisition accounting in order to challenge whether a confirmatory “ball-park” comparison has been properly made and whether a preliminary estimate of the net negative capital adjustment could properly be included in the Circular.

The focus of the complaint then became the reasons given for the omission of a qualified working capital statement. The application for the waiver founded itself on the proposition that the Enlarged Group (like every other bank) was not immune from the effects of an extended closure of the wholesale markets and so was to some degree dependent upon the availability of support from the BoE: and that such disclosure risked an undue loss of faith in Lloyds and HBOS because, although every other bank was in an identical situation, no other bank was involved in a merger which might require such disclosure. </p>

On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that even before the collapse of Lehman Brothers consideration was being given by Lloyds senior management to raising additional capital: and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers (and the opportunistic £800m rights issue) there remained a need. On Lloyds’ own figures that need might have been £4bn. If the Circular had  said that the £5.5bn to be taken under the Recapitalisation Weekend programme was being taken to cover anticipated losses deriving from HBOS it would not have been accurate.  </p>

This disclosure (accompanied by the warning in Risk Factor 1.5 both of the inherent possibility of serious liquidity constraints and of  the higher funding risk facing the Enlarged Group than a standalone Lloyds faced and the further warning in Risk Factor 1.12 of loss of confidence causing depositor withdrawals) was accurate and sufficient as regards the future of the Enlarged Group. It gave a clear warning that looking forward the Enlarged Group could not rely on the market to meet its funding needs: but that of itself did not put the Enlarged Group in any different position from any of its peers, all of whom relied on the availability of SLS (and some of whom would have failed without SLS).

This admission was not withdrawn. It will be apparent from my account of the facts that the Lloyds board did not seek specific advice as to their disclosure obligations regarding the existence of ELA, but simply relied on their banking and legal advisers to prepare the Circular in a form compliant with regulatory obligations and the general law. But Linklaters were not informed of the use of ELA by HBOS (probably because the Lloyds board believed that it had to be kept confidential) and therefore gave it no consideration.   </p>

That account drew attention to the existence of a liquidity portfolio consisting of mainstream eligible collateral, and a substantial pool of high-quality secondary liquidity assets which, it was said, permitted HBOS to manage through periods of stress taking into account the likely behaviour of depositors and the wholesale markets. In essence the Claimants complain that this was not a candid and fair account because it did not disclose that the only way HBOS had been able to manage through the then-current period of stress was to turn, not to the market, but to the BoE; and to do so outside the mainstream facilities on offer (namely, SLS and the ELTR facility). Accessing ELA enabled HBOS to meet liabilities which it could not immediately meet from its own resources, or from the market, or from the mainstream market-wide central bank liquidity facilities. The Claimants say that the simple disclosure of the use of ELA would have told Lloyds shareholders that HBOS was “funding insolvent” and that would have had a materially adverse impact on the value of HBOS.  </p>

The expert evidence of Mr Benkert for the Claimants and of Prof Persaud  for the Defendants is all but agreed on this point: they agree that the frequency of its use then was not what it was after 2012. Mr Benkert has found a couple of instances of use in 2008, but Prof. Persaud does not accept that they are usages consistent with what we now call “ELA”. The point of the Defendants’ observation is not about simple labelling: it is about the ready recognition of a distinctive category of stigmatised assistance. Thus, the Defendants submit,  Mr Daniels, Mr Tate, Mr Tookey and Mr Short all appeared to regard ELA as a variant of the SLS scheme (Mr Short in evidence called it “SLS lite”) under which the collateral that could be offered in return for Treasury bills did not fit the SLS profile but in due course could in most cases be securitized into a compliant form (as 70% of it was); in the meantime ELA offering a temporary “bridge” facility that was immaterially different. On this analysis HBOS  was simply accessing a functionally connected additional line of SLS funding. </p>

Mr Benkert (the Claimants’ expert) and Prof Persaud (called by the Defendants) were agreed on the similarities between SLS and ELA. (i) Both were liquidity facilities provided by BoE operating by means of swaps (under which the BoE provided gilts in return for collateral). (ii) The collateral accepted under the ELA was unsecuritised loans of a type similar to those accepted in securitised form for SLS. (iii) The fact and extent of any usage by individual banks was in neither case disclosed by the BoE: disclosure was on an anonymised, aggregated basis with a suitable time lag (scheduled in the case of SLS and individually determined in the case of ELA) and whilst subsequent repo transactions might give a clue who were large scale users of the facilities, no analysis could tell the market whether it was SLS or ELA that had generated the T-bills.

(v) The “haircuts” applied by BoE to the value of the collateral was broadly similar: according to Prof Persaud it was 40% for SLS and 43% for ELA, figures with which Mr Benkert agreed, though he thought ELA simply mimicked SLS because of lack of experience of valuation in an ELA context. </p>

(i) The key difference (which Mr Hill QC hammered home time and again) was that SLS was a mainstream facility that was permanently available on demand to a range of users, whereas ELA was an idiosyncratic and bilateral arrangement arising out a request for assistance by a systemically important institution. In my own mind I characterised the point he was seeking to make as the difference between HBOS being an applicant for SLS and being a supplicant for ELA. He argued that the making of the request for bespoke assistance (rather than the making of an  application for access to an open facility) differentiated the applicant from its peers, and that differentiation ran the risk of attracting “stigma”. Hence the great secrecy surrounding the ELA provided by the BoE to HBOS and to RBS. Although the Tripartite had widely publicised its intention to do “whatever was necessary” the BoE </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">was in no mood to test whether its offers of help had been de-stigmatised: so it kept everything about ELA covert. (ii) The objective of SLS was to unblock the flow of liquidity assistance to the banking sector generally (by camouflaging and destigmatising its use): but ELA was institution specific and available only to systemically important institutions. (iii)  The collateral provided was, in the case of SLS, securitised loan packages; and in the case of ELA was otherwise ineligible raw loans held through a trust structure. This was an indicator of the urgency with which the assistance was needed (for it could not await the securitisation process). (iv) The interest rate charged upon ELA was in general higher than that charged under SLS (200bps as against an average of 140bps at the time ELA was first granted, though the latter average rose to 178bps) but was not necessarily so (because the rate payable under SLS increased with the proportion of funding that SLS constituted for the applicant bank). It is difficult to know whether this difference resulted simply from a desire on the part of BoE to encourage securitisation and to disincentivise the use of raw loans: or whether a higher ELA rate represented some pricing of increased risk. But in either event the difference was hardly material to the market at large: and I shall leave this difference out of account. (v) SLS was accessible under a standardised process utilising pro-forma documentation whereas ELA only became available upon individualised application and after the Governor of the Bank had sought and received authorisation from the Chancellor. Once granted ELA was managed by a different department within the Bank from that which managed SLS. (vi) The assistance provided under SLS was the provision of 9-month Treasury bills that could be repo-ed with an option to roll-over for up to a maximum of 3 years: whereas ELA provided 14-day money (though again with a roll-over option). So, ELA could not be used to refinance maturing wholesale funding but was subject to frequent review. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, the Defendants say that the true question which the Lloyds shareholders needed to address was whether HBOS could be funded until completion: and how that was achieved was not “material”. I agree that this was one of the vital questions. It had arisen at the end of September 2008 when Sir Victor was confronted with the possibility that HBOS might not open its doors; but the problem had then gone away. All Lloyds shareholders would have known that HBOS was vulnerable, for it was that very vulnerability that afforded the opportunity for the Acquisition. Furthermore, Sir Victor had observed to shareholders in the Chairman’s Letter that HBOS had been significantly affected by recent challenging market conditions which had negatively affected its funding model. The Circular set out how those vulnerabilities would be addressed once HBOS became part of the Enlarged Group: but the question is whether it was material for the shareholders to know how the vulnerabilities were addressed in the interim. Mr Daniels, Mr Tate, Mr Tookey and Mr Short were all of the view that interim funding was an immaterial consideration. I think the UKLA were probably also of the view that it was immaterial: for I think it likely that the HBOS supervisory team at the FSA must have been aware that HBOS was accessing funds outside the SLS yet the UKLA did not insist upon the Circular reflecting that fact. (There is no documentary evidence to that effect: but it is supported by some of the evidence of Mr Sants, and by the improbability of HBOS concealing from its supervisor how it was meeting its funding needs). However, the “sufficient information” principle requires the Court to subject the Circular to scrutiny, not simply to accept the judgment of those preparing the Circular as to the materiality of information about interim funding. The honestly held views of the participants at the time cannot be determinative. </p>

On their case how HBOS was funded to completion was immaterial. The question for the Lloyds shareholders was: given that HBOS was there, should its business be merged with that of Lloyds? The Claimants, of course, argue that knowledge of ELA would have told Lloyds shareholders that HBOS was a “failed bank” and was “valueless” and so should not be merged with Lloyds because it would weaken Lloyds and excessively dilute shareholder value. </p>

Having considered the competing arguments this is my conclusion. I accept that  the focus of the shareholders’ consideration was HBOS as part of the Enlarged Group: and the Circular was right strongly to emphasise this. The argument which starts and finishes with this point is very powerful. But the giving of focus and direction to the shareholders in the Circular does not mean that only material supportive of the recommended outcome needs to be included. The business of the EGM would be to approve (or to withhold approval from) the recommendation of the board as to the incorporation of HBOS into an Enlarged Group. That involved an assessment of its strengths - what it would contribute to the Enlarged Group that a “standalone” recapitalised Lloyds would lack. But an informed assessment of HBOS would also note its weaknesses, because the extent to which the remedying of those weaknesses would sap the strength of Lloyds within the Enlarged Group might well be a matter of concern to shareholders. A fair, candid and reasonable account of the purpose of the meeting should therefore note (though need not emphasise) those weaknesses. It is a question of balance whether that is done through the enumeration of risk factors, or whether it is done in the course of laying out the proposal itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the weaknesses of HBOS as matters stood was that it did not have enough collateral available to satisfy its demands for immediate funds using generally available sources (which it may, indeed, have already exhausted). Its then-current position (and one that would continue until the implementation of the Recapitalisation Weekend proposals) was that its needs were being met by the availability to HBOS, as a systemically important institution, of a particular “lender of last resort” facility that was not generally on offer to HBOS’s peers, was not used by Lloyds and which would cease to be used on completion. The exact extent of use and the precise features of this facility would not be of concern to a Lloyds shareholder: to provide such detail in a proper context would overwhelm the reader and confuse the issue. But the <span style="font-style:italic">existence </span>of the facility potentially was of concern: not (in my view) because it was an indicator that HBOS was a “failed bank” and was “valueless” (though some shareholders did already view it as such), but because it showed the funding position of HBOS and presented a funding risk that would have to be absorbed by, and managed by, the Enlarged Group. Part of the additional capital raised following the Recapitalisation Weekend would not provide additional strength in the anticipated downturn but would be absorbed in repairing shortfalls that had already occurred. For a fair and candid account of what was before the meeting the existence of the facility that we at trial have referred to as “ELA” ought in my judgment to have been noted.  </p>

There may well be an argument that directors of a particular company (be that company a quoted company in receipt of ELA, or the predator of such a company) are not obliged, in the discharge of their duties to their particular shareholders, to risk the integrity of the entire financial system within which they operate (including the value of their shareholders’ economic interests), and that covert operations of the central bank present circumstances in which it is “impracticable” to present all material to shareholders.

The issue is whether it should have been disclosed in the Circular. I have said above that the first tranche could be regarded as advanced in the ordinary course of business. The second tranche was at the time treated (by Lloyds and by the regulators) as “ordinary course” business and Lloyds was not at the time required to seek shareholder approval for it as a Class 1 transaction. I shall not revisit that treatment in that context. But that does not answer the question posed here by the Claimants: should the Lloyds Repo have been disclosed in the Circular?  </p>

A reasonable disclosure would not have been in alarmist terms: it would not have been in the interests of Lloyds to excite speculation or to trigger panic or to jeopardise a beneficial transaction. But in a 286page account of the circumstances of the transaction there was room for some disclosure that, in order to ensure that HBOS had (in tight wholesale markets) stable funding until completion Lloyds had provided a facility of up to £10bn, a significant part of which remained undrawn. </p>

He acknowledged that the same could be said of the DWF, although (to give a nuanced answer) it was “less ordinary course” than using the TAF. Mr Benkert plainly did struggle with the conclusion that using DWF was “ordinary course” (although that was the conclusion to which the logic of his position took him):  and he continued to struggle with it even though he agreed that the market would not have been surprised to learn that an entity like HBOS with dollar assets on its books had accessed the DWF.

Taking that evidence together with that of Mr Benkert (and there is no evidence to the contrary) it is plain that resort to Federal Reserve funding for dollar requirements was nothing remarkable. It was a way of dealing with the need to raise funds for dollar cover (as many banks had to do) before the BoE itself began to offer dollar facilities. It did not differentiate HBOS from other banks. It did not demonstrate that HBOS was a “failed” bank: only that the US public market could not provide dollar cover for dollar liabilities. It was not something to which attention needed to be drawn in the Circular. </p>

The view of the Tripartite in October 2008 (confirmed to Parliament in November 2009 when the advance of ELA was revealed) was that it was for the Lloyds directors to decide what to disclose.  </p>

The Circular would not have said baldly that the BoE had provided and was providing £X emergency liquidity assistance to HBOS. It might properly have said HBOS relied on SLS, government guaranteed issuance <span style="font-style:italic">and other bilateral fully collateralised Bank facilities</span>. The disclosure would have said that the Lloyds board affirmed the Acquisition because it was satisfied that HBOS was funded until completion and that following completion the Enlarged Group would not need to utilise the bilateral facilities currently available to HBOS.  That would have given a candid and fair (but not inflammatory) indication that HBOS was to some degree dependent upon bespoke bilateral arrangements rather than its needs being met by participation in mainstream arrangements.  </p>

That is the basis upon which it supported a waiver of competition concerns and justified the grant of supportive ELA.  It would have done whatever it could to support that takeover, though it was not going to give Lloyds a free ride and was going to extract a price for the competition waiver by ensuring that Lloyds bore a share of the risk. The Tripartite strongly preferred a capital contribution to an Enlarged Group over a complete or partial nationalisation of HBOS.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">I further note that it is undoubtedly the case that the Tripartite was extremely anxious to avoid disclosure of ELA and went to great lengths to keep it secret: the grant of ELA was kept within the Bank’s Transaction Committee and not released to the Court of the BoE or to the Chair of the Treasury Select Committee. The former is perhaps in part explained by the presence on the Court of competitors of HBOS and of Lloyds: but the latter is a straightforward instance of a desire to preserve secrecy for its own sake. It is clear that the Tripartite did so because of the extreme fragility of the markets in which they feared a negative market reaction (from depositors and the debt and equity markets); and because they believed that the risk of disorderly failure of HBOS or of observable distress (and the effect of contagion) was of such magnitude that they did not wish voluntarily to incur it.  </p>

Thus, once announced, failure of the merger (or indeed any rumour that the Tripartite no longer supported the merger) would harm financial stability and risk contagion in the same way.  </p>

ELA (as its very name suggests) addresses a shortage of liquidity. Mr Sants emphasised the point when he said in Edinburgh on 15 October 2008 that the immediate issue for the banks was not their capital and that noone had run out of capital; the problem was with liquidity.   But ELA may convey a wider message. The point is made in “The Review of the Bank of England’s Framework for Providing Liquidity to the Banking System” prepared by Bill Winters in October 2012. The following citation deals with why (when issues of underlying solvency and short-term illiquidity are considered) banks are special:- </p>

This exposes banks to liquidity risk as their borrowings may need to be paid back before they are repaid on their loans. If this risk crystallises, what started out as a liquidity problem can quickly become a solvency or viability problem. Specifically, if creditors of the bank see it as accessing a central bank liquidity facility, they may fear that the bank is insolvent or otherwise non-viable and stop lending the bank additional funds. The blurring of this distinction between liquidity and solvency makes distinguishing liquidity problems and solvency problems very difficult. This may be even more difficult to judge in times of stress. And part of the reason for stigma in central bank facilities is likely to be that the market does not believe central banks are always able and willing to make this distinction. Indeed, the solvency problem may initially manifest itself as a liquidity problem. So the discovery that a firm has used central bank liquidity can be taken as a signal that they are in trouble and may become or already be insolvent.… The link between liquidity and solvency may be self-fulfilling in some circumstances.”  </p>

The Claimants argue that disclosure of ELA and the Lloyds Repo would have shown that HBOS was in a weaker position than other banks, that shareholders would understand that HBOS could not survive as a standalone bank and that they stood to be wiped out absent the Acquisition and that the price to be paid under the Acquisition appeared “excessive”. </p>

This evidence struck me as entirely coherent. Why would the Government trigger the very event it had been so anxious to avoid?

I am in no doubt that these measures did (as intended) establish a “new normal” in which the Bank had ceased to act simply through open market operations, the provision of “standing facilities” and as a “lender of last resort” and had become a mainstream provider of liquidity under arrangements (the SLS) that were not transparent to the market (because the amount taken by any individual bank and the circumstances in which it sought to use SLS  were not disclosed). These measures did indeed substantially reduce the “ghost run” on HBOS that had happened in September and early October 2008: in other words, the new arrangements influenced not only the technically minded market participants but also the ordinary retail and corporate depositor. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The second difference is that the disclosure would have been controlled not leaked. Much of the apprehension about disclosure (and what drove the desire for secrecy) was a fear of uncontrollable and unpredictable market reaction, such as had followed the BBC leak of the plans for Northern Rock. So there was an understandable desire on the part of Lloyds and of the BoE  to avoid “unforced errors”.  But if disclosure is required then attention can be (and would have been) focused on the manner and terms of disclosure so as to minimise the risk of damaging speculation. This was recognized to have been a possibility in the case of Northern Rock, where the Treasury Select Committee Report of January 2008 expressed the view that there was a reasonable prospect that an official announcement of the BoE support operation would have reassured depositors, whereas the “leak” caused panic. Of course, one cannot be sure: not every controlled release successfully avoids a markedly negative reaction. But each of the other matters to which I refer is mutually reinforcing. </p>

The grant of ELA and the use of the Lloyds Repo were not leaked or made known to the market as unanchored facts inviting speculation. A reader of the Circular would know why the ELA (and the Lloyds Repo) had been granted (to provide stable funding until completion of the Acquisition) and would know that it would not be needed by the Enlarged Group. This would reduce (though I do not consider it would eliminate entirely) the consequences of using stigmatised facilities. Stigma is related to uncertainty. I found helpful Prof  </p>

Uncertainty is something you cannot. Stigma is not that markets believe the risk of an asset has risen to some level and that there is some compensating level of interest rate that could offset this new risk and draw funders back, but that there is an increase in uncertainty of future outcomes and investors do not know how to price it, and so they prefer not to have any of it at all. ” </p>

There was no real doubt about the Government’s intention both to provide liquidity for illiquid institutions and to subscribe for capital (though the terms of provision were not certain), nor about the Government’s support for the Acquisition. If the Lloyds shareholders approved the Acquisition in accordance with the recommendation of the Lloyds board (an element of risk that could be and was constantly priced by the market, reflected in the fact that HBOS shares traded at a discount to the Lloyds offer price) their relationship would become one with the Enlarged Group. The Enlarged Group itself was one that had been scrutinized by the regulators and had been recapitalized by the Tripartite at what might well be (and in the event was) a premium to the market price. There was no need to assume the worst because the long-term future for HBOS had already been mapped out. That is crucial.   </p>

There was the leak of the “secret” Lloyds Repo on 9 November 2008, picked up by the Sunday Times, and then by the BBC, the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Independent and by various analysts and the main subscription services. It is right to note (i) that this “leak” did not precisely replicate the sort of disclosure that would have been contained in the Circular, in particular the very fact of  disclosure in the Circular would have indicated  that the transaction was one that was thought to need special mention as in some respect out of the ordinary; (ii) that a press story (however well it is said to be founded) is not the same as a statement from Lloyds; and (iii) it was not associated with any disclosure of ELA.  </p>

But Prof. Schifferes and Dr Unni are agreed that the “Sunday Times” story regarding the Lloyds Repo did not lead to significant change in the share price of HBOS (or of Lloyds).  Prof. Schifferes thought that this was entirely due to the fact that the story was not confirmed by Lloyds and was not taken seriously. But it was widely reported and taken seriously; it  was picked up by analysts. It was not overshadowed by the simultaneous stories relating to the two Scottish interventions (and possible foreign interest): these were not the dominant market drivers, as the Claimants suggested (contrary to the view of their expert). Indeed, the co-incidence of the stories focused attention on the very question: what did HBOS need to survive as an independent bank? In my judgment the muted market reaction does run entirely counter to the thesis that in febrile times the market would seize upon any sign of weakness and punish the institution concerned; and it does tend to favour the argument that measures supportive of a planned restructuring were at least to be viewed as neutral.   </p>

There was an undoubted loss of confidence in HBOS, its Chief Executive had publicly expressed the view that its troubles were not temporary, and there was a widely held view in the market that HBOS did not in reality have an independent future. The assumed disclosures in the Circular recommending the Acquisition would thus have provided important <span style="font-style:italic">incremental </span>information about how far along the journey HBOS was, but the destination (absent the Acquisition) was already anticipated by many. HBOS would (after the Recapitalisation Weekend) have to raise £12bn as a stand-alone bank and it could look only to the Government to provide it i.e. at best partial nationalisation.  </p>

The Claimants make the point if the disclosures would cause a material number of these market participants (who did not currently believe that HBOS had no future as a stand-alone) to re-evaluate then it would cause a material market movement. I acknowledge the theoretical point: but there is no evidence available to make the point of any utility.  </p>

Amongst those buyers was the fund which Mr Ellerton himself advised. It was also the evidence of the Governor of the Bank of England that the announcement of ELA for Northern Rock had the immediate effect of reassuring wholesale funders to Northern Rock: though I think that reassurance may have waned as it became increasingly apparent that there was no long term private sector solution to the Northern Rock problem (whereas the Acquisition offer price always afforded a “floor” in the case of HBOS). </p>

In the interests of balance, I should note that access to DWF was not the only benefit of conversion, and I do not seek to press the example so far as to suggest that accessing emergency funding naturally has a positive effect on the share price.

On the evidence I would answer that question in the negative. Any transaction based on a share exchange depends upon the relative share prices. There is no evidence of how the Lloyds’ share price would have reacted to the assumed disclosures in the Circular and a 10%-15% decline in the HBOS price. But in any event the transaction was based on the underlying strategic value of HBOS to Lloyds: this was the point made by RiskMetrics in its commentary supporting the deal, where it said that the deal was not value-based by about strategic acquisition.

There is no reason to think that the small number of self-selected retail or institutional Claimants is in any way representative. There is one witness who is not a Claimant (Mr Hammond-Chambers of Hansa Trust, who was part of the dissentient minority at the EGM). What reliance can one put upon that one witness to represent the likely views of a statistically significant part of other non-claimant institutions?

First, the factual evidence of the Claimants itself shows that in general  shareholders cast their votes in accordance with the recommendation of the board: on this counterfactual the board is recommending the transaction. This is a manifestation of what Mr Torchio called “the Wall Street walk”, which he memorably encapsulated as “shareholders either vote with their hands or they vote with their feet” i.e. they will either vote in favour or they will have sold out already. Second, the factual evidence of the Claimants shows that some shareholders recognize that they simply cannot say how they would have voted in the counterfactual world. Third, the expert evidence adduced by the Claimants (Mr MacGregor and Mr Torchio) established that in general shareholders do not wish to undermine the company’s management (“if the management’s in favour, its highly likely that it’s going to be voted in favour”) and will vote in accordance with a recommendation. Fourth, analysts recognised (and advised their clients) of the risk of contagion if shareholders voted against management (“shareholders will recognise that if they block the deal they might start a storm from which Lloyds TSB itself will not be able to shelter”). Fifth, the most prominent shareholder advisers (RiskMetrics and PIRC) were both advising shareholders to vote in favour: the Claimants did not seek to prove that the advice of either body would have been different if ELA and the Lloyds Repo had been disclosed in the Circular  (notwithstanding the qualified terms in which the RiskMetrics advice was tendered). All these are contra-indications. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">What indirect evidence might support an inference?  First, the Claimants acknowledge that it was widely known that HBOS was in difficulties, at the weaker end of the spectrum, and widely viewed as not having an independent future (though they resist the suggestion that this was a consensus view). I have found that the disclosure of “ELA” and the Lloyds Repo would have been significant incremental information which would tell investors more about how far on its journey HBOS was and would have been mildly negative. Would this reaction have swayed a vote? I do not think that if the counterfactual includes the proposition that disclosure would have a mildly negative effect one can infer the overthrow of a majority of 96%. What would weigh with the Lloyds shareholders was the strategic objectives of the Acquisition not the temporary funding arrangements pending completion. These temporary arrangements did not of themselves clearly signal that the strategic objectives would only be achieved at a cost increased by an unexpectedly deep and long recession.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the Claimants say that that only about half the shareholder population  actually voted: they submit that the Court should presume that the absent and abstaining other half did not support the proposal as it was revealed, and that if ELA and the Lloyds Repo had been revealed and reinforced the market response assumed in the counterfactual then it may be presumed that a sufficient number would have become active, all of whom would have voted against the proposal. I part company at the first stage.  The fact that some people did not vote does not mean they were opposed to the proposition. They may simply have not got around to voting (whatever their view). They may have been content simply to follow the majority (whatever that view was). They might have understood that the management view is generally backed and have gambled that that would again be the case with the vote at the EGM. </p>

There is no basis for leaping from the evidence of 15 individuals to the conclusion that 1.4 billion votes would have been cast differently. Many shareholders would have been guided by the (correct) advice of Sir Victor that they should focus on comparing (i) Lloyds as part of the Enlarged Group and (ii) Lloyds, not as it used to be, but as it stood to be after the Recapitalisation Weekend. Many shareholders are likely to have weighed the negative signals sent by temporary central bank support against the strategic advantages and earnings accretion the Board anticipated would accrue. Some may well have gone through the same balancing exercise as the analysts at Rensburg did in early October. Their early and insightful summary suggests that a merger might mean that a wellcapitalised bank is dragged down by the HBOS commercial lending, but the discount on book value gave scope for write-downs and (Rensburg suspected but a Lloyds shareholder would know) there is some sort of facility from the BoE to oil the wheels. It suggests that in some ways the deal is very positive: Lloyds gets a huge number of retail customers in a deal that would normally be blocked on competition grounds, and retail customers are more important in a world where wholesale lending has stalled. It observes that the Enlarged Group needed to get through the immediate hitches but on a 2-3-year view Lloyds should emerge strong. In other words, shareholders would focus on Lloyds, not on HBOS.  </p>

The touchstone for that would be whether an honest shareholder might reasonably hold the view that the matter under consideration was beneficial to the company. In the counterfactual scenario under consideration the board has unanimously recommended the Acquisition as beneficial to Lloyds and its shareholders and has done so without negligence. Moreover, each director who holds shares is voting the entirety of his or her shares in accordance with that recommendation. The Claimants would be unable to show that <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>honest and reasonable shareholder could have supported the Acquisition. If a cross-holder voted in favour of the Acquisition it would therefore not necessarily be because he put his private economic interests above the interests of the company as a whole.

It was common ground that whether that individual Claimant had suffered loss depended not only upon how he, she or it would have altered their vote in the light of incremental knowledge, but also on how other shareholders would have reacted to that same information. The “loss causing event” would not have happened if enough shareholders had reacted in the same way as the individual claimant. The primary position of both parties was that because the question was how the individual claimant and the other identically placed shareholders would have reacted to the same external input (of incremental information) the outcome was to be determined on the balance of probabilities. “If the material had been released the meeting would have been called off”. “If the material had been released the price would have halved”. “If the material had been released the motion would have been defeated”. The question in each such case is not how the other persons would have reacted to some input from the claimants, such as “Would they have made a bargain?” It is: “how would the body of which I am part have reacted to an outside stimulus?.” </p>

I think such an analysis sits uneasily in the context of company general meetings with their settled remedies for the protection of minority rights and for the correction of inequitable decisions. I think it is the law that a dissentient shareholder is bound by the result of a company meeting unless he can demonstrate that the business before the meeting was not fairly put (so that its outcome must be set aside) or there was oppression of the minority. I do not think it is the law that a dissentient shareholder is bound by the result of the meeting but can nonetheless seek compensation for breach of equitable duty (ultimately from the company) on the footing that he has lost the chance that the meeting might have reached a different view.  </p>

On this analysis each shareholder has to show that there was a real or substantial chance that had the existence of ELA been disclosed and had the existence of the Lloyds Repo been confirmed more than 1.4 billion other votes would have been cast with his own and with the existing dissentients.  Mr Hill QC submits that if the step required of an actor is clearly for his benefit then the Court will have little difficulty in concluding that it would be taken. But the step required here is to vote against the unanimous recommendation of the board made on reasonable grounds (which incorporate their assessment of the future course of events); and the supposed justification for taking that step are the suggested implications to be drawn from temporary funding arrangements. These implications (in essence that the transaction occasioned serious risks to Lloyds itself) were already spelt out in the “Risk Factors”: risks arising from general and sector specific threats to the market, a further deterioration in economic conditions, further material negative adjustments to fair values, risks  to borrower credit quality which might affect loan recoverability (particularly on the lower-rated HBOS corporate portfolio which was exposed to substantial increases in impairment losses), liquidity risks (especially if the Government were to withdraw liquidity support), the threat to regulatory capital posed by greater than anticipated assets impairments, reductions in Lloyds’ credit ratings, all these risks and more were drawn to the attention of Lloyds shareholders. Yet 96% of the voting population supported the decision of management. That is what the expert evidence shows overwhelmingly happens: and it is what the factual evidence shows. The only factual evidence (an analysis of the disclosed voting pattern of NFU Mutual Insurance Society) showed that it voted against a management recommendation in only 0.02% of cases. The evidence of a  handful of witnesses as to what they would have done is thus insufficient to establish that there was a real and substantial chance that 1.4 billion others would have joined them. </p>

The burden would not appear difficult to discharge. If Lloyds had acquired the HBOS shares for a cash consideration there is no doubt that Lloyds would have had a cause of action against any directors who negligently overpaid: and it would be for current directors or for the shareholders in general meeting (either effectively directing the existing board or by electing a new board) to  cause the company to pursue that claim. If neither the directors nor a voting majority of shareholders wanted to pursue the claim, then a group of shareholders could seek to pursue a derivative action. In each case the recoveries would form part of the assets of the company. Does the fact that the consideration was not a cash payment but a new Lloyds share make any difference?

The “loss” is caused when this inflation of the Enlarged Group’s share price is dissipated by the release to the market of the true position. I have difficulty in seeing that reversion to “true” value is a loss recoverable by an existing holder (as opposed to it being claimed by a purchaser at an inflated price). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr MacGregor then suggested three approaches to calculating post acquisition loss.  The first is an attempt to calculate as at 15 January 2009 the value of a “standalone” Lloyds share diluted by the issuance involved in the transaction and adjusted for the value added to the Enlarged Group by merging HBOS. The method was not pressed. It is dependent upon there being a valuation of HBOS (which there is not).  I would not have awarded damages on this basis.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The second is to take as a starting point the price of a “standalone” Lloyds share on 17 September 2008 and as an end point the price of a share in the Enlarged Group as at 26 February 2010 (by which time all information must have been in the market). The starting price of a Lloyds share is then adjusted by reference to a banking index and recalibrated to 26 February 2010. The end price of a share in the Enlarged Group is then adjusted to take account of issuance. The two adjusted prices are compared. The difference  between the two is said to constitute the loss. It is said that under this method loss is not being calculated as at 26 February 2010, but rather that events down to that date are being used to illuminate “the true value” (as opposed to the market value) of a share in a “standalone” Lloyds at the completion date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">If the Court was to adopt this approach it would have to take as a starting point the price of a share in a “standalone Lloyds” as  at 3  November 2008 to be its actual share price at that date (reflecting the proper state of market knowledge at that date). That was more than 50% lower than Mr MacGregor’s starting point. From that base it would be necessary to recalibrate the Lloyds share price by reference to a banking index (whose constituent members all have all relevant information in the market reflected in their price), but taking into account the adverse effect of the rejection of the board’s recommendation and the systemic shock caused by the failure of the Tripartite’s stabilisation strategy; one might then reach a hypothetical “standalone” share price for Lloyds at the Acquisition date. Only if there were clear evidence that in the period 15 January 2008-26 February 2010 some disclosure was made that caused a shift in the share price at the disclosure date would any further adjustment need to be made. The Acquisition date is the date upon which the actual dilution of the Lloyds shares took place and the date from which the Enlarged Group was created. It would then be necessary to establish the date upon which (in this counterfactual world) Lloyds would have raised £7bn: and to establish the terms on which the Tripartite would have offered to take that capital. That recalibrated price could then be compared with the actual price of a Lloyds share on that date. Only then would it be possible to assess “loss”. But none of that is possible on the evidence adduced. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The third approach was to take the actual share price of a share in the Enlarged Group on 26 February 2010 (by which date it is assumed full disclosure has been given) and then try to work backwards to the Acquisition date, recalibrating that share price by reference  to a bank index to see what the price of a “standalone” Lloyds share might have been. This approach suffers from the twin methodological flaws of indexing over a sustained period (where shortcomings in the index become magnified) and in assuming that any departure from the indexed performance must be attributable to some disclosure; and as a matter of principle I am unconvinced that it is proper to take some distant post-event date and then try to work back towards the assessment date. Critically it includes the actual disclosure on 24 November 2009 of the use by HBOS of ELA, which the market simply took in its stride. So I would not have awarded damages on this basis.  </p>

I would not use it to compute mathematically to the nearest 0.01p the loss per share, because there are sensitivities for which allowance might properly be made. But I would have taken it as a good guide.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Amongst the sensitivity adjustments I would have made would have been an allowance for the effect of a rejection of the Lloyds boards’ recommendation of the Acquisition. In my judgment that rejection would have had a very significant effect (i) on the market generally (and in particular on bank sector shares) since it would have removed a central plank of the Tripartite’s strategy for the restoration of financial stability; and (ii) a particular idiosyncratic effect on Lloyds (whose management would have lost credibility).  Accordingly, Mr MacGregor’s UK Banks Index would have to be adjusted for this disruptive event; and there would need to be a specific further reduction in Lloyds’s hypothetical “standalone price”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">As to general contagion I agree with Dr Unni’s opinion that a rejection would have triggered a reaction in the sector. It seems to me obvious (given (i) the Tripartite’s oftstated concern to avoid disorder in the affairs of a systemically important institution like HBOS and (ii) the nervousness of the market when the possibility of the Acquisition not completing emerged) that the necessity to abandon the Tripartite’s plan and to fall back on a partial nationalisation of HBOS would have effects beyond Lloyds and HBOS themselves.
