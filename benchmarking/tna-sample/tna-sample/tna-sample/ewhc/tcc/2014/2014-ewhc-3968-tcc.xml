	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a claim by the owners of 120 apartments in two apartment blocks in Concord Street, Leeds.  The Claimants sue the Defendant (“Barr”) who built the development.  The two blocks were built between 2003 and 2006, as part of one development whose stated object was to provide high quality apartments for young professionals.  Many of the apartments were sold off-plan.  There are 171 apartments all told, but for various reasons only 120 of them now remain the subject of this litigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">Unfortunately, the tenders that were initially obtained by the developers, City Wall Limited (“CWC”), came in at significantly more than CWC’s budget.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">Barr, a construction company based in Scotland, had decided to enter the market for the construction of residential property in England and indicated that it would be prepared to build the development for a price that was within CWC’s budget.  However, it made it clear that this would involve making significant reductions to the quality of the finishes.  Also Barr proposed to use a steel frame instead of the concrete frame on which previous designs had been based. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">CWC accepted Barr’s tender.  Barr insisted on having a fairly free hand to make the necessary changes to the specification, some of which had to be negotiated with the planning department of the City Council. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">The project did not go smoothly.  Barr had problems with many of its subcontractors, some of whom were replaced more than once.  Practical completion of the South block was achieved in July 2005 and of the North block in January 2006.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">When the purchasers moved into their apartments they were very taken aback by what they found.  Even one of Barr’s own witnesses described the buildings as looking like council blocks from the 1960s.  There were problems from the outset.  Quite apart from the poor quality of the finishes to the common parts, many of the residents found when, or soon after, they moved in that the intercom system did not work properly and that the covered walkways would flood in heavy rain.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">Within two or three years numerous additional problems had begun to manifest themselves.  There were leaks above the walkway on the fifth floors, leaks from the penthouse balconies into the flats below, leaks into the voids above the walkway soffits, the appearance of mould and condensation in a number of apartments and in the common parts and, in a great many apartments, there were leaks and excessive mould in the shower cubicles. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">In the meantime, there were disputes over Barr’s final account and allegations of defects by CWC.  Subsequently there was an adjudication in July 2007 which resulted in a decision in CWC’s favour, but it seems that CWC spent little, if any, of the sums recovered from Barr in rectifying defects.  Not long afterwards, in February 2008, CWC went into administration.  By this time over 10% of the apartments were still unsold, so there was a consequent shortfall in the contributions to the management charge and there was no satisfactory management structure in place. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">The owners were in a quandary.  CWC was in administration and, in any event, it seems that the owners would have faced serious contractual difficulties in suing CWC for misrepresentation in relation to the quality of the finishes or the defects.  The owners, of course, had no contract with Barr. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">The result is that the Claimants have had to bring this action against Barr under the Defective Premises Act 1972 (“the Act”), alleging that their apartments were not fit for habitation when completed.  Not all the owners are claimants and, indeed, some owners who joined in the proceedings initially have withdrawn their claims.  This appears to have been the result, in part at least, of the terms of a settlement reached between Barr, CWC’s administrators and the Royal Bank of Scotland.  I will have to say a little more about this settlement later on in this judgment. </p>

One point taken by Barr in its defence is that each owner is only entitled to recover his or her contribution to the maintenance charge in respect of the cost of any repairs, and then only if the relevant defect has made that owner’s apartment unfit for habitation.  For example, Barr contends that only the owners of apartments on the top floors are in a position to make a claim about defects in the roof because, whatever the state of the roof, it will not make apartments at lower levels unfit for habitation.  Yet Barr also contends that the claims of the owners of the affected apartments on the top floors are limited to their proportion of the part </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in;text-indent:0.5in">There has been a direction that this hearing would determine the issues relating to what were described as “purely internal defects” by reference to eight lead apartments, together with issues relating to the common parts.  The parties have selected four lead apartments each and the evidence in relation to the internal defects in the apartments has, in accordance with the direction, been largely confined to defects in the lead apartments.  In addition, three witnesses (known as “additional B2 witnesses”) gave evidence about the condition of the apartments which they owned or occupied.  In relation to the common parts, there has been no limitation on the evidence which can be called, save that there was a direction limiting the number of B2 witnesses.  Accordingly, where defects in the common parts, such as the external walls, have resulted in damp or mould within non-lead apartments, it is open to the court on this hearing to make findings in relation to those apartments. </p>

Even if it were open to me to do so, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to embark on this as a paper exercise and without having submissions from the parties in relation to each apartment. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Uratemp</span> it was not suggested that the dwelling occupied by the tenant, which was a single room, extended to the WC or bathroom which he shared with others.  The reasoning was that a WC or a bathroom is a room which one visits for a particular purpose, and would not fairly be described as a living room:  see Lord Millett, at [45]-[47].  By contrast, I would regard a broom cupboard or internally accessed cellar in a house occupied by one family as part of that family’s dwelling even though no one actually uses either space for living.   </p>

The defendant had arranged for the conversion of the building into flats but had carried out no work to the cellar.  The flat suffered from penetrating dampness emanating from the cellar, which formed part of the flat.  The decision is authority for the proposition that liability under the Act can arise out of a failure to do something as well as doing something badly.  I do not find the case to be of much assistance in the context of this claim.

In the context of the Act I would say that the stable block is not a dwelling.  I am less certain about the garage, which in a broad sense might be said to be occupied by the owners of the house.  It may well be that they are buildings that are constructed “in connection with” the provision of a dwelling, namely the house, but that is a separate point.  If the garage roof leaks so that rust-contaminated water drips onto the paintwork of the car parked within, does that mean that the “dwelling” is not fit for habitation?

For example, suppose that the lavatory in a flat has been installed so that there is no washer between the bowl and the soil pipe, with the result that foul water is discharged all over the floor.  If it is the only lavatory in the flat, then in my view any suggestion that the flat was fit for habitation because it would only cost £50 to fit the necessary washer would be unarguable. </p>

As to what is a reasonable time, that will depend on the nature of the defect.  Whereas the brick or stone structure constituting the shell of a building may be capable of lasting for a hundred years or more, one would not necessarily expect the same of the roof or the gutters.  I consider that the upper limit of the reasonable time is the design life of the building, but for some components (such as a boiler) it may be substantially less.  It seems to me that the test is not how long the component actually lasts, but how long it could be expected to last in the actual condition in which it was at completion.  For example, in my view a lift that was installed in such a manner that within a year or two of completion it broke down with monotonous regularity could, subject to the degree of inconvenience caused, mean that the dwelling was not fit for habitation at the time when the work was completed.</p>

This may not be a very attractive answer to the representative claim so far as the West Register apartments are concerned, but in my judgment it is a good one. </p>

In 2007 Mr. Atkinson was made redundant from his position as a business development manager for a catering company.  In January 2008 he accepted employment as a temporary cleaner at Concord Street whilst he looked for other employment.  To cut a long story short, within a few months he was offered £3,000 per month to provide cleaning services to the two blocks.  On 19 May 2008 he set up a company, PGA Property Solutions Ltd, through which he provided his services, at least initially.  As time went on he involved himself increasingly with the problems experienced by the occupiers of the individual apartments and in due course was asked by several of the leasehold owners to take on the management of their apartments. </p>

In addition, he manages two other small blocks of flats in Leeds and some individual flats in another building.  He is clearly hardworking and able and, by his own efforts, has made himself almost indispensable to those responsible for the management of Concord Street.  He is not a builder, but he can do basic DIY tasks and often carries out minor repairs to both the common parts and individual apartments.  For more challenging work he employs appropriate specialists. </p>

Whilst he gave answers on two or three occasions of whose accuracy I was sceptical, I thought that on the whole his evidence was credible and reliable.  It was quite clear that he knew a great deal about Concord Street, and he was almost invariably able to identify the owner of any particular apartment.  On a day to day basis the development is managed by him and Ms. Lisa Kaye.  She deals with the administration and financial aspects of the management, such as collecting the service charge and paying bills.  She used to work for CWC and was subsequently taken on by the management company.  She and Mr. Atkinson work closely together and, indeed, subsequently embarked on a relationship in which I understand they still remain.  I reject entirely the suggestion that he has neglected the maintenance of Concord Street.  Taking the evidence as a whole, I think it is clear that Mr. Atkinson has done the best that he could in very difficult circumstances. </p>

However, things have improved somewhat and the management company now has a reasonable sum in reserve to deal with major items of expenditure, although nothing like enough to address the major problems at Concord Street such as, for example, the roof. </p>

In some apartments it seems that it does work, or at least did work for some of the time, whereas in many apartments it has never worked at all or, at least, not for many years.  Mr. Atkinson and others think that the fault lies in poor wiring.  It has never been repaired because no contractor would undertake to leave it in working order in the light of the uncertain position about the wiring.  He understood that to rewire the system completely would cost of the order of £250,000 and so what has now been done is to replace it by some form of wireless system that connects directly to the mobile phone of a resident.  While such a system has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages.  Mr. Atkinson explained that it took about 15 minutes to programme the system with a new telephone number for a resident (which he has to do by taking his laptop outside and standing in front of the door).  Of course if a resident’s mobile has an interruption of signal or a flat battery, then the system will not work. </p>

A decision was taken to install aluminium trays on the balconies, and this was then done in the case of 18 apartments at a cost of just under £25,000.

The first apartment where this was reported was No. 158, where water appeared to be collecting in the bulkhead above the balcony door.  Mr. Atkinson said in his witness statement that he went on to the roof with a builder that he knew, Mr. Harris, and an owner, Mr. Watson.  They opened up one of the roof panels immediately above the apartment which revealed that there was little insulation, and that what was in place was totally saturated.  In addition, the roof steelwork was wet and covered in rust.  A decision was taken, now criticised by Barr, to install a vent into the roof space in order to provide ventilation and reduce the condensation.  Similar problems arose subsequently in at least four other apartments. </p>

At paragraph 148 of his witness statement, he summarised the position in this way: </p>

When there is a changeover of tenant I will paint over any problems with damp, reseal the shower tray and make sure the apartments are presentable for any viewings.  So long as it has not been raining then it is not too difficult to rent the apartments out, at least for the short term.  It is only once the tenant has been in the apartment for 6 to 9 months the problems start to reappear and I usually then received complaints or the tenants simply move out.  I will then simply turn the apartment round ready for the next one.  Unfortunately, I do not see this lasting forever as at some point I will be unable to paint over the mould (this is starting to happen now) nor will extra sealant work.  The problems are progressive and at the present time we are fighting a losing battle.  We are simply holding the Development together with a bit of sealant and paint.

Taking the evidence as a whole, I consider that the passage quoted in the paragraph above is probably a realistic assessment of the position, at least so far as one can judge from the apartments that have been the subject of detailed investigation at the trial.

In relation to the new mobile phone based intercom, Mr. Wood said that he regarded it as the compromise solution but they chose it because it was affordable.  So far as the legal costs are concerned, Mr. Wood said that the costs of the litigation were being shared between those who were taking part in it.  He explained that the costs initially incurred, which were the costs of initial investigations into the condition of the building, together with the initial legal advice about the merits of the claim, were charged to every leaseholder because each one would have to take a decision as to whether or not to become a claimant.  However, once a decision to embark on litigation had been taken and certain owners had decided to become claimants, only those leaseholders bore the costs of the litigation. </p>

He bought three apartments off plan since, as an employee of BSB, he was entitled to a discount.  He managed to sell one of these in late 2004 at a profit of about £27,000, but his efforts to sell the other two (Nos. 127 and 163) were unsuccessful and so he still owns them. </p>

He said that the general feeling at the time amongst the residents was that those responsible for the maintenance of the buildings were not keeping up with their job.  He said that at the meeting that took place on 28 January 2008 the owners and residents were told that Accent, who had been acting as agents for the management company, had walked away from the contract as a result of the problems that they had experienced with the buildings.

He said that it was his idea to install a vent in the outside wall to provide some ventilation in the space between the liner sheet and the suspended ceiling and thereby minimise condensation.

He visited Concord Street when there was a considerable amount of snow on the main roof.  They went into apartment No. 63 where they saw water running (in cross examination he described it as “cascading”:  Day 8/111) down the side of the walls and coming in above the balcony door before pooling on the living room floor:  he said that the occupier had put buckets out to catch the water by the time they arrived.  They then inspected the balcony above on which there was a considerable amount of standing water.  One problem was that the downpipe from the main roof gutter discharged onto one side of the balcony whereas the outlet was at the other end.  He said that closer investigation showed that there was no adequate waterproofing system to the balcony so that the water could seep into the building below.  This led to the solution of fabricating and installing specially made aluminium trays to hold the water.  Mr. Harris said also that these were never intended as a permanent solution, only a temporary one (Day 8/113).  He said that in order to achieve a perfect seal the asphalt would have to be dressed up under the cill under the balcony door.  In addition, the downpipes from the gutters were re-routed. </p>

She explained in her witness statement that there was a development near Concord Street called Aspect 14, which is recommended to students from Saudi Arabia by their embassy.  Those who cannot lease an apartment in Aspect 14 go to Concord Street as a second choice until an apartment at Aspect 14 becomes available.

She said that over the years almost all of the apartments had experienced a problem with the shower trays.  It seems that Sanderson Weatherall also had a general policy of visiting apartments under their management every quarter.  She said that even in rented apartments she would not expect a shower to require resealing more often than once every 3-5 years.  She compared Concord Street to another development of similar age in Leeds in which none of the apartments under Sanderson Weatherall’s management had required resealing within five years after completion. </p>

She said that in relation to rental income standard two-bedroom apartments were about £100 less per month than similar apartments in other city centre developments.  She said that owing to the condition of the apartments it was virtually impossible to obtain increases in rent although rental levels generally in Leeds had been increasing.  She said that there was still a high demand in Leeds for apartments to rent, and that this had worked in Concord Street’s favour. </p>

She said that when Sanderson Weatherall was approached by owners of apartments in Concord Street wishing to sell them, their standard advice was that the apartments were unsellable as a result of the poor reputation enjoyed by Concord Street, principally as a result of the numerous defects in the buildings. </p>

However, she said that the tenants had to be moved out of the apartment completely whilst the apartment was refurbished.

This, of course, is not a ground of the claim against Barr in this litigation, but I consider that it is a factor that the court is entitled to bear in mind when considering general submissions by Barr to the effect that it is not fair that Barr should be made to pay for the same defects twice - as it says would be the case in respect of some of the defects. </p>

In fact, Barr did not purchase the freehold itself.  It was purchased by a company formed in March 2013, Terrapens Limited.

This was clearly no sort of explanation, and when I asked Mr. Chalmers what he meant by this he did not have any ready answer.

He explained also that some of the problems with the intercom were caused by Barr’s contractors putting screws through conduits and damaging the cables (Day 7/175-6).  He agreed that the condition of the walkway floors was dreadful, a problem that was never resolved because no finish was ever applied (Day 7/120).

I consider that there is some force in this criticism, not only in relation to the claim generally but also in relation to the evidence of Mr. Scott.

For example, his suggestion that if the apartments were unfit for habitation, he would not expect tenants to renew their tenancies (paragraph 4.2 of his report, which was said to have been based on conversations that he had had with about 30 tenants of which he had made no notes);  and his comment that the Claimants had not mitigated their loss by carrying out essential maintenance work (paragraph 30.9). </p>

I think that it would not be unfair to say that, with the exception of about three or four areas (for example, the junction between the roofing sheets and the patent glazing on the top floors, the construction of the penthouse balconies and some aspects of the external glazing), he concluded that either that no responsibility for the defect rested with Barr or that the defect in question had not rendered any dwelling unfit for habitation.  Where he accepted that there were shortcomings in workmanship - such as in the external walls - he said that the level of workmanship was “typical of the industry standard” or that it had not caused the observed mould or condensation.  I take the former to be another way of saying that the work was carried out in a workmanlike manner so that it met the standard required by section 1 of the Act. </p>

As the findings in this judgment demonstrate, the two blocks at Concord Street were poorly constructed in almost every respect.  There was little point in carrying out repairs until the extent of the problem in any particular area had been determined.  As a result of the problems caused by the ingress of water through the external glazing to the walkways the voids above the soffits were full of moisture and the finishes steadily began to deteriorate.  There was little point in repairing or decorating the soffits if the damage was just going to re-occur.  Similar considerations applied to the walkway soffits on the top floor.  Painting the steelwork on the walkways would achieve little until the source of the moisture giving rise to the corrosion was discovered and dealt with.  I do not consider that there are any grounds for criticising the Claimants in respect of their conduct of the management company once they were in control of it. </p>

In addition, in the case of one apartment, in respect of which I heard evidence from the owner, I have found that it was also unfit for habitation because of the extent of mould and damp that appeared as a result of the defects in the construction of the roof (apartment No. 72).  This is a conclusion that might also apply to other apartments in respect of which the owner or occupier did not give evidence.  I have concluded also that each leaseholder can only be restored to the position that he would have been in if the work had been carried out properly by awarding him or her the cost of replacing the entire roof to the block in question.  For the reasons given in Appendix J, I reject Barr’s various proposals for remedial works and, in particular, the submission that it would be sufficient just to repair the section of roof immediately above those apartments which are owned by Claimants in the action.  Therefore I find that the claimant owners of each of the penthouse apartments are entitled to recover the costs of repairing the roof of the block in which the apartment is situated, in other words the Claimants’ Option 1.  In addition, I find that the owners of apartment No. 72 are entitled to the same remedy on the ground that their apartment was unfit for habitation by reason of the extent of the mould and damp caused by the defects in the roof.  I understand that replacing the roof in its entirety will necessarily embrace the cost of dealing with the defect in relation to the junction between the roof sheets and the glazing above the top floor walkways.  The total direct costs of replacing the two roofs has been agreed in the sum of £777,097, plus the relevant indirect costs (as with the external glazing).  In relation to the South block, I find that Mr. and Mrs. Haslehurst and the owner of apartment No. 74 are entitled to the costs of repairing the roof of that block, together with the relevant indirect costs (which will have to be assessed if not agreed).  As I have already mentioned, appropriate directions will have to be given as to the terms on which these damages are to be received and dealt with.  As to the North block, for the same reasons the owners of apartment Nos. 171, 173, 175 and 177 are entitled to damages representing the costs of replacing the roof of that block.  In the absence of agreement, the evidence of owners or occupiers of those apartments, and of No. 74 of the South block, will have to be considered to determine whether or not those claimants are entitled to recover a like sum by way of damages on the further ground that their apartments were also unfit for habitation by reason of the presence of mould and damp caused by the defects in the roof.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

I reject the remedial proposals put forward by Barr and so I accept the proposals put forward by the Claimants.  In my judgment each claimant leaseholder is entitled to the cost of the repairs to the walkway or walkways providing access to or exit from his or her apartment.  This will include the cost of repairs to those parts of the walkways that constitute the means of escape from the apartment in the case of fire.  I anticipate that the damages to which the Claimants collectively will be entitled will cover the cost of repairing all the walkways in both blocks, but I am not in a position to make a finding to that effect at this stage.  The direct cost of the remedial work to the defective walkway drainage is £308,013, again excluding preliminaries and other indirect costs.  That is a sum for which Barr is liable, but directions will again be required as to the appropriate form of order so far as this head of damages concerned. </p>

I have concluded that the risk to the occupants in the event of fire makes each of these apartments unfit for habitation, so I consider that the relevant Claimants are entitled to recover the cost of the appropriate remedial work.  Since it seems that the extent of the problems from this cause differ from apartment to apartment, I consider that the extent of the work required will probably have to be assessed on an apartment by apartment basis and will depend upon whether works to the shower tray are also required in that apartment, but I will hear further submissions on this if necessary.

So far as I can tell, the absence of a Zürich certificate for the common parts appears to have been caused, or at least materially contributed to, by outstanding and unrectified defects to the walkways of the South block.  Since the problems with the walkways were common to both blocks, the same obstacle to the issue of the Zürich certificate would have arisen there also.  However, as I have already mentioned, there are no records of any Zürich inspections after 16 December 2005.  This may be because no further inspections were carried out after that date, but there is no evidence about it. </p>

Accordingly, the diminution in value consequent upon the defects at Concord Street, and which - as between the Claimants and Barr - I regard as largely the responsibility of Barr (because I have rejected the allegation made against the Claimants in relation to the performance of the management company) have caused a further 20% loss in value. </p>

In addition, some of it will be attributable to visible defects for which I have found that Barr is not liable to the Claimants, such as the poor state of the render, which detract from the overall appearance of the buildings and thereby affect the value of the apartments. </p>

In my view, there are two difficulties facing this argument.  First, this is a matter which, in practical terms, is almost incapable of proof.  A claimant may wish to sell his apartment in principle but only at a reasonable price.  The latter will in large measure be dictated by future movements in the market which, of course, cannot be either proved or predicted.  Second, even if a claimant were to say “Yes, of course I will sell my apartment at the earliest opportunity”, knowing that this might attract an additional component to the damages, this evidence would be open to challenge on the basis that it is bound to be tainted by the exigencies of the litigation so that it is inherently unreliable.  I consider that neither of these difficulties can be dismissed as fanciful. </p>

It is in my view not correct of Barr to say that a leaseholder who retains his property through the blight would suffer no loss.  His or her loss is the inability to realise the stigma-free value of the apartment during the blight period should he or she need to do so.  That is an actual, not a contingent loss.   </p>

If an owner’s decision to sell his apartment is dependent on factors such as the current state of the market, his own financial position at the time and so on, there is no way in which one can begin to assess the probability that the relevant circumstances will arise during a particular period (unless, of course, those circumstances have already arisen).  The closest analogy of which I am aware is what is known in personal injury cases as a <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Manchester</span> award, that is a sum by way of general damages that may be awarded to a claimant who has not lost his employment as a result of the injury (or has acquired some other employment) but whose condition is such that, should he lose his job through redundancy or some other reason not related to his injury, he will be under a handicap on the open labour market as a result of his injury.  This is not a type of loss that can be evaluated as a loss of a chance because it cannot be assessed arithmetically. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in">It seems to me that a similar approach would be appropriate here.  The starting point is to take the 10% diminution in value attributable to blight which I have already concluded is appropriate, and to discount that by a modest proportion to reflect the fact of accelerated receipt (because the Claimant is receiving compensation now and not at the midpoint of the blight period).  A further deduction must then be made to reflect the possibility that the particular Claimant will need to put his apartment on the market during the blight period.  This is necessarily a rough and ready exercise and I consider that the justice of the case would be met by reducing my 10% starting point by just over half to reflect these two factors.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.33in">I can take Ms. Lingwood’s case as an example.  In the case of her apartment the equalised price at January 2006 (taken from the spreadsheet attached to Mr. Richardson’s report of 12 December 2013) is £97,600.  So in her case I would award general damages for blight in the sum of £4,500.  It does not matter that in fact she purchased her apartment for much less than the equalised price, because the price she paid reflected not only the fact that it was a repossession but also the fact that the market had dropped considerably by July 2009.  The object of Mr. Richardson’s exercise in equalising the prices was to eliminate the factors that were not connected with the market value of the apartment, such as a sale in unusual circumstances or the buyer being in a position to negotiate a special discount.  I therefore consider that his equalised value is the correct starting point irrespective of the actual purchase price. </p>

For the most part, that evidence was not challenged and the court was able to form a reasonably clear picture of the distress and inconvenience that those who gave evidence had suffered.  It is apparent from Appendix A that not all claimants suffered from all the defects for which I have found Barr to be liable under the Act, or for the same periods.  It seems to me self-evident that any award of general damages for distress and inconvenience must reflect the period over which it was suffered.  By contrast, I consider that it would be both difficult and invidious to make individual assessments of the level of distress caused by, say, a leaking shower tray according to whether a particular individual was particularly robust or unduly sensitive.  I propose therefore to award damages on the basis that each claimant is a reasonably robust individual:  indeed, from what I saw of the witnesses that was in fact my general impression.  So to that extent, a fairly broad brush approach is called for. </p>

The appropriate sums for each claimant assessed on this basis are set out in a table in the Claimant’s closing submissions (paragraph 1046).  Barr did not dispute the entitlement to general damages as a matter of principle, but submitted that the amount should be very modest.  The amount suggested was £200 per annum on the basis of a decision of Ramsey J in <span style="font-style:italic">Eiles v The London Borough of Southwark</span> [2006] EWHC 1411 (TCC), at [152] - [157], and of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Berent v Family Mosaic Housing</span> [2012] EWCA Civ 961, at [39] - [40].  Both cases concerned cracking caused by tree roots and so the inconvenience and discomfort, except during the period when repairs were carried out, was pretty minimal.  This was made clear by Ramsey J.  The decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Berent</span> is in my view of limited assistance because the court concluded that there was no reason to make an award that was higher than the claimed figure of £200 per annum.  By contrast, in this case the inconvenience caused by the malfunctioning intercom was clearly fairly serious and the inconvenience, discomfort and distress caused by the damp and mould, in particular from the leaking shower trays, was in my judgment very significant. </p>

That case involved the failure of damp proofing work and whilst the remedial work was carried out the claimants lived in a nearby rented house.  The court considered that £2,000 per annum would have been an appropriate rate for Mrs. West and £1,500 per annum an appropriate rate for Mr. West.  The stress and anxiety suffered by Mrs. West was described by the court as “undoubtedly significant”, but not at the top of the scale. </p>

However, it has to be borne in mind that there are a number of defects for which Barr is not liable under the Act (for example, the cracking of the render) and these have to some extent added to the overall stress suffered by the occupiers.  For this reason, I do not consider that an award at the top of the range would be appropriate for any of the Claimants in this case, even though it is clear that many of them have suffered a great deal of stress and anxiety to an extent that would otherwise call for an award at or close to the top of the range.   </p>

In the case of Mr. and Mrs. Booth and Mr. Priceman, they had a child or children in the apartment for some of the period, and I have increased the award slightly to reflect this on the ground that a parent with a child is likely to be much more anxious in circumstances such as these than an adult with no children. </p>

This is one of two reasons:  either the occupier will be in alternative accommodation (the reasonable cost of which will form a separate and recoverable expense) and not putting up with the defects, or he or she will be putting up with the work but doing so in the comfort of knowing that things are about to improve.  In any event, I do not know how long the remedial works will take in the case of any particular apartment. </p>

She was hoping to save some money in order to enable her to move up the property ladder in due course.  However, she said that in the event most of the savings that she had hoped to make went to pay for the repairs of defects.  She said that she could not sell her apartment at the moment and that it was not really suitable to be let.  As a result she felt trapped in her situation and has had sleepless nights and been tearful at times about her situation. </p>

Her mother cleaned it and managed to improve the colour and to get rid of the smell.  However, she said that this was for a short period and then “… it was just back with a vengeance” (Day 4/11).  She said that the shower used to leak onto the tiled floor of the shower room, which she used to have to mop up.  She said that the water appeared to be coming out from the plinth below the shower tray and through the shower door.   </p>

Ms. Lingwood took everything out of the cupboard and found that the back and side walls of the cupboard were covered in mould.  She cleaned it off and then went on holiday, but when she came back the mould had reappeared and was, if anything, worse than before.  She then called in a plumber who had done other work in apartments in Concord Street. </p>

She noticed a small amount of mould growing in the right hand corner when she moved in, but over the years it got worse.  She said that she used to clean it off on a regular basis and paint the area with a heavy duty paint, but the mould kept coming back.  More recently mould has developed on the left-hand side of the door also.  She said that the damp and mould in her apartment had got progressively worse with time.  She said that it was sometimes worse than the condition shown in the photographs - it all depended on when she had last cleaned it.  The experts noted in the Scott Schedule that although the property had undergone recent redecoration there was mould growth at the base of both reveals. </p>

She tried to wash it off but it came back almost immediately.  Then she tried leaving the bathroom fan on all day when she was at work (by wedging the door open).  This turned out to have been caused by a problem with the cistern of the WC which had dropped because it had been poorly fixed.  The repairs involved demolition of the walls that had not been replaced on the last occasion and the total cost was £2,800. </p>

He shared it with a friend and they lived there from October 2009 to October 2013.  Mr. Haim was attracted by the penthouse flat at Concord Street because it was relatively large and the rent was low by comparison with other flats in Leeds.  He was studying for a Master’s degree and the apartment was close to the University.  For the first two years they occupied the apartment under a twelve month lease, renewing in September 2010 at the same rent having made it clear that they would leave if it was put up, but thereafter they remained on a monthly rolling lease.   </p>

Barr apparently recorded that the cause of this water was the terrace above.  This problem continued into 2007 in spite of remedial work that was carried out to the terrace above (as Mr. Veitch acknowledged in his letter to CWC dated to April 2007).  In June 2007 Barr reported to Mr. Watson that the joint between the asphalt and the rainwater gully in the balcony above his apartment had broken down, probably exacerbated by recent heavy rainfall, and that it had effected a temporary repair.   </p>

He said that there was mould and damp around the shower cubicle.  He complained also about the “bodged attempt” to stop the water leakage above the balcony windows, which consisted of the area having been covered with plastic sheeting.  He said that the extractor fans fitted in the bathroom and kitchen appeared ineffectual and that windows had to be opened whenever the flat was occupied to ventilate the smells.  He demanded a rent reduction on account of his son’s living conditions.  In August 2012 the tenants declined to renew the tenancy and moved out.  The problem of water ingress around the balcony doors still remains unresolved and water staining above the balcony doors, together with water damage to the flooring below, was noticed on the experts’ inspection on 30 January 2013. </p>

In evidence Mr. Watson said that he would not have accused the tenants of isolating the fans unless he believed it was true (although in his witness statement he said that he had never visited the apartment during the tenancy), but he said that he did not have any wholehearted belief that the problems with the shower were caused by a lack of maintenance (Day 5/135).

Further repairs were again required in May 2012, but Mr. and Mrs. Wood were advised to check the floor after the conclusion of the existing tenancy. </p>

He explained that the costs initially incurred, which were the costs of initial investigations into the condition of the building, together with the initial legal advice about the merits of the claim, were charged to every leaseholder because each one would have to take a decision as to whether or not to become a claimant.

In the latter he said that it was possible that in unusual rain conditions the ground water level rises above the floor level in the North block so that water is entering the car park by this route as well as by means of the external glazing.  A borehole sunk by WSP in February 2003 struck groundwater at 7.5 m below ground level, which then rose in the next 20 minutes to about 30.6 m Above Ordnance Datum.  That is about 2.5 m below the lowest point in the North block car park. </p>

Since that core was drilled there is no evidence that water has ever been seen to come up through it, although Mr. Tasker would expect it to be doing so.  In cross-examination he suggested that a reason for this could be that the clay below the borehole might have formed a plug so as to prevent water coming up through the hole.  In the end, Mr. Tasker could only say that there was a clear possibility of water ingress from below between the sheet piles and the concrete slab (Day 13/105). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty of ventilating the apartments was a constant theme of the evidence.  When I went into apartment No. 122 during the view I was struck by the musty smell in the living room, the door of which was closed.  The apartment had been empty for about three weeks and the trickle vents had been left open.  I regard the suggestion that trickle vents or extractor fans were not used properly as unfounded.  There is evidence, albeit not very cogent, that the extractor fans in the shower rooms may have lacked the capacity to remove all the moisture.  Whatever may be the position under normal conditions, I am quite certain that those fans are not capable of removing the excess moisture produced by a leaking shower tray.  There is little evidence that the fans in the kitchen area were not used when cooking was taking place, and I see nothing unreasonable about the occupants turning off the fan when the kitchen was not in use in order to avoid the irritation of the noise. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject Mr. Allen’s evidence that the problems with the shower trays were caused by a lack of maintenance.  I have concluded that the problem was caused primarily by differential movement between the shower tray and one or more of the adjacent partition walls, which no amount of maintenance would have resolved.  The only effective means of repair was to take the entire installation apart and rebuild it.  This conclusion should come as no surprise:  there is nothing to suggest that the population of occupants at Concord Street is any different from the population at large, and the incidence of failures of the shower units at Concord Street is way above anything that could normally be expected.  This points strongly to the cause of the problem being something to do with the construction of the shower cubicles, rather than with the behaviour of the occupants of the apartments.  In my view, for the reasons that I explain in more detail in Appendix M to this judgment, that is exactly what it was. </p>

Since Mr. Allen appears to have kept a note of precisely where damp was or was not found (see, for example, paragraphs 8.9 and 8.17), I find it surprising that he did not make a note of which apartments were the source of the information to which he refers.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Another criticism made by Mr. Allen is that the occupants did not open the bedroom windows giving onto the walkways, which he says can be partially opened and locked so that they are secure and cannot be used to gain access to the apartments (November 2013 Report, paragraph 9.16).  However, it was the evidence of Mr. Atkinson that many residents did not have confidence in these window locks and were reluctant to go out to work leaving the bedroom windows open.  It is certainly the case that the residents do not leave these windows open during the day, at least not in winter:  during the view on 14 January 2014 I made a point of looking to see whether any windows were open on the walkway elevations, and I think that I noticed only one.  These windows are readily accessible so I can well understand that people would be reluctant to leave them open whilst they were out, unless they were completely confident that they were secure.  I see no reason to doubt Mr. Atkinson’s evidence on this point and I accept it. </p>

I find that the root cause of the problem lay in the manner in which the apartments (and, in some cases, the roof of each block) had been built. </p>

Having regard to the evidence as a whole, this was a realistic concession.  The projection of the balcony supports through the external skin of the building was always going to present difficulties.  Mr. Goffin said that the detail at the junction was not best practice.  He said also that the holes in the external boarding through which the brackets projected were left open and unsealed for about a year with the result that water was able to penetrate into the fabric of the building which should have been dry.  He said that, with hindsight, he was very embarrassed to have been an architect who was involved in this aspect of the design.  He said that it was difficult to apply the sealant effectively around the balcony supports because the boards had not been sufficiently carefully cut around them (see Day 3/130-132, and 138-139). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Leaving aside the omission of a thermal break between the balcony supports and the vertical stanchions, I have no hesitation in finding that the detailing and execution of the junction between the external skin of the building and the balcony supports was very poor.  I have no doubt that water or moisture was able to penetrate through to the cavity between the inner and outer skins of the external wall, causing elevated levels of humidity.  Whether any water actually penetrated the inner skin of plasterboard (as opposed to making it damp) is difficult to say.  I have seen no evidence that it did, either during construction or subsequently.  There is a subsidiary issue as to whether rainwater could run along the balcony support and into the building, because the surface of the bracket falls slightly downwards towards the building.  Barr said that this would be largely prevented by the horizontal steels that rested on the balcony supports (at right angles to the line of the bracket) which in turn supported the timbers forming the floor of the balcony.  I consider that whilst this might have acted as a barrier to much of the water that fell on the supports, it was not always a complete barrier and in any event it was still possible for driven rain to get in behind the cross steels to the point where the bracket was bolted onto the vertical stanchion. </p>

This is an area that cannot readily be seen, but in his quantum report Mr. Tasker thought there was a “high probability” of corrosion extending immediately behind the facade.  Barr does not agree.  On this I prefer Mr. Tasker’s view, primarily in the light of the findings that I have made above in relation to moisture penetration through to the inner cavity of the wall. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Scott makes a further point in relation to the cavity between the external rendered boarding and the breather layer within (often incomplete).  He refers to Mr. Allen’s description of it as “vented cavity”, but says that this is inaccurate.  Mr. Scott says that because the cavity as constructed is formed by single battens - that is to say, battens in one direction only - and there is no provision for the installation of any vents, there is no facility for air to move through the cavity.  It is, in effect, trapped in the space between adjacent battens.  It is Mr. Scott’s view that in order to comply with BS 5250:2002 “The Code of Practice for Control of Condensation in Buildings” provision has to be made for venting the cavities between the battens.  One way of doing this would be to introduce a second layer of battens fixed at right angles to the first layer.  The boarding is then fixed to the outer layer of battens leaving room for air to move right through the entire cavity between the two layers of boarding.  It may be that Mr. Allen appears to accept this in principle, as I mention in the next paragraph. </p>

He says that this is likely to result in the opening up of the joints with the passage of time.  Mr. Allen considers that, save in the case of Apartments 23 and 122, in order to prevent water staining and further deterioration of the render, vents should be added to allow trapped moisture to escape from the wall cavity.  However, Mr. Allen makes the point, which I accept, that there are no signs of compression failure which is typical of the lack of proper provision for movement. </p>

Mr. Scott relies on Approved Document to Part C of the Building Regulations 1991 which provides, at paragraph 5.1, that the cladding of the building should “… resist the penetration of rain and snow to the inside of the building”.  Paragraph 5.8 refers to the fact that insulation can be affected by condensation and cold bridges. </p>

It was missing in a number of places on many of the supports and these had corroded to an extent that was greater than the experts would have expected.  Barr’s position, through Mr. Allen, was that the extent of the rust on the balcony supports was the result of inadequate maintenance.  Mr. Tasker’s view was that painting of this type of steelwork would not usually be done more frequently than about 20-year intervals (Day 13/8).  Mr. Allen contended for intervals of about eight years.  Subject to any more stringent obligation which may be imposed by the lease, I prefer Mr. Tasker’s evidence which seems to me to be more in line with what a reasonable building owner would expect to have to do.   </p>

The steel balcony supports were, according to the evidence, supplied pre-painted and then painted again following installation.  Once the balcony supports had been installed the boarding comprising the external skin of the building should have been sealed at the point where the skin was broken by the balcony support.  In the case of Concord Street, not only were the holes not sealed for some time, so that rain water could penetrate into the inner part of the external wall, but also when they were sealed I find that the work was very badly done. </p>

The original paintwork on the supports had been damaged, as Mr. Tasker pointed out in evidence (Day 13/7), during the course of movement and storage and so there was a potential for corrosion if the parts of the support within the envelope of the building were exposed to rain or moisture.  That was one of the purposes of ensuring that there was a proper seal around the support that the point where it broke the skin of the building.  Accordingly, I find that any corrosion to the steelwork of the balcony supports that was within the external skin of the building had nothing whatever to do with any potential failure to comply with the terms of the lease. </p>

It is sufficient if Barr’s breach of duty makes a material contribution to the relevant loss.  It is no answer for Barr to assert that there was another cause that also made a material contribution to the loss (unless, in circumstances which do not apply in this case, there is room for an allegation of contributory negligence).

As a proposition, I am not sure that this was really in dispute save as to what is meant by “substantially”.  The Claimants suggest that any interference with the enjoyment of the occupation of an apartment that is more than minor can be regarded as rendering the apartment unfit for habitation:  they submit that what renders the dwelling unfit for habitation is the character of the defect, rather than its magnitude or extent (see paragraph 96 of the Claimants Opening Submissions). </p>

In cross examination Mr. Allen advocated what he said was a similar product manufactured by Antel.

Mr. Allen suggested that the vapour barrier coating could then be painted over with a suitable interior paint to match the existing declaration.  However, in cross examination it was put to Mr. Allen that it was not possible to paint over the Antel product with ordinary interior paint.

In some witnesses’ statements the door entry system is not mentioned at all, usually in statements by leaseholders who had never lived in the property.  In about half of these the contemporaneous documents record that there were problems with the door entry system to the apartments belonging to those witnesses, which suggests that the tenants had not reported them.  In relation to the remaining apartments there is no evidence at all that the door entry phone did not work satisfactorily.

The CSMCL board called for three quotations to repair it (see for example the quotations from Garndene dated 12 October 2010 and Experience Living Ltd dated 16 October 2010).  On the basis that the cost of repair was about £25,000 plus VAT this was still being considered in July 2011 (see e-mail of 18 July 2011 from Ms Kaye to some of the board members).  The board had received authorisation at the second AGM on 2 February 2012 (as confirmed in the minutes) from the owners/shareholders to spend around £25,000 to repair it.  However, none of the contractors were prepared to guarantee the repairs as they were concerned that there may be issues with the wiring to individual apartments.  As reported at the board meeting of 3 April 2012 a definitive quotation was needed.  When the CSMCL board asked for a quote to include rewiring throughout the buildings the cost went up to £250,000 (as referred to in Ms Kaye’s e-mail of 30 November 2012), which was not an affordable or realistic option.

In my judgment, the position in relation to the door entry system is quite clear.  For whatever reasons, the system was not properly installed and has never worked properly for the great majority of apartments.  Mr. Allen’s reference to No. 134 as an apartment with a working door entry phone is the only example referred to expressly in the evidence of a door entry phone that works, although I would accept that there are likely to be some others.  However, from my review of the documents I am satisfied that about 80% of the apartments belonging to those Claimants who have made a witness statement had a door entry system that was said not to work or was reported as not working, and on this basis it is likely that the system would need to be replaced or overhauled in its entirety in order to ensure that all the apartments that currently do not have a properly working system will have one that does work. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Putting it another way, of the 120 or so apartments owned by the present Claimants, the documents suggest that the best part of 100 have a door entry system that either does not work at all or does not function properly and reliably.  Further, if this is the case then I am satisfied that it is the result of defects in the original work (or attempts by Barr to have it rectified) or damage by other sub-contractors and not because of any unsuccessful attempts by the Claimants to rectify the problems subsequently. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr. Allen’s suggestion that the present state of the door entry system is the result of alterations to the wiring since its installation (impliedly, by or on behalf of the residents) and/or lack of maintenance since the completion of construction is in my view manifestly unsupportable.  The contemporaneous documents clearly record the fact that many apartments had problems with the door entry system fairly shortly after they became occupied, if not from the outset.  Further, there is no evidence whatever that the Management Company or anyone on its behalf carried out any work to any part of the door entry system.  By contrast, there is evidence that during 2006 various engineers either looked at or carried out work on the system at the request of Barr. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I find that the Management Company did not carry out any work on the door entry system for the reasons given by Mr. Wood in the passage from his witness statement that I have set out above.  In my view, this was entirely reasonable.  It seems to me that there was little purpose in paying £25,000 or more for a company to carry out work that it was not in a position to guarantee.  In addition, I consider that the temporary wireless arrangement that is now in place was a reasonable response by the Management Company to the predicament in which it found itself.  I accept that it is a temporary arrangement and must be viewed as such:  it is not as good as the system that the Claimants would have had if the original system had been properly designed and installed. </p>

It is, I regret to say, merely one example of Barr’s intransigent attitude towards many of its responsibilities in respect of this development. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Whether or not the door entry system serving any particular apartment might have worked for a short period after the apartment was first occupied, it is clear that when the work to the North block was practically complete in January 2006, the door entry system was already demonstrating that it was not fit for its purpose.  The only plausible reason for this is that it was not designed or installed in a professional or workmanlike manner.  Accordingly, I find that the Claimants have proved that the required standards of design and workmanship were not met in relation to the design and installation of the intercom system.  I set out below the apartments in respect of which I find that the door entry system was not designed or installed in a professional and workmanlike manner: </p>

So far as houses in single occupation are concerned, I agree with this for the reasons I have already given.  But that is irrelevant.  Barr has adduced no evidence that apartment blocks similar to those at Concord Street were being built at the same time without any form of door entry system and, in the light of the considerations about security that I have already mentioned, I consider it very unlikely that this happened.  The concluding sentence of paragraph 25.7 of Mr. Allen’s report that I have quoted above is no more than a bare assertion unsupported by any reasons and I disagree with it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I find, therefore, that every one of the apartments listed at paragraph 21 above was rendered unfit for habitation by Barr’s failure to provide a reliable intercom system when building the two blocks at Concord Street.  For the reasons that I have already given, the fact that in very many cases the intercom system either did not work at all from the outset or ceased to work properly within a few months of completion demonstrates in my view either that it cannot have been properly installed or, if it was properly installed, that it was damaged by other work carried out by Barr as Mr. Veitch suggested.  Indeed, it may have been a combination of both. </p>

This cost about £8,000.  It was an audio system only and so there was no video facility that enabled an occupier to see the person at the main door.  It works through the occupier’s mobile phone so if, for any reason, that has no signal, is not at hand, not working or has a flat battery, the system will not work.  Another difficulty is that it takes Mr. Atkinson about ten or 15 minutes to re-programme the system (which he has to do physically by plugging his laptop into the fascia outside the main door) every time there is a change of occupier or phone number. </p>

In addition, it seems to me that there are weaknesses in a system which relies on the occupier having a working mobile phone with him or her at all times.  It was suggested that the current system had an advantage over the original system because the occupier of an apartment could let the person in the main door when he or she was not in the apartment.  However, as Mr. Atkinson pointed out, this would be of limited use if the caller did not also have a key to the relevant apartment.  I do not find this to be a material advantage. </p>

It therefore looks as if the cost of replacing the entire system may be less than the aggregate of the costs of reinstalling about 50 odd door entry systems on an apartment by apartment basis.  If that is the case, then Barr should not have to satisfy that part of each Claimant’s award of damages in full, but only to the extent of the lower cost of replacing the entire system.  This can be achieved by an order directing that the relevant part of each individual award of damages is not to be enforced to the extent that the aggregate sum paid by Barr would exceed the cost of overhauling the complete door entry system - that is to say the agreed sum of £71,029 (or the cost of the same work at the time when it is reasonable to carry it out). </p>

This is designed so as to be waterproof on the outside but not on the inside.  However, with the agreement of CWC and, seemingly, to the knowledge of the City Council’s planning department, Barr decided to reverse this glazing since they anticipated serious maintenance problems if glazed panels had to be replaced because there was no suitable access to those elevations of the buildings.  The result is that the nonwaterproof face now forms the exterior of the screen.  There is no evidence to suggest that Kawneer was consulted about this proposal.  Indeed, at paragraph 30.6 of his report Mr. Allen said: </p>

The water runs or condenses onto the cold metal surfaces of both the steel frame for the building and the steelwork within the walkway soffits.  The rest of the water emerges from the base of the Kawneer system and is discharged straight into the basement car park. </p>

It says that the system’s internal drainage system is, in effect, redundant since the mullions have been capped at the top and are now on the inside of the building.  It contends that any water that penetrates the system does so in miniscule quantities and will be discharged to the exterior of the building via a chute (which is a little above ground level) which has been or can be installed at the bottom of each mullion.  This is strongly disputed by the Claimants. </p>

The letter recorded that it had been agreed at the meeting that Pendant would appraise the design at eaves level above the curtain walling with a view to providing a solution to the water ingress problem.  Unfortunately, the photographs that have survived are not clear but the terms of the letter tend to suggest that the problem was not confined to leaks at basement level. </p>

The document, prepared by a Mr. England, who had formerly worked for Kawneer, made it clear that it would not be possible to provide a fully waterproof system.  The first objective was to minimise the amount of water entering the main structural box area of the curtain walling mullions and to drain out any water that did get into the system.  There were a number of other objectives also.  Although I understand that some form of trial was conducted, the work described in the method statement was never carried out.  The position was that no-one could come up with a satisfactory solution to make the system watertight. </p>

There is evidence that water leaks from the holes in the walkways soffits where the lights are fitted and I have already concluded that the probable source of this water is leakage through the external glazing.  I find that the modifications that were made to the glazing system in order to install it back to front have created a path for external water to enter the building from the mullions in the glazing screen.  I find that most of that water collects in the voids above the walkways soffits, although I accept that from time to time there are leaks from the soffits onto the walkways below.  However, I find that such leaking makes a material, but a relatively small contribution to the ponding of water on the walkways. </p>

He proposes the detail that was devised by Hurd Rolland (at the time of the second adjudication) to accommodate the mullions which rest directly on the wall below.  These proposals are wholly untried and are very dependent on the precise gap between the wall and the base of the screen at any particular point into which the flashing has to be fitted.  Mr. Allen’s scheme appears to depend on the as built dimensions being exactly as they are shown on the as built drawings.  Mr. Scott’s evidence was that in places the relevant dimension is substantially less.

It is agreed between the experts (Mr. Tasker and Mr. Allen) that leakage has caused some corrosion to the walkway steelwork.  Mr. Tasker said that the current extent of the corrosion is not sufficient to cause a significant overstress or weakening of the steelwork so that adequate protection against further corrosion would be sufficient by way of remedial work.  Calculations prepared by Mr. Tasker (at paragraph 3.1.1 of his report), which applied to both of the corrosion of the steelwork below the roof and at the walkway steelwork, led him to conclude that the corrosion of the walkways support beams and columns could lead to them becoming excessively weakened within the service life of the building (paragraph 3.3.12), which would render the walkway dangerous.  Mr. Tasker’s conclusion, which I accept, is that unless the exposure of the steelwork to moisture is eliminated or significantly reduced, this steelwork must be protected with a suitable corrosion resistant paint. </p>

I therefore see no reason why the existing fittings cannot be removed whilst the works are carried out and then put back.  I would therefore disallow the cost of replacing all the light fittings, whilst allowing a contingency to provide for the replacement of some that are already unserviceable or which are broken during the works. </p>

If part of the living room ceiling in an apartment gets damp or admits water every time it rains heavily, then I would not regard the apartment as fit for habitation.  The fact that it is occupied throughout the period when leaks occurred is largely irrelevant:  neither the owner nor the tenant would have expected the apartment to leak when he or she bought or leased it and, once installed, would probably have had little choice but to stay there.

In addition, Alsecco pointed out that there had been a loss of moisture in and around the boards and the cavities.  They expressed the opinion that moisture movement in both the battens and the boards was a major contributing factor to the movement that had caused the problems being experienced.  There is no doubt that the boards were exposed to moisture during construction </p>

It seems that Harrisons may not have carried out any of the rendering, as Mr. Veitch thought, because the subsequent correspondence is with Lord and Downing.  On 9 August 2005 Barr issued an instruction to Lord and Downing to proceed with the filling of excessively wide joints in the cementitious boarding.  As Mr. Veitch confirmed, this instruction would not have been necessary if the sub-contractor who installed the boards, Horbury, had done its job properly. </p>

There were also isolated vertical cracks from floor to ceiling.  Barr said that it had no proposed solution for overcoming this cracking.  On 22 September 2005 Alsecco wrote to Barr to express concern about various aspects relating to the render.  First, that the moisture/water problem behind the sheathing layer did not appear to have been rectified, which might lead to further movement, cracking and staining to the render finish.  It said that the workmanship in the application of the sheathing layer (the fibreglass mesh that forms part of the render system) was poor.  In addition, Alsecco said that the joints between the boards were of irregular size, boards were not fixed at critical points, were out of line and had been patched using a variety of materials.  Alsecco concluded by saying that these matters would have to be attended to in order that both the quality and durability of the finish would be maintained.  The poor workmanship in fitting the boards is shown very clearly in some of the contemporaneous photographs:  the boards were not fixed so that they formed a flat surface and the width of the joints between the boards was erratic.  Mr. Veitch conceded that the workmanship - as shown in the photographs - was not good.  I find that it was very poor throughout. </p>

The Alsecco data sheet for the render system used at Concord Street described it as “anti-crack” and “flexible and anti-cracking”.  In my view, this must be taken to mean what it says.  The cracks that have appeared on the walkway elevations to my mind indicate either that the product does not perform as the brochure described, or that it was applied to an unsuitable substrate:  in my judgment the latter is the correct explanation.  This view is confirmed to some extent by a comment made by Lord and Downing, one of Barr’s sub-contractors, who said, after completion, that “Many of the items on the reports highlight problems with the particle board used as the base for our render systems”.  Coming, as it did, from a sub-contractor whose work was being criticised, this observation must be treated with some caution, but nevertheless I consider that there is some truth in it. </p>

There is no doubt that the quality of the insulation in the area over the eaves is very poor:  Lord Marks accepted that it was “rubbishy”, which I thought was a fair description.  Further, thermal images show that there is a significant lack of insulation round the perimeter of the roofs and along the line of the central ridge.  There are one or two other places where the insulation is patchy, but generally the images suggest that the bulk of each roof is effectively insulated. </p>

This was because those brackets created a vertical obstruction to the placing of the vapour control layer across the existing lower metal liner sheet of the roof.  Mr. Scott said that he understood that it was proposed that the vapour control layer should be taken up and over the capping sheet supports, which was how the work was initially priced (see paragraph 21 of Appendix B to the Quantum Experts Joint Statement No. 2 of 10 January 2014).

Again, I think this was a suggestion that emerged for the first time very shortly before the trial, or perhaps even during the evidence.  At any rate, it had all the hallmarks of a solution that had been conceived on the hoof when Mr. Allen realised that his detail as originally proposed did not comply with the British Standard.  In a post-trial e-mail dated 7 February 2014 Mr. Scott suggested that this proposal would involve raising the level of the eaves by approximately 65-70 mm, with the result that the sheets forming the external skin would no longer sit flat on the roof surface but would “kick up” prior to the bottom fixing.

He appears to have made no allowance for the replacement of insulation that had become damp or mouldy, which Mr. Scott found it to be (as did Mr. Harris at the time of his earlier investigation).  The figure strikes me as quite unrealistically low, particularly since Ashford recommended in 2006 that the insulation should be replaced.  Although the Claimants asserted that the entirety of the insulation should be replaced because it was not or, so far as it was visible, did not appear to be a type of insulation which was suitable for installation in a pitched roof since it was not rigid.  There was no evidence that the insulation had in fact slumped as a result of this which, given that the slope of the roof was only 10%, does not surprise me.  I reject the suggestion that all the insulation has to be replaced on this ground, although I accept that it is likely that a proportion much greater than 5% will have to be replaced because of the presence of damp or mould. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A further feature of Barr’s proposals as finally presented was that they involved carrying out remedial works to parts of the roof only and leaving substantial parts unrepaired.  The parts to be repaired were those over apartments owned by claimants in the action.  The parts over those apartments not owned by claimants were to be left as they are.  The proposals therefore involved the installation of some form of barrier along the lines of the party walls between the flats to isolate those parts of the roof which had been repaired from those parts which had not.  As I have mentioned, what Mr. Allen subsequently proposed was to make large sausage shaped barriers of insulation wrapped in polyethylene and to place these above the party walls.  The metal sheets would then be laid on top of them pressing them down - presumably in the expectation that this will achieve an airtight fit.  In cross-examination Mr. Tasker was presented with a rather different proposal, which was to run the vapour control membrane up the party wall to the level of the roof (by which Lord Marks meant up to the impermeable liner sheets).  Mr. Tasker was reluctant to endorse this approach on the ground that the building was never designed with such a form of installation in mind (Day 12/161).  Mr. Allen’s “sausage” proposal was not put to him.  I am not persuaded that either of these arrangements would be wholly moisture proof;  again, it seems to me that each solution would depend heavily on the quality of the workmanship of those installing it.  In addition, in his e-mail of 7 February 2014 Mr. Scott pointed out that there was no vapour control layer in the existing party wall between apartments and therefore the barrier in the roof space would be bypassed by air diffusion through the plasterboard.  He therefore concluded that it was unclear how the insulation in the roof space would work having regard to the uninsulated wall beneath.  But, as I have said, none of this was properly explored in evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">One drawback of the approach of repairing the roof above certain apartments only is that the unpainted steelwork in the unrepaired parts would continue to be exposed to moisture and would continue to corrode as a result.  This would not present any risk of failure in the short term, but Mr. Tasker was not prepared to dismiss the risk of failure altogether in the context of a building with a 50-60 year design life.  He said that as a designer he would not be prepared to proceed on the basis that such a risk could be ignored (Day 12/153-4).  Mr. Harris said that when he looked into the roof space in 2010 the steelwork had already started to delaminate.  In its Supplementary Closing Submissions Barr submitted that all the relevant steelwork is in the ceiling void, not the roof void, and hence is safe from corrosion (paragraph 24).  However, this assertion is in flat contradiction to the evidence, which I accept, that significant corrosion had already taken place by 2010 (and when the void was a warm space). </p>

The short answer to this submission is that fitness for habitation is to be assessed at the time of completion of the relevant work.  If there is a latent defect which presents a risk to the structural integrity of the building, and the remedial work is going to involve work that, in the ordinary course of maintenance a prudent building owner would not expect to carry out (such as replacing or protecting steelwork in the roof), then the claimant is entitled to recover the costs of the work for the reasons given above.

It is clear from the evidence of Mr. Haslehurst that the problems of damp and mould which he described, and which I find were the result of the poor construction of the roof, that the problem could not be described as either transient or trivial.  I am quite satisfied that the extent of damp and mould caused by the defects in the construction of the roof rendered the apartment unfit for habitation from the time when construction was completed.  It is irrelevant that the problem did not manifest itself immediately, but took a few years to do so, because there has been no suggestion that this was damage of a type that routine maintenance might have prevented. </p>

I recall seeing one case on the view (I did not make a note of which apartment it was) where the gap between the outer edge of the door and the frame exceeded 5 mm for almost the full height of the door.

It is because the internal walls were and are inadequately supported and have dropped at mid-span. The structural element of the floors and ceilings of most of the flats are cast in situ concrete slabs. These generally deflected slightly during curing, and have probably deflected further when loaded. The flooring in each apartment consists of a simulated wood floor which is made of tongue and groove MDF strips covered with a finish that has the appearance of floorboards. The MDF strips are in turn laid on chipboard sheets supported on wooden battens (about 30 mm square) laid at about 600 mm centres. </p>

These consist of a plastic frame, into which the batten sits, with a 10 mm layer of fairly rigid foam fixed to its base. The purpose is to prevent the transmission of sound and vibration through the floors. The effect is that the floor moves slightly when it is walked on because the Proctor supports give about 1-1.5 mm under a person's weight.  However Proctor recommends, and it is obviously good practice, that there should be two battens laid side by side where the battens are supporting point loads, which is effectively the case where they support the internal partitions.  Such an arrangement would roughly halve the load on individual Proctor supports below the battens, and thereby reduce the deflection caused by the weight of the partitions and any adjacent furniture (or by an occupier passing close to the partition wall, as might happen in the smaller bedrooms). </p>

They tend to act as a rigid beam.  However, when the steel frame supporting the floor slabs was subsequently loaded by the installation of the floors, internal walls, kitchen units and so on in the apartment it deflected slightly.

If the silverfish came from the next door apartment, as I find they probably did, I cannot envisage any other means by which they could have entered Mr. Booth’s apartment.

However Mr. Allen agrees that live load deflection will cause slight distortions of the door frames which can sometimes cause doors to jam requiring maintenance and adjustment.

I find that this work was not carried out in a workmanlike or professional manner so that it constituted a breach of the standard set by section 1 of the Act.  Where the relevant door frames have distorted to an extent such that the gaps exceed those prescribed by the British Standard, or where a door cannot be shut or, if closed, cannot remain firmly closed because the latch is ineffective, the requirements of the guidance provided by the Building Regulations have not been met.

If the state of affairs inevitably brought about by the manner of construction is one that, if evident at the time of completion, would have led to the dwelling being condemned as unfit for habitation, I cannot see why that state of affairs should permit the dwelling to be regarded as fit for habitation simply because it did not manifest itself until a year or two after completion. </p>

Accordingly, the surface of the tiles on the two opposite sides of the alcove would have to be less than 1,186 mm apart if the surface of the tiles is to meet or overhang the horizontal section of the rim of the shower tray. </p>

However, there was a ready solution to this - albeit one that would probably have come at a modest cost - and that was to install an additional layer of plasterboard on one or more of the walls of the alcove.  Given the very tight budget that Barr had taken on, I strongly suspect that this solution was not adopted because it would have been more expensive.  Alternatively, it may be that it did not occur to anyone to do it or, perhaps, it was not thought to be necessary.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me to be self-evident that it is desirable for the plane of the surface of the wall tiles to overlap the horizontal section of the rim of the shower tray.  Not only would this mean that most of the water would be deflected into the basin of the shower tray, but also - as Mr. Allen accepted in evidence - water from a shower will less readily penetrate a fissure that is in a horizontal plane than a fissure that is in a vertical plane.  In the case of the latter, gravity will assist the passage of water through the fissure and, in addition, since for most of the time the water from the shower will be travelling more or less vertically its own kinetic energy would tend to force it more readily into a vertical fissure then into a horizontal fissure.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">

However, there may also be other good reasons for this guidance that are less obvious.  In any event, I consider that the guidance provided by the shower manufacturers in this respect represents good practice and that, whether one regards it as a matter of specification or of workmanship, the plane of the surface of the wall tiles in a shower cubicle should overhang the rim of the shower tray (and, in the case of trays with rounded edges such as have been installed at Concord Street, it should overhang the horizontal section of the rim). </p>

They have agreed that the best solution is to install the concrete battens directly onto the concrete slab without using the Proctor supports.  This involves removing the existing shower tray and the chipboard flooring beneath it.  New timber battens are then laid directly on the concrete floor, using shims to adjust their height and level.  Additional battens are then laid underneath the adjacent partitions and, with the use of wedges, made to form a tight fit below the partitions.

The obvious method is simply to double board one or more of the walls of the shower cubicle.  The extent to which this may require the removal of tiles other than those on the wall that is to be double boarded will depend on the extent to which those tiles have either become loosened or displaced as a result of underlying moisture penetration into the plasterboard below or have been unavoidably damaged by the remedial work. </p>

Mr. Pearson has spent 19 years with BSRIA, and is a Category 3 thermographer (the highest level of qualification).  Mr. Selves has a degree in Special Physics and is a member of the Institute of Materials and Institute of Roofing.  His experience is principally of inspection and reporting on the condition of roofing and cladding and giving technical advice on the use of different types of cladding.  He has a practical experience of thermographic surveys.  Unlike Mr. Pearson, Mr. Selves is an experienced expert witness. </p>

The camera can measure the temperature of the object at which it is pointed.  The camera can also measure the relevant ambient temperature.  For an interior, this will be the air temperature in the vicinity of the object or area being examined, which can sometimes be derived by taking the temperature of an object in the relevant part of the room, such as a lampshade, which is likely to be at the same temperature as the air. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For external images, the estimation of the ambient external temperature is more complicated.  For a part of a building at low level facing other buildings, the ambient air temperature may be the relevant external air temperature.  But if the object is at high level on a wall or roof that effectively faces the open sky, an apparent temperature (in effect, a composite temperature) is taken to reflect the mean temperature of the sky that the object is facing.  This will probably be much lower than the ambient air temperature in the vicinity of the camera because, as Mr. Pearson explained, a night sky can be as cold as -43°C so that an ambient temperature of, say, -15°C is not implausible for some images. </p>

First, the wrong version of the appendix giving the details of all the measurements taken was attached to Mr. Pearson’s first report.  The appendix attached contained the default setting for all the ambient temperatures (in this case -15°C), instead of the temperatures which had or should have been subsequently inserted by the thermographers.  Although the corrected values had been used when the BSRIA report was written, the uncorrected appendix was attached to the report in error when it was served.

The U value is the measurement of heat lost through a unit area (1 m²) of a wall when the temperature difference between its two sides is 1°K.  The thermal index is the difference between the temperature of the anomaly and the outside temperature divided by the difference between the ambient inside temperature and the outside temperature.  It is a means of assessing the temperature of the inside surface of the wall in question.  It was Mr. Pearson’s position that a thermal index of 0.75 represented the acceptable lower bound for the degree of insulation of a wall.  He considered that there was an approximate equivalence between the thermal index and the U value, although he accepted that it had its limitations.  He thought that there was an accuracy of +/-25% when extrapolating from the one to the other. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, there is very little evidence that the occupier of any apartment has been deprived of water as a result of the pipes in the walkway voids freezing.  Mr. John Sutton said that there had been instances when he has not had any water in winter as a result of frozen pipes, but he did not give any particular examples.  There are reports of three instances over the winter of 2008/09 when the water supply to an apartment was interrupted (there are also two other cases, but these occurred during the summer months).  However, there is no documentary evidence that any of these instances where the result of a burst pipe (Day 14/124), although that possibility obviously cannot be dismissed.  Still less is there any evidence that any freezing of pipes occurred at a point where the insulation was missing, although one would expect that to have been the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This evidence, even taken at its highest, falls far short of persuading me that the poor insulation of the pipework in the walkway voids - which clearly there was - has adversely affected the fitness for habitation of any apartment.  The documents show that some residents at Concord Street have made complaints of interruptions to their water supply, but so far as I can tell (apart from the cases that I have mentioned) these have not been connected with possible freezing of pipework. </p>
