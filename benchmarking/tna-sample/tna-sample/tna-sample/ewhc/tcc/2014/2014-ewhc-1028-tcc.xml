	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">These proceedings are brought by Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (“OHL”), a substantial Spanish civil engineering contractor, against the Government of Gibraltar (“GOG”), in relation to a contract for the design and construction of a road and tunnel under the eastern end of the runway of Gibraltar Airport. Unfortunately, after over 2½ years of work on the 2 year project and when little more than 25% of the work had been done, the contract was terminated. Issues arise as to who was legally and factually responsible and at risk for the state of affairs which led to the termination of the contractual relationship. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">Although the overriding issue revolves around the termination and whose actions were or were not justified in relation thereto, the main underlying issue revolves around whether the extent and amount of contaminated materials in the ground to be excavated were or were not reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor at the time of tender; if not so foreseeable, that would not be OHL‟s risk. OHL‟s case is that the amount and location of contaminated materials was such that it had to re-design the work particularly in the tunnel area which it did after the original contract period had expired. Such re-design having been approved, it is OHL‟s case that it was ready, willing and able to proceed with the work but it was unable to proceed with the works due to various obstacles put in its way by GOG when GOG purported to terminate the contract. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">Gibraltar sits on the southern end of Spain albeit to the western end of Spain‟s south coast. The famous and geographically striking 400 metre high Rock is joined to the mainland by a relatively narrow isthmus. It comprises about 640 hectares and is about three-quarters of a mile wide at most on the east-west axis. Much of the building is to the south and west of the Rock, although much of Gibraltar is built upon. Just south of the Spanish town of La Linea and on the flat part of the isthmus sits Gibraltar Airport. For many years, and indeed as it has turned out still, there runs Winston Churchill Avenue from the Spanish border due south and it runs over the Airport runway so that the road needs to be closed when there are aircraft movements on the runway, causing congestion to both the north and south of the runaway. Some 6,000 road vehicles and 7,000 pedestrians used it every day.  By about 2005, GOG had decided to resolve this problem by running a new dual carriageway road eastwards along the edge of the runway on both the north and south sides and at the eastern end to construct a twin bore tunnel (to carry the traffic) which was to be under the end of the runway at that location. The proposed road and the tunnel was to be located relatively close to the eastern coast line much of which comprised a sandy beach (the “Eastern Beach”) which was popular with the public particularly in the summertime. At the same time, GOG intended to provide extensive new airport facilities including a new terminal building. </p>

It was besieged and bombarded in a number of campaigns by Spain in the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century, particularly in the 1780s and then during the Napoleonic wars. It became a strategically important military and naval base in the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centuries and later a base for the RAF which used the runway for its military purposes. It was attacked and bombed by Vichy French, Italian and German armed forces in the Second World War. Happily, it has not had to face military attack since that time. Its population is now about 30,000, albeit it has numerous visitors, partly due to its financial standing and partly due to the convenience of its location as a starting-off point for holidaymakers to Spain. Given its historical legacy, particularly with its historical and continuing military and RAF connections and the use of the now expanded international Airport, the area around the Airport and its runway have been used relatively intensely for a considerable period of time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">In 2006, GOG retained engineers, Gifford Ltd (“Gifford”), to investigate the options and with their assistance decided on the route of the new dual carriageway and tunnel; this became known as the “Frontier Access” road and tunnel. Gifford are well known engineers and had a close connection with Gibraltar. In 2006, GOG also retained Gibraltar Land Reclamation Company Ltd (“GLRC”) as project manager for the project. GLRC had been and was retained on a significant number of GOG projects over the preceding years. After producing an “Outline Feasibility Study” for the project in October 2006, Gifford completed a contaminated land desk study in April 2007 which set out environmental and historical information about the site of the proposed works. Gifford‟s formal retainer from GOG was signed in February 2007. In July 2007, following a site investigation, including 28 boreholes, sampling and testing, a Soil Investigation Factual Report was produced by a Spanish company called Sergeyco; this report covered an area which encompassed the areas proposed for the new dual carriageway and tunnel as well as for the new terminal buildings. Gifford was also retained at this time to produce what later became known as the "Illustrative Design" which was to be available to tenderers, albeit that the successful tenderer was to be responsible for the design whether it selected the "Illustrative Design" or its own design. Gifford produced various general arrangement drawings, plans and profiles which comprised the Illustrative Design. By the time that contractors were invited to tender, GOG had decided upon the site and route for the proposed dual carriageway and the tunnel. </p>

These tenderers included OHL. At about this time, an "Environmental Statement” (“ES”) had been prepared for GOG in relation to the proposed works as well as all the new airport terminal work; this was prepared by a company called Environmental Gain Ltd (“Engain”) and was prepared in connection with the planning application for the airport, road and tunnel works; Gifford contributed towards the “Land Contamination” part of the ES. This was to be incorporated in the Contract between the parties. The ES amongst other things provided information about the site and its surroundings as well as dealing with the likely significant environmental effects of the works proposed and providing advice on mitigation measures. The ES was forwarded to the tenderers by way of Tender Addendum No. 2 on 21 Dec 2007. GOG also issued Tender Bulletin Number 1 at about this time which sought to reply to queries raised by various tenderers, materially as follows: </p>

By letter dated 25 April 2009 GOG asked the tenderers to price certain additional works, including the construction of a new Fuel Farm and Simple Approach Lighting System (“SALS”) for the Airport. On 27 June 2008, GOG raised with OHL various questions for clarification of its tender, including requesting an explanation of “how your submission addresses protection of the aquifers, particularly during construction of the embedded walls”. OHL replied in July 2008: “Our embedded walls do not reach the lower aquifer and there is no risk of contamination of the potable water…OHL guarantees that the potable water will not be contaminated in any way”. This was subsequently incorporated into the Contract at Annex 10. </p>

The Contract Agreement contained OHL‟s express covenant "to design, execute and complete that Work and remedy any defects therein in conformity with the provisions of the Contract" with the concomitant covenant from GOG to pay the Contract Price as prescribed by the Contract. The Contract price was £30,231,068.36, as confirmed in the Letter of Tender. Attached to that Letter was the completed Appendix to Tender which identified that the time for completion of the Works was 24 months, Gibraltar Law was to be the Governing Law and Delay Damages were to be at the rate of £5,000 per day. It is common ground that the Commencement Date was 1 December 2008 and the Time to Completion was 24 months. Thus OHL was, subject to any extension of time, due to complete the Works by 30 November 2010. </p>

There was, surprisingly, no evidence from witnesses or documentary evidence from OHL as to what those then involved with the tendering process for OHL actually foresaw; it is surprising because so much of the dispute between the parties relates to what was or was not "reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor by the date of submission of the Tender" (Clauses 1.1.6.8 and 4.12). The consequence must be that the Court can not and does not infer that OHL itself did not in fact prior to the Contract foresee the adverse physical conditions actually encountered.

Similarly, it would not have waited the best part of 2, 3 or even 4 weeks after getting the first draft report from Himalaya before instigating a suspension of work supposedly to protect the health and safety of its workers. </p>

It was suggested by Mr Orciel and Mr Pardo that there never was much by way of reports to GOG or meeting notes or minutes notwithstanding bi-monthly meetings with the Chief Minister. In the absence of clear evidence that documents have been deliberately and unjustifiably withheld or destroyed, I can only assume that there never was much of such documentation, in which case this demonstrates a lack of efficiency and businesslike conduct which itself undermines confidence in their evidence, where it is unsupported by documents or other people‟s evidence. Mr Pardo‟s evidence about contacts with possible replacement contractors was unreliable; he said initially in evidence that it did not cross his mind between January and April 2011 that GOG would ever get in a replacement contractor but he later had to accept that in that context he had been in contact with two well known international contractors, FCC and Bouygues in February 2011; there is a dearth of documents about this and they must have existed. There are other gaps in GOG‟s disclosure in relation to whatever strategy it was that was adopted in the period between about February and August 2011, some of which can legitimately be explained by the cloak of privilege which would apply to legal advice being given, as it was both by internal and external solicitors and independent English Counsel. </p>

He is a civil engineer and was largely site based. He came over as a pleasant person. His English was good, although he had the interpreter available if required. On key issues, I found him unconvincing. For instance, his evidence (on Day 3) was that in effect OHL was planning to re-use both contaminated and non-contaminated material, for instance to cover the completed tunnel; this was contradicted by the CEMP produced by OHL in various revisions which called for hazardous waste to be transported to Spain and, furthermore this point seems only to have been raised when problems with ground contamination began to prove almost insuperable well into 2010. He was on occasion unable to provide convincing answers as to why he had not challenged correspondence from the GOG team, an example being in relation to a statement from Mr de la Paz on 12 March 2010 that he had “repeatedly requested” the Sergeyco 2009 results before. He was unconvincing about why OHL had not provided to the GOG team these results; there was in reality no good reason to have failed to do so particularly as they showed some contamination materials present.  Another example is when he gave evidence about why OHL did not seek a formal instruction in relation to the instruction said to have been given by the GOG team at the meeting on 12 May 2010 that contaminated material had to be removed from the site and taken to an approved landfill; although this was going to cost OHL millions of pounds and they were being advised by a claims consultant. His answer that OHL was simply looking for a way forward and that he did not see the point of seeking an instruction was simply not credible. His involvement with the Himalaya story in November and December 2010 undermines any confidence which I might have had in him on the topic.  </p>

At best, he acted unprofessionally in and about his first supposed discovery of a hydrocarbon smell on the site in November 2010 (e.g. no notes, no written warning to people on or visiting site), and then his briefing of Himalaya (nothing in writing, first three drafts obviously poor and lacking intelligible analysis). He did not come over however as incompetent and I sensed that he was almost embarrassed on occasion to be seeking to answer some of the criticisms about the Himalaya involvement. The reality is that all the Himalaya reports and certainly those sent to GOG were in material respects drafted by OHL personnel and a claims consultant and Mr Alcazar was party to the presentation of what were not truly independent reports. </p>

He was not good at answering questions, albeit that he was giving evidence in an English Court which was probably disconcerting for him. He effectively admitted that parts of his March 2011 report must have been drafted by OHL; it must be unprofessional to have allowed a report to be proffered in his name which he has not drafted in material particulars. I felt that he was naïve, albeit intelligent and trained. His reports particularly in 2010 were poor. He allowed himself and his firm to be manipulated into saying what his client wanted him to say and then unconvincingly sought in evidence to defend what on any count was a poor and unprofessional job on his part. I am afraid that I found him an unsatisfactory witness and it was difficult to place any significant reliance on his evidence. </p>

He was closely involved in the suspension of work and the decision to re-design and the events which led to the termination. I found him unconvincing and unimpressive also, particularly in relation to the Himalaya story. An example was his oral evidence that he got the Himalaya report dated 15 December 2010 but, notwithstanding the supposedly serious advice that work should be suspended for Health and Safety reasons, it did not go to GOG until 20 December 2010 because (he said) an English translation was awaited; that was obviously false for at least two reasons, the first being that there were still (Spanish) workmen working on site and they were allowed to go on working in supposedly dangerous conditions for another 8 days in spite of the recommendations in that report and the second being that it simply would not have taken 5 days to translate the Himalaya report: one hour would have been required to translate the key conclusion chapter. I have no doubt that he was under immense pressure when he took over in November 2010 a project which had gone seriously wrong for OHL and was likely to cause it a very substantial loss. He was reluctant to accept the very obvious point that what was dictating much of what OHL did after his involvement started was the commercial imperative of securing a financial deal with GOG which would mitigate if not remove the inevitable massive losses incurred and likely to be incurred; this was in circumstances in which from the sparse disclosure as to this topic from OHL it was clear that this was the case. </p>

He was urbane but he became flustered under cross-examination; his memory was poor and, partly at least due to this, he was somewhat evasive and “cagey”, particularly when he was asked to address the events leading up to the termination, although I do not suggest that he was actually dishonest. An example was his unwillingness to accept knowledge of or involvement in the Engineer‟s letter of 1 June 2011 withdrawing from OHL the use of the Aerial Farm site for depositing excavated materials. Again, there was a dearth of relevant reporting and recording paperwork which suggests either there was none (which would suggest that he could not do his job properly) or that there was but it has been lost or withheld. Of these two possibilities, I lean towards the former explanation, save in respect of the liaison between him and colleagues and Bouygues and FCC for which there must have been much more documentation than has been disclosed. </p>

As for Dr Purnell, it would not be unfair to say that my impression of him was that he was somewhat eccentric in his giving of oral evidence, not necessarily that this was something for which he should be blamed; he was occasionally confused.

One of the problems for programming experts in construction cases is that often they have to make assumptions about the facts, albeit that they are not always agreed or admitted. I can understand here the logic applied by both these experts but ultimately the logic must follow the facts as I have found them. An example is the suspension of work by OHL on 23 December 2010 which I have found was initiated by OHL in effect at its own risk and as a tactical step to put pressure on GOG, this being based on the very poor impression which I formed about OHL‟s witnesses and their evidence about the Himalaya reports during the run up to the suspension. Neither expert could necessarily anticipate this particular finding. I tended to find Mr Crane‟s approach somewhat more helpful as his logic for the period up to the suspension was more obviously right and chimed with the evidence as it had emerged. Both experts were helpful and were not very far apart for the final and key period from the suspension up to termination.  </p>

The second is a variant on the first and was adopted in its revised design proposal in the months before termination of the Contract involving the same use of embedded walls but before casting the roof some metres depth of earth would be excavated from the area below. The third way would also involve embedded walls but excavation of the whole of the earth down to road formation level at the bottom of the tunnel would take place before the roof was cast.

As Mr Beadman and Mr Chapman have confirmed in their joint statement of 17 July 2013, the AIP process took almost a full year involving multiple submission of documents; they agree and I accept that, at least, OHL was responsible for the delays up to and including the approval time for Revision B in August 2009. I will return to this issue when considering extension of time. There was witness evidence from GOG to the effect that OHL was less than professional and inefficient in the first 8 months. There was certainly dilatoriness and a lack of urgency as the project slipped seriously behind programme. There is correspondence between OHL and its primary design subcontractor, Ayesa, which criticises Ayesa for its delays in this regard; an example is Mr Portal‟s email dated 16 July 2009 to Ayesa. GLRC complained from time to time about the delay, an example being its letter dated 24 July 2009 to OHL referring to delays in design work in respect of diversion of services, airfield safety management plan, simple approach lighting, fuel farm, quality control and structures design, mechanical and electrical design and tunnel finishes. There was little if effective or real challenge by OHL to these criticisms. </p>

This letter noted that of the 23,000m³ that was to be excavated it was expected that 6,000m³ would be concrete and asphalt and the rest was expected to be uncontaminated sand. This was somewhat optimistic because the top 2m of soil to be removed for the initial excavation would likely include also material which would not be sand. Mr Gil replied by letter dated 29 October 2009 saying he was grateful for the offer of sand but the volumes were such that its delivery would need to be carefully planned and co-ordinated. He went on to say that the local tip would accept the disposal of the concrete subject to various reservations.

Mr Gil became sceptical (e-mail 2 December 2009 to Mr Doncel)) about “how serious” OHL was in taking forward the clean sand provision. More rubble was being generated and deposited on the East Side tip than could be accommodated. By 10 December 2009 the East Side rubble tip was almost full and after 11 December 2009, OHL was asked to take material for tipping to the “North Mole”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">OHL started diaphragm wall construction on the North Approach Ramp on 1 March 2010 with some 200 to 500m³ of excavated material generated per working day. This was stockpiled on site and also onto the adjacent Aerial Farm site. Coincidentally, a Dutch reclamation company doing such work in Gibraltar had taken some material from the Eastside rubble tip believed to have come from the tunnel, which when tested was found to contain high levels of lead as recorded in an e-mail dated 9 March 2010. Mr Gil was concerned about this and called for an urgent investigation. On 10 March 2010, Mr de La Paz asked Mr Doncel to carry out sampling and testing on excavated material stockpiles. He had a discussion with OHL and was told that the November 2009 Sergeyco tests had been free of contaminants; that of course was not correct, but OHL undertook to provide the report on the same day. After much chasing, OHL provided the report on 12 March 2010. It was clear that OHL had been reluctant to provide this report; this is inferable from Mr Doncel‟s e-mail of 23 March 2010 to Mr Dunn (“Stuart, at the end I had to submit the first report (November)”) and he was even reluctant to provide the further report to be obtained form Sergeyco in March 2010. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that OHL knew that there was going to be some contamination but hoped to avoid having to do anything about it. </p>

The following report dated 25 March 2010 (provided to GLRC and the Engineer) showed, against “Dutch intervention values”, that excessive values for lead, nickel, mineral oils, zinc and chromium were recorded.  It is unclear why Sergeyco were asked to report by reference to these Dutch values because they were not contamination levels called for as such by the Contract and were generally more severe than the Contract values for contamination. By the contract values, one sample (M-03-04-10) showed noncompliance, for lead, this sample being taken at 2.5m below the already reduced </p>

The location plan in the report was wrong, showing this sample being taken on the beach when as Mr Doncel accepted in an e-mail on 29 March 2010 all samples were taken from sand in the tunnel area and from sand stored next to OHL‟s site cabins. This discrepancy was one of the reasons for GOG and GLRC having little confidence in this exercise. Mr Gil was concerned that there might also have been cross-contamination of samples. Mr De La Paz was confused as to the use by Sergeyco of the Dutch values. There was by the end of March 2010 a real concern within the GOG team that, unless the GOG team was pro-active in trying to determine what contaminated materials were where, OHL would not be. Also, the GOG wanted to ensure that a substantial quantity of appropriate sand was available from the excavation on this project to replenish the beaches. </p>

The purpose was described as being “to ascertain the levels of contamination (if any) both in the ground and in stockpiles of excavated material, to provide information on the chemical nature of the soils to be removed as part of the Works”. The “Scope of investigation” was said to involve 7 window samples at 2m depth with environmental testing to be carried out at depths of 0.5m, 1m, 1.5m and 2m. The seven trial pits were shown on a plan with 5 in the tunnel or tunnel ramp area and two just outside.

OHL had no clear or obvious policy as to what to do with the excavated material. In that regard representatives of OHL met Mr Gil and GLRC on 12 May 2010 to see if more working areas could be provided to store the excavated material; they said that they proposed to place the contaminated material back where it had been extracted from but they were told that contaminated material would have to be removed from site and taken to an approved landfill.

As a result, OHL again retained Sergeyco to carry out contamination sampling of a number of the stockpiles, including a bentonite stockpile.

The "technical solution" was to remove both contaminated and inert materials to Spain and otherwise decontaminate contaminated material in Gibraltar and provide it for landfill; uncontaminated material could be placed on the beaches. That meeting was followed by a meeting with Mr Pardo and Mr De La Paz at which they made it clear that the contractual specifications were to be applied and that, if the material fell within such specifications, it could be taken to Gibraltar landfill and, if uncontaminated, used on the beach.

There is, rightly, now, no real factual issue between the relevant experts that this represented a gross exaggeration, although it was not necessarily put forward in bad faith. The total cost of dealing with this contaminated material was said to be some £6.7m. There was also a proposal that at least some decontamination work should take place in Gibraltar which would require a soil washing or cleansing plants to remove the contaminants; this would lead to most of the material capable of being reused within Gibraltar with some 13,000 m³ only to be disposed of in Spain.

It is unclear what is meant by "agglomerate” which usually in geological terms relates to a volcanic accretion; something may have gone wrong in the translation. I suspect that “agglomerate” meant asphalt. The report indicates that the highest concentration in a sample from the first of these stockpiles was lead at 12,500 mg/kg and in a sample from the second 303 mg/kg. It is on any account a poor report. Again this attracted no concern within OHL for their workers on site.  </p>

There was an impasse between GOG and OHL because OHL was not removing the stockpiles of material and, unless there was a resolution of this, work could well come to a grinding halt. This concern was at least partly underpinned by the misunderstanding that GOG was or might well be contractually and therefore financially responsible for the costs of and occasioned by dealing with contaminated material. There was also real concern within the Environmental Agency and the DoE that the contractual thresholds in the ES might well not have been the right ones. This is illustrated by an internal DoE memorandum dated 24 June 2010 which suggested that the contract values, based on the UK “CLEA” ones, primarily related to the effect of human exposure to a chemical in an existing source; it did not address the impact of excavation, transport and re-use of the material. The memorandum recommended that the much lower “Gibraltar values” could be used to assess the possibility of using the excavated material for </p>

On 4 August 2010 an OHL internal meeting took place before a meeting between OHL (Mr Doncel amongst others) and Mr Gil of GOG, Mr Pardo and Mr. Stagnetto (a GOG lawyer). The internal meeting recorded that 20,000m³ had been removed to Spain and 7,000m³ was remaining to be transported; 2,000m³ per week was being excavated from the diaphragm walls; it recorded that OHL should start breaking off the diaphragm walls to get them down to the requisite level from which the tunnel roof could be cast. OHL also noted that the groundwater had been detected by it to be contaminated and that the problem “may be serious”. In the following meeting, Mr Gil identified (what was to become clear later) that GOG was looking to require contaminated materials above the Contract levels to be taken to Spain, other contaminated materials to be decontaminated in Gibraltar and clean material to be used on the beach. Two areas of 1,300m² and 4,000m² would be made available to OHL for intermediate stockpiling.  </p>

The document went on to suggest that a study would be made of the waste from the first metre of excavation so that OHL could “assign the destination of the excavated materials, without the need for large stockpiles on site". A further study would be made of the waste from the first meter to the bottom of the excavation at 10-12 metres depth. The proposal involved the determination of whether material exceeded the "tender values" or the draft guideline values or was beneath both these limits. Mr Dunn on 2 September 2010 pointed out to OHL that one problem about using Gamasur for these studies was that Gamasur‟s laboratory was not accredited and that it would be important that “independence and impartiality can not only be written but demonstrated and this would always be an issue with an in house lab facility”. As became apparent, this has become an issue in these proceedings.

Six trial pits were dug between the Sergeyco trial pits from May 2010 with two samples taken from each trial pit (at 1m and 1.5m deep) and an average of these samples was calculated for each trial pit. The results were at least badly presented and neither Gamasur nor OHL noticed at the time that alleged failure results for PCBs were reported as such by μg /kg (micrograms per kilo) as opposed to mg/kg (milligrams per kilo). Using the wrong measurement and perhaps unsurprisingly, failures are reported for all samples for PCBs. Lead failures were shown against two samples form one test pit (CC2) which was in the ramp end on the northern side. There was one PAH failure as against the Contract values also in CC2. About half of all results exceeded the lower level limit in the Draft Fill Guidelines. The lower level from the Draft Fill Guidelines was exceeded at least once for every contaminant tested, save for chromium, selenium and zinc. On this basis, and by reference also to the earlier Sergeyco results, the tunnel and approaches were mapped out and 4 of seven sectors (A, C, F and G) were designated in orange as “hazardous” zones and three (B, D and E) were designated as “non-hazardous”. Later evidence identified that PCBs were not relevant to the designation in any event. Sectors D and E were right in the middle of the tunnel. Following further test pitting and four more samples being taken on 30 September 2010, Gamasur provided an updated report in October 2010 which added two additional sectors (H and I) at either end of the tunnel footprint; the μg/kg anomaly was repeated.  </p>

There would have to be a Discharge Permit and, although there had been no groundwater monitoring regime in place before (with only the August 2010 Sergeyco piezometers and water sampling exercise being done in August 2010), it was not until this time that serious thought by OHL began to be given to what it was going to do with pumped water. An internal memo at this time recognised the likely need for a water treatment plant. On 15 September 2010, OHL submitted its Method Statement for dewatering in the tunnel excavation areas; this proposed pumping wells but did not provide for where the pumped water was to be discharged let alone how it was to be treated. OHL had well before known that a Discharge Permit would be required, it being mentioned in its CEMP, for instance, but did not take any active steps to find out what would be required from Mr Soiza or anyone within the DoE. Sergeyco was sent to discuss matters with the DoE and the DoE said that the standards to be applied would be the EQS limits set out in Directive 2008/105/EC; Mr Soiza provided these EQS limits to OHL on 24 September 2010. The DoE had a few days earlier provided the detection limits and Mr Dunn advised OHL that a British laboratory, NLS, could provide testing services to these limits. In October and November 2010, OHL set about getting proposals from various organisations for the provision of a water treatment plant to be located on site to treat contaminated water before it was discharged into the sea. Proposals were provided for instance from Soldec in midNovember 2010.  </p>

There was no good reason why OHL could not have continued the removal to Spain of any stockpiled material; the only constraint was that, the Stockpile Agreement having expired on 30 September 2010, OHL would have had to pay for it all itself without at that stage a contribution from GOG, at least initially and subject to any justifiable claim. The Engineer pointed out that GOG had no obligation to make available any additional land but added that "the beach car parking area, which was previously made available to you, would be made available to you at 48 hours notice…” and that "an additional area of land has also been identified which may be made available to you". A detailed proposal would be required and OHL was told that any "delay in being provided with access to these sites will be as a result of your own delay in providing such details which in any event are required under your" CEMP. He pointed out that, by reason of current progress and related site activities, there had been no need to dispose of any excavated material since 30 September 2010. He notified OHL that a company had now been identified to dispose of material prices considerably below those which had been paid pursuant to the Stockpile Agreement. </p>

The reasons for the delay included late approvals, changes, late access, rock and the volume of both hazardous and non-hazardous contaminated excavated material "being significantly higher than could reasonably [have] be expected from the Tender information". It seems clear that from by this stage, GOG acutely realised that there would unavoidably be potentially severe delay, financial and even political ramifications.

It was from this visit that works were suspended just before Christmas 2010. I found his evidence unconvincing and him to be an unconvincing witness. No-one else on the site had noticed any such problem. He did not record what his findings were or precisely where the smells emanated from. Although he sought to give the impression that he was concerned about this and brought it to the attention, five days later, of Mr Hernandez, he did not apparently give any advice to anyone on site to take particular care to avoid ingestion or inhalation of hydrocarbon vapours. Indeed, he hardly recorded anything in writing as to what he did or as to what he briefed various relevant people whom he came across such as Mr Hernandez or Himalaya. I have formed a very strong view that there really was no problem and that, even if he smelt something on site, it represented at most a peg on which to hang a hat which would lead to suspension. If there had been any real concern about health and safety at that stage, I am wholly satisfied that, if and to the extent that there was a problem, Mr Alcazar would and should have recorded what the problem was believed to be and given clear and unequivocal advice to protect the workers and others on the site. Everything which followed up to Christmas 2010 and the suspension, in my judgment, demonstrates that what OHL was seeking was an excuse to suspend work with a view to putting pressure on GOG to compromise both financially and as a matter of time on what had already turned into a disastrous project. </p>

Given the alleged urgency, if it was a genuine exercise, work would have been suspended or, at the very least, the Risk Assessment called for by Mr Mojon would have been initiated.

A draft letter to go to GLRC was prepared I infer by Mr Metcalf which refers to the unreconstructed earliest version of the 30 November 2010 Himalaya report ("Soil analysis, conclusions and recommendations"). In all probability, Revision 1 had not been drafted by then. At 16.21 he sent to Mr Metcalf the same Version 1 but with an electronically imposed signature of Himalaya and Mr Mojon; it is clear that Mr Mojon had provided this to be imposed by OHL. At 16.23, he sent to Mr Metcalf the Sergeyco May 2010 report. At 16.28, Mr Alcazar sent to Mr Doncel what looks like Revision 1, which Mr Doncel sent on to Mr Metcalf at 16.34. Mr Metcalf clearly drafted changes and sent them back to Mr Doncel at 18.36; the email clearly refers to the possibility of seeking an injunction in the Gibraltar courts for the work to be suspended. He next e-mails Mr Doncel at 8.36 on 15 December 2010 suggesting that Himalaya is asked to consider whether the tender information indicated a health and safety risk. Over the next few days, there were exchanges between Mr Alcazar and Mr Doncel and Mr Garcia about geotechnical information contained in the Sergeyco and Gamasur reports being two such reports which Mr Alcazar had said in evidence he had given Himalaya earlier. </p>

I have formed a very clear view that this was put together by a combination of people from OHL‟s personnel, Mr Metcalf and to a relatively limited extent from Mr Mojon himself. The reference in the 15 December 2010 to PCBs is an example: it had not been mentioned in the 30 November 2010 report and there was no good reason why, if it was relevant at all, it was not mentioned in the earlier draft report; Mr Mojon suggested that Mr Alcazar did not understand the importance of PCBs but that evidence for someone with his knowledge and experience and for one who had had the Sergeyco and Gamasur reports which talked about PCBs was not credible. </p>

It was prepared to put commercial pressure on GOG in the context of the very substantial delays and losses incurred and to be incurred by OHL in effect to encourage a commercial resolution of these problems. If OHL had genuinely believed that the contaminated materials unearthed by Sergeyco and Gamasur in 2010 were harmful, the position reached by 20 December 2010 would have been reached months before. The fact that OHL sat on the Himalaya report, what is said to have led up to it and the alleged concerns raised in that report for the best part of a month without doing anything to protect its workers or warn them and other users of the site like the Engineer and other related personnel suggests strongly that the submitted version of the report and the request for suspension were simply tactical.  </p>

For instance, a draft OHL document entitled “Alternative Solution to the Viability of the New Access Road and Tunnel…” suggests that a figure £79.664m would suffice provided that certain cost-saving changes were implemented. In fact a figure of £91.1m had been put forward but the lower figure assumed various savings in terms of potential design savings.  </p>

He said that there was nothing in the Himalaya report in terms of findings that were "materially different from what you knew, or ought to have known, from the information that you have available at Tender Stage" and that it was OHL‟s responsibility and risk to deal with the circumstances which had arisen, referring to OHL‟s CEMP which stated that appropriate personal protective equipment and dust suppression techniques would be employed to deal with contaminated ground. Reasonable practicable measures were available to address all pollutants cited in the Himalaya report and indeed all the identified pollutants could be addressed by the use of appropriate methods and equipment. He observed that OHL had not compared the contamination hotspots within the programmed excavations for the Works and that, if they had done, it would be shown that most of the contamination was within the area of tunnel excavation which could be removed in the open air before the roof slab was cast.

This seems to have involved his first trip to site and the object was to advise on the ramifications of working on the site and in the tunnel as designed. Mr Mojon‟s statement (for which there is no documentary support) says that he was approached again in January 2011 by Mr Alcazar and he recommended an assessment be made “of the degree of worker‟s exposure to chemical products during the excavation work”. What is surprising is why it took OHL so long since the Sergeyco and Gamasur reports in the previous year to embark on this exercise, if it was ever really concerned about their workers‟ safety. Even then, there was no urgency and it was not until 23 February 2011 that Mr Mojon went to site to take controlled air samples.

The Report in Annex 2 is poorly drafted and is not to a good professional standard. It provides no analysis and little justification for its conclusions. It does not identify on what it is based in terms of which reports it had regard to; for instance Mr Mojon could not in evidence identify which report he said he had been shown by Mr Alcazar relating to ecotoxicity, although he refers to ecotoxicity in the report. It appears to abandon any reference to PCBs in respect of which in capital letters in the 15 December 2010 report it had said finding "PCB in the workplace where the tunnel is being constructed is a very worrying aspect”; it appears no longer to have been worrying at all. It places reliance on the contents of Annex 3 for which see below. It then jumps to conclusions to the effect that the soil on the route of the proposed tunnel should be decontaminated.

As the relevant experts both said, lead is only a risk if it becomes airborne within the tunnel excavation and it would not have become airborne if the common system of dust suppression, namely wetting the material to be excavated, was deployed. Hydrocarbon contamination was similarly not a risk and, if encountered, it need not have become airborne and would not have been materially different from the diesel fumes generated by the tunnel earthmoving equipment which would have been addressed by the planned forced ventilation and other standard measures. </p>

It is clear that GLRC and the Engineer were keen to review the documents and provide a response earlier than the three weeks called for by the Contract design approval procedures; this was confirmed by e-mail dated 21 April 2011 from Mr Garrett and other members of Gifford, particularly in the context of the diaphragm wall cut-off level, which he believed needed to be defined.   </p>

Over the previous few weeks, some of the letters written by the Engineer, albeit not all, had been vetted if not always drafted by others, and, as indicated above, contact had been made with two substantial European contractors as to their possible deployment in the event of termination. There was some coyness on the part of some of the GOG witnesses about this and the recollection particularly of Mr Pardo was peculiarly poor; I have also formed the view that there was a not insignificant amount of documentation that should have been disclosed in relation to this, which would not obviously have been caught by </p>

I can not understand why this was so because I would have expected any employer in the position of GOG to have made enquiries in relation to the ramifications of and prepared at least contingency plans for termination in the position in which GOG found itself after the suspension of work, the continuing lack of activity thereafter and the pursuit of a re-design the need for which its own consultants were at best extremely cynical about. </p>

It has been redacted in places because, I presume, the redactions contained legal advice or recommendations. This draft, which, subject to some amendments, was later to be sent on behalf of GOG, was clearly intended to be sent as, so to speak, the first step in the termination process, particularly if the notice was not complied with. It is unclear when the earlier and first draft was produced but I presume this was at least 2-3 weeks earlier to enable the amendments to be made. Over the next three weeks there was continuing discussion within GOG and its team about when to serve the Clause 15.1 Notice with some appreciation that regard had to be given in this context to the process of re-design. On 6 May 2011, there was a Bilateral Meeting between, amongst others, the Chief Minister and Mr Pardo at which termination was discussed and it is clear that advice from Leading Counsel was awaited. There were no disclosed notes of this meeting.  </p>

AIP Rev F was not approved and was “yet to be reviewed”. The letter said that the re-design process had “provided no good reason for the demolition of the diaphragm wall heads cut off to have stopped”.  OHL‟s Progress Report for April 2011 indicated completion of the Works 72 weeks after design approval. On 5 May 2011, Mr De La Paz in an internal e-mail assumed that OHL would have access to Aerial Farm although a small part of it might have to be handed over to others in October 2011. On 6 May 2011 OHL sent through electronically to the Engineer the proposed new programme of works. His immediate response was that it did not have any dates and therefore did not comply with the Contract. It did in fact have dates on, although they were not readily readable electronically. </p>

It was pointed out that the M&amp;E design was still outstanding but OHL said that they required a response to the remaining design packages, even if they had been previously accepted by the Engineer. The Engineer called for the Category 3 Check Certificates (from Messrs Donaldsons retained by OHL) and OHL said that it would be provided by mid-June 2011.

For instance, OHL from internal emails on 18 and 19 May 2011 were trying to work out financially what would be the consequences of the job being terminated or suspended and bonds being called and OHL continuing with the work and only the contractual amount being paid and/or the OHL claims succeeding; projections were attached which suggested substantial losses on all scenarios. Mr Pardo wrote to OHL on 19 May 2011 saying that GOG was still prepared to agree taking the disputes to the Disputes Adjudication Board for adjudication but referred to the fact that OHL would not agree to a lawyer being the Chairman. This was tactical on the part of OHL because there can not have been a sensible reasoned view that, say, a specialist construction lawyer should not be the Chairman but there may well have been a fear that OHL might lose the adjudication and be stuck until completion with a temporarily binding decision. It was tactical on GOG‟s part because it felt confident about success in such an adjudication. I do not accept Mr Doncel‟s evidence that OHL had only been waiting for the AIP approval for the revised tunnel design before resuming work. </p>

Mr Doncel accepted in evidence that he knew beforehand both that the Befesa plant had been dismantled and that the Aerial farm site was being used by others for other purposes. What is not clear is why this letter was written at this time rather than before. The suggestion of OHL (although its legal team does not use the word) is in effect conspiracy, namely a deliberate attempt by GOG to ensure that OHL did not re-commence work in the tunnel area because it had committed itself privately but irrevocably to terminate irrespective of what OHL wanted to or was able to do. I do not accept this inference. There was little evidence as to how this letter came to be written. However, I strongly suspect that the letter of 22 December 2010 and the instruction for the use of Aerial Farm had simply been overlooked by GOG.

The withdrawal of the availability of Aerial Farm need not in any event have prevented OHL from proceeding. As it recognised and indeed was the case, it could start excavating and stockpiling a substantial amount of material on the site whilst organising again the removal of excavated material off site; this it had done without great difficulty pursuant to the Stockpile Agreement for some 4 months in 2010. Indeed, it had started doing some excavation work on 1 June 2011 for the MOD drainage diversion works and was stockpiling on site. </p>

It said that it would provide as soon as practicable proposals how to implement these changes which constituted a Variation. OHL also wrote directly to GOG expressing surprise at the contents of the 1 June 2011 letter saying that they found it extraordinary "that precisely at the time we are close to recommencing the key Works, this is made impossible in the short term as a result of instructions from the Engineer that directly contradict earlier instructions…” and that it had "bona fide been working for many weeks on a solution to the design issues arising out of the unforeseeable levels of contamination" which took into consideration that earlier instruction. To undertake segregation between clean and contaminated materials a borehole campaign and laboratory analysis and a soil decontamination study would be required and a new excavation method needed to be worked out. There was nothing in these letters which as such indicated any difficulty about excavating and stockpiling in the interim. </p>

The perception was that historically OHL‟s excavation practices did not distinguish between contaminated and non-contaminated materials so that, if there was a termination and if there were substantial quantities of excavated materials on-site at that time, GOG would be left with the task and expense of exporting the material to landfill in Spain, because it would all then have become contaminated. In that context, the Engineer wrote on 8 June 2011 (a letter drafted by Mr Cahill)  to OHL expressing concern that OHL was not segregating the different soil types encountered. This method of waste handling was "not considered to be best practice" or in accordance with the CEMP, method statement and contractual obligations. He noted that stored "contaminated soils should be managed in such a way as to limit the possibility of contaminating previously uncontaminated areas of the site." He went on to say that OHL had "a wealth of information on the chemical composition of the site soils to be excavated" and that it should use "this information to delineate the site into zones of contaminated and uncontaminated soils, facilitating the effective segregation of the soils that are excavated.

This was formally neither minuted nor noted; it was clearly informal. From Mr Reyes‟ diary note, discussion ranged from substantial alterations to the subway arrangement, payments being made in Euros, facilitating the SALS problems and the provision of a new CEMP. It was suggested that Mr Pardo gave an assurance that Aerial Farm would be made available and instructed Mr Bugeja to make the necessary arrangements. I do not accept this evidence, albeit that Mr Pardo‟s somewhat contradictory evidence was also unreliable on this; it is unthinkable that, if this had happened, it was not noted and confirmed in writing by OHL attendees because it would have saved OHL literally the millions of pounds which transporting possibly 180,000 tonnes of excavated material to Spain would have cost. There was no corroboration. At best there was some informal discussion about the possibility of the use of Aerial Farm. There was a clear reluctance on the part of GOG at this time to make it available particularly given its use as an overflow car park for the adjacent beach which was popular with beach users. </p>

Again on 18 July 2011 Donaldsons wrote saying it “could not sign off” on the revised construction sequence because “the walls will be overstressed…” None of this was passed on to the Engineer or GOG. </p>

There was an oily layer on the surface of the water spreading across the site and the water within the reservoir had a thick hydrocarbon type scum on the surface. He required OHL immediately to stop the unauthorised dewatering works. Instruction No 21 was issued under cover of another letter on the same day requiring OHL to remove the standing water. OHL did comply broadly with these instructions, it being noted by the Engineer that the lagoon or reservoir was substantially reduced by dewatering, the contaminated material backfilled into the lagoon and the area levelled off. Although there was an evidential issue as to whether the Engineer had suspended by this letter all dewatering, that was clearly not the case and it was not taken as such because dewatering continued through the water treatment plant. </p>

The first involved a costing of a soil analysis of every square metre of soil on the tunnel area at a cost of €123m to enable an effective segregation of soils to take place. The second involved a decontamination plant by OHL within Gibraltar. The third would require the provision of land with GOG dealing with waste management, much as the Befesa arrangement before. OHL recommended the third option. This was considered disappointing by the Engineer‟s letter dated 22 July 2011 in reply.  </p>

It then turned to the instructions about the diaphragm wall defects, saying that the time allowed was insufficient because the amount of contaminated material had increased massively and that until 1 June 2011 its obligation was to deposit all excavated material on Aerial Farm. It said that the panel excavation work was out of sequence but the Engineer had instructed dewatering to be suspended. Dewatering might well be required from between 1.5m and 3m from the surface. However, it said that it would “now commence such excavation around the diaphragm walls as it is safe and practicable to undertake”. No reason was given as to why at least this work could not have been started earlier. It said that the time allowed for the work was unreasonably short.  </p>

On the same day, by letter it formally served OHL at its office in Madrid the letter dated 28 July 2011, saying that termination would take place 14 days later. On 20 August 2011, GOG informed OHL that it was thereby terminating the Contract, alternatively accepting repudiation on the part of OHL (on various bases). GOG took possession of the site on or shortly after 20 August 2011, and a local company, GJBS, with whom over the preceding weeks at least there must have been a fair amount of contact, was retained initially to secure the site. There was talk of GJBS actually undertaking more of the works than this but this came to nothing. The water treatment plant was dismantled. Little else has been done since.  Later in 2011, there was an election in Gibraltar and the Chief Minister, who had been in office for many years, was replaced by the electorate. There seems little doubt that political considerations had played their part in at least the Chief Minister‟s actions in relation to this project in setting it up and ultimately in approving termination. </p>

The tunnel and approach ramps are to be designed and constructed to be water resistant therefore they will be as impermeable as the soil and rock layers they disturb and will prevent a substantial increase in cross flow between the aquifers local to the new road.

One of the obvious and known limitations of boreholes is that the individual hole is, usually, only 100 mm to 150 mm wide and the samples taken from within that narrow hole are not necessarily representative of material either between that borehole and the next one which may be hundreds of metres away or even immediately adjacent to the sample being taken. Once boreholes are taken down into the natural and undisturbed natural strata, geotechnical and even civil engineers are better able to interpolate in relation to such strata what materials at what levels are likely to exist between boreholes. Trial pits are larger but do not usually go down nearly as far as boreholes; they also suffer from the same problem that they disclose what is within the pit but not what lies between the pits. The difficulty however, which is and was both obvious and well-known to those experienced in civil engineering projects, arises in relation to made ground or other fill material which has historically either been placed or has simply been built up on the surface.

The contaminants were in this location as, or more likely to be randomly located than deliberately dumped. The boreholes, given their limitations arising out of the number of boreholes and the narrow gauge of the borehole samples, and the trial pits would only fortuitously locate the randomly distributed contaminants.

There is no evidence that OHL actually applied its mind pre-contract at all to what if any quantities of contaminated land might be encountered. Their conduct over the first 15 months of the project or even longer suggests that OHL had not considered this to be a real risk at all, notwithstanding that it had been told to allow for 10,000m³ of contaminated material. I accept Mr Hall‟s evidence that experienced contractors at tender stage would not limit themselves to a study of the ES, which is primarily directed towards planning matters, albeit that it provided useful technical information. What was needed and could have been expected from experienced contractors was some intelligent assessment and analysis of why there was contamination there (namely the recent and less recent history) and therefore what the prospects of encountering more than had been unsurprisingly revealed by the pre-contract site investigation, even if it would be difficult to quantify. The very obvious questions which any experienced contractor asks and would have asked, in relation to what was in effect a brown-field site is: what was this site used for before? The answer broadly was and always would have been that the key part of the site (the tunnel area) was at the end of a runway and near a fuel farm on what had for many years been an extensive rifle range and therefore there would be an expectation of a very real risk that there could be extensive lead and hydrocarbon residues from these activities in the made ground. </p>

In so doing not only do I accept the approach adumbrated by Mr Hall in evidence but also I adopt what seems to me to be simple common sense by any contractor in this field. Contaminants of the type with which this case are concerned will have been present as a result of human intervention over many years; they will have been deposited and spread either deliberately, accidentally or carelessly and possibly at times when the human agencies involved did not know or appreciate that they might be dangerous if left in the ground. They will therefore primarily have been in the made ground overlying the undisturbed strata underneath. Boreholes and sampling pits will only disclose what is in the samples, which in the case of contaminants will be randomly located and the contaminants may or may not show up in the relatively small number of samples taken; put another way, the contaminated materials will only show up in the samples by chance. The only exception to this would be a location in which available records showed the deliberate and planned deposition of contaminated materials; there is no suggestion that this applied here.  </p>

It must have been obvious to anyone who applied any real thought to this that the residues of what soldiers had been firing with on these rifle ranges would include the lead in the bullets or musket balls likely to have been used. Those butts had obviously been levelled years before 2007; thus foreseeably there would have been lead spread around the area within the made ground. Similarly the facts that aeroplanes had been landing, taking off and being refuelled for over 70 years before 2007 on and around the east end of the runway and that there were a fuel farm and oil pipes close to the line of the proposed road and tunnel would and should have been appreciated by tendering contractors to the effect that there could well be hydrocarbon or other oil derivatives in the soil in and around the proposed tunnel area. Many petroleum derivatives also used to have lead additives in them, although lead free petrol is now the norm in Western Europe.

It is and must have been clear that (as was the case) the 10,000 m³ figure given in the ES was hardly anything more than a “say” figure and is in effect a warning to tendering contractors that a sizeable amount of contaminated ground should be anticipated. It is also apposite to note that, even if there was only 10,000m³ of contaminated ground, it could not in practice be excised with surgical precision on a construction site like this, the consequence being that, to remove say a 2x2x2m amount of contaminated material from the ground with an excavator, one is probably going to have to excavate a hole of 3x3x3m, thus inevitably cross-contaminating and more than trebling the initial volume. There was always thus foreseeably a major problem in this regard.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">One of the problems which has in one sense complicated this part of the case is the attempts by the relevant experts to quantify the quantities of contaminated material, both that which was reasonably foreseeable by tenderers and that which was actually present at the site. In relation to the latter, this has become complicated by what actually happened on site in circumstances in which OHL took no real measures prior to the end of 2010 to anticipate the presence of contaminants or to take steps to segregate or to avoid mixing all the soils (both contaminated and not). Thus, Mr Wouters, rightly, does not seek to defend the assessments of such quantities made by OHL at the time (for instance the 73,000m³ suggested by OHL in June 2010); this is particularly so because there was substantial cross-contamination caused by OHL‟s work practices. Another problem is the method of assessment of quantities: what each expert has done is to assume, in relation to each sample found to be contaminated above the STV levels, that the ground around it (to assessed depths and to large or small areas around it) were equally contaminated; one then multiplies the area by the depth to produce a cubic metre result. That is little more than engineering speculation, albeit put forward by each expert in good faith. It is speculation because there is no way of knowing that the given areas selected (be they smaller or larger) contained as much (if any further) contamination as that represented by the sample(s) selected. Thus, for instance, if Sample A at 2m depth at Chainage 600 shows excessive lead contamination, that could stretch just 1m² around the sample location and create 2m³ of contaminated soil or it could stretch 20m² around and produce 800m³. They have tried to extrapolate from and/or interpolate between the samples to produce assessments but that logic runs foul of the probability that the contaminated materials were randomly deposited and/or spread historically and the extrapolation/interpolation exercise is in this regard (unlike in relation to the rock exercises done by other experts) no more than guesswork and essentially unreliable. It might be different, for example, if excessive hydrocarbon was found at the same depth over 10 samples within a 400m² area; one could then sensibly conclude that it represented a sizeable hydrocarbon deposit or dump. However, the results of the sampling show a much more random distribution and that type of conclusion is not readily available. </p>

He goes on in Paragraph 4.7.10 to say that a competent contractor would consider that the ES would present an overview and a comprehensive diagnosis of the subsurface conditions of the site”. Although he may believe that (and indeed it is his thesis), I consider that experienced tendering contractors needed to look at all the available information and also to understand it. This is (correctly) not a case in which it is said that the ES amounted to a warranty or representation. There is no evidence as to what OHL actually considered at tender stage in relation to contamination. What experienced contractors needed to appreciate and understand for projects such as this in relation to contaminated materials was the extent to which such material would <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> be shown up by a relatively few boreholes and trial pits in the key area (the tunnel and the tunnel ramps where the main bulk of the excavation was to be done) in the light of the known history of the site; that history involved the known and foreseeable risks of hydrocarbon contamination from the fuel for vehicles, primarily aircraft, which had been deployed on this site for over 70 years and lead contamination from lead bullets and from fuel; these were both highlighted and identified in the tender documents. Any intelligent contractor tendering for this work would, I am satisfied, have appreciated that reliance simply on the part of the ES relied upon by Mr Wouters would have been unrealistic. A primary reason for this is that experienced contractors (who, as here, often have experienced civil engineers working in-house) know that a borehole and trial pit regime on its own can only identify such contaminants as are disclosed by the samples and that it would be imprudent (not only commercially but also from an engineering standpoint) to presume that there was no other contamination elsewhere.  </p>

This was later adjusted to double that figure in his Addendum Report of 13 December 2013. For the reasons indicated above, that is, with respect to him, a somewhat facile approach. However he has to come back in his report to the fact that the ES specifically refers to 10,000m³ of contaminated soil. That would point a contractor (and even one who was minded to deploy within his tender calculations an assessment such as that employed by Mr Wouters) to the very strong probability that there was likely to be a sizeable amount more of contaminated material than such a simple assessment would produce. </p>

This ignores the fact that Sergeyco and Gamasur were in effect targeting a very specific area which was the tunnel and its approach, and was sampling mostly in between the sample points from the pre-tender site investigation. If anything, these later investigations, and indeed those done in early 2011, demonstrated that it was almost inevitable that one would find additional contamination in the areas in between the earlier sample points,  albeit of course not necessarily at every additional new sample position. </p>

He had to accept in evidence that these figures include an un-quantified element of non-contaminated material because this would inevitably be mixed up with the contaminated material when removed by excavation. However, on that basis, the 10,000m³ referred to in the tender would have had to be substantially increased to allow for this as well.

He came up with a figure of 15,000m³ as a figure which he would have advised a contractor to make allowance for. However, he did a similar calculation to Mr Wouters, albeit one which produced a higher figure; this is subject therefore to my serious misgivings about the type of calculations. One of the problems is to determine what the calculated figure or the 10,000m³ figure in the ES actually relates to; it must mean that there is in the undisturbed state such an amount. However, it would be difficult to extract surgically 5m³ here or 50m³ there of contaminated material without taking out rather more; the reality is therefore that whatever figure a tenderer assumed was present, in practice it would have to budget on having to treat more than the strict figure assumed as contaminated because by the time that </p>

This becomes even more surprising after the Gamasur report in October 2010 when further contamination is recorded as having been found. In practice, what OHL did was to remove 2m of the soil from the original surface level without forethought or regard to whether it contained contaminated materials or not. OHL simply did nothing throughout late 2009 and 2010 to deal with either contaminated material or recognise the ramifications and consequences of not doing anything. Thus, OHL did nothing when Mr De La Paz fairly pointed out in early 2010 that it was doing nothing to counter cross-contamination between contaminated and non-contaminated soils. It is true that the questions of responsibility for contaminated materials became confused by the Stockpile Agreement whereby all material excavated was to be taken to Spain but that was a stop-gap arrangement and the materials were still excavated and handled on site without any regard being given by OHL to the ramifications of them being contaminated materials. These ramifications were not simply the health and safety considerations towards workers on and visitors to site; they also included consideration (well before January or February 2011 when the re-design started) of the impact on the design and working methods for the tunnel excavation and roof construction. The reality is that, whether the re-design was necessary or not or reasonable or not, the basic geotechnical and chemical information supposedly justifying it had all been available for months before the Himalaya related suspension at Christmas 2010.  </p>

For instance, it did not require its workmen to use appropriate safety equipment or do any risk assessment to justify its non-use and it did not segregate contaminated from non-contaminated materials. Mr Doncel and others said that OHL had planned to save contaminated materials with a view to putting them back, appropriately capped within the material covering the tunnel roof; I do not accept that this was always the OHL plan and it only saw the light of day as the contaminated materials saga unfolded and indeed there was little or nothing in the OHL planning which seemed to identify what if any arrangements were being made for the temporary storage of such material or indeed any material for this purpose. The excavation for the diaphragm wall panels started in about March 2010 and was indiscriminate in its approach to contaminated and noncontaminated soil; simply everything was taken out and there was factual evidence that cross-contamination was inevitable in these circumstances. Mr Hall said in evidence (Para. 185 of his first report), and I accept, that lead contamination can be simply identified by use of hand held tools and hydrocarbon contamination can be smelt by humans so that a reasonable level of segregation could be achieved, in practice. </p>

There being no waiver or estoppel points raised, this does not help OHL who carried the risk. In one sense, OHL could just have said to itself that it would dispose of all the made ground to avoid having to segregate it between contaminated and non-contaminated. Again another confusion came in which was GOG‟s wrongful belief that it was or could well be financially at risk for the costs of disposal by OHL of all contaminated materials which largely drove its thinking in relation not only to the Stockpile Agreement but also the plan to set up and pay for the Befesa plant and the setting aside of the Aerial Farm site for OHL to deposit all excavated material upon it. This latter arrangement in the result was fruitless because OHL deposited little material on Aerial Farm. It is also the case that the Befesa arrangement was significantly driven by the thought within GOG that extra useable soil should be made available within Gibraltar and the draft Fill Guidelines should be applied to this process so that any material which complied with them could safely be used for instance in land reclamation. The Befesa arrangement was one which would have saved OHL millions of pounds because it had the contractual risk in relation to the contaminated soil (as set out in this part of the judgment); all it had to do was deposit all the excavated materials on Aerial Farm. But for this, it would have had to dispose of scores of thousands of cubic metres of materials which either were originally or had become in consequence of its working practices contaminated. As for the rest, unless the excavated material was clean sand, it would have had to be taken out of Gibraltar as waste even if not contaminated. </p>

The primary contaminants encountered were lead and hydrocarbon, particularly PAHs, which were reasonably foreseeable at the date of tender as likely to be encountered particularly along the line of the tunnel and the tunnel ramps and within the made ground which extended down in places to over 5m below existing ground level. In terms of the quantities of contaminants to be foreseen, it is difficult to put any precise figure on what should have been foreseen but in my judgment the amount would be very substantially above 10,000m³. It is similarly impossible to determine with any precision what quantities of contaminated materials were actually encountered or were present. I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that OHL (to apply the wording in the operative clause, Clause 4.12 of the conditions of the Contract) in fact encountered either in terms of type or quantities or location “Unforeseeable” physical conditions, namely contaminated materials in the soil. I find that the quantities actually encountered and present were likely to have been less than could have been reasonably foreseen by an experienced contractor and it has certainly not been established otherwise. </p>

The issue of contaminated water on site is relevant not only to possible extension of time but also in the run up period before the termination. There needs to be a distinction drawn between the underground natural aquifers which carried water in effect from under the Spanish mainland and the groundwater. The groundwater was not and is not fed or charged only by the aquifers and there may be some contributions from other sources; for instance rain and even the nearby sea can play a part in the groundwater regime at this site. There is no dispute factually that groundwater was foreseeable (and indeed levels were given for it in the ES) and that dewatering would foreseeably be required for the tunnel excavations which were to go down many metres. The dewatering would be required to keep dry the tunnel excavation and environment so as to install the road and drainage within the tunnel as well as the tunnel linings and other related work. The real issue is whether contaminated groundwater was foreseeable by an experienced contractor at the time of tender. </p>

For instance, the Water Resources chapter in the ES says in no uncertain terms that “exceedances of threshold values were recorded for heavy metals, toluene and PAH contaminants" (Paragraph 3.24 quoted above); toluene is a benzene derivative, being aromatic hydrocarbon and historically one use was in gasoline fuels. A number of the groundwater monitoring wells were installed pre-contract in the tunnel area (for instance Boreholes 102, 103, 105, 109-114, and WS111) and several of these showed such contamination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">There are two other very obvious aspects of contamination in the groundwater. The first is that, because groundwater levels rise and fall (sometimes seasonally) and because groundwater can move laterally as well (for instance here towards the sea), the contaminants can in their soluble form be transferred upwards, downwards or sideways as the water itself moves; this is all standard knowledge for experienced contractors. They can therefore be moved down from the made ground into the natural undisturbed strata below. Indeed, that can explain a number of the water borne contaminants being found in the pre-contract tests for instance at depths between 7m to 15m. The second aspect is that, as must have been obvious to any experienced contractor, the effect of excavation and other construction operations in the ground can also "disturb existing contaminated soil and result in new paths for contamination to move between soil and water" (see Page 13 of the Non-Technical Summary to the ES, quoted above).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">One then couples the above to the lead and hydrocarbon in the made ground which would have been foreseeable by experienced contractors. I therefore conclude and find that competent tendering contractors should reasonably have foreseen that there was a very real risk and prospect of significantly contaminated groundwater being encountered during excavations which when encountered would need to be addressed by appropriate dewatering and discharge arrangements. In this regard, I accept the thrust of Mr Hall‟s evidence. I found Mr Wouters‟ analysis on this for instance in his second report to be unhelpful; for instance (Para. 2.109 et seq), he seeks to analyse particular monitoring wells from the 2007 Sergeyco investigation which showed detected hydrocarbon not being exceeded in four out of six well results, judged as against 2008 (EQS) standards; that does not help because the clearest warning about heavy metals and hydrocarbon product or residue being present in the groundwater was given in the prose part of the ES (for which see above). Any experienced contractor would be bound to attach weight to what the ES says (albeit not slavishly so). Mr Wouters in his first report seeks to assert that a number of the sample results were some distance away from the tunnel area so that, he says, experienced contractors would assume that there would be no or little water contamination at the tunnel. This however ignores two things, first that groundwater is on the move in this location, carrying with it contamination and secondly the essentially random nature of the distribution of contamination which may or may not be picked up by sampling. Mr Wouters goes on in his second report (Para. 2.119) to infer that contaminants in the groundwater do not matter because this is “in the context of groundwater that is present in a coastal aquifer, which will end up in the sea anyway in a relatively short period of time”. I can only assume that this was a flip and unconsidered remark because, of course if the ground is undisturbed by construction operations, the groundwater may well migrate into the sea either with the contaminants or with the contaminants filtered somewhat by the soils between the given point measured by sampling and the sea; the corollary is that, when the ground containing contaminated water is seriously excavated into, the groundwater will be released into the excavation and the contractor will have to do something about the then doubly contaminated water (that is contaminated before going into the excavation and then further contaminated by any contaminants in the soil in the excavation). Whether or not the contaminants found in water sampling exceeds a particular threshold may well not matter to an experienced contractor provided more than trace elements are found because there will then be a readily recognisable risk that water treatment of some sort will be needed. </p>

Further findings including what have now become controversial water sampling results produced for OHL in the autumn of 2010 show certainly some contaminated water and possibly some very contaminated water. It was only in about September 2010 that OHL gave any real thought as to what it might have to do in relation to contaminated water which it would encounter when excavating down to and within the groundwater levels to be encountered. Eventually, in the tunnel area, the groundwater level being encountered was about 2 or 2.5m below the reduced ground level or about 4 to 4.5m below the original ground level.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">The evidence on all sides was that, if there was only lead contamination to address, a relatively simple sand block method of filtration would be required to enable the “suspended solids” represented by the lead in the dewatered water from the excavation. For instance this was accepted by Mr Wouters in crossexamination and Mr Hall accepted it also saying in effect that would be achieved with a settlement tank. In respect of hydrocarbon contamination in water, a more elaborate water treatment plant would be required.  Mr Hall said (and I accept), that this can only be removed by passing the water through granular activated carbon filters. The problem for OHL was that it could not just dump the untreated water in the sea or into the Gibraltar foul or storm water drainage systems, because it was going to be polluted. Although there was much discussion in the case about whether the Gibraltar authorities in general and Mr Gil in particular were being unreasonable or were applying standards which had not been applicable or applied before the Contract was entered into, the reality was that OHL would never have been allowed to deposit into the sea or the drains untreated groundwater with the levels of contamination being reported fairly consistently by both sides‟ independent consultants in 2010 and early 2011. The sizing and capacity of any water treatment plant to be selected depends, as Mr Hall said and I accept on the flow rate of the contaminated water and that would depend on OHL‟s programme requirements and methodology; he went on to say that an activated carbon filter removes all hydrocarbon contamination until the filter is saturated and has to be exchanged. In this context, I do not accept the evidence or argument in this context that the “new” EQS limits to which GOG and its agencies had regard by September 2010 (compared with the standards applicable at the tender stage in 2007 and 2008) made any difference to the basic need for the provision of the more elaborate water treatment plant as referred to by Mr Hall or as actually installed; even with the less stringent limits applicable at contract stage, such a plant would have been required. </p>

Certainly those results or some of them show a level of water contamination which is way above what had been reported in May and August 2010 by Sergeyco itself as well as later results from Clarke Bond and VTA in early 2011. There was a further water sampling exercise done in July 2011 and reported on by Sergeyco on 3 August 2011. No witness was called from Sergeyco to respond to the concerns raised by for instance Mr Hall in his reports. As Mr Wouters accepted under cross-examination there was no relevant deterioration, so far as contamination was concerned  in water as sampled by Sergeyco in May and August 2010; there was however an apparently marked deterioration between August and October 2010 (maximum concentrations identified), with a 37 fold and a 10 fold increase in the lead and hydrocarbon elements: </p>

Under Chapter 5 which dealt with road tunnels, a (non-exhaustive) list of aspects to be considered included “Proposed tunnel wall finish”, “Fire resistance” and “Secondary lining and cladding”. One needs to bear in mind that an AIP involves Approval in Principle, which does not necessarily involve the need to consider detail although obviously sufficient needs to be provided to the Engineer to enable him or her to determine whether it can be approved in principle.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">What happened in the AIP process is that time and time again OHL submitted for approval a proposal that the tunnel lining should be brickwork cladding and not the proprietary lining expressly called for in the Contract. The Engineer rejected the first four submissions on this ground in effect because it clearly did not comply with the Contract and also because the brickwork proposal did not demonstrate that the specified specular value could be attained. It is and was no secret that OHL was putting forward the brickwork cladding alternative to save money as it was thought to be much cheaper; internal-mails in April 2009 suggested that possibly €400,000 might be saved. Time and again, OHL sought to justify its selection on the grounds that it was much used in Spain and by producing information by which it attempted to suggest that brick-lining was as good as a proprietary lining. Ultimately, there was an understanding reached possibly as late as November 2009 that the issue would be “parked” and the Rev D submission would use generic or relatively neutral wording to secure approval. This is what happened. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">The issue is whether the stage reached at Rev D in November/December 2009 could and should have been reached earlier. Mr Chapman says that the lining was “not an essential structural component and its only relevance for the overall design was the space that it would occupy” (first report- Para. 101), that agreement on this issue “was not necessary” and that it could have been taken “off-line…provided that adequate space-proofing allowance was made” (Para. 103). Mr Beadman disagrees on the basis that, until agreement was reached on the lining, the internal dimensions of the tunnel could not be determined, that the specular requirements of the brick lining were not met, that the requisite fire resistance had not been demonstrated and, underlining these matters, that it was contrary to what had been specified contractually. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">In my judgment, Mr Beadman is absolutely right on this issue. There was no justification to put forward the brick lining option as an appropriate design solution. It expressly contravened what the Employer‟s Requirements called for and the brick-lining could not be demonstrated effectively to comply with the fire resistance or specular requirements. The fact that the lining was not to carry structural loads from other parts of the tunnel structure was immaterial because it was not just structural matters which needed to be addressed in the AIP exercise. In any event, the lining whatever it was would at least carry its own loads and any applied loads in the case of an accident in the tunnel, for instance a lorry driving into it; in that sense it might legitimately be considered to have some structural implications. Until the basic lining was determined in any event, the available carriage width could not be determined; for example, if the brick cladding arrangement was 125mm thick (on each of two internal walls of each road tunnel) compared with 25mm thick for a proprietary lining, the brick cladding would take up 200mm more space in the tunnel than the proprietary lining. Apart from the commercial consideration, it is wholly unclear why OHL continued to press for the brickwork solution in all these circumstances when the Engineer was clearly unhappy about a solution which was so obviously contrary to what the Contract called for. Mr Chapman accepted under cross-examination that he could not say that the Engineer had acted unreasonably in this regard.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">With regard to the flood wall for the tunnel, Paragraph 2.7 of the Employer‟s Requirements provided for a design against the 1:200 year storm with an overtopping discharge of 0.01/s/m at  all locations along the length of the flood wall. OHL engaged (through Donaldsons) the well known British marine engineers, HR Wallingford, to design the flood wall.  Initially, in May 2009, Wallingford indicated that a flood wall of 5.5m in height would be required. Over the following few weeks, OHL requested that consideration should be given to a wall of 2.3m in height and this required further analysis. There were exchanges between Donaldsons, Wallingford, OHL and the Engineer in June and July 2009 which led to Donaldsons advising OHL to "seek a departure from the contractual requirements in relation to overtopping threshold…to a figure<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>of 0.05l/s…coupled with a 1:100 year storm and sea level rises [giving] a wall crest elevation of 6.9 m CD [and] this wall should be re-curved”, this being requested in an OHL letter dated 6 July 2009 to the Engineer. This was addressed in Rev B of AIP1 submitted all 27 July 2009 which stated that flood/wave loading would be taken into account in the detailed design.

He goes on to say that therefore the Engineer should have agreed at the Revision B stage in July and August 2009 to take this element "offline”. Mr Beadman says that given “that the initial flood study was submitted on 8 May 2009 and the Engineer was considering the results, leading to the eventual agreement to relax the specification, I do not consider that this is an issue that should prevent approval of AIP1 from Rev B onwards” (Para. 185 of his 31 July 2013 report). </p>

This issue clearly was a structural matter which, depending on the height of the wall, its shape, its loading and its size, would necessarily have a material impact on the tunnel structure loadings. This was clearly within the context of BD2/05 something which the Engineer was entitled to reject until sufficient was provided to demonstrate that there would either be structural compliance with the Employer‟s Requirements or that sufficient was provided to demonstrate justification for a substantial departure from those Requirements. The fact that Wallingford was a very well known marine engineer can not obviate the need to comply with BD2/05 because otherwise the whole AIP process could be sidelined by saying that, because there are particularly well qualified and experienced engineers in charge on the design side, it can all be sorted out later; BD2/05 was introduced as it makes clear following serious structural failures, mostly in box girder structures designed by internationally well known and respected British consulting engineers.

This omission was sorted out by the time that Revision C was produced.

However, to reach the tender toe levels for the east and west walls there was a slight risk that some sporadic local chiselling might be necessary to break up the material described as laminates of mudstone within the clay.

A significant difference however between the two experts arose in relation to the extent to which the experienced tendering contractor would have regard or attach weight to the soil descriptions in the 2007 site investigation borehole logs but less so to the SPT values also recorded in those logs. Another difference appeared, highlighted in the second joint statement, which was in relation to the quantity of "rock" encountered; this revolved around a given depth of "rock" over a panel length which required two “bites” of the clamshell after chiselling had been carried out on the first bite or bite‟s worth only.

Another sub-contractor, Terratest, started on the southern side again in the ramp area in late March 2010. Altogether, this work was programmed to last some 2 months, it in fact took over 9 months. “Rock” was first encountered on the northern side on 18 May 2010. As more “rock” was encountered, OHL engaged Sergeyco and another to carry out further site investigation (in late May/June, July and October 2010). There were some design changes because at least in part, if rock was encountered higher than expected, the founding level could be altered. Also agreement was reached that a sensible way of addressing the “rock” was by drilling or chiselling into the “rock” and then using the clamshell grab to break it out and remove the debris. Chiselling in this context involves the sometimes repeated dropping of a large steel mass to the base of the excavation such as will cause the hard material at the base to shatter into pieces; the clamshell grab can then be used to pick up the fragments.  </p>

What happens (as described by Mr Davies in his first report (Para. 80)) is that there is a free fall hammer (of 63.5 kg mass) which drops onto a drive head from a height of 760mm and the number of blows required to achieve a 75mm penetration is recorded. If more than 50 blows were needed to penetrate the 75mm it was considered to have met “refusal”. BS 5930, which is the relevant Site Investigation Code of Practice, identifies what SPT values demonstrate in different soils; thus for sands and gravels, “dense” can be established with SPT values of 30-50 and “very dense” above 50 and for rock, “moderately strong” 12.5 to 100 and “strong” 50 to 100. The borehole logs identify what SPT values were established at different depths as well as describing the material as noted by the loggers of the borehole in question. There is as between the experts an (intellectual) tension as to the weight to be attached to the SPT results as compared with the description of the soil or other material note at the various different levels in the borehole logs. </p>

Mr Sanders believes that it was reasonably foreseeable that material described as „clay‟ but recovered with SPT „N‟ values exceeding 67 was, in fact, a mudstone or clayey marlstone. This all tied up with how a contractor would expect to deal with whatever it is which is being encountered in practice. Mr Davies thus believes that only limestone around the position of BH105 could be foreseen together with “sporadic” mudstone bands within stiff/very stiff brown clay, mostly at Chainage 420 to 500.  </p>

Of course, they would rely on the description of the soils contained in the borehole logs because the verbal description (based by the loggers on a visual look at the material and touching it, all based on their experience) is useful but they would also attach importance to the SPT test results. The soil descriptions and the test results can be wrong or misleading; mistakes can be made, say, in the logged soil descriptions or test results can be skewed unwittingly by something unusual being locally present within the material being tested. The higher the SPT results, the more likely the experienced tendering contractor will say to itself that there was (or at least there was a real risk that there was) something harder in the material being tested which was causing the drive head of the testing gear to be resisted by the material. There would be a very real risk in the contractor adopting a blinkered approach by saying to itself that it will ignore the SPT results unless it is wholly consistent with the description of the soil given at the comparable depth. The experienced contractor must say to itself that, where there are high SPT values, there is a real and foreseeable risk that it may encounter something much harder than may be verbally described; that harder material may require special measures to remove it, over and above those measures planned for the less hard material. In this regard, I accept Mr Sanders‟ evidence that this was a significant risk and that OHL should have appreciated from high SPT values recorded in the 2007 Site Investigation Report in material often described as “clay” that this material could well prove to be particularly difficult to excavate simply with a clamshell grab and that provision should be made for more robust measures to remove such material. It is clear that at tender stage, OHL did have regard to the SPT values in relation to the geotechnical design for the diaphragm walls because it said so in the Contractor‟s Proposal (Clarification Correspondence of 2 July 2008).  </p>

His view is that higher SPT results are consistent with bands of mudstone being present within the stiff or very stiff “Clay” as verbally described in the borehole logs. I prefer the evidence of Mr Sanders on this to the effect that the SPT results are not consistent with these suggested bands of mudstone because the SPT results do not reveal a sudden increase in strength as would be anticipated in the case of layers of rock within a clay matrix.  </p>

This raises the subissue as to whether account needs to be taken of material below the foreseeable level at which the risk of needing to chisel should reasonably have been foreseen, albeit in the result was not required. Mr Davies does not obviously take it into account but Mr Sanders does; Mr Davies says that, of the 1,382m³ actually chiselled, some 56% (or about 775m³) could not reasonably have been foreseen, whilst Mr Sanders says that over 4,000m³ was foreseeable. In my view, no reasonable contractor would have assumed that, where every SPT result exceeded a certain amount, chiselling would be required. There must be an assumption by such contractors that there is real risk that SPT results may well show harder materials which may need chiselling but no experienced contractor would, like Mr Sanders has done, assume that anything like 4,000m³ plus would be encountered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">Mr Davies said that 806m³ of harder material which required chiselling could not have reasonably have been foreseen whilst Mr Sanders said that the whole quantity representing what was chiselled was foreseeable and in effect even more could reasonably have been foreseen; indeed, the conclusion to be drawn from Mr Sanders is that OHL was extremely fortunate to encounter substantially less than could reasonably have been foreseen. I broadly accept that Mr Davies is closer to being right than Mr Sanders with regard to these figures but Mr Davies‟ approach is guided by his 15-20% “sporadic” chiselling allowance which, because he does not attach as much weight to the SPT values as experienced contractors would do in my judgment, represents an under-allowance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">I have reviewed above the basis of the primary alleged causes of delay up until about the end of 2010. The programming experts have analysed the various programmes which were produced and the progress, initially as against the March 2009 programme, to determine what critically caused delay to this project up until the termination. There is little doubt that this two year project was at least the best part of 23 months in delay by early August 2011, if it had not actually gone backwards in the sense that several expert scenarios and OHL predictions suggest a 24 month plus delay. The delay is important because it puts into context what happened between late 2010 and termination.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">The onus of proof is on OHL to prove that it was delayed by the matters now relied upon by it as critically causing it delay up until the time of termination. It relies largely on the evidence of Mr Crane, its programming expert. GOG, although putting forward its own programming expert, Mr Palles-Clark, primarily concentrates on seeking to challenge OHL‟s delay case. Indeed, GOG did not actively support in its opening or closing what Mr Palles-Clark had put forward. The exercise however for the Court is, in circumstances where there is little material dispute as to what in terms of design or work was done and when, primarily one of logic, albeit based on the evidence. Programming experts, at least the good ones, help the Court to concentrate on the logic not only of the original (baseline) programme to which the contractor in question was working but also what was driving progress or a lack of it on key parts of the work at key times. There are also issues as to whether OHL complied with Clause 20 and the preconditions therein contained for prompt notice for extension of time applications, to which I will return at the end of this Chapter of the judgment. </p>

This was indeed part of the Particulars of Claim. Its new programming expert, Mr Crane, in an appropriately independent way differed somewhat from the pleaded analysis with the result that OHL (at my gentle suggestion) amended its Particulars of Claim, without objection from GOG.

The programming experts showed where the planned critical path was programmed to run (in Annex 2 to their first joint statement). It starts with the submission of AIP1 and follows with the development of the tunnel design. There is for part of the period a concurrent planned critical path which relates to the securing of access to “Area B” followed by some service diversion work to enable the construction of the guide walls off the diaphragm walls. One can therefore see that, if the tunnel design had gone through in accordance with this baseline programme but the Area B service diversion work had been materially delayed, the guide wall work could have been delayed and the subsequent undoubtedly critical construction of the diaphragm walls. This is not what happened however; it was the AIP process which became seriously delayed. AIP 1 was supposed to have been reviewed successfully by 20 May 2009 but it was not until 21 December 2009 that it was approved, a delay of 215 days. Although detailed design was planned to overlap with the AIP1 exercise, it could not be completed until the AIP1 had been approved. The detailed design stage did overlap in fact but for a variety of reasons none of which are said to entitle OHL to extensions of time, the detailed design which was programmed to be complete by 16 July 2009 was in fact completed by 7 May 2010, a delay of 295 days, albeit one which overlaps with the AIP1 delay between 16 July and 21 December 2009. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">It is obvious and I find that the diaphragm wall work could not start until sufficient detailed design work had been done to enable such work to start. In fact, diaphragm wall construction, initially excavation, began on 1 March 2010, the guide wall work having been started in late November or early December 2009. This effectively means in logic and fact that the Area B service diversion work did not delay the start of the diaphragm wall excavation. Whatever it was that delayed the start of the diaphragm wall work, it was not the Area B” service diversion work. There is only one sensible explanation which is that the design process, initially the AIP1 submissions followed by the detailed design preparations and exchanges, is what delayed the start of the diaphragm wall construction. It follows that Mr Palles-Clark‟s thesis that the first 5 items on his list above did, individually and overall, cause delay is wrong and they did not delay the Works and in the result could not have delayed the overall progress of the work. Mr Palles-Clark however “catches up” with Mr Crane at about December 2009 and properly, in my view, he then allocates design delays as the next critical cause of delay. </p>

That doubtless occurred because there was mutual confidence that what remained outstanding could be resolved in good time before any failure to resolve it would seriously impact on progress.

I agree. It follows that, as I prefer the approach of Mr Crane on critical delay up until this point, the causes of critical delay up until 7 May 2010 were the delay approval of AIP1 (until 21 December 2009) and delayed approvals of detailed design until 7 May 2010. That critical delay is 295 days. For the reasons given earlier in this judgment and because no case is continued to be advanced by OHL that the detailed design approvals attract any entitlement to extension, this delay was the risk, responsibility and fault of OHL. </p>

This period runs primarily from 7 May to 24 June 2010, the latter date being when tunnel diaphragm wall panel work started in earnest. The reality is that this work could not start on 7 May 2010 in any event because OHL needed to construct the requisite reinforcement cages; Mr Doncel confirmed in his first witness statement explained that this was a reason for not starting tunnel wall panels then as well as the need to organise night shifts for sub-contractors, concrete batching plant and OHL‟s own supervisory staff. He also said that there was a lack of space to stockpile excavated material. This, it is said, then became worse when OHL was instructed on 14 May 2010 by the Environmental Agency not to move or use the contents of three stockpiles, which were thought to be and indeed mostly were contaminated. There is a factual dispute as to whether there was sufficient room to create more stockpiles or to store excavated material. </p>

The risk was OHL‟s and it was in effect OHL‟s responsibility to get rid of excavated material. If there was room in Gibraltar, all well and good but if there was not, the only place in practice it could be taken to was Spain.

He says, and I agree, that PEE could have started on about 24 September 2010 when Chainages 615 to 715 (partly in the southern but mostly in the northern parts) were effectively completed.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">This was not a period through most of which it could be said that there was a stockpile problem because the Stockpile Agreement came into effect and all excavated materials could be and indeed were removed. Insofar as the stockpile problem could be said to have delayed matters in the earlier part of the period, similar considerations apply as for the previous period. The only additional factor which is said to have delayed OHL was the encountering of rock or material which was sufficiently hard to require chiselling. It is comprehensible and logical that the panel excavation work in the northern airside area was critically delayed by “Unforeseeable” physical conditions when OHL hit such material. However, in this period, there were 2 or possibly three panels in the northern airside section for which chiselling was required (No. 148 on 10 August and No. 153 from 13 to 16 September 2010 and possibly No. 146, all identified in Appendix 7.2 of Mr Crane‟s first report); there are no records showing any chiselling time for No. 146. For No. 148, 4 hours and 5 minutes of chiselling time was recorded and 16 hours for No. 153. Mr Crane equates this to 2 working days delay, based on a 10 hour working shift (at night because of air traffic restrictions). I attach no weight to the mere fact that there was chiselling because to qualify for an extension of time it must have been done above the line which the rock experts have drawn above which rock or hard material was “Unforeseeable”. Thus, Panel No. 148 involved chiselling below the line which I have accepted (see above). Panel No. 153, as identified by the rock experts, was entirely above the line and it therefore attracts extension of time. That needs to be balanced by the overall quantity of foreseeable rock or hard material which reasonably would have been allowed by experienced contractors; I allowed 500m³ which was 5/8ths of what the Claimant‟s rock expert had allowed. In terms of how much delay was actually caused, I assess therefore that one day‟s critical delay was caused by the </p>

The Stockpile Agreement was extended until 30 September 2010; there can be no excuse for alleged problems with disposing of contaminated or non-contaminated material up to that date as it was all being taken to Spain, mostly at the expense of GOG (at least on an interim basis). There was absolutely no good reason why thereafter OHL could not have continued to export all contaminated material and, if it decided not to segregate the material into contaminated/hazardous/non-contaminated/non-hazardous categories, simply have exported it without segregating it. OHL had advance notice of the impending end of the Stockpile Agreement and it had contractual arrangements in place to continue the export arrangements; there is evidence that it could have done so at significantly cheaper rates than thitherto. The risk was OHL‟s as the problem with contaminated material was as it happened not </p>

The fact that there was a hope, eventually realised, that GOG not only would provide space for all material to be deposited but also would undertake to treat such material at its own expense should not have meant that OHL should simply do nothing about a growing problem of materials stacking up on site and delaying work. The easiest interim measure was for OHL to export the excavated material as before albeit without the previously agreed interim financial support from GOG for that exercise; alternatively, OHL could commercially but without contractual justification have taken a calculated gamble that liquidated damages for delay might be cheaper than the costs associated with exporting material to Spain in the hope that GOG would come round and provide the space and/or that it might secure an extension of time and related costs. The disclosed documentation does not reveal whether this thinking went on within OHL but it would be most surprising if it did not in circumstances in which in effect OHL dug its heels in, effectively allowed matters to drag on and took no steps to remove much if any material during this period. In any event, OHL was expressly given the opportunity on 13 October 2010 to use the beach car parking area for materials, an opportunity which it unjustifiably ignored. I have addressed this period earlier in the judgment. There was no entitlement to any extension of time in relation to this period. OHL could have started the PEE work on 24 September 2010 and could have disposed of the arisings either by export to Spain (partly at GOG‟s expense on an interim basis until 30 September 2010) or at the “free” beach car parking area shortly after 13 October 2010 or otherwise at its own expense. Mr Palles-Clark accepted in his second report (Para. 195) that this work could have started at the end of September 2010. </p>

In his basis of analysis, there was little effective progress apart from the impact of the rain. In broad terms, I accept his conclusion. The rain fall was exceptional with more than 20mm falling on 10 days compared with an average in 2001 to 2007 of 4; that produces in an acceptably simple analysis a net 6 days of exceptional weather and it is clear that it did seriously delay progress. Accordingly, I find that OHL was delayed by 6 days in this period for a reason which entitles it to extension (exceptionally adverse climatic conditions); I refer to this on occasion as the December rainfall or similar, although it started in late November and running through into the first 8 or 9 days of December 2010. </p>

There was effectively a 7 day entitlement to extension of time subject to the Clause 20 Notice provisions. It was on any count in very serious delay; the most optimistic assessment would be that it was some 18 months in delay. There were numerous problems looming. The first was what to do with the water, either surface or ground water. It had actually known at least since September 2010 that it was going to have to do something about it, having previously not obviously planned for it in any concrete way. It had set about but without any real urgency from September 2010 to seek quotations for the work and as at Christmas 2010 it must and should have been estimating that it would still take some weeks for any water treatment plant to arrive on site even if all the stops were pulled out. The site, albeit not over the whole of it, was heavily ponded with the rain which had fallen in early December 2010 and there must have been concern as to how that would be dealt with at least in the short term; indeed an extension of time notification was sent in on 10 January 2011 about the future effects of this ponding. On my findings of fact, OHL had decided to go down the risky route of finding an excuse to suspend work with a view to pressurising GOG into a financial arrangement which would at least mitigate the very heavy losses it was suffering and knew that it would otherwise suffer in the future; the job was on any count financially disastrous. There was however no real problem with material disposal following the allocation of Aerial Farm as a site on which to deposit excavated material at no cost to OHL, it formerly having been OHL‟s responsibility to dispose of all material, whether contaminated or not. </p>

The hydrocarbon risk would have been no more in practical terms than the impact of diesel from the excavating machines against which the drivers and other workers could be protected by forced ventilation in the tunnel which was always planned, by the drivers working in enclosed cabins on the excavating machines and by the wearing of PPE. </p>

The fact that nominally it had been advised by Himalaya to suspend work on the basis of supposedly serious risk to health and safety did not make it reasonable to suspend and then re-design. The December 2010 report was as much OHL‟s work as it was Himalaya‟s and OHL must have known therefore that it was not an independent report.  The 1 March 2011 Himalaya report actually suggested that it would be acceptable to proceed with PPE equipment for the workers. The expert evidence suggests that the later March 2011 Himalaya report also substantially drafted by OHL was flawed in suggesting that without adopting the re-design there was a material risk to workers. The re-design had been embarked upon well before this final Himalaya report was produced and so this report could have played no material part in the decision to redesign. </p>

There was no good reason to wait until December 2010 to do something about the problems thrown up by the presence of lead and hydrocarbon within the made ground. If OHL did not have the requisite expertise in-house (which I do not accept), it needed to go to a decent and genuinely independent firm of engineers with experience of dealing with contaminated land in tunnels for objective advice; that could and on this hypothesis should have been done by no later than about June or July 2010 at the latest. That advice (possibly following some further trial pit work), I have no real doubt, would have been that the then current design was achievable safely by one or both of the measures referred to in sub-paragraph (d)  above.

One reason given by OHL for not doing this work to any great extent was the residual ponding of water following the excessive rain in early December 2010. This did not seem to stop OHL from doing some such work at least. Further, the ponding was concentrated mostly at the northern end of the site and over the period from December 2010 it began to evaporate or otherwise naturally disappear and indeed by May 2011 it had substantially all evaporated. I accept the evidence that by about and after the end of February 2011 there were substantial areas in the tunnel region which were not affected by standing water and standing water did not provide an excuse not to restart this cutting down work. </p>

The problem was that the standing water was probably contaminated by the contaminants uncovered by the excavations and that it could not simply be pumped into the sea as it would have polluted the sea and the DoE would not have allowed it. This was within OHL‟s risk and responsibility for a number of reasons, the primary one of which was that the presence of contaminants in the ground was not Unforeseeable and therefore it was OHL‟s responsibility to provide for means of disposing of any consequentially contaminated standing or ground water. The risk of contaminated groundwater being encountered was not “Unforeseeable”. The only practical way in which disposal of standing water could have been done (short of removing very large quantities of it by water tankers, which was not particularly practical) was by providing a water treatment plant, which is what OHL eventually did. However, there is no good reason why this had not been provided well before the end of February 2011 and indeed it should have been provided many months before if progress had been even something close to what was envisaged by the Contract. OHL actually knew or believed from September 2010 onwards that water treatment was likely to be needed but for no good reason it took 8 months to organise and set it up on site; it should not and need not have taken anything like this time. </p>

I do not accept this. From the very start, there had been a culpable failure on the part of OHL to appreciate the risk of contaminated water and to put in place at an early stage measures to address this problem. Although OHL recognised internally only in September 2010 that a water treatment plant capable of handling both heavy metal and hydrocarbon contamination would be required, this recognition should have been very much earlier and before excavation started in earnest; that would have been by about May 2010 at the latest. Additionally, the correspondence reveals a real lack of urgency by OHL in the procurement process between September 2010 and the end of the year and indeed early into 2011; there is nothing really to excuse the delay in procurement from September 2010 until May 2011. </p>

Nonetheless, OHL, for no obviously good reason, indicated that it would not start until AIP was given to the redesign or indeed until the TAA approval was given. Whilst both parties were being tactical towards each other, it is difficult to accept that there was any real risk that AIP approval would not be given once the detailed design was approved. If OHL had really wanted to get on with the work after approval of the detailed design, it must have been clear that the Engineer would not stand in its way and there would therefore be no effective ground for any complaint of a premature start.  </p>

If there really was a problem for and genuinely felt by OHL in not wishing to start until all the design approvals were in place, the absence of the Category 3 certification for the tunnel roof redesign would have prevented a start being made before mid August 2011 at the earliest. </p>

Water had to be fed into it and the treated water tested before it could be used in practice. It was due to be tested on 6 May 2011 and the samples returned to England for testing with the results due by 15 May 2011. The sampling was done on 7 May 2011 but the sample bottles were broken in transit and so the sampling and testing had to redone and there was a further 8 days delay occasioned thereby to the potential effective start of water treatment at the site. Whilst the evidence does not indicate whose fault directly the bottle breakage was, this was OHL‟s risk and certainly not one which entitled it to extension or additional cost under the Contract. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">The programming experts adopt different approaches to this period. Mr PallesClark takes different periods to analyse and concludes that the absence of the water treatment plant critically delayed the Works from 22 September 2010 to 10 February 2011 and then that the re-design exercise and ramifications delayed the Works until the Contract was terminated finally on 20 August 2011. Mr Crane‟s analysis takes 3 sub-periods and identifies different causes of delay, 24 December 2010 to 9 January 2011 (Christmas closure), 10 January to 4 February 2011 (contaminated standing water) and 5 February to 23 May 2011 (re-design and absence of an operational water treatment plant). As will be seen above, I do not accept much of either of these analyses. Mr Palles-Clark‟s attribution of delay to the absence of the water treatment plant as from 22 September 2010 to 10 February 2011 is unrealistic and theoretical. Although there was internal recognition by OHL in an e-mail of 22 September 2010 that it would be unable to commence “work on the tunnel‟s upper slab until we know whether the pumping and well system we have contracted is adequate for carrying out hydrocarbon and/or heavy metal decontamination” given “the need to drawdown the groundwater level”, and although OHL took an inordinately long period to procure an appropriate water treatment plant, work on diaphragm wall panels (both construction and cutting down) continued until the suspension on 23 December 2010. Particularly, the cutting down work was critical, albeit slow. The absence of a water treatment plant did not as such delay the work until the suspension, which intervened critically at that time. The suspension on 23 December 2010 was the dominant and indeed only cause of delay as from that time, albeit that it led into the re-design period. One could say that, since the irreversible decision to re-design was taken by OHL on about 4 February 2011, the re-design intervened or took over as a separate dominant cause of delay as from that time, although I tend towards the view that it is unnecessary to subdivide suspension and re-design as both were or at least became parts of the strategy of OHL as it developed. As for the contaminated standing water giving rise to separate delay from 10 January to 4 February 2011, this is also unrealistic because, although there was extensive ponding and the ponded water was contaminated, some diaphragm wall cutting down did take place during this period and the real cause of delay was the suspension and re-design with OHL unwilling to restart in earnest pending anticipated commercial negotiations and a gathering internal view that re-design would for one reason or another be the appropriate way forward.  </p>

It is theoretically possible but unlikely that there was no strategy and it is almost inconceivable that OHL‟s board and senior directors were not in receipt of reports and were not involved in consultations about what to do about the very grave commercial and practical problems on this project, about the open-ended suspension and then the decision to re-design. If there was no such strategy and the senior directors were not being properly consulted, the project was proceeding in a rudderless fashion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">The experts are agreed that the re-design was at least a critical cause of delay from the first half of February until 23 May 2011. Given OHL‟s (arguably strange) expressed reluctance to restart work and Mr Hernandez‟ direction to his staff that no further tunnel work would start until AIP and TAA approvals were secured and given that the tunnel work was critical, the tunnel re-design was the primary or dominant cause of delay. I do not accept Mr Crane‟s view that the water treatment plant was a concurrent cause of delay or at least of anything like the same causal potency as the redesign process adopted by OHL. The only arguable concurrency was in relation to the 3 day period from 20 May to 23 May 2011 after the AIP and until the water treatment plant was finally operational but TAA approval was not obtained until a few days later (on 31 May 2011) and so OHL had committed itself in any event not to restart until then. Of course, even if the absence of an operational water treatment plant was a critical cause of delay in May 2011, there was no entitlement to extension of time and particularly over the minimum 8 days prior to 23 May 2011 when the reason for the plant not being operational was the breakage of the sample bottles which prevented this state of affairs occurring by 15 May 2011.  </p>

This was going to be critical work and starting at least a few weeks before the water treatment plant was capable of being used in practice would have meant that there was a significant part of the precutting down excavation work done. This is another reason why the absence of the water treatment plant was not critical during this period.  </p>

This involved a huge saving to it because, without the instruction from the Engineer of 22 December 2010, OHL would have had to dispose of all the material itself; although the clean material (at least that below the made ground) would probably have been found a home in Gibraltar, much of the rest would have had to be exported to Spain at a considerable cost. Whilst I accept that, in the run up to the last week in May 2011, OHL‟s site based staff must have seen that Aerial Farm was and had for some weeks been largely occupied by others, I do not accept that OHL would, did or should have known that it would not be made available when required thereafter. </p>

Whilst I do accept that OHL would then reasonably have needed time to make other arrangements to address these arisings, the reality is that it did nothing to do so before the termination. Many thousands of cubic metres of excavated materials had been removed from site in the period covered by the Stockpile Agreement in the July to September 2010 period and the arrangements had all been made by OHL; OHL used Gamasur to do this and the operation had gone well. GOG had been able to secure a substantially reduced price shortly after September 2010 for this as well. There is no reason to believe anything other than OHL, if it had had the will to do so, could have set up such arrangements within a few weeks at the outside. This belated instruction of 1 June 2011 therefore need not have delayed work in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">Any such delay would and reasonably could have been reduced to no more than several weeks if OHL had done what they did prior to the Stockpile Agreement which was initially to stockpile arisings from the excavations necessary to achieve the cutting off down to the formation level of the tunnel roof. In OHL‟s March 2011 programme, it had allowed 70 working days (or 3.18 calendar months) for breaking down the diaphragm walls and related excavation (from the middle of Month 2 to the middle of Month 5) and further excavations to tunnel roof formation level of 29 working days (or 1.32 calendar months) from the first week </p>

The next programmed critical work involved the placing of precast beams and shuttering boards to enable the tunnel roof work to go ahead starting in the fourth week of Month 6. Therefore, excavation work requiring necessarily disposal from the site was to run over 4 months and one week. Mr Doncel had estimated albeit in October 2010 (see the Chronology above) that some 22,000m³ of excavation arisings would be the product of the cut-off excavations (12,000m³) and further excavations of diaphragm walls (10,000m³); whilst that estimate would need to be increased for the tunnel excavations down below the tunnel roof formation level to reflect the revised design, it is unlikely that the cut-off excavations would have been dramatically increased. Some of the cut off excavations had been done prior to the suspension and some in January and February 2011. Therefore, if OHL had started to make arrangements to dispose of the excavations on a permanent basis, it could have worked for some weeks stockpiling the cut-off excavation arisings on site, thus enabling the work to progress effectively and then, reasonably seamlessly, the removal of the stockpiles and newly excavated materials could have started following the securing of appropriate arrangements. OHL was in any event for part of this period stockpiling excavated material from the MOD diversion work. Even if one was looking at 30,000 to 40,000m³ or even 60,000m³ arisings spread over the 18 weeks of programme time, one would be allowing on average 1,700 to 2,200m³ or 3,300m³ of excavated material a week. This spread over say even 6 weeks would total somewhere between 10,200m³ and 19,800m³ which could have been readily stockpiled on site pending arrangements to remove the material; as indicated earlier, the period for making arrangements would have been significantly less than this.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">There was heated discussion during the trial as to how much in quantity terms of stockpiled material the site could accommodate in the June to August 2011 period. For the reasons given above, this matters little as there was certainly room to accommodate all that could realistically be expected to be excavated in June 2011. There was however room for well over 15,000m³ of stockpile if there had been a will to go down that route. Mr De La Paz identified up to 7 or 8 places where material could be deposited but he was cross-examined to the effect, and he accepted, that some of these were small areas and some of them already had arisings from the MOD diversion work. Given the criticality of the excavation work, I have formed the view that OHL, if it had truly wished to get on with the work, would have found a way and space to stockpile substantial quantities of excavated material. Of the areas identified by Mr De La Paz, the most likely one to yield a substantial amount of space was at the northern end of the site along the line and just north of the proposed east-west dual carriageway line; it was the tunnel work which was critical and, even if the part of the line of the proposed dual carriageway and the area beside it was covered with arisings, it did not matter.

The concerns were not allayed so far as I can ascertain up to the time of termination. There is no suggestion that the attempts being made to secure agreement from Donaldsons were in some way slowed down to reflect the escalating steps towards termination which had started with the Clause 15.1 Notices in mid-May and early July 2011 or even by the termination notice letter of 28 July 2011. </p>

This letter relates to rock encountered on 18 May 2010 at Chainage 794 at the northern end of the site and talks about all rock to be encountered, saying: “In our opinion the excavation of all rock will entitle us to an extension of time…” Further site investigation was done as to rock levels with Sergeyco being deployed and a report being provided to the Engineer dated 6 July 2010 as to proposed changes to the proposed work. I do consider that the letter of the 14 July 2010 was a “claim” as such, albeit that it was widely drawn.

OHL also relies on a letter dated 10 January 2011 to the Engineer which refers to the December rainfall which it says has flooded the site and thus “come into contact with the contaminated ground…and we are unable to discharge this rainfall from site…In our opinion the foregoing will entitle us to an extension of time…” That is not a notice of claim about being delayed by weather actually whilst working in December 2010 (so to speak by the rain actually falling), which is what the 6 days allowed relates to; the letter relates to future delay caused by the effect and impact of weather on the contaminated material on site. OHL was actually delayed in critical work in late November and early December 2010 by the unusual weather and OHL failed to give notice of this within 28 days of becoming aware, or of when it should have become aware, of it. It would have been a good notice for any critical delay caused or to be caused by the contaminated ponded water, but there was no critical delay caused by ponding, as the suspension and then re-design were then the causes of delay. </p>

This ground can be and is contractually distinguished from the other grounds, such as Clause 15.2(c)(i) (failure “to proceed with the Works in accordance with Clause 8”, that is in effect often a failure to proceed with “due expedition and without delay”). One can ask rhetorically: why have the ground of the “intention not to continue performance of [contractual] obligations” as well as failure to proceed with due expedition and without delay unless they are or at least can be two separate grounds? </p>

In that sense, the Contractor is given the chance to avoid termination whilst the simple termination for any breach can come out of the blue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">Clauses 15.1 and 15.2(c) must as a matter of common sense pre-suppose that the Contractor is given the opportunity by the Employer actually to remedy the failure of which it is given notice under Clause 15.1. In that context, termination could not legally occur if the Contractor has been prevented or hindered from remedying the failure within the specified reasonable time. This stems from a necessarily implied term that the Employer shall not prevent or hinder the Contractor from performing its contractual obligations; there is also almost invariably an implied term of mutual co-operation. If therefore the Engineer has served a Clause 15.1 notice to remedy a breach of contract, and to the extent that the Employer hinders or prevents the Contractor from remedying the breach, the Employer could not rely on the Contractor‟s failure in order to terminate the Contract. This is because the Employer should not be entitled to rely on its own breach to benefit by terminating (see for instance <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Alghussein Establishment v</span></p>

The unilateral and, as I have found, unjustified suspension had been in place since 23 December 2010 and OHL unilaterally had embarked on the re-design of the tunnel and in particular the roof and the excavation sequence, which as I have found was both unnecessary and unreasonable. It is inconceivable that OHL was not aware of the contractual and commercial risks both of the suspension and the redesign and, so it and its directors embarked on this risky course of action with their eyes open.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">Argument has been pressed by Mr White QC, forcefully, that OHL was quite entitled contractually to re-design. That is correct and indeed it had the right and obligation to design and it could not be forced to work to a particular design which it did not endorse save by way of a Variation Instruction from the Engineer. This design right needs to be seen in the context of other obligations, such as the need for OHL to proceed with appropriate expedition. The contractual risk was on OHL to complete the Works within the extended Time for Completion. It was not entitled in fact or contractually to any significant extension of time and so by mid-May 2011 it was not only almost 6 months late already but there was no realistic prospect of it finishing in less than a further 1518 months thereafter. What had happened here was that the re-design was an indulgence which OHL consciously or unconsciously allowed itself, primarily for what it perceived to be its commercial interests. One can test Mr White‟s point by a hypothetical example which is the Contractor repeatedly re-designing after securing previous AIPs for previous designs for the same work in circumstances </p>

In fact, on 6 May 2011 OHL had sent such a programme electronically to the Engineer. There was no complaint in the Notice that what was provided was inadequate, although Mr De La Paz e-mailed shortly after receipt to the effect that it was non-compliant because it did not have dates on. When one looks closely at the electronic programme sent on 6 May 2011, it does have dates on it and periods for different items of work; it seems that the programming experts in the case have had no difficulty in reading and understanding it.

Purportedly, the suspension was resolved upon for health and safety grounds and upon the basis of the recommendation in and conclusion of the Himalaya report dated 15 December 2010. There was no material risk to health and safety of workers or others on or around the site, provided of course that sensible measures were taken to remove or reduce the risk to safe proportions. Thus, as was accepted by the experts, the re-design and the suspension which preceded it were not necessary and, as I have found, not reasonable. The tunnel work could and should have proceeded on the basis of the already approved tunnel designs. As found above, the hydrocarbon contaminants in the ground would not have affected the operation with forced ventilation (already planned) and other usual protective measures whilst the lead contamination could easily have been addressed by damping down the excavations to suppress the dust which would otherwise have spread the lead, even if, following a targeted site investigation, the contaminants had not been removed before the tunnel roof had been laid and the internal excavations started.

No competent contractor in OHL‟s position would have suspended work on the basis of the Himalaya report. I do not consider that OHL had any real regard for the health and safety of its workers in this regard because, if it had done so, it would have suspended the excavation-type works at the latest in September 2010. What drove OHL was the commercial considerations, which I can understand (albeit there was no lawful or contractual justification for it), which involved bringing about some commercial resolution on the project. The suspension was primarily designed to help bring about such resolution. This step and the later re-design were however commercially, contractually and factually dangerous steps to take, as the senior project management and senior staff of OHL must have known. Unfortunately, GOG was not prepared to “play ball”. The suspension was a breach of contract because it was bound to lead to and immediately re-started further critical delay. </p>

There was nothing to stop OHL reverting to its original and approved design or, even if it wanted to persist in its re-design, to get on with what was by mid-May 2011, and had been since the suspension the next critical work, namely the breaking down or cropping of the now completed diaphragm walls. OHL had approval at least for excavating and cropping of the diaphragm walls down to the originally approved design level; the Engineer was seeking to encourage OHL to get on with this. OHL was therefore failing to proceed with due expedition and without delay in accordance with Clause 8.1. </p>

What OHL was called upon to do was to “resume tunnel excavation work” and “proceed with the cropping and repairs to the diaphragm walls unaffected by standing water” by 30 May 2011. “Resume” means and meant effectively re-start. The detailed design was approved sufficiently and the AIP was due and was provided 4 days later. If the AIP had not been provided well within this initial 14 day period, it might have been more arguable that there was some prevention on the part of GOG which might have acted as a bar to termination on this ground but in the result this did not happen. If or to the extent that dewatering was going to be required once the groundwater level was reached in the excavation, the water treatment plant was going to be operational soon (as indeed turned out to be the case) on 23 May 2011; any surface water, although there was none or at worst little in the critical tunnel area, could be dealt with in the same way. All OHL needed to do to “resume” and “proceed with” this work was actively to deploy at least several labour teams and some excavation plant actually to re-start excavation and cropping of the walls; if there was no room on Aerial Farm, material could be stockpiled on the site at least temporarily.  </p>

This was needed to assist dewatering of the excavation for and the construction of the pedestrian subway which was to go on the east side of the tunnel and was outside the line of the eastern diaphragm wall. OHL had been for a considerable period trying to persuade the Engineer and GOG to accept a different design for the subway. The Engineer and GOG had not been really pressing OHL to get on with the subway or the related sheet piling work or complaining about the work not being done by this time before the Notice. OHL had provided a revised sheet pile design for the subway within the 20 April 2011 package for the tunnel re-design, this not being accepted until 11 May 2011. This revised design provided for different sized piles compared with the earlier design, both as to length as well in part as to gauge.  </p>

It seems that this work was not on the critical path in any event and it is therefore difficult to find that a deferment of the sheet piling until later would necessarily have led to any overall delay to the project and it can not be said that there was therefore a failure to proceed with due expedition and without delay. I would also have found that it had not been established that OHL was given a reasonable period to proceed with this work as it would have taken and was taking considerably longer to procure the re-designed sheet piles than the 14 days identified by the Engineer in the Notice. </p>

This work was a variation ordered in February 2009 and related to an installation off-shore to assist aircraft to land and possibly take off. It was to be piled and located off the western end of the runway and so it was well away from the tunnel and roadwork. OHL had stated in its proposal<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>that this work would be completed by 17 September 2009 and a Time for Completion of end of September 2009 was expressly recorded in Variation No. 1. Mr Doncel accepted that OHL knew that completion of the SALS was a priority for the Employer, this being, as Mr Nuitjen said in unchallenged evidence, because it was needed soon for international aviation standards compliance; there had been an incident in low visibility when an aircraft had mistaken street lighting for the airport runway lighting.  </p>

From largely unchallenged evidence, OHL told the Engineer through its progress reports in January and February 2011 that it would start this work in early May 2011. OHL was always aware that a specialist barge or ship would be needed for the trenching and laying of the cables and that, because the work would be done in Gibraltar waters, approval for the selected specialist vessel would have to be obtained from the Gibraltar Port Authority. It only approached the Port Authority on 4 April 2011 with a proposal that it use a Spanish vessel called the “Ardenza” but by 27 April 2011 OHL ran into a problem, because it was asked to show the Port Authority that it had approached local operators before acquiring the services of the Spanish vessel in order to obtain a dispensation from licensing. OHL told the Port Authority that it could not find an appropriate Gibraltar vessel. The Port Authority was sceptical about this response writing on 10 May 2011 asking OHL to produce: </p>

There was little exploration in evidence as to whether the Ardenza was immediately available to start by 6 June 2011. I should add that there has been no suggestion that GOG was leaning on the Port Authority to be difficult and indeed that is most unlikely given the urgency of the work.

OHL re-submitted it on 27 May 2011 for it only to be rejected by the Engineer, this time on 17 June 2011. There was no credible evidence that the Engineer was wrong to do so the second time round.

There was no evidence that there was any good excuse or even explanation as to why an acceptable method statement had not been produced by 16 May 2011. OHL had numerous comments from the Engineer which could have acted as a check list for OHL to work to; it had already done a fair amount of work, presumably knew what it wanted to do and had worked out how to do it.

For reasons which I have already given in the extension of time chapter above, OHL was in breach in this regard. This plant should have been in place and procured, as a minimum, many weeks before. Even on OHL‟s latest projection it should have been operational by 16 May 2011 and the latest problem (the breaking of the water sample bottles) was OHL‟s or their sub-contract consultant‟s responsibility and had delayed this beyond this date. It was perfectly reasonable to require, in the circumstances prevailing as at 16 May 2011 that the dewatering commenced by 30 May 2011 as it was obviously achievable and, indeed, it was operational by 23 May 2011. However, there was a continuing breach and non-compliance with the Notice as no dewatering actually started by or even on 30 May 2011. This is very much tied in with the other progress failures. </p>

The other two certificates related to the sheet pile design for the subway and the tunnel re-design. Essentially, OHL argues that it was not in breach as at 16 May 2011 in relation to these two certificates because contractually they were not to be provided until after the AIP had been approved by the Engineer (which did not occur until 20 May 2011) or until the AIP had been countersigned with TAA approval. This latter point is not a good one as work could proceed as soon as the Engineer issued the AIP as provided for in Paragraph 11(a) of Part 1 to Volume 3 of the Employer‟s Requirements.

There was however, unbeknown to the Engineer, an impending breach flowing from the belated instruction of Donaldsons by OHL on 4 May 2011 to start the certification exercise and Donaldsons‟ persistent unwillingness to sign off on the tunnel redesign but that was for the near future. This potential breach was not sufficient to found a complaint of actual breach at this time. </p>

This arose out of the non-compliance by OHL with Engineer‟s Instruction No 20 issued on 16 June 2011. Based on the facts, I accept that what sparked Mr De La Paz‟s instruction was the uncovering of one or two wall panels with apparent defects during the MOD diversion works. Mr White QC made great play that EI 20 and the later Clause 15.1 Notice were part and parcel of a long established strategy to terminate the Contract on the part of GOG. As indicated elsewhere, I have no doubt that GOG had recognised as from early 2011 that termination might occur and, doubtless, that recognition became firmer as 2011 went on. By mid-June 2011, there had been little or no practical response from OHL to the first Clause 15.1 Notice. I have no doubt that Mr De La Paz in broad terms initiated EI 20 and that, in relation to the second Clause 15.1 Notice which followed, there was some involvement, probably in the drafting, on the part of GOG and its legal team. Similarly I have no real doubt that the second Notice was intended in effect as a test to encourage OHL to get on and do some work. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">There is, rightly, no real suggestion that the Engineer was not entitled to issue EI 20 and there can be no suggestion that the Contractor should not have complied with it. That instruction called for works to be done by 23 June 2011, namely the excavation and exposure of 20 panels. OHL did not do any work and did not even respond until 24 June 2011. The explanation is given as to why OHL could not do this work until a stockpile area was provided for the excavated and probably contaminated material uncovered. For reasons given elsewhere, this explanation was unjustified: in any event OHL had room to stockpile the relatively limited quantities of excavated material on the site. This excavation was in any event work which needed to be done to start the cropping of the diaphragm walls. The Clause 15.1 Notice which followed on 5 July 2011 was issued when no work had been done to comply with EI 20. In one sense, the motivation of the Engineer and GOG in and about the issue of this second notice is not relevant, unless possibly it was shown to be in bad faith. It would not be bad faith to issue any such notice if it was justified under the Contract, even if it was issued in circumstances in which the Engineer and GOG believed that it would not be complied with and, if not, termination might, could or would thereafter follow. It could not have been issued if by the time of this second Notice OHL had started in earnest doing the work which it had been instructed to do by EI 20. In my judgment, the Engineer was entitled to issue this second Notice as not only had OHL not complied with it but </p>

It made a fairly good effort to comply with it, albeit belatedly, between 13 and 21 July 2011, without encountering any great problems and this therefore demonstrates in practice that it could have been complied with. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">It is then necessary to consider the extent to which the two Clause 15.1 Notices were or were not complied with. In the light of my earlier findings, it is only necessary here to consider the Clause 8.1 breaches involved in the suspension and the failure to resume the cutting and repairing of the outer diaphragm walls, the failure to provide an appropriate method statement, the dewatering and the failure to comply with EI 20. The reality is that nothing was done by OHL with regard to the cropping of the diaphragm walls and the related excavation works. There was, as I have found, no good reason why OHL did not resume this work. There was and continued to be room to stockpile a fair quantity of excavated material on this site. In any event, following the removal of Aerial Farm from OHL, there had been plenty of time to make arrangements for the removal of excavated material from the site and, no later than the end of June 2011, these arrangements could realistically have been in place if OHL had resolved to go down that route. The water treatment plant was up and running from 23 May 2011. No adequate explanation has been offered as to why an appropriately revised method statement could not have been provided; there is no such explanation. There was continued non-compliance up to the date of termination in this regard. The real reason for, and indeed the true cause of, the continuing delay was in fact that OHL was unable to secure the Category 3 Certificate from Donaldsons; there was a very real problem with the stability of the revised tunnel design which, justifiably or not, Donaldsons were not prepared to sign off on. Either way, this was the risk and the fault of OHL. By the time of the termination, there was no end in sight for the resolution of this problem. It is unlikely that OHL disclosed to the Engineer in any detail or at all what was going on in this regard; at best, OHL had on several occasions indicated that the Category 3 certificate was virtually on the way.  </p>

Certain defects were uncovered and reported on to the Engineer but OHL had not been prepared to dig down below the ground water level. The precise detail of compliance was not fully investigated at the trial and, if this had been the only item upon which the termination was based, I would not have found that there was sufficiently significant non-compliance with the scope of the instruction; in this context, I bear in mind that there was evidence that the Engineer actually instructed, whilst these works were going on various changes to EI20 and accepted some departures as acceptable as recorded by OHL. There was however, clearly, non-compliance with the time period given in the second Clause 15.1 Notice in that there was no good reason why it was not complied with within the seven-day period referred to; OHL had had some 2½ weeks to comply with EI 20 and had not done so and there was no good reason not physically to have got on with and completed the instructed works within seven days of the second Notice. The relevance of this is that it was further evidence that OHL was not committed to pursuing work with any expedition or at best was committed to doing the minimum in effect that it thought that it could get away with. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:1.24in">I have addressed elsewhere the limited impact which the withdrawal by GOG from OHL of Aerial Farm on the ability of OHL to work in the June to July 2011 period. Considerable reliance is also placed by OHL on the suggested impact of the Engineer‟s letter of 8 June 2011. It is suggested that this was all part of GOG‟s strategy to bring about a termination. It is clear however from the surrounding documentation that the point made in this letter had only really been thought about within a few days, at most, before the letter was written. Undoubtedly, as I have held elsewhere, a significant part of the concern related to the possibility that, if there was to be a termination and if OHL had by the date of termination left substantial quantities of material in stockpiles on site it would be difficult to differentiate between what was contaminated and not contaminated. The terms of the letter should have been relatively uncontroversial, calling as they did simply for compliance by OHL with its own CEMP. The letter was written in the context of the excavations then being carried out by OHL on the MOD drainage diversion works and simply contains a statement that the Engineer expected OHL to do exactly what its CEMP itself called for, the final version of which have been issued only three months before. It is also clear that an equally significant part of the concern of the Engineer stemmed from the incompetent way in which the MOD drainage diversion works were being carried out. Mr De La Paz also said in evidence that he was concerned that, if there was a valid "Unforeseeable" claim, then a failure to segregate the material would lead to unnecessary disposal costs. There were therefore a number of motivations behind this letter which were legitimate on any count. </p>

If OHL ever was seriously to have resolved to re-start excavation work for the diaphragm wall cropping related work, its need to comply with its own CEMP should not have hindered or prevented it from starting that work in earnest. The same quantities of material, either contaminated or not, were going to be excavated and, in simple terms, all that would happen is that following segregation, assuming that that was possible and practicable, there would be two sets of piles of contaminated and uncontaminated or (to borrow the wording from the CEMP) inert waste soils and other waste categories. In any event, the letter was not written in prescriptive terms, and, therefore, OHL could simply have removed anything from site and disposed of it without segregating it. </p>

Thus, a few days delay in the context of a two year contract would not justify termination on the Clause 8 ground and an unwillingness or even refusal to perform relatively minor obligations would not justify termination on the "intention not to continue" ground. </p>

The prospects did not objectively look good either as at this date. There was again an impasse over what to do with the excavated materials from site with GOG saying (correctly at that stage) that it was OHL‟s contractual responsibility to make the appropriate arrangements and OHL saying (wrongly) that the problems such as contaminated land and water were not its responsibility and in effect that it was up to GOG to sort out arrangements for the disposal of contaminated material. </p>

None of these were realistic by this stage. OHL in its letter of 13 July 2013 to GOG did say that it remained “committed, subject to our right to extension of time…and additional payments under the Contract” but went on to say that due to “the affected aquifers, the presence nearby of a special area of conservation and the actual contaminated conditions…it is not in our view prudent to continue with the works following our planned designs and building methods”. It then called for a hydro-geological study as “necessary” but that GOG was responsibility to undertake it.
