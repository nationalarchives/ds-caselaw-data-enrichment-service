In the event, I decided that a sub-contract had been agreed between Taylor Woodrow and Biwater and that it was in the so-called “Yellow Book” form of sub-contract.  Strictly speaking, the sub-contract had not actually been in the “Yellow Book” form, although it was convenient to refer to it as such.  However, for the avoidance of doubt, the expression “the Yellow Book form of sub-contract” is a reference to the “<span style="font-style:italic">Biwater Model Form of Conditions of Sub-Contract for Process Plants, December 1997, Rev. O</span>”, provided to Taylor Woodrow by Biwater on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 1999 with amendments: see my judgment in this Preliminary Issue dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2003 (“the Sub-contract Preliminary Issue”) <span style="font-style:italic">passim</span>.</p>

At that stage, Taylor Woodrow and Biwater were separately represented and delivered separate openings.  After the openings, the hearing was adjourned until 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.  By the time it resumed, Taylor Woodrow and Biwater had reached a settlement between themselves, the terms of which were set out in a formal written agreement (“the settlement agreement”) to which a schedule was attached.</p>

That obligation extended to pursuing the counterclaims that Taylor Woodrow had maintained against Yorkshire Water.  Furthermore, by Clause 2.1 Taylor Woodrow admitted the Biwater counterclaim against Taylor Woodrow, but Biwater in turn agreed to release Taylor Woodrow in relation to any part of that counterclaim which was not established against Yorkshire Water.</p>

However, there are some outstanding issues between Taylor Woodrow/Biwater and the Second Part 20 Defendant (“Elga”) with regard to the settlement agreement.  As a result, it has been agreed that any necessary further argument/submissions by those particular parties on that aspect of the matter should be left over until all other issues in the case have been decided (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 35/29</span>).</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At this stage, it is convenient to note that, as already indicated, Taylor Woodrow itself has made a counterclaim against Yorkshire Water that, broadly stated, consists of the following two elements: (i) various claims for outstanding amounts said to be due from Yorkshire Water to Taylor Woodrow and (ii) a claim that passes on Biwater’s claim against Taylor Woodrow (also brought in these proceedings) for an extension of time together with various claims for additional and outstanding amounts said to be due from Taylor Woodrow to Biwater.  Finally, Elga has a counterclaim against Biwater for £101,894.55, which largely consists of the agreed outstanding balance of its subcontract price, less retention.  I will turn to consider these various additional claims at an appropriate stage after I have dealt with my findings and conclusions with regard to the principal claim in the main action, i.e. Yorkshire Water’s claim against Taylor Woodrow. </p>

The Construction Completion Report has to state that the Plant is in such a physical condition that pre-operation take-over tests can be carried out safely. Thereafter Taking Over of the Plant by the Purchaser and final Acceptance by the Purchaser depend on assessment of performance as demonstrated by testing. By reference to the individual clauses, after physical construction works are completed (Clause 33) take over tests and procedures are carried out to gauge whether or not the Contractor is entitled to hand over the Plant; Clause 34 and Schedule 6. After Take-Over, the Purchaser has possession of the Plant and he carries out performance tests to check how well the Plant is operating; Clause 35 and Schedule 7. Following successful Performance Tests an Acceptance Certificate is issued (Clause 37.2). </span>

Take Over having taken place, the Contractor has limited rights of access; for example, to supervise performance tests (Clause 35.3) and then to make adjustments (Clause 35.6); or to make good any Defects notified under Clause 36.1.

Mr Elliott accepted that a defect in the Plant might amount to a “material breach”, entitling the Employer to determine the Contract under Clause 41.2 (c), but he emphasised that Yorkshire Water had chosen not to go down that particular route in this case and submitted that Yorkshire Water was, thus, still contractually bound by the restrictions contained in Clause 44.2.</p>

He pointed out that it was only once the point was taken in the pleadings served by Taylor Woodrow, Biwater and Elga that Yorkshire Water had amended the Claim Form and its Particulars of Claim to delete the claim for damages for breach of contract and to substitute for it the present contractual claim for<span style="font-style:italic"> “Payment of all sums due under the terms of the Contract… </span>”: see paragraph 450 below, the Amended Claim Form and the terms of paragraph 1 of the Amended Prayer.  </p>

As Mr Elliott pointed out (correctly, in my view), that is a very different process from having to prove the amount of damages to which Yorkshire Water would be entitled as compensation for such foreseeable damage as has been caused by the various alleged breaches of contract.  On behalf of Taylor Woodrow/Biwater, Mr Streatfeild-James QC supported and adopted all the foregoing submissions by Mr Elliott. </p>

As a result, hydraulic forces cause sludge to enter the removal pipework more rapidly than the sludge can flow into the vicinity of the outlet, a void forms in the sludge layer and is immediately filled with dilute sludge from the region directly above the outlet.  Eventually, a volume (sic) in the shape of an inverted cone is formed which makes a direct connection (known as a “rat hole”) into the region of dilute sludge.  As a result, the concentrated sludge layer then remains intact and only dilute sludge is removed (a process known as “rat-holing”).</span>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Insofar as Sub-Clause 35.10 makes provision for the Purchaser’s entitlement to Liquidated Damages under Schedule 10 (“the liquidated damages regime”), it does so on the basis of the taking and evaluation of the relevant performance tests (i.e. those tests that come within the “liquidated damages regime”: see below).  In my view, the expression “…<span style="font-style:italic">does not pass</span>…” must be construed accordingly.  Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that the contractual obligation to carry out the performance tests rests firmly on the Purchaser.  If the words “<span style="font-style:italic">does not pass</span>” were to be given the wider meaning for which Yorkshire Water contended, this could produce the bizarre result of a Purchaser being able to claim liquidated damages from a Contractor, in circumstances where the fact that the Plant had not been tested during the relevant period was due entirely to the Purchaser’s own breach of the obligation to carry out the necessary performance tests.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, my answer to the first part of this question is that Yorkshire Water does not have an entitlement to recover liquidated damages under sub-clause 35.10 if no performance tests were carried out under Clause 35.  It is common ground that, at the date these proceedings were amended and reissued (i.e. 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002), no performance tests had been carried out (see below).  It therefore follows that Yorkshire Water does not have any relevant right of recovery under sub-clause 35.10.</p>

In my view, the express wording of sub-clause 35.10 makes it clear that it applies only to those performance tests that come within the liquidated damages regime, i.e. it applies only to those performance tests in respect of which there is provision for “liquidated damages” under Schedule 10 if the performance test in question is taken and failed (i.e. not passed).  The express words of Schedule 10 also make it clear that the liquidated damages regime does not apply to the absolute guarantees (including TP1, TP2, TP9 and TP11(b)), which therefore do not come within the provisions of sub-clause 35.10.  However, if I am wrong about that and sub-clause 35.10 does apply in the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the outcome of these proceedings remains wholly unaffected, for reasons that will become apparent later in this judgment.</p>

Of course, in order to establish that entitlement, it will be necessary for Yorkshire Water to prove, by some means other than by showing that the Plant failed the relevant performance tests, that Taylor Woodrow was “<span style="font-style:italic">unable to meet the requirements of Schedule 7</span>” in respect of the relevant absolute guarantees within the relevant time scale.

In the case of the absolute guarantees, this is achieved by limiting the recoverable costs to such costs as the Purchaser has actually incurred.  In the case of the other guarantees, calculation of the liquidated damages depends on ascertaining the relevant unit costs for use in the applicable formula: see paragraph 41 of Mr Elliott’s written closing submissions.</p>

By the time the Purchaser can claim his costs from the Contractor in respect of an absolute guarantee, he will do so for a sum certain, namely the “<span style="font-style:italic">actual costs incurred</span>”.  The claim will thus be for a liquidated contractual debt and, as such, consistent with the heading to the Schedule and “the liquidated damages regime” in respect of the other Schedule 10 guarantees.

To a greater or lesser extent, depending on the subject matter, they will wish to be informed of what may variously be described as the context, the background, the factual matrix or the mischief.  To seek to construe any instrument in ignorance or disregard of the circumstances which give rise to it or the situation in which it is expected to take effect is in my view pedantic, sterile and productive of error.  But that is not to say that an initial judgment of what an instrument was or should reasonably have been intended to achieve should be permitted to override the clear language of the instrument, since what an author says is usually the surest guide to what he means.  To my mind construction is a composite exercise, neither uncompromisingly literal nor unswervingly purposive: the instrument must speak for itself, but it must do so in situ and not be transported to the laboratory for microscopic analysis.”</span> (per Bingham M.R.)</p>

But Mr Eder went further and said that, if the meaning of the words is clear, as he submitted it is, the purpose of the contractual provisions cannot be allowed to influence the court’s interpretation.  That involves the process of interpretation in the fashion of a black-letter man.  The argument assumes that interpretation is a purely linguistic or semantic process until an ambiguity is revealed.  That is wrong.  Dictionaries never solve concrete problems of construction.  The meaning of words cannot be ascertained divorced from their context.  And part of the contextual scene is the purpose of the provision.  In the field of statutory interpretation the speeches of the House of Lords in Attorney-General v. Prince Ernest of Hanover … showed that the purpose of a statute, or part of a statute, is something to be taken into account in ascertaining the ordinary meaning of words in the statute: …it is important to bear in mind that the purpose of the statute is a permissible aid at all stages in the process of interpretation.  In this respect a similar approach is applicable to the interpretation of a contractual text.  That is why in Reardon Smith Line Ltd v. Yngvar Hansen-Tangen …Lord Wilberforce, speaking for the majority of their Lordships, made plain that in construing a commercial contract it is always right that the court should take into account the purpose of a contract and that presupposes an appreciation of the contextual scene of the contract.” </span>(per Steyn L.J.)</p>

It was the reinsurers’ case that this was the natural meaning of the words used and that there was nothing in the context which required the words to be given any different meaning.

The general scheme or purpose of Schedule 10 is to make appropriate provision for the Contractor’s contractual liability and the Purchaser’s contractual entitlement under each “guarantee” to be in respect of a liquidated sum, calculated by reference to the costs actually incurred (in the case of recoverable costs under the “absolute” guarantees”) or by use of the relevant unit costs in the applicable formula for calculating liquidated damages (in the case of the other “guarantees”), and not involving any estimate or prediction of future costs: see paragraphs 56 to 58 above.</p>

Mr Slater submitted that, although the single overall defect was the Plant’s failure to produce effluent of the required quality, the overall defect was itself the product of a number of individual defects or deficiencies in the design and construction of the Plant (hereafter called “the individual deficiencies”), each of which required to be remedied in order to improve the overall performance of the Plant and achieve the necessary contractual standards.  He submitted that this was precisely what Yorkshire Water had endeavoured to do by carrying out the remedial works in question. Mr Slater submitted that neither the wording nor my answer to the Fourth Main Contract Preliminary Issue prevented recovery of the costs of remedial works under sub-clause 36.7, even if the works had not achieved a complete remedy, provided the works in question had gone some way towards making good the overall defect by dealing with some of the individual deficiencies.  Stated shortly, it was Mr Slater’s submission that sub-clause 36.7, when properly construed, permits recovery of costs incurred in carrying out remedial works that have the effect of <span style="font-weight:bold">partly </span>making good the overall defect: see paragraph 41 of Yorkshire Water’s closing submissions.

In those circumstances, to the extent that any of the deficiencies alleged in the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April letter might have been successfully addressed by any of the remedial works carried out to date, the deficiency in question has only been remedied in part because the SBR, as presently constituted, is unable to achieve fully the required contractual performance standards.  On that basis, Yorkshire Water’s remedial costs are still not recoverable under sub-clause 36.7, having regard to my existing answer to the Fourth Main Contract Preliminary Issue and my reasons for that answer.  However, I accept that this conclusion is entirely academic, having regard to my conclusion (the reasons for which I explain later in this judgment) that times the SBR was not defective as alleged (i.e. it was capable of meeting the contractual performance requirements at all material times).</p>

When considered in conjunction with my conclusion on Preliminary Issue 2 (see paragraphs 54 to 67 above), this particular conclusion does, of course, have a significant effect on Yorkshire Water’s entitlement to financial relief in these proceedings.  In effect, the consequence is that, so far as concerns its claim for the costs of remedial works, Yorkshire Water’s entitlement is limited to the cost of remedial works that have been carried out (i.e. its incurred costs, not its prospective costs).</p>

As I have already explained, Yorkshire Water deleted its original claim for damages for breach of contract at a very early stage of these proceedings and did so for good reason: see paragraphs 16 to 20 and 28 above.  Yorkshire Water’s claim is confined to its entitlement to financial recovery and liquidated damages pursuant to various specified terms of the main contract.  Accordingly, a claim for general damages has not been the subject of either evidence or submissions in these proceedings.  It is therefore neither possible nor appropriate for me to decide or even speculate as to what the position would have been, either as to liability or quantum, if any of Yorkshire Water’s many and various complaints about the SBR had been the subject of a claim for damages for breach of contract.   </p>

However, Mr Slater did not deal with any specific sub-clause 36.11 claim in either his written opening or closing submissions and there is no obvious reference to any such claim in respect of any latent defect in the sludge handling system in Yorkshire Water’s updated and amended Quantum Schedule (“the Quantum Schedule”).</p>

He suggested that, although the SBR was required to be capable of treating the design flows and loads on 5 tanks, it is clear from the wording and context of the paragraph in question that this was to be the exception rather than the rule.  Mr Streatfeild-James submitted (correctly, in my view) that the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">with one basin out of service</span>” suggests that the usual mode of operation would entail all 6 basins being in service.  He also made the telling point that, unlike other items in the Specification (e.g. the submersible pumps, the belt thickeners or the polyelectrolyte dosing pumps), the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> tank/basin of the SBR is not described in the Specification (or elsewhere) as a “<span style="font-style:italic">standby</span>” unit.  As to the latter point, Mr Streatfeild-James submitted that if what was required was a plant that would operate on 5 tanks, with one tank spare at all times, one would expect that to be spelled out clearly in the tender/contract documents, if for no other reason that that nobody would price the job on such a basis unless it was clearly spelled out.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was therefore Mr Streatfeild-James’ submission, supported by Mr Elliott, that the requirement that the SBR be capable of operating on 5 tanks was for the purpose of enabling necessary operations, such as the routine maintenance and/or repair of the SBR, to be carried out.  They therefore submitted that paragraph 0.2.6.3 of the Specification should be construed accordingly (i.e. that the SBR should be capable of operating on 5 tanks for such periods as would be required, from time to time, to carry out such necessary operations as routine maintenance and repairs).  It was also suggested that this construction entirely accords with the how the relevant obligation would normally be understood by experienced people in the wastewater industry (see, for example, paragraph 7.6.1 of the first report of Yorkshire Water’s expert, Dr Brian Chambers (“Dr Chambers”: <span style="font-style:italic">E1/32</span>), paragraphs 252-253 of the first report of Taylor Woodrow’s expert, Dr David Johnstone (“Dr Johnstone: <span style="font-style:italic">E2/53-54</span>) and paragraph 8.5 of the second report of Biwater’s expert, Dr Nigel Horan (“Dr Horan”: <span style="font-style:italic">E3A/tab 2/32</span>).  Furthermore, as Mr Streatfeild-James pointed out, that was how the Specification was understood at the time by the parties: see, for example, the evidence of Elga’s Head of Projects, Mr Derek Workman (“Mr Workman”), at <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 17/89</span>, the evidence of Biwater’s design process engineer, Mr William Dunn (“Mr Dunn”), at <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 19/146 and 151-152 and C7/358</span>  (see paragraph 177 below) and the evidence of Yorkshire Water’s Waste Water Technical Support Manager, Mr Jeffrey Holmes (“Mr Holmes”) at <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 4/82-83</span>, where he said this about a note that he had written at the time (<span style="font-style:italic">C15/253</span>), whilst emphasising that the plant should be capable of operating on 5 tanks for as long as was needed for such purposes:</p>

I accept that the extent and/or duration of the period of time for which the SBR might be required to operate with one tank out of service, to enable necessary operations such as maintenance and repair to be carried out, is not specified.  However, I cannot accept Mr Slater’s submission that that clause 0.2.6.3 of the Specification means that Taylor Woodrow was obliged to provide a 6 basin plant that was capable of operating indefinitely with one basin out of service as if it were, to all intents, a 5 basin plant with one basin on standby.  It is clear that the parties understood that the purpose of this provision in the Specification was to enable such necessary operations as maintenance and repairs to be carried out whilst the otherwise “<span style="font-style:italic">6 basin plant</span>” continued to operate.  In my view, Mr Streatfeild-James’s construction (see paragraph 95 above) is not only consistent with that proposition but it is also consistent with the general description of the Plant in question (i.e. “<span style="font-style:italic">a 6 basin SBR Plant</span>”) and consistent with the appropriate performance testing of significant contractual guarantees (i.e. power and water consumption: see Schedule 10, Guarantees TP 3 and TP 8: <span style="font-style:italic">B1/160-161</span>).  Furthermore, I am not persuaded that such a construction is in conflict with the passages in Taylor Woodrow’s tender proposals to which Mr Slater drew attention.  In my view, these did no more than state that the ability of the proposed Plant to operate with one basin out of service (whenever required to do so, but without specifying for how long) meant that it was likely to be able to improve the overall quality of the effluent from the Knostrop works when all tanks were actually in operation: see paragraphs 101 to 103 above.  I do not accept that these assurances carried any implied suggestion that the plant would be capable of being operated indefinitely with one basin out of service. </p>

The expression “BOD” is also used as an indicator of the readily biodegradable material or “food” for the bacteria that is contained within the sewage and is often used as a convenient term by which to refer to the biodegradable material itself.  In the United Kingdom and many other countries, the BOD of a particular sewage is established by measuring the amount of oxygen taken up during a laboratory test carried out over a period of five days at a temperature of 20C, in which the natural conditions in a river are simulated (“5-day BOD”).  5-day BOD is usually expressed as BOD<span style="font-size:8pt">5</span>.

Thus, if the sewage in question is found to have a BOD<span style="font-size:8pt">5</span> of 200mg/l that would mean that every litre of the sewage that is discharged to the river would remove a total of 200mg. of oxygen from the river over a five-day period.  However, not all the biodegradable material is necessarily oxidised in five days and there may well be a continuing (albeit, normally very small) oxygen demand after five days.  So it is that some other countries (e.g. in Scandinavia) conduct the BOD test over seven days (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 16/136</span>), which results in BOD values expressed as BOD<span style="font-size:8pt">7</span>.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Chemical Oxygen Demand (“COD”) is a more stringent measure of sewage strength.  The COD test utilises sulphuric acid and a temperature of 120C to speed up the reaction and is thus a much more exacting and more rapid process than the 5-day BOD test.  The COD test conditions are such that all the organic material in the sewage is converted to carbon dioxide, i.e. all readily biodegradable organic material together with all other organic material of a less or non-biodegradable nature.  Consequently, the value for COD in a particular sewage will always be significantly higher than for the BOD.  As the COD test measures the total organic fraction in the sewage and the BOD test measures only the organic fraction that is biodegradable, the COD:BOD ratio is a crude measure of the biodegradability of the sewage in question.  Thus the COD:BOD ratio is one that is widely used in the industry as a rough indication of the treatability of the sewage in question.  In broad terms, the higher the ratio of COD to BOD, the more difficult the sewage is to treat (see also paragraph 331 to 336 below). </p>

Once the sludge consisting of the detached/dead biofilm has settled to the bottom of the humus tank, the layer of clear wastewater that remains above the sludge can now be discharged to the watercourse as treated effluent.  The sludge from the bottom of the humus tank is then collected and combined with the sludge produced at the primary sedimentation stage (“the primary sludge”) for further treatment.

Instead, the mass of micro-organisms (known as “the biomass”) and the sewage are kept in intimate contact with each other in a tank that is continuously mixed and aerated (“the aeration tank”).  When mixed with the sewage in the aeration tank, the biomass undertakes exactly the same biological reactions that are carried out by the biofilm in an attached growth process.  The mixture of sewage and biomass is known as the “mixed liquor”.  The “Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids” (the “MLSS”) is the concentration of the suspended solids in the mixed liquor and is usually expressed in milligrams per litre of mixed liquor (mg/l).  The MLSS is an important design and operation variable in activated sludge processes.  Thus high values of MLSS concentration are normally required for nitrification to proceed effectively (<span style="font-style:italic">E3/79</span>).</p>

It is typically the case with a suspended growth system that some of the settled sludge is recycled to the aeration tank (“the return sludge”) with the remainder being removed (a procedure known as “wasting” the sludge) and combined with the primary sludge for further treatment.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Many sewage treatment plants use an “activated sludge” system for the biological treatment of wastewater.  As already indicated in what I have just said about suspended growth systems in general, all conventional activated sludge systems (e.g. the ASP at Knostrop) have the following essential features in common: (i) an aeration tank, in which the influent wastewater is treated by being mixed with the biomass and supplied with oxygen, thus enabling the bacteria in the bio-mass to oxidise the organic matter and ammonia: the mixture of wastewater and biomass being known as mixed liquor; (ii) a separate settling tank, in which the biomass (“the sludge”) is allowed to settle, thus separating it from the treated wastewater, which can then be decanted for further treatment or discharge; (iii) a system for recycling some of the sludge back to the aeration tank, or otherwise retaining it within the process and (iv) a sludge handling system for the removal of excess sludge (i.e. the process known as “sludge wastage”), so that the process can continue to operate under reasonably constant conditions (i.e. with stable MLSS levels).  It can therefore be seen that the sludge is a bi-product of the treatment process itself.  Ultimately the amount of the sludge will depend upon the BOD and TSS (Total Suspended Solids) loads that are being treated by the plant in question. The term “sludge yield” is used to describe the amount of sludge produced during the treatment process by reference to the amount of the BOD load treated.  Thus the sludge yield is the amount of sludge (in kg) produced per kilogram of BOD treated.  It is an important component in the sizing of the sludge handling system, since it allows a contractor to calculate how much sludge a sludge handling system will be expected to process.   </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The period of time for which the bacteria forming the sludge is allowed to reside in a suspended growth treatment plant (as opposed to being wasted/discharged) is called the sludge age.  Another way of describing what is meant by the expression “sludge age” is that it is the number of days’ growth of sludge that is retained as activated sludge.  If the sludge age is long, then slow-growing species of bacteria can maintain themselves within a more diverse population of resident species.  It is important to note that the bacteria which can convert ammonia into nitrates (i.e. the nitrifiers) comprise mainly species which grow slowly.  Accordingly, for the plant in question to achieve and maintain nitrification, a sludge age that is long enough to establish a sufficient resident population of nitrifying bacteria will be required.  Conversely, a sludge age that is too short will result in an insufficiency of nitrifiers and nitrification will not be achieved or will be lost.</p>

There are two standard laboratory tests used routinely at wastewater treatment plants to measure activated sludge settling properties and commonly referred to by their initials, namely SVI (Sludge Volume Index) and SSVI (Stirred Sludge Volume Index).  Both tests involve placing a sample of mixed liquor in a graduated cylinder and measuring the volume occupied by one gram of sludge after a 30-minute settling period.  The greater the volume occupied by a gram of sludge, the poorer its settleability.  The results obtained are therefore quoted as numerical values, high values being indicative of poor settleability.  SVI tests are simple to perform, but SSVI tests (which can be corrected or uncorrected), while more time consuming, are considered to be a better indication of the true settling properties of the sludge in question.  The operational difficulties resulting from poor sludge settleability are a common cause of effluent failures in activated sludge plants.  Poor sludge settlement (also known as “bulking sludge”) is nearly always associated with the presence of excessive numbers of microbes/bacteria that have a diffuse, filamentous structure.  Although these filamentous microbes can perform effective treatment, they do not settle as rapidly as the more desirable “flocculating” species, which are the types of bacteria that naturally combine into particles (known as “flocs”) that settle readily by gravity. </p>

Creating a high floc load is one of the main ways by which the flocculating bacteria are encouraged to predominate.  This is <span style="font-family:'Times New'">because a high floc loading ensures the maximum amount of food is available for the micro-organisms to “feast” on.  It is</span><span style="font-family:'Times New';color:#FF0000"> </span>achieved by the introduction of a “feast” of food (i.e. consisting of the biodegradable content of the sewage) to a relatively small proportion of the contents of the aeration tank (i.e. the bacteria forming the biomass/sludge) in a selector zone.  Many flocculating species are able, if food is present in excess, to take up the “food” rapidly (i.e. to “feast” on it) and to store it inside their cells, leaving it to be metabolised during the later aeration stage.  In this way the “food” ceases to be available to other species (particularly filamentous ones). The flocculating species can be further encouraged by an adequate supply of air to the selector zone (to allow absorption of the available food at the maximum rate) and elsewhere in the aeration tank (to allow the food to be metabolised).  </p>

Consequently, the usual floc promoting advantages of the full-scale “feast” conditions of a separate selector zone are somewhat diminished in such circumstances.  Furthermore, the combination of a lower F/M ratio and a filling stage that is almost entirely anoxic (see paragraph 147 below) means that the process conditions in a typical SBR can be very favourable to the growth of <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella </span>(see also paragraphs 140 above and 145 to 147 below).  </p>

It is in this zone that the main aeration takes place.  This enables the bacteria to metabolise the absorbed food.  Ideally, the flocculating microbes should break down all the absorbed food before they are returned to the selector zone.  The existence of feast/famine conditions in an activated sludge plant is generally considered to be essential for encouraging the development and dominance of the flocculating species of microbes, thus ensuring good sludge settlement.

In an SBR system the treatment operations are all carried out sequentially in the same tank on discrete batches of wastewater according to a timed sequence (hence the name “Sequencing Batch Reactor”).  The various treatment operations in an SBR are therefore separated temporally rather than physically, the latter being the usual arrangement in a conventional activated sludge plant (see paragraph 133 above).  The treatment of a continuous inflow of wastewater is only possible in an SBR system if more than one tank is installed in parallel, so that the influent can always be received by a tank that is ready to start the treatment cycle.  The total amount of treated effluent that is decanted and discharged from an SBR system each day must be equal to the total amount of wastewater that is admitted into the system.  Put another way, the number of decant events per day, when multiplied by the volume of each decant, must be equal to the total influent flowrate for that day. </p>

Generally speaking, the tank is filled under primarily anoxic conditions.  During this period the BOD within the influent is absorbed and stored by the microbes.  However, the bacteria are not able to metabolise this “food” until aerobic conditions are created within the tank by the addition of dissolved oxygen.  Aeration usually (but not always) commences late in the filling stage and continues into the next stage, which is (ii) the react or treatment stage.  After completion of the filling, the contents of the tank are or continue to be aerated for a given period.

In the absence of aeration, the suspension of activated sludge solids will gradually settle, leaving above it a layer of treated effluent.  As with the conventional activated sludge plant, good settlement of the sludge is crucial to the satisfactory performance of the process.  The layer of treated effluent is then removed during (iv) the decanting stage.  This usually involves the physical movement of mechanical equipment (known as “decanters”) through the layer of treated effluent towards the top surface of the settling sludge (known as the “sludge blanket”).  After the decanting stage, there is usually (v) an “idling” phase, while the tank waits to receive the next batch of influent.

On that basis, the project team (led by Ms Henderson) proceeded to prepare load information sheets, using assumed COD:BOD ratios.

Somewhat surprisingly, the GPSX modelling design exercise had predicted that an additional 17 ASP lanes would be required, as opposed to the 2 additional lanes that had been contemplated in the authorisation.  As a result, it was decided to change the overall contractual strategy and to adopt an “open” approach to a “Red Book” contract, with the contractor being allowed to assess the possible options (<span style="font-style:italic">C5/115</span>).</p>

Thus, although the USF/JetTech SBR had by then an established and successful record in the USA, neither Elga nor Biwater had any actual experience of the USF/JetTech SBR and, as Mr Streatfeild-James observed (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 30), USF/JetTech itself “<span style="font-style:italic">was zealous in the protection of its proprietary product</span>”.</p>

The calculations were duly submitted to Earth-Tech in early 1998 and considered by Ms Henderson, who was not at all satisfied with them.  One of the reasons for her concern was that, in the United Kingdom, it is regarded as good practice to design to an average flow that is taken to be 1.3 DWF (c.f. the position in the USA, see paragraph 172 above).  Ms Henderson was therefore worried that the Biwater mass balance calculations, in which average flow had been equated with DWF, would result in an under-designed plant (i.e. as I understand it, a plant with insufficient physical capacity to carry out treatment to consent standards at all specified flows and loads).</p>

In broad terms, it was Yorkshire Water’s case that the influent should have been introduced into each tank by means of an ID manifold (i.e. the USF/JetTech proprietary IDSC), so as to distribute the influent evenly across the bottom of each tank, where the activated sludge in the settled sludge blanket would be most concentrated, and with minimum disturbance of the sludge blanket, thus maximising the SBR’s selector capacity: see, for example, the first report prepared by Dr Chambers, dated March 2003, at paragraph 6.3.7, which is in the following terms (<span style="font-style:italic">E1/22</span>): </p>

The IDSC allows the influent wastewater to be admitted into the SBR in a uniform manner along the tank floor where the concentration of sludge will be highest.  The mixing action is gentle and excessive turbulence is avoided.  In my opinion, the IDSC is necessary to optimise whatever selector capacity exists during the SBR filling period.  The actual wastewater inlet consists of a vertical chute in the corner of each tank.  The wastewater is not brought into contact with the sludge in a uniform manner and the mixing is turbulent and localised.  I cannot accept that the selector capacity of the SBR is optimised, or even predictable, as a result of this inlet arrangement.</span>” </p>

It was also Yorkshire Water’s case that the significant disturbance of the settled sludge blanket, caused by the turbulence initiated by the dump fill process, resulted in an inevitable carry-over of solids whenever a fill/decant occurred – a problem that was compounded by the proximity of the decanter arms to each influent chute.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">During the process start up phase, influent is introduced in a manner that enables the process for the plant to be started.  For a sewage treatment plant which uses activated sludge, like the SBR at Knostrop, it is necessary to build up the biomass that will be used to treat the influent sewage over a period of time.  The amount of the biomass is measured in mg/litre as “mixed liquor suspended solids” (commonly abbreviated to “MLSS”: see also paragraph 134 above).  It is important to note that the MLSS is one of the 2 parameters (the other being the BOD load) that are used to control the F/M ratio and the sludge age (the sludge age being inversely proportional to the F/M).  Since it is not possible to control the BOD load in the influent to a plant, the only way of ensuring that a stable F/M ratio (or sludge age) is maintained is to control the in-basin MLSS.  As Dr Chambers conceded, if a plant is operated to the designed F/M ratio, it should work (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 27/17</span>). </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">At the process start up of an activated sludge plant like the Knostrop SBR, a specific target value for the MLSS is set, which is derived from the process design and is a function of the nature of the specified sewage influent.  The duration of the start up period is a direct function of the time required to build up the biomass to the prescribed level of MLSS and achieve full treatment.  However, broadly stated, the overall stability of the plant is dependent on both achieving and maintaining the appropriate MLSS levels required for the effective treatment of the sewage in question.  If the necessary MLSS levels are not achievable and/or cannot be maintained for whatever reason, the plant is regarded as unstable.  Once the target MLSS has been achieved and the plant is stable and producing effluent within the specified consent standards, the process take-over tests can be commenced.  The successful completion of these tests marks the end of the commissioning phase, at which point the plant is handed over to the client (<span style="font-style:italic">D3/125, paragraph 18 - 20</span>).

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As Mr Molloy observed (<span style="font-style:italic">D3/125, paragraph 21</span>), the commissioning phase is the phase during which the components of the plant and the process are tested to locate and iron out problems.  The failure of a plant to achieve the specified levels of effluent and/or to meet the relevant consent standards from time to time during the commissioning phase is an entirely normal part of making the plant operate properly.  Mr Molloy’s understanding was that the original target MLSS for the Knostrop SBR was 3,000 mg/l, based on the nature of the specified sewage influent (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 20/66</span>).  At one of the regular commissioning meetings held on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 1999, it was anticipated that the target MLSS would be achieved by day 38 (i.e. 38 days after the start of seeding). </p>

The influent flow was significantly lower than expected and, in early October 1999, an influent sampler was installed that led Biwater to believe that the influent BOD load being received by the SBR was also significantly different from that specified (<span style="font-style:italic">D3/131, paragraphs 51-52</span>).  In the year following take-over (i.e. November 1999 to December 2000) flows to the SBR ranged from 23.15 tcmd to 107.32 tcmd.  The average flow for the same period was 59.99 tcmd, compared with the suggested 85 tcmd (see paragraph 162 above and also paragraph 87 of Yorkshire Water’s Re-Re-Reamended Reply <span style="font-style:italic">A1/tab 5/45-47</span>).

In fact, the MLSS level that was being achieved at the time (approximately 2000 mg/l) was considered by Biwater to be more than adequate for the treatment of the influent at the flows and loads then being experienced (<span style="font-style:italic">D3/131, paragraph 53</span>).</p>

As Mr Molloy accepted, it is always necessary to achieve a satisfactory balance, so that the MLSS level is high enough to maintain nitrification during the winter, but not so high that it causes other problems such as an increased loss of solids in the decanted effluent.  </p>

Systematic and routine monitoring of the SBR is obviously an important aspect of its proper operation and performance. </p>

There is a dispute as to what caused this apparent loss of MLSS.  It was Yorkshire Water’s case and Ms Schofield’s evidence that it was the result of an inter-basin transfer of mixed liquors, i.e. that MLSS from basin 1 had escaped into basin 2.  It was suggested that this had resulted from the installation of a faulty gate-valve in the cross-connecting pipe between the two basins (the valve shutter had an inappropriate bevel on one side, i.e. the basin 2 side).  </p>

Even if the valve shutter design was unsatisfactory and the shutter did flex very slightly as a result (which is a possibility), I am satisfied that any resulting leakage would have been far too small to account for the apparent loss of MLSS in basin 1.  In any event, as Mr Streatfeild-James observed, the actual MLSS figures for basins 1 and 2 do not correlate in such a way as to support the suggested inter-basin transfer and appear to have varied a great deal from day to day (<span style="font-style:italic">Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 76(2)</span>).  </p>

Again, the reasons for that confusion are not important, so much as the fact that the confusion existed.  In my view, other than to say that this phenomenon (either then or later – see below) did not result from the unsatisfactory design of the gate-valve, it is not now possible to identify any particular reason for the apparent loss of MLSS from basin 1 during this period or when the inter-basin transfer of MLSS was suspected later in 2000 (see paragraphs 352 and 382 below). </p>

He referred, in particular, to an incident that occurred on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 1999, in which the decant valve in tank 2 had failed and had been left unattended, with the result that the tank had been out of operation from midnight until after 7am, when the problem was addressed and dealt with by Mr Gibson.  However, whilst I readily accept that the inexperience and lack of know-how of the Yorkshire Water operatives were a factor in the operational problems experienced with the SBR poor performance during this period, in my view they provide only part of the reasons for the SBR’s operational shortcomings during this period (as to which, see paragraphs 257-258 below). </p>

Various representatives from Yorkshire Water, Biwater/Elga and Earth-Tech attended the meeting, including Mr Holmes, Ms Schofield, Mr Coulthard, Dr Hemphrey, Dr Cannon, and Mr Molloy.  On behalf of Yorkshire Water, Mr Holmes made it clear that he was mainly concerned about the incidence of fill-decants, the fact that the decanters appeared to be clipping the sludge blanket at the end of the decant cycle (possibly as the result of a suction effect caused by the flow through the decanter orifices) and the need for longer term proposals for improving sludge settleability (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript Day 3/26-27</span>).</p>

Furthermore, the more significant representation of the Elga/Jet Tech personnel at these meetings (see e.g. the list of attendees at <span style="font-style:italic">C62/46</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>meant that the various discussions that took place had the important benefit of their specialised knowledge and experience (e.g. that of Mr Norcross).  Thus, although it was acknowledged that the sludge blanket was being “clipped” by the decanters (thus causing excessive levels or “carry-over” of solids in the effluent), it was Jet Tech’s advice that Yorkshire Water’s concern about decanter nozzle velocities and the possible suction effect on the sludge blanket was misplaced.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.49in">At the same time as seeking to allay Yorkshire Water’s concerns about the decanter nozzle velocities, Jet Tech also pointed out that the reported SVI levels were too high, thus indicating poor settlement of the sludge blanket.  In order to achieve an early (though not necessarily long term or permanent) solution to this particular problem, Elga advised that the period for sludge settlement should be increased and the MLSS levels reduced to 1600 mg/l by increasing the sludge wastage rates (<span style="font-style:italic">C62/43-45</span>).  In addition, Mr Norcross took samples of the MLSS back with him to the USA for microbiological analysis. </p>

As Mr Streatfeild-James observed (<span style="font-style:italic">Closing Submissions, paragraph 84</span>), the position that had been reached by the early part of February 2000 was that, notwithstanding Yorkshire Water’s continued serious misgivings about the design, performance and perceived shortcomings of the SBR, as expressed by Mr Holmes in particular (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 3/35-39 and C62/43-45</span>), Biwater/Elga/Jet Tech were confident that the plant could be stabilised relatively quickly and steps were being taken to analyse the available information, to provide operational support and to resolve anomalies/deficiencies in the operating manuals.</p>

In addition, there were other reasons that meant that the proposed Performance Test (which Yorkshire Water had hoped to commence on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February) would not be possible, i.e. the need to deal with the qualifications to the take-over certificate, the continuing problems with mechanical reliability and the need to install the fill-decant inhibit software (see paragraph 259 below).

This was one of Yorkshire Water’s most serious concerns by 12 January (Transcript, Day 3/26-27).  Those who witnessed them at the time noticed a correlation between fill decants and solids carry-over in the effluent at the end of a decant (C59/60) and a “severe and uncontrolled disturbance of settling sludge”: Schofield paragraph 80 (D1/220).  A significant number of the solids carry over events can thus be related to the occurrence of fill decants.</span>

Other defects such as air locks in the recirculation pumps were also witnessed to be causing solids loss (C62/1).  It is obvious that mechanical failures such as these would have hindered the performance of the SBR: indeed, Mr Holmes referred to their effect as being quite “brutal” (Transcript, Day 3/82).</span>

As Mr Holmes put it in the course of his evidence, “<span style="font-style:italic">there were a lot of interactions at the time</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 3/31</span>).

The most compelling evidence with regard to the presence and effect of <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella</span> in the Knostrop SBR at this early stage is that contained in a report prepared in February 2000 by Dr David Jenkins of Berkeley University (“the Jenkins’ report”), which indicated that there was sufficient <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella</span> present in two out of five tanks at the end of January 2000 to cause “<span style="font-style:italic">moderate settling problems</span>”: see paragraph 263 below.</p>

It was recognised that there was a serious problem with filamentous bacteria (including <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella</span>) at Adwick and that this was causing bulking sludge (i.e. poor sludge settlement), with resulting poor effluent quality. </p>

The contemporaneous microbiological reports prepared by Ms Schofield and a late-1999 monitoring exercise carried out by Dr Cannon had not revealed the presence of <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella</span> at Knostrop.  So it was that the continuing problem of solids carry-over events at Knostrop was still considered to be mainly linked to fill-decant events and to the decanting process itself, albeit in the context of a generally expressed concern about the need to improve sludge settleability at both plants (<span style="font-style:italic">C62/106</span>). </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.49in">During this period of the SBR’s operation, “fill-decant inhibit” software was installed and commissioned as part of the computerised control system in order to deal with the problem of fill-decants.  The result was that, whenever and for as long as a fill-decant was threatened, the incoming influent was diverted from the SBR to the high-level filters.  As a result of this particular measure being taken, fill-decants ceased to have the solids’ carry over effect that they had previously had, but at the cost of diverting the influent from the SBR and imposing an additional albeit insignificant burden (as it happens: see paragraph 381 below) on the high-level filters for the duration of each such diversion.  However, I accept Mr Streatfeild-James’s submission that the fill-decant/fill-decant inhibit issue is something of a red herring so far as concerns the central issue in these proceedings (i.e. whether Taylor Woodrow/the SBR were able to meet the Schedule 7 performance requirements).  Fill-decant events are a feature of the flexible software that controlled the operation of the SBR.  It was assumed that fill-decants would be very rare and Yorkshire Water was given assurances to that effect (see paragraphs 207-209 above).  In the event, there was a problem with fill-decants that was resolved by modifying the software so as to provide for fill-decant inhibits.  It is clear from Dr Cannon’s evidence that the volume of flow actually diverted between September 2000 and November 2001 as the result of fill-decant inhibits was only 1% of the total flow treated over the same period (see <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 22/63-64, 74 and exhibit “Elga 1”</span>).  I accept Dr Cannon’s evidence that additional changes to the software could have significantly reduced the frequency of fill-decant inhibits even further (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 22/64</span>).  In the event, it was common ground that no harm was actually caused to the high-level filters or the humus tanks as the result of SBR influent being diverted as a result of an fill-decant inhibit: see, for example, Dr Chambers’ evidence at <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 28/48</span>.  It is clear that fill-decant inhibits were relatively infrequent, usually of very short duration and triggered by occasional sudden, significant changes in flow.  I accept the evidence of Dr Cannon to the effect that fill-decant inhibits had an insignificant effect on the treatment capacity of the SBR.  There is therefore no evidence that provides any real support for the suggestion that fill-decant inhibits would have prevented the SBR from receiving and treating influent up to the maximum of 136 tcmd, whether it was being operated on 5 tanks or 6 tanks. Consequently, I am satisfied that the ability of the SBR to meet the Schedule 7 performance requirements was not diminished in any material respect by the modification to the control system to provide for fill-decant inhibits.</p>

There is enough Microthrix parvicella present in the SBR Tanks 5 and 6 to cause a moderate  settling problem.  The amount of Microthrix parvicella is less in Tanks 2 and 4 and least in Tank 3.  Microthrix parvicella causes both settling and foaming problems but because of its coiled growth form that keeps it in and around the flocs, it takes a lot of it to severely impact settling rates.

But first, we want to establish good settling, and good consistent effluent, which requires reducing the M. Parvicella proliferation.  However, Dr. Jenkins concluded that the concentration, or abundance of M. Parvicella in those samples was not enough to cause severe settling problems.  I think we have gotten to that point now, and it is likely that this organism is to blame.

It was appreciated by all concerned that this strategy was maintained “<span style="font-style:italic">at the detriment of the ammonia levels</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">C1/114</span>), i.e. that the strategy put at risk the SBR’s ability to maintain nitrification (see also paragraph 134 above).  </p>

However, as indicated above, the strategic decision had been taken that it was important to sort out the continuing problem of solids carry-over events, before seeking to restore nitrification.  In the circumstances, as Mr Holmes readily accepted in the course of his evidence (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 3/74</span>), it would not be fair to attach too much significance to the loss of nitrification during this period, because the control strategy that had been adopted consciously accepted that a loss of nitrification might occur as the result of the reduced MLSS levels.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">Achieving the desired reduced MLSS level of 1600 mg/l proved to be very difficult.  Yorkshire Water and Earth-Tech formed the view that this was due to a deficiency in the sludge-wastage system (i.e. a lack of capacity to waste enough sludge).  However, this proved not to be the case.  In February 2000, Mr Steve Kirkwood (“Mr Kirkwood”: one of Earth-Tech’s process engineers and an SBR specialist) carried out an investigation into the SBR’s sludge production system.  This revealed (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that the daily amount of sludge being produced was about 7 tonnes per day, whereas the estimated sludge yield, as calculated by reference to the original Yorkshire Water data, was about 2.74 tonnes per day (<span style="font-style:italic">C63/100</span>).  </p>

However, the fact that the sludge handling system appeared to be wasting more sludge volumetrically than it had been designed to waste was the main reason that Biwater rejected the suggestion that it lacked capacity at the monthly progress meeting (<span style="font-style:italic">H3/248 and see also the evidence of Mr Molloy at Transcript, Day 21/13</span>).

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">For its part, by March 2000 Yorkshire Water had come to the firmly held view that there were deficiencies in the SBR’s sludge handling system, problems with fill-decants and the SBR’s fill arrangement and a hydraulic defect in the decanters that created a suction effect on the sludge blanket.  It would appear that there was at least a measure of support from Earth-Tech in respect of all three matters.  Furthermore, as I have already indicated in paragraph 262 above, Yorkshire Water and Earth-Tech had also formed the view by then that the omission of the IDSC and the influent chute design had resulted in the Knostrop SBR having an inadequate selector capability.  On the other hand, the Biwater team did not consider that there was any design problem with the SBR and that it was simply a question of getting the SBR balanced and operating it correctly (<span style="font-style:italic">C64/341</span>).

It seems that Mr Copnall had come to the conclusion that the physical capacity of the SBR might be 30% too small because average flow had been equated with DWF instead of being calculated as 1.3 DWF: see his exchange of emails with Ms Henderson on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March (<span style="font-style:italic">C92/7-8</span>).  </p>

It was Yorkshire Water’s case that the reason for the low flows (and thus the low BOD loads) to the SBR was that flows to the SBR had been capped.  However, I am not persuaded that the caps had any real impact on the flows to the SBR, nor do I accept that this was the reason for the low BOD loads.  I accept Dr Horan’s evidence that the fact that the flows to the SBR were capped had no real practical effect on the flows or the BOD load actually received by the SBR during the relevant period.  He suggested that the flows to the SBR, and thus the BOD load, would have been much the same if there had been no cap on the flows.  In my view, he was correct in that assertion.  Graph 6 appended to the end of Dr Horan’s first report (<span style="font-style:italic">E3</span>) compares the SBR inlet flow, when capped, with the flow that would have been available if there had been no cap.  As it seems to me, Graph 6 clearly shows that the imposition of the flows cap had only a marginal, if any, effect on the available flows to the SBR during 2000.

I am fortified in that view by the agreed information in table 4 of the second EJS (<span style="font-style:italic">E5/49</span>).  This shows a steady decline in the BOD influent concentrations, during the course of the year, from 75mg/l to 31mg/l.  I accept Mr Streatfeild-James’s submission that, if the reductions in the BOD load been the result of the imposition of flow caps, one would have expected the influent BOD concentrations to have remained static over time (load being the product of flow multiplied by concentration).

I will deal with the reasons for that deterioration at a later stage of this judgment (see paragraph 400 below onwards).  Before doing so, it is necessary to consider the events of the summer and autumn of 2000 in greater detail.</p>

It is clear that, from the outset, the review was to be strictly limited to Elga/Jet Tech and that there was no immediate intention of passing on whatever views or conclusions were reached to either Biwater or Yorkshire Water: see the email dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 200 from Mr Derek Workman (“Mr Workman”), the Head of Projects for a group of companies of which Elga was one (<span style="font-style:italic">C66/327</span>), who was responsible for supervising and coordinating the project managers and conducting regular project reviews in relation to a number of projects including that at Knostrop.</p>

The conclusion reached at this stage was (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>) that there was a design problem with the SBR because of the omission of ID manifolds (i.e. the IDSCs), which were considered to be necessary and required to be installed (<span style="font-style:italic">C73/89</span>).  However, it is important to note that the absence of IDs was not perceived to give rise to a selector problem.  Rather it was seen to be the reason for the problems that arose as the result of the occurrence of fill-decant events (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 22/28, evidence of Dr Cannon and Transcript, Day 24/138-140, evidence of Mr Norcross</span>).

However, as Mr Streatfeild-James observed (<span style="font-style:italic">Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 142</span>), a possible explanation for this is that by the date the Elga/Jet Tech review was concluded (i.e. July 2000), the SBR appeared to be working well and was producing good quality effluent.

In particular, when the SBR’s apparent lack of aeration capacity was being discussed (see paragraphs 323-324 below), Mr Norcross claimed that the ratio of COD:BOD had changed significantly, that there was a much higher proportion of readily biodegradable COD present in the sewage than could have been expected from the data provided and that this was the explanation for the apparent lack of aeration.  This phenomenon of COD that did not form any part of the BOD<span style="font-size:8pt">5</span> (i.e. the BOD as measured by the usual 5 day test – “5-day BOD”: see paragraph 125-126 above) but was nevertheless <span style="font-weight:bold">readily</span> biodegradable, became known at the trial as “<span style="font-style:italic">the BOD disguised as COD</span>” (i.e. COD that appeared to be as readily biodegradable as BOD, but which (contrary to normal expectation) had not been measured as and included in the figure for the 5-day BOD).  In an internal memorandum dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">C68/343-348</span>), Mr Norcross summarised his views on this aspect of the matter, as follows:</p>

Effluent COD values indicate 30 to 40mg/l as soluble COD; this means the “extra” COD is readily biodegradable.  Therefore, the SBR is removing much more organic load (70% more) than was expected.  And in most cycles, each tank still ends aeration because the D(issolved) O(xygen) setpoint is reached.  And this is occurring in spite of dramatically reduced aeration times due to the poor settling rates; and in spite of low airflow rate …</span>”</p>

As a result, he satisfied himself that the SBR did have a sufficient volumetric capacity and that it had a nitrification safety factor of 250% on 6 tanks.  However, if only 5 tanks were operational, Dr Zuber’s calculations suggested that, although the SBR would nitrify and produce effluent to the required standards for a short period of time, the SBR’s ability to nitrify could not be sustained indefinitely at full flows and loads and that there “<span style="font-style:italic">might well be a sudden drop in performance of the Plant after 2-3 weeks of continuous 5 tank operation</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">D3A/331, paragraph 5.22</span>).

This, in turn, was indicative of a lack of aeration in the react phase of the overall treatment cycle.</p>

Dr Greenhalgh explained that it was necessary to check the sludge guarantee figures and relate them to the COD, because sludge production was higher than would have been expected.

However, it was common ground that the low DO profiles (and the associated “BOD disguised as COD” phenomenon) were a temporary feature that did not persist after early June 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 16/148</span>).  It was also common ground that the amounts of sludge that were being produced were very high and this particular aspect of the matter did persist.  The issue was as to why this was the case.</p>

This established fact, taken together with the fact that an unexpectedly high COD was apparently being treated and removed from the influent, led Biwater to suggest at the time (not unreasonably, in my view) that there was a large proportion of readily biodegradable COD in the influent that was not picked up by the 5-day BOD test (i.e. that there was a higher than measurable load in the influent to the SBR) and that it was being degraded, thus exerting an oxygen demand and creating or contributing to excessive sludge. In effect, this was the same point as that made by Mr Norcross during the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May meeting (see paragraph 319(iii) above) and, in my view, is probably the correct explanation for this temporary phenomenon.  Moreover (and more importantly), it was also Biwater’s view that, rather than an anticipated COD:BOD ratio in line with the normal 2:1, the actual COD:BOD ratio of the influent was nearer to 4:1 (<span style="font-style:italic">C71/120</span>): see also paragraph 0.2.2(b) of the Specification, paragraph 26 (v) above.</p>

However, it was calculable from the data provided in the Specification (“the specified COD:BOD ratio”) and, as Mr Holmes and Ms Henderson readily accepted, was a ratio that is normally used in the wastewater industry for assessing the nature and treatability of the sewage in question (see paragraph 127 above).  During the summer of 2000, Yorkshire Water and Earth-Tech carried out their own internal investigation into what the specified COD:BOD ratio was.  Mr Copnall carried out some calculations, using the GPSX report that suggested a ratio of 3.1:1 (<span style="font-style:italic">C71/262</span>).  At a meeting held on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2000, it was said that the ratio derived from the contractual documentation was 2.85:1, whereas the actual ratio appears to have been calculated to be 3.5:1 (<span style="font-style:italic">G5/123</span>).</p>

It is worth noting that Mr Arthur Boon arrived at the same ratio in his report in September 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">C77/149</span>: as to the Boon report, see paragraph 338 below).  For its part, Yorkshire Water maintained that the ratio of 2.74:1 related to settled sewage only and that it was not the appropriate ratio for the influent to the SBR.  According to Yorkshire Water, the COD:BOD ratio of the SBR influent was nearer to 5:1, once proper account had been taken of the contribution of the ASP effluent (49% of which was to form part of the SBR influent: see paragraph 0.2.6.3 of the Specification, paragraph 26 above).</p>

I accept the evidence of Dr Zuber and Dr Greenhalgh (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 14/55-61, Day 16/77-80 and 139-141</span>) that the ratio of 5:1 asserted by Yorkshire Water (as calculated mainly by Dr Chambers and by Taylor Woodrow’s expert, Dr David Johnstone, “Dr Johnstone”) resulted from a process of calculation that was fundamentally flawed.  Dr Zuber and Dr Greenhalgh both accepted that it was important to take account of the loads in the ASP effluent, when calculating the appropriate COD:BOD ratio of the SBR influent, but both rejected (correctly, in my view) the suggestion that the effect of doing so would be to raise its COD:BOD ratio to 5:1.  As both Dr Zuber and Dr Greenhalgh pointed out, the Yorkshire Water calculation involved the mathematically impermissible exercise of averaging the various ratios, the fallacious nature of which was graphically illustrated by Dr Greenhalgh in the course of his evidence (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 16/140</span>).</p>

The influent data for the SBR for the period 2000 to 2003, as collected and summarised in exhibit TW5, gives a mean average COD:BOD ratio of 4.3:1 and a maximum value of 17.3:1.  In the course of cross-examination, Dr Chambers accepted (albeit with some reluctance) that there was a difference (meaning a significant difference) between a COD:BOD ratio of 2.74:1 and one of 4.3:1.  As it seems to me, it is clear that the COD:BOD ratio of the SBR influent was significantly and unexpectedly different to that which could have been ascertained from the influent data in the contract (in particular, from the tender information and the Specification: i.e. it was a much higher COD:BOD ratio).  It follows that the influent to the SBR was much more difficult to treat than could reasonably have been expected from the specified data.</p>

There was no express specification of the influent TSS concentrations in the main contract.  This is not unusual.  I accept Dr Horan’s evidence that a TSS concentration is only specified for sewage plant designers where a Purchaser wishes to draw the designer’s attention to the fact that the TSS concentration is outside the range normally to be expected in influent sewage (see Dr Horan’s 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> supplementary report at paragraph 4.2: <span style="font-style:italic">E3A/tab2/15</span>).  In other words, since there was no expressly specified TSS concentration in the main contract, the designers of the SBR were entitled to expect that the TSS loads in the SBR influent would be within normal limits, that is to say within the normally expected range of plus or minus 25% of the of the specified influent BOD concentrations (paragraph 4.2: <span style="font-style:italic">E3A/tab2/15</span>).  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr Eikelboom’s evidence was to a like effect.  On the basis of the specified BOD concentrations (see paragraph 26 above), Mr Eikelboom would have expected the SBR influent to have a TSS concentration of about 75mg/l to 100mg/l (see paragraph 54 of Mr Eikelboom’s first report: <span style="font-style:italic">E4/17</span>), which translates into TSS loads of between 6.375 tonnes/day and 8.5 tonnes/day at average flows.  Given that the experts were agreed that the BOD concentration of the SBR influent during the relevant period was 81mg/l, Mr Eikelboom’s figures fall within the band identified by Dr Horan.  I am thus satisfied that the weight of expert evidence supports Dr Horan’s views (see also Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraphs 287-288).  Accordingly, in the present case, the normal expectation with regard to the TSS loads in the SBR influent would have been plus or minus 25% of the specified BOD loads.</p>

However all the experts were agreed that the possibility that the high TSS loads originated with the ASP effluent could be discounted altogether.  Unlike Dr Chambers, Dr Horan and Mr Eikelboom also discounted the internal sludge return liquors.  They both considered it likely that the high TSS loads were being added to the high level stream either above or below the primary tanks from other parts of the Knostrop works, before becoming part of the SBR influent (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 30/28 and Transcript, Day 31/61</span>).</p>

Despite Dr Chambers’ insistence to the contrary, it is clear from the mass balance calculations set out in pages 4 to 6 of exhibit TW6 that it is simply impossible that solids’ loads of the magnitude recorded in the SBR influent could have originated from the sludge return liquors.   I also accept the force of the various other points made in paragraph 599(2) of Biwater’s closing submissions.  In any event, as it seems to me, the proposition that the sludge return liquors were not the source of the high TSS loads is self-evidently true.  As Dr Horan said in evidence (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 30/27</span>): “<span style="font-style:italic">there is not 10 tonnes of solids leaving the G(ravity) B(elt) T(hickeners) even on the belt, so we know they are not from the GBTs”</span>.

However, the fact that the precise source of the high TSS loads cannot be identified does not matter.  For the purposes of this case, it is sufficient to find, as I do, that the unexpectedly high TSS loads were not caused by any aspect of the SBR’s design or of its operation or system of control.   </p>

However, at the SBR Review Meeting held on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2000, it was acknowledged that the recorded data did not support the occurrence of any such inter-basin transfer (although there had been instances of a valve being wrongly opened or left open), but it was decided to investigate the possibility further (<span style="font-style:italic">C1/229</span>).  At the same meeting it was agreed that it was not practical to carry out meaningful performance tests on the SBR in the prevailing circumstances, although Yorkshire Water indicated an intention to undertake the four 28 day tests as soon as circumstances permitted (<span style="font-style:italic">C1/230</span>).</p>

She had also come to the conclusion that there was something fundamentally wrong with the SBR (<span style="font-style:italic">D1/272 and Transcript, Day 13/18</span>).  Although Mrs Williamson was aware that Biwater disputed that this was the case, she had been advised that Earth-Tech shared Yorkshire Water’s view that the SBR was fundamentally defective and she firmly believed this to be the case.  It is no exaggeration to describe this as a critical watershed in the history of the original SBR. Inevitably, this firm belief on Mrs Williamson’s part had a significant effect on her approach to matters and decisions relating to the SBR and to how matters progressed from the summer of 2000 onwards, despite the marked improvement in the SBR’s performance, which strongly suggested that there was actually nothing fundamentally wrong with it.</p>

Not surprisingly, this was of considerable concern to Yorkshire Water and Mrs Williamson made this clear at an SBR meeting held on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">R1/45</span>).

At the time, the Global pollution was considered to have had a very detrimental effect on the Knostrop plant’s nitrification capability.  It is clear that this factor was considered to be sufficiently significant for Mrs Williamson to decide that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">absolutely essential</span>” that the information should not be made known to Taylor Woodrow (and Biwater), in case it was used as “<span style="font-style:italic">an excuse for the SBR not working</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">C92/50</span>) in the contractual arguments that were currently taking place with Taylor Woodrow.  In my view, this particular episode of industrial pollution during the summer of 2000 and Yorkshire Water’s reaction to it, does show that, from time to time, treatment problems at Knostrop were and were perceived to be due (in part, at least) to the toxic and/or chemical effect of incidents of industrial pollution: see, for example, the overnight loss of nitrification in tank 4 of the SBR, observed by Dr Zuber on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">D3A/333</span>), which was probably directly due to the Global incident.  As it seems to me, the problem of intermittent industrial pollution is a factor that must be taken into account when assessing the overall performance of the SBR during the period 1999 to 2001.</p>

The scoping document was to become Recovery Plan 2 and was to be written under the auspices of Mr Copnall, but with individual sections being prepared and written by different specialists in Earth-Tech (<span style="font-style:italic">C79/245</span>).  The purpose of Recovery Plan 2 was to establish the works that needed to be done to both stabilise the SBR and to maximise its treatment capacity at the existing 85% of the original maximum capacity (<span style="font-style:italic">C9/287</span>).</p>

Because of these other commitments, she had only a limited recollection of being involved in Recovery Plan 2 (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 7/74-75</span>).  It was Ms Henderson’s evidence that the main process input into Recovery Plan 2 had come from Dr Hemphrey, Ms Henderson’s successor as Earth-Tech’s lead process engineer for the Knostrop project (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 7/72</span>: and see paragraph 156 above).  However, it is clear that Ms Henderson did visit the Knostrop works, where she was shown around by Mr Coulthard, she had a discussion with Ms Schofield about the SBR, she obtained various documents from the files and she gave a presentation.  Although Ms Henderson does not appear to have been extensively involved in its preparation, it is nevertheless clear that parts of her presentation were subsequently incorporated into Recovery Plan 2, although written by somebody else (either Mr Copnall or Dr Hemphrey).</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">In my view, Ms Henderson’s understanding of the SBR was somewhat limited as, in effect, she herself acknowledged.  She had a CASS background.  She had never seen a Jet Tech SBR before (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 8/58</span>) and she emphasised how complicated it was (<span style="font-style:italic">D1/75</span>).  As Ms Henderson explained in the course of her evidence, she found it difficult to be sure what the control software was doing because it was constantly changing the treatment cycle times.  In this respect, it is important to note that the Jet Tech SBR is markedly different from the CASS plant/system, which has fixed treatment cycles, not variable ones (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 8/57-58</span>).  During the first two weeks of November 2000, therefore, Ms Henderson tried to gather what information she could from the O&amp;M manuals, she gleaned such information as she could from the way the SBR was operating during the visit that she made with Mr Coulthard, she discussed the operation of the SBR with Ms Schofield and she applied her general knowledge of SBRs to the information that she gathered in this manner.  The result was the presentation, complete with visual displays, which she gave on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">C80/186-204</span>:<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“Ms Henderson’s presentation”). </p>

Ms Henderson’s recommendations were: (i) that Jet Tech should check the design and confirm operating water levels, (ii) that Jet Tech should investigate the anomaly in the anoxic fill times and (iii) that the SBR should be set up and operated with design parameters and set points (<span style="font-style:italic">C80/204</span>).</p>

The extent to which it was demonstrated that there were important errors in Ms Henderson’s presentation can best be illustrated by reference to her critical (and erroneous) conclusion that the SBR had been designed using only 87% of design flows (<span style="font-style:italic">C80/194</span>).  Ms Henderson had reached that conclusion by carrying out (inter alia) a number of calculations of decant volumes, entirely based on a CTDC (Cycle Time Distribution Chart) that she had obtained as part of her general inquiries.  Unfortunately, the CTDC used by Ms Henderson (<span style="font-style:italic">C80/192</span>) was itself based on dimensions that were not the same as the dimensions of the SBR as built, so the decant volumes were completely different.  I accept that, when the correct figures were used to repeat Ms Henderson’s calculations, the SBR was shown to have adequate capacity.

Inevitably, to the extent that Recovery Plan 2 was based on and/or incorporated the calculations and conclusions of Ms Henderson’s presentation, its calculations and/or conclusions were, by a parity of reasoning, erroneous.

The problem with fill-decants had been resolved by the fill-decant inhibit and the monitoring carried out by Yorkshire Water revealed that there was no obvious effect when, as a result of a fill-decant inhibit event, influent to the SBR was diverted to the high-level filters.  Fill-decants/fill-decant inhibits were therefore no longer considered to be one of the main issues by this stage.  Attention was largely focused on achieving stability of the SBR.</p>

This new regime started on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2000, and the procedure adopted was that the Yorkshire Water operatives would carry out the MLSS analyses in the mornings and that these, together with the previous day’s sludge wastage results were sent to Mr Molloy.  He would then decide upon the appropriate sludge wastage set points and send details of these back to site, so that they could be set by Mr Coulthard for operation on the following day.  After some initial problems, this system appears to have worked well.

However, no changes to the flows and loads were proposed in the short term since the SBR was still not considered to be stable by Yorkshire Water/Earth-Tech, because they considered that various important issues still remained unresolved (<span style="font-style:italic">C1/239</span>): i.e. (i) the continued incidence of fill-decant inhibits, (ii) mechanical plant reliability, (iii) software performance, (iv) the recent deterioration in settleability, (v) the possible flow transfer between basins and (vi) the operation of the control penstock.  </p>

In the circumstances then prevailing and having regard to the success of the strategy that he had promoted and pursued, his sense of frustration was very understandable.  Although I am not persuaded that Yorkshire Water had deliberately embarked on a conscious policy of holding back from carrying out the performance tests because it had recently decided to terminate the main contract in November (which appears to be the thrust of paragraph 221 of Biwater’s closing submissions), the decision to terminate the main contract undoubtedly coloured Yorkshire Water’s overall approach to the operation of the SBR.  I have no doubt that Yorkshire Water’s various concerns were genuinely held (although, as it seems to me, misplaced) and that it was these concerns that were the main reason for its decision not to increase flows and loads and proceed to performance testing at this stage.  It is important to remember that the flow of sewage cannot be “switched off” in an emergency (unlike other public utilities and services).  Thus, the daily flow of sewage into the Knostrop works would be bound to continue, whatever treatment problems/difficulties were being experienced at the time.  Accordingly, the consequences of a major compliance failure by the Knostrop works were far too serious for any risk of such an occurrence to be taken.  There were a number of reasons that appeared to justify Yorkshire Water’s decision not to increase the flows and loads to the SBR and proceed to performance testing at the time.  In particular, the improvement in maintaining appropriate MLSS levels was fairly recent (following a rather lengthy period of difficulty) and there were some slight signs of deterioration in settleability with winter approaching (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 4/59</span>).  However, for the reasons given later in this judgment, I am satisfied that the SBR was perfectly capable of meeting the contractual performance requirements if operated properly.  By the autumn of 2000, Taylor Woodrow/Biwater were quite prepared for the performance tests to be carried out on the SBR and, in my judgment, there is every reason to believe that it would have passed those tests satisfactorily had they actually been carried out.  In the event, it was Yorkshire Water (the party who had the contractual obligation to carry out the performance tests: see Clause 35 of the General Conditions) that decided to hold back from doing so.  </p>

To that end, an SBR Optimisation Group (“the optimisation group”) consisting of a working party, comprising representatives from Yorkshire Water, Earth-Tech, Taylor Woodrow and Biwater, was duly formed.  I am not persuaded that the formation and work of the optimisation group was a result of Yorkshire Water’s decision to determine the main contract in November 2000 (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 222), although the group’s existence and the future prospects for the project as a whole must be seen against the background of that decision.  All in all, I have no doubt that Yorkshire Water was not prepared to take any sort of discernable risk of any failure of the consent standards caused by the SBR and, inevitably, its perception of such a risk was heavily influenced by its firmly held belief (shared by Earth-Tech) that the SBR was fundamentally defective and the fact that (essentially for that reason) it had been decided to determine the contract in the near future.  </p>

In order to achieve this it was recommended that: (i) the flow averaging period (Watchdog) should be left at its current setting, (ii) the TWL (top water level) should be increased by 200mm., (iii) if the adjustment to the TWL did not work, then the settle safety time should be adjusted to give increased buffering capacity for flow changes and (iv) if that also did not work, that the SBR feed pumps should be slowed down (<span style="font-style:italic">R1/114</span>).  As it seems to me, the optimisation group’s work and conclusions make plain a general acceptance by all concerned that, despite some apparently unusual features of the influent, the SBR system had sufficient flexibility to enable it to treat it satisfactorily at full contractual flows, after appropriate adjustment to the SBR’s various operational parameters. </p>

As he put it, he would not have wasted his time drafting them had it not been the intention that they should be issued.  In the draft letter dealing with the claim for an extension of time, a total of 17.5 weeks’ extension of time was awarded, of which 16.5 weeks of the extension of time was said to be granted with costs, and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 1999 was stated to be the revised take-over date for the SBR (<span style="font-style:italic">C80/212-214</span>).

In fact, Mr Jones produced his own drafts of the extension of time and final account letters on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November and 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2000 respectively (<span style="font-style:italic">C92/125 and 127</span>).

Furthermore, on his final account letter, it can be seen that Mr Jones made a handwritten note dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December to the effect that the letter had not been sent at Yorkshire Water’s request (Mr Sawyer), because there was a “<span style="font-style:italic">contractual issue</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">C92/127</span>).</p>

Attached to Mr Jones’ letter was his brief written account and opinion with regard to the extension of time/final account issues in which he confirmed that, in Earth-Tech’s opinion, an extension of 17.5 weeks (10.25 of which were stated to be at no cost) and a provisional Final Account Valuation of £11,642,334.65 were appropriate.  It is worth noting at this stage that, as it seems to me, Earth-Tech’s conclusions with regard to the extension of time/final account issues provide compelling evidence of Taylor Woodrow’s entitlement to the 17.8 weeks’ extension of time and further payment that it has counterclaimed in these proceedings.  For the brief reasons that I give later, when dealing with that counterclaim (see below), I am satisfied that Taylor Woodrow is entitled to the extension of time claimed, which effectively disposes of Yorkshire Water’s claim for liquidated damages.</p>

As he pointed out, not only was the SBR’s performance good throughout the period but, once Mr Molloy was in control of the sludge wastage regime, the SBR’s apparent lack of stability in August was rapidly remedied and stability achieved.  As a result, the SBR was now operating well, despite being affected by the dramatic variations in the TSS loads, the low BOD loads and the high COD:BOD ratio, all of which had the effect of making the SBR difficult to operate.  However, as Mr Streatfeild-James observed, “<span style="font-style:italic">these various difficulties could be – and were – being overcome</span>” (paragraph 358 of Biwater’s closing observations).  Furthermore (and importantly), although it is clear that Taylor Woodrow/Biwater were perfectly prepared for performance testing to be carried out on the SBR from about late September 2000 onwards, it was Yorkshire Water that decided not to do so.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">In my view, there is no doubt that a significant factor in the SBR’s rapid deterioration in performance in November 2000 was precipitated by a serious error made with regard to the anoxic multiplier set point. Either Mr Coulthard or a representative of Elga changed the anoxic multiplier set point from 0.35 to 3.5, representing a tenfold increase.  It is not clear who was actually responsible for making the alteration, but it was common ground that it was done and that it was not corrected until 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November.  Furthermore, on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2000, Mr Coulthard increased the top water level (the “TWL”) by 200mm (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 6/166</span>), which had the effect of increasing the fill time, changing the volume of the influent admitted to each tank and increasing the decant depth.  Unfortunately, it is clear that Mr Coulthard did not appreciate that these changes meant that appropriate adjustments to the cycle times would also be needed, a matter that required appropriate modifications to be made to the software of the computerised control system if the increase in the TWL was to be maintained (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 6/167-168</span>).</p>

As it seems to me, Mr Coulthard’s approach to remedying the situation, by making the various changes to the set points that he did, was largely one of trial and error (<span style="font-style:italic">C80/A27, C80/A28 and Transcript, Day 6/170 onwards</span>).

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">The hit and miss nature of such an approach inevitably caused Mr Sawyer to express some concern as to whether there was a proper understanding of the changes that were being made to the set points: see the terms of his email to Mr Holmes, dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">C81/207</span>), in which he posed the question: “<span style="font-style:italic">Are we managing the changes properly?</span>”  Mr Holmes’ recollection was that it was the loss of control of the SBR as a result of the anoxic multiplier episode, coupled with the inevitable time that it took to recover and the fact that winter was starting, which caused the decline in performance of the SBR (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 4/69</span>).  Although this is not an unfair overall assessment of the situation, it does not take account of the important fact that there was a lack of a real and complete understanding of the SBR system (and, in particular, of the appropriate changes that needed to be made to the set points from time to time) on the part of the various concerned Yorkshire Water/Earth-Tech operatives at the time.  It is important to note that there is no evidence (nor was there any suggestion at the time) that any of the operational problems during the winter of 2000/2001 were due to poor sludge settleability caused by <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella.</span></p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">Although Earth-Tech’s investigations were still largely predicated on the basis, mainly derived from Ms Henderson’s erroneous presentation, that the SBR had insufficient capacity to treat full flows on either 5 or 6 tanks (see, for example, Mr Copnall’s calculations of plant capacity in <span style="font-style:italic">C82/81A and C83/150</span>), it also appears that, in December 2000, Dr Hemphrey had come to the conclusion that the SBR lacked adequate selector capacity (<span style="font-style:italic">C83/150 and Transcript, Day 9/125</span>).  There appears to be no record of any contemporaneous investigation/analysis of the microbiology or of the SBR’s selector capability and no way of knowing precisely how or why Dr Hemphrey came to express that conclusion at this particular stage.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">However, as it seems to me, it is significant that the suggested lack of selector capacity was specifically linked to the absence of an IDSC and the design for introducing the influent into each SBR tank, i.e. by means of the inlet chute (<span style="font-style:italic">C83/150</span>).   As I have already stated, from as early as February 2000 both Yorkshire Water and Earth-Tech had taken the view that the omission of the IDSC, coupled with the effect of introducing influent by means of an influent chute, would have a detrimental effect on the SBR’s selector capacity (see paragraph 262 above).  It therefore seems to me very likely that fresh interest was being shown in or greater importance attached to this long standing opinion, possibly because of the slight deterioration in settleability that had been observed from September 2000 onwards (see paragraph 381 above).  </p>

In it, he stated that if a selector zone were provided, the SBR should have a capacity of 105 tcmd for 6 tanks (as opposed to a capacity of 92 tcmd on the basis of its then configuration) and that at that level there was (in Earth-Tech’s view) a limitation in the capacity of the SBR by reason of the decant volume.  Mr Copnall suggested that to correct this it would be necessary to increase the decant depth by 500mm.  However, he went on to point out that, with a selector zone, it would be possible to increase the decant depth by 200mmm and this would take the SBR capacity to 117 tcmd.  He also stated that there would then be a requirement for new humus tanks to accommodate the capacity shortfall between 117 tcmd and the contractual 136 tcmd.  Mr Copnall put the estimated cost of the suggested “short-term” remedial works, i.e. excluding the new humus tanks, at £1.170 million (<span style="font-style:italic">C92/132</span>).</p>

Mr Copnall gave the first presentation by way of background  (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 9/164</span>) and after discussion it was decided that the way forward was to adopt an external selector tank of about 900 m<span style="font-size:8pt">3</span> to overcome the poor sludge settleability (<span style="font-style:italic">R2/108J and K</span>).

In due course, the first stage became Phase 1 of the remedial works (see below).  In March 2001, BCIC gave approval for carrying out the short-term remedial works to include the external selector.

Works valued at more that £2 million are normally subject to a competitive tendering process, using three contractors from another Yorkshire Water pre-selected panel called the Framework Contractors List.  The original selection of the contractors on these pre-selected panels was by a competitive tender process for the duration of AMP 3.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">In the event, so far as concerns Phase 1 of the remedial works, the view taken by Yorkshire Water was that it was not feasible to go through a competitive tendering process, because of the shortness of time in which to design, procure and carry out the works before the onset of the winter 2001/2002 and the fact that the works were required as soon as possible (<span style="font-style:italic">D1/229</span>).  So it was that, in due course, Yorkshire Water decided to appoint the west area Gleeson CaSP (led by M.J. Gleeson: “Gleeson”) as the contractor for the Phase 1 remedial works, because Gleeson was already established on site at the Knostrop works, where it was carrying out investigation/feasibility works in relation to the Knostrop High Priority Maintenance Scheme.  For the same reason, the consultant chosen to design the remedial works was TEAM, which is a joint venture between E.C. Harris, RKL-Arup and Montgomery Watson Hazra (“Montgomery Watson”).  There was also the added convenience that Montgomery Watson happened to be part of the Gleeson CaSP (<span style="font-style:italic">D1/229-230</span>)</p>

Mr Slater suggested that this very real danger had also been fully appreciated by both Taylor Woodrow and Biwater, both of whom realised that the SBR was incapable of satisfying the relevant Performance Tests, and that it was for that reason that they had not been prepared to agree to Yorkshire Water operating the SBR at full flows and loads throughout the entire relevant period.  Mr Slater emphasised that, at all material times, Yorkshire Water had been anxious and willing to carry out the Performance Tests, but had been prevented from doing so because (i) it was common ground that the SBR was quite unable to meet the requirements of the relevant Schedule 7 Performance Tests and (ii) there was a significant risk of “catastrophic consequences” as the result of the inevitable failure to meet those requirements.  </p>

Undoubtedly, Taylor Woodrow/Biwater accepted that taking performance tests was not appropriate whilst the SBR was operating at reduced flows and loads and/or whilst it was unstable (see my foregoing account of the facts generally).  However, as I have already indicated (see paragraphs 385 and 399 above) there did come a stage, in the late summer of 2000, when Biwater was anxious to increase flows and loads and proceed to performance testing, in the light of the SBR’s excellent performance at the time, and it was Yorkshire Water that decided not to do so.  As I have also already made clear, by that stage Yorkshire Water had decided to terminate the main contract and was determined not to take any risk of failing the relevant consent standards.</p>

It is important to note that, as part of Phase 1 of the remedial works, the SBR was no longer required to treat any part of the effluent from the ASP.  The influent to the SBR was and has thereafter remained confined solely to the originally specified proportion of the effluent from the high-level primary tanks (i.e. 33% of the high-level primary tank flow and load, up to a maximum of 76 tcmd).  It is also important to bear in mind that, for these reasons (i.e. the addition of the external selector tank and the modified influent), the SBR was now markedly different to that originally designed and installed by Taylor Woodrow/Biwater.</p>

Nitrification was not satisfactory and there was a significant incidence of BOD, COD and solids consent failures: see graphs 1 to 4 attached to Dr Horan’s first report.  BOD loads remained low at under 2 tonnes/day in mid-January 2002, rising to around 2 – 4 tonnes/day thereafter (see Graph 5, <span style="font-style:italic">E3</span>).  In my view, having regard to the extent and nature of the modifications to the original SBR (see paragraph 431 above), it cannot be assumed or inferred that the SBR’s poor performance after recommissioning was attributable to any defect or design deficiency in the original SBR, nor does it demonstrate that the original SBR would have been unable to meet the Schedule 7 performance requirements.  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic"> July 2002, Mr Aspinwall of ETM produced a document dealing with the design of the decanters (R5/155).  Mr Copnall referred to it as a process statement (Transcript, Day 12/101).  This addressed the additional depth which could be gained by reference to the CASS decanters which were proposed; it was said to be 100mm. (In addition, Mr Aspinwall suggested that, in the case of the CASS decanters, the area of flow nearest the sludge blanket was many times greater than for the Jet Tech decanters and that, therefore, the flow velocity nearest the sludge blanket would be proportionally less for the CASS system, further reducing the risk of solids carry-over).</span>

What was being discussed was the fact that the CASS system did not achieve a saving of 500mm (i.e. the difference between the surface water level and the point of draw of the Jet Tech decanter) because the scum baffle extended below the water surface.</span>

(Mr Kirkwood went on to identify the main benefit of installing the CASS decanters as Mr Apinwall’s additional point, namely “the draw-off velocities will be much less, greatly reducing the risk of entraining solids from the sludge blanket”).

The BAF was intended and designed to deal with the ASP effluent that was to have been but no longer was being treated by the original SBR, following the completion of the Phase 1 remedial works (see paragraph 426 above).  Of course, after allowing for the 60 tcmd to be treated by the proposed BAF, the figure of 76 tcmd represents the balance of 136 tcmd, i.e. the maximum flow for which the original SBR was intended to provide treatment.</p>

That test was carried out with 5 tanks in operation and showed the effluent quality to be within the standards required by the Main Contract: see paragraphs 6.2 to 6.4 of Dr Chambers’ first supplemental report.  However, in my opinion, that particular test cannot be said to be equivalent to a performance test carried out under the terms of the main contract.  Not only was the modified SBR markedly different from the SBR as designed and installed by Taylor Woodrow/Biwater, but the maximum flow tested was 76 tcmd, as opposed to the maximum of 136 tcmd specified by the main contract.  </p>

For the reasons given earlier in this judgment and in my judgment in the Main Contract Preliminary Issues, this case is almost entirely concerned with Yorkshire Water’s contractual entitlement to recover its relevant remedial costs, pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 10 of the Main Contract (see paragraph 86 above).  However, even if (contrary to the way that I have construed the main contract) Yorkshire Water is entitled to rely upon any of the other contractual provisions identified in the Particulars of Claim, I am satisfied that the outcome of these proceedings remains unaffected for the reasons given in the latter part of this judgment.</p>

I therefore accept Mr Streatfeild-James’s submission (Biwater’s closing submissions paragraph 280) that it is not enough to show that at certain periods the SBR performed poorly in terms of its effluent.  The nature of the original SBR was such that any failure in terms of effluent could be due to any one or more of a wide variety of causes.  The evidence of poor performance has to be considered and the reasons for its occurrence identified.  Only then will it be possible to say whether Yorkshire Water has proved that, at all material times, Taylor Woodrow was unable to meet the relevant performance requirements of Schedule 7.  </p>

It was Dr Zuber’s evidence that there is a standard rule of thumb in conventional plant operation that the sludge settlement required for good performance will be normally be achieved by making appropriate adjustment to the MLSS levels in order to match the incoming BOD load and that this is done by monitoring and reacting as appropriate to the developing trends in the BOD load (<span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 14/52-53</span>).

Accordingly, the difficulty in controlling the MLSS levels in the SBR was not due to any defect or design deficiency in the SBR or its sludge handling system.  It was the result of abnormally high and erratic TSS loads coupled with operational errors, inexperience and a lack of understanding of the Jet Tech SBR process.  I am fortified in that conclusion by what happened when Mr Molloy took control of the decision-making in relation to the sludge wastage set points in September 2000 (see paragraphs 383-384 above).

Accordingly, I accept Mr Streatfeild-James’ submission that selector capacity is not necessarily provided by the construction of a specifically identifiable region or feature (either within or outside the treatment plant itself) that can be termed a “Selector” (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 457).

It is conveniently thought of as a “feast to famine” regime.  The feast part can be designed to happen in a separate compartment but it does not have to be so, as long as the conditions allow a rapid uptake of “food”.

Accordingly, because of the unpredictable nature of selectors, it may be difficult to identify the existence of an appropriate selector regime, particularly since the existence of one form of selection in a plant may make the presence of the other less important (see the evidence of Mr Eikelboom: <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 31/46-48</span>).  I therefore agree with Mr Streatfeild-James’ submission that where, as here, there is operational experience of a selector, the best evidence of its effectiveness is an analysis of whether the desired consequences of selection actually came about.  In this context, it is important to stress the following two matters: (i) the fundamental purpose of selection is to select out the selectable filamentous bacteria (see paragraphs 139 and 463 above) and (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella</span> is a filamentous species that is not selectable (see paragraph 140 above).</p>

In this context, it is important to note that it was Mr Norcross’ unchallenged evidence that a rule of thumb value for a beneficial floc loading is 75mg BOD per gramme of MLSS (<span style="font-style:italic">D4/77 and Transcript, Day 23/99</span>).

Accordingly, as Mr Streatfeild-James observed (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 460), the absence of a defined selector region in the original SBR means that, although the theory of promoting a high floc loading still remains valid in principle for such a treatment plant, the calculation of an exact floc loading in respect of the SBR is not without its difficulties: see paragraph 59 of Mr Eikelboom’s first report (<span style="font-style:italic">D4/19</span>).  However, in the same paragraph of his first report, Mr Eikelboom expressed the view that: “<span style="font-style:italic">Considering the loads mentioned in the contract and 10% mixing with the settled sludge, a floc load of about 75mg BOD/g MLSS can be calculated, a loading level that would have been high enough to create the selective pressure that favours floc forming bacteria</span>.”  I accept that this particular calculation is sound in principle and that it indicates that the SBR did have an adequate selector capacity (i.e. that the SBR was theoretically capable of providing an adequate kinetic selector regime).</p>

As Mr Streatfeild-James succinctly put it: <span style="font-style:italic">“In short, did the SBR suffer from the presence of filamentous bacteria susceptible to a selector regime?</span>”  The real proof of the presence or absence of an adequate selector regime in the as built SBR is whether it prevented the proliferation of filamentous bacteria that would otherwise have been susceptible to selection at the time.

Unfortunately, in the present case, the microbiological evidence during the operational life of the SBR before the remedial works is sparse and, in any event, the design and installation of the external selector (the Phase 1 remedial works) went ahead without any consideration of the microbiology, despite the advice from TEAM that a full process investigation should be carried out (see paragraphs 418-422 above).  </p>

Although Mr Norcross’ calculations were not carried out contemporaneously, I am satisfied that they were based on reasonable estimates of the degree of contact between the feed and the MLSS and that they took into account all other relevant factors.  In my view, the validity of Mr Norcross’ calculations was not undermined or discredited in cross-examination.  I accept that the calculations represent a fair theoretical assessment of the satisfactory selector effect of the dump fill via the influent chute, compared with the very unsatisfactory selector regime that would have resulted from the use of an IDSC in this particular SBR. Furthermore, Mr Norcross confirmed that the air entrainment effect was not observed at flows between 40 tcmd and 60 tcmd (Mr Norcross: <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 23/111</span>) and I accept his evidence to the effect that, to the extent that any air entrainment may have occurred, it was of no real significance to the SBR’s selector capacity.</p>

As Dr Horan pointed out, contact between the MLSS and the high concentration of food provided by the dump fill would be achieved as soon as the motive pumps were switched on once filling had finished, thus creating a good kinetic selection regime: see Dr Horan’s evidence at <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 30/123-124</span>, where he said this:</p>

What Dr Chambers is saying is that you are effectively dumping the fill in the corner and pushing the sludge from it, so you are getting your feed into the basin.  No microbial contact with it, as Dr Johnstone said there.  You are allowing the feed to accumulate in the corner.  That inlet is sited next to the motive pumps.  As soon as the motive pumps come, you are mixing that dump feed with the settled mixed liquor.  If Dr Johnstone is right – I had not appreciated it – if he is right, that is the best selector you could have designed.  What else is it but a zone in the tank where you have a high feed?

I accept the evidence of Mr Norcross and Dr Horan to that effect and am not persuaded by the evidence of Dr Chambers and Dr Johnstone to the contrary effect.

The essential thrust of Yorkshire Water’s case on this aspect of the matter is that unless the SBR’s fill was substantially anoxic at average flow (1.3 x DWF i.e. 85 tcmd) its selector capacity would be compromised.  It is said that, because the average flow that was used for the design of the SBR was 1 x DWF (i.e. 65 tcmd), the result was that the period of aerated fill commenced much earlier than it should have done, the period of anoxic fill was reduced as a result and that this adversely affected the selector effect.  </p>

Dr Chambers plainly regarded the omission of the IDSC as the main problem with the SBR’s selector capacity (see paragraph 6.3.7 of his first report: <span style="font-style:italic">E1/22 and paragraph 197 </span>above).  It is therefore not entirely clear how much importance he attached to the DWF issue in his overall criticism of the SBR’s selector capacity.  It is possible that Dr Chambers restricted himself to the general observation made in paragraph 7.5.2 of his first report, because he recognised that the point only arises at flows in excess of 65 tcmd and is expressed in terms of an average flow of 85 tcmd – whereas the actual average flows to the SBR during 2000 were about 60 tcmd (i.e. the actual average was below the DWF used by Jet Tech/Elga as the average flow for design purposes).  </p>

More importantly, it was Dr Horan’s evidence that the ASP effluent was treatable, did not compromise the SBR’s selector capacity and did not explain the poor settleability experienced in the SBR: see paragraph 3.2 of his first supplemental report (<span style="font-style:italic">E3A/19</span>).  I accept Dr Horan’s evidence on this aspect of the matter in preference to that of Dr Chambers and Dr Johnstone because: (i) it is consistent with the operational history of the SBR, (ii) it is supported by the evidence of Mr Norcross and Mr Eikelboom and (iii) it is entirely supported by bench tests that Dr Horan carried out and which are fully described in Appendix 2 to his first supplemental report (<span style="font-style:italic">E3A/50-56</span>).</p>

In fact, after take-over, because of the unexpected nature of the influent (i.e. in particular, its unexpectedly low BOD and high TSS, compared with that specified), the SBR was never operated at the design F/M: see generally Dr Horan’s first report sections 7.33 to 7.116 (<span style="font-style:italic">E3/53 onwards</span>).  The average operating F/M ratios never went above 0.028 and, by March 2001, they had sunk as low as 0.014.

Thus, for example, the agreed tables show that, in order to treat a flow of 136 tcmd with a BOD load of 6.89t/d: (i) the 6-tank SBR would require an MLSS of 1800mg/l and an SSVI of 110ml/g, if operated at an aerated sludge age of 14.1 days, (ii) the 5-tank SBR would require an MLSS of 2500mg/l and a SSVI of 90ml/g, if operated at an aerated sludge age of 13.2 days and (iii) the lower the aerated sludge age at which the SBR was operated, the less MLSS that would be required and the greater the SSVI that could be tolerated.  </p>

According to the jointly agreed tables, this would require the SBR to be operated with an SSVI of about 100ml/g.

However, for the reasons already given (see paragraphs 510 to 515 above), I am satisfied that a sludge age of 12 days is sufficient for nitrification and the agreed tables show that, with a sludge age of 12 days, the appropriate operating SSVI (which will ensure that there is no solids’ carry-over) would be increased to 120ml/g.</p>

The problems with nitrification prior to mid-May 2000 were almost entirely due to the loss of control in late December 1999/early January 2000 and the deliberate strategy of bringing the solids’ carry-over problem under control (see paragraphs 231 to 258 above).  As I have already indicated, it was therefore common ground that it would be unfair to attach any significance to the nitrification problems experienced during this period (see paragraph 271 above).  To the extent that there were a small number of failures thereafter, I am satisfied that the most likely explanation for those is that, from time to time, there were incidents of industrial pollution and/or some other form of toxicity in the SBR influent, for which Taylor Woodrow/Biwater were not responsible, that temporarily inhibited nitrification (see, for example, paragraph 359 above).  Unfortunately, it is not possible to be more precise about this aspect of the matter, because the documentation relating to industrial pollution during the relevant period was only made available after the trial had started and a detailed investigation of the matters referred to in that documentation was not possible (see, in particular, the documents contained in <span style="font-style:italic">C92</span>).</p>

As to that, for the reasons already explained (see paragraphs 510 to 515 and 520 above), I do not accept Dr Chambers’ evidence that a minimum sludge age of 15 days would be required to achieve full nitrification throughout the year.  As it seems to me, that leaves only the further point made by Dr Chambers on this aspect of the matter, namely that, when operating on 5 tanks at FFT, the available reaction time would only be about 10 minutes, which would be insufficient to achieve full nitrification: see paragraph 6.2.15 of his first report (<span style="font-style:italic">E1/20</span>).</p>

As Mr Elliott pointed out (see paragraph 15 above), the contract provides appropriate machinery for testing the SBR’s ability to meet the performance requirements, i.e. the four 28-day seasonal performance tests.  Although I have held that it is open to Yorkshire Water to prove its case, notwithstanding the fact that it did not subject the SBR to any of the contractual performance tests (see paragraph 38 above), this is obviously a difficult burden to discharge, particularly in a case where (as here) the Plant in question performed perfectly satisfactorily for significant periods of time (in particular, from June 2000 to November 2000).</p>

Having regard to Dr Horan’s unchallenged evidence (as to which, see paragraph 527 below), it is clear that this criticism by Dr Chambers is subject to a further limiting factor, namely that the risk of ammonia failure due to insufficient react time would only arise in winter, when operating at FFT <span style="font-weight:bold">and</span> at or about peak BOD loads. </p>

It was also accepted by Yorkshire Water that the peak BOD load of 7.58t/d would hardly ever coincide with FFT, because maximum flow normally results from heavy rainfall and this has the effect of diluting the sewage: see Mr Holmes’ evidence to that effect: <span style="font-style:italic">Transcript, Day 6/69-70</span>).</p>

However, I am satisfied that the likelihood of such a conjunction of events would be so remote as to be, to all intents, non-existent.

Furthermore, Dr Chambers had made no allowance for the fact that the fill period of 25 minutes at FFT would be entirely aerobic and that there would be some reaction taking place during that period.  I therefore accept Mr Streatfeild-James’s submission that both these factors meant that Dr Chambers took too gloomy a view of the difficulties of nitrification at FFT and full loads in winter (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 525 (5)).

As I have already indicated, the likelihood of such a conjunction of events would be so remote as to be virtually non-existent.  However, even when operating on 5 tanks, the SBR would have been able to nitrify for a sufficient period of time to cover the duration of any such very unlikely event. Accordingly, I am satisfied that such a limitation in the SBR’s treatment capacity (if limitation it be) does not provide any foundation for the suggestion that the SBR was unable to meet the performance requirements of Schedule 7, even if the performance testing had been entirely carried out on 5 tanks only.</p>

I accept the general nature of the improvement in treatment capacity that is summarised in paragraphs 540 to 541 of Biwater’s closing submissions.  I also accept Mr Streatfeild-James’ submission that the decant depth could have been increased to 2.06m by altering the set points so as to lower the bottom water level.  I accept Dr Horan’s unchallenged evidence to that effect and his calculations demonstrating that there was no hydraulic restriction to prevent this from being done: see paragraph 2.35 and Appendix 1 of Dr Horan’s first supplementary report (<span style="font-style:italic">E3A/11 and tab1</span>).  As Mr Streatfeild-James observed, an increase in decant depth was perfectly possible and would have resulted in significant improvements in both selector and treatment capacity (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 543).  In my view, this strongly supports my conclusion that Yorkshire Water has not proved that the SBR was unable to meet the Schedule 7 performance requirements.  Furthermore, had that increase in decant depth been carried out, there is every reason to believe that the SBR would have been able to meet the Schedule 7 performance requirements without difficulty, even if operated throughout on 5 tanks.  By a parity of reasoning, Yorkshire Water has failed to prove the contrary proposition.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conclusions with regard the SBR’s performance and capabilities</span>.                     The operational difficulties experienced in 2000 were caused by a number of matters that had differing effects over time.  The initial problems with set points, mechanical failures, issues over the operation of the SBR and so forth were eventually replaced by a period of conspicuously good operation and stability, where the only matter of concern was MLSS control.  MLSS levels were difficult to control because of the unexpectedly high TSS loads, which persisted throughout 2000 and for which Taylor Woodrow/Biwater were not responsible.  However, these control issues were perfectly capable of being addressed and were successfully addressed by Biwater in September and October 2000.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic">Microthrix parvicella</span> may have been present throughout 2000.  To the extent that it was present it was not there in any significant quantity, although its presence would have added to the difficulties being experienced.  However, I am satisfied that <span style="font-style:italic">microthrix parvicella</span> could have been controlled at acceptable levels by use of a suitable sludge age/F/M ratio.  Such a sludge age could have been maintained throughout the year without jeopardising nitrification.  I am satisfied that there is nothing in the performance of the SBR as originally designed and built to support the suggestion that the SBR was fundamentally defective or lacked adequate selector capacity.  I accept Mr Streatfeild-James’ submission that Dr Zuber’s assessment of the operational difficulties was entirely accurate and correct (<span style="font-style:italic">D3A/341-343</span>): i.e. the SBR was not defective, but was difficult to operate because of the varying and low BOD loads, the high and variable TSS, the high COD:BOD ratio and the high sludge yields (Biwater’s closing submissions, paragraph 442).  Unfortunately, as Mr Streatfeild-James went on to observe, Yorkshire Water had decided to determine the contract in the belief that there were fundamental defects with the SBR and that led to remedial works being undertaken that were not, as it seems to me, actually required to remedy any defect or deficiency in the design of the SBR.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in">I am satisfied that, whether by reference to its operational history or to appropriate theoretical calculation, the SBR as originally designed and built did not lack either adequate selector or treatment capacity.  Had Yorkshire Water proceeded to performance testing in the autumn of 2000 (as Biwater was anxious to do) and had the SBR been operated properly, there is every reason to believe that it would have passed the performance tests in question, particularly if the influent had been within the limits of “<span style="font-style:italic">the likely variations in flows and loads</span>”, which had not been the case for much of 2000.  Furthermore, the prospect of a successful completion of the performance tests would have been even greater if the set points had been adjusted so as to increase the decant depth, a measure that could have been carried out without the need for any of the remedial works actually carried out.  As it seems to me, it follows from these findings that Yorkshire Water has not proved that Taylor Woodrow was unable to meet the performance requirements of Schedule 7 of the main contract and its case, therefore, fails.  By a parity of reasoning, I am satisfied that the SBR was not defective as alleged in either the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March Defect Notice (see paragraph 275 above) or the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April Defect Notice (see paragraph 290 above).  It follows that, even if (contrary to my construction of the relevant terms of the main contract) Yorkshire Water is entitled to rely on any of the other contractual terms identified in the Particulars of Claim as well as the Schedule 10 absolute guarantees, the outcome of these proceedings remains the same.</p>

I am satisfied that the analysis of the evidence and of the factual circumstances that is to be found in those paragraphs is both accurate and reliable and I adopt them without repeating them. I accept as correct the submissions that are founded on that analysis.  I am fortified in that judgment by the unambiguous view taken by Earth-Tech at the time that Taylor Woodrow/Biwater were entitled to an extension of 17.5 weeks (i.e. all but .3 of a week of the period actually claimed).  Accordingly, having regard to the existing length of this judgment, I do not feel that it is either appropriate or necessary to give any further detailed reasons for my decision that Biwater and, by a parity of reasoning, Taylor Woodrow are entitled to the extension of time of 17.8 weeks claimed.  However, before passing on, I would like to acknowledge the very considerable assistance that I gained from both the detail and clarity of this part of Biwater’s closing submissions, which was such that I have been able to deal properly with the matter in the foregoing short form.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as concerns Messrs Barrow and Heale, the issue turns on whether they worked on site as electricians or whether, in view of their description as “supervisors”, they should be regarded as forming part of the site overheads.  In my view, the approach adopted by Biwater’s quantum expert (Mr Wilde) is correct.  Biwater’s site diary for 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1999 (<span style="font-style:italic">G2/tab 1/6</span>) records that Mr Heale and Mr Barrow, together with a Mr McLeod, had been authorised to work on the electrical equipment/switching by Mr Richard Rennie of Yorkshire Water.
