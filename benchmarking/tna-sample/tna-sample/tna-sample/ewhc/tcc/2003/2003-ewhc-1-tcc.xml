	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The Claimant changed its name subsequent to the transfer of engagements to its present name, but for the purposes of this judgment it is convenient to refer to it as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“CWS”</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Prior to the transfer of engagements CRS carried on a retail grocery and supermarket business through some 460 or so stores located in regions called Central and Eastern, Northern, South East, South West and Wales and Borders. The precise number of stores operated by CRS immediately prior to the transfer of engagements is a matter of some controversy in the evidence in this action, but ultimately of no significance. The range was between 436, a figure as to which Mr. Neil Braithwaite, the General Manager, Retail Finance, of CWS spoke, and 464, a number put forward by Mr. Keith Brydon, the General Manager, Retail IT of CWS. Other evidence generally concentrated in the region of 460. CRS did not operate in Scotland or Northern Ireland.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">CWS seems originally to have been, as its name suggests, a supplier of goods by wholesale, rather than by retail. However, over the years it appears to have spread its net into other areas, including providing a funerals service, to which aspect of its business I shall have to make further reference later in this judgment. By the 1990s CWS also carried on a similar retail grocery business to that of CRS. Immediately prior to the transfer of the engagements of CRS to CWS that retail business was carried on through some 650 or so stores. Again the evidence on behalf of CWS conflicted as to exactly how many stores CWS operated immediately prior to the transfer of engagements, but again the question of the precise number is of no significance. CWS operated in regions called Central and Eastern, North Eastern (including Cumbria), Northern Ireland, Northern, Scotland and South East. CWS did not operate in Wales or the South West of England. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Although the names Central and Eastern, Northern and South East were each used by CRS and CWS to describe regions in which they respectively operated stores, in fact only in the Greater Nottingham area and in the South East of England did CRS and CWS operate stores in close proximity to one another. It seems that there were in total some 25 CRS stores which were close to CWS stores.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It is notorious that in recent times a feature of the retail market in foodstuffs in the United Kingdom has been the presence of large supermarket groups, some of which have chosen to seek to attract custom by providing large out of town superstores. It seems that at one time CWS sought to compete with such groups by operating superstores of its own. However, in about 1997, according to the evidence of Mr. John Bowes, the Chief General Manager, Marketing of CWS, CWS carried out a strategic review of its food retail business and concluded that it should cease to compete with the operators of superstores on their own terms. Instead, CWS should concentrate on smaller supermarkets in market towns which would dominate the local trading area and on convenience stores. Against that background consideration was given within CWS to the acquisition of further stores to give effect to the new policy and achieve comprehensive national coverage.</span>

It was that end of the market which the strategic review had determined was of most benefit to CWS, on the basis that it would allow us to concentrate on our strengths, which were seen as being the smaller convenience stores, as opposed to the larger supermarket side of the market.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">A feature of the Co-operative movement at retail level from early in its history in the nineteenth century was the distribution to members of a share of profits by means of what was called a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“dividend”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. In the marketing conditions of the late twentieth century the distribution of dividend in what had been the classic manner seems to have ceased to be a characteristic of trading in retail co-operative societies. The evidence of Mr. Bowes and Mr. Braithwaite was that it had disappeared in the late 1960s.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In his first witness statement, in evidence which I accept, Mr. Bowes explained that, having decided to concentrate food retailing in the small supermarket and convenience store sector, CWS was faced with the need to try to differentiate itself from other stores in that sector. In paragraph 5.5 of his first witness statement Mr. Bowes said that from about 1995 CWS had run various trials of loyalty schemes. It was decided, following the strategic review, according to Mr. Bowes, to introduce, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“as a key differentiator between CWS stores and our opposition in the market place”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, a loyalty card scheme, which in broad general terms entitled holders of loyalty cards to build up an entitlement having a cash value on purchases of certain types of items – Co-op brand products and fresh produce – and to use such entitlement in payment for goods or to redeem it for Sterling currency. Because of the nostalgic appeal of the classic dividend scheme this loyalty card scheme was called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Dividend”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. I shall refer to it by that name in this judgment. In its original form the rate at which entitlement could be accumulated under the Dividend was 5% of the retail price per item on Co-op brand products and fresh produce. Purchases of other products were not eligible for entitlement. In various of the documents put before me during the trial the original Dividend scheme, to which I shall refer as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Original Dividend”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, was described as a 5% + 0% scheme. Subsequently the Original Dividend was revised so that the rate at which entitlement could be accumulated on purchases of Co-op brand products and fresh produce was reduced to 3%, but other brands of products became eligible for entitlement on purchases at a rate of 1% of the retail price per item. Some purchases of goods remained ineligible for entitlement, so the revised scheme, to which I shall refer as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Revised Dividend”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, was referred to as a 3% + 1% + 0% scheme.</span>

In early 1999 I was aware that Phil was addressing the issue of Millennium compliance of the CRS estate. The entire CRS estate faced the potential problem of its EPOS system not working after the Millennium. CRS also had a problem in that it did not have a uniform IT system throughout the stores, using a number of different systems which makes it difficult to service and introduce new developments. I was aware that in 1999 Phil had negotiated with ICL for an EPOS harmonisation programme which would provide CRS with a uniform platform which was also Millennium compliant.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">As I have already recorded, Phase 1 of the work contemplated by the CRS Agreement was completed satisfactorily. Before the question of carrying out the work required under the succeeding phases seriously arose CRS and CWS became involved in the discussions which led ultimately to the transfer of the engagements of CRS to CWS. An aspect of the possible merger of CRS with CWS was the anticipated need to harmonise the computer systems used in the stores operated by CRS immediately prior to the transfer of engagements (to which stores I shall refer in this judgment as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the former CRS stores”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) and those used in the stores operated at that time by CWS (to which stores I shall refer in this judgment as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the existing CWS stores”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">). In particular, it was anticipated that it would be necessary, or at any rate desirable, to introduce the Dividend into the former CRS stores after the transfer of engagements had taken place. Other features of what was on offer in the existing CWS stores which it was desired should also be available in the former CRS stores included the ability to make payments at tills in-store into Individual Savings Accounts (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“ISAs”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) and High Interest Savings Accounts (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“HISAs”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">), which I think were in fact operated for customers by Co-operative Bank. ICL and PCMS was each invited to make proposals to CWS as to how, from the point of view of provision of appropriate computer software, the computer systems of CRS and CWS could be harmonised, and the Dividend, and other desired facilities, introduced into the former CRS stores. One possibility was to replace the recently installed ISS400 in the former CRS stores with ISS300 and Vision, which were used successfully by CWS in the existing CWS stores. Another possibility was to replace Vision in the existing CWS stores with GlobalSTORE which, under the CRS Agreement, ICL had undertaken to develop for use by CRS so as to provide the functionality of SSM, at the same time as that software was installed in the former CRS stores. A third possibility was to leave the existing CWS stores as they were, but to instal GlobalSTORE, developed to provide in conjunction with ISS400 all the functionality provided to the existing CWS stores by the combination of ISS300 and Vision, in the former CRS stores. In the event it was the latter course which CWS decided to adopt. In this judgment I shall call the project to develop GlobalSTORE for installation in the former CRS stores with the capacity to offer the Dividend and the other desired facilities </span>

The case of CWS was that it accepted that alleged repudiatory breach as terminating the contract for which it contended. There were also allegations that ICL made misrepresentations in order to induce CWS to enter into the contract contended for. The damages claimed amounted to a little less than £11,000,000. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">ICL resisted the claim of CWS. The position adopted in the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim was that the contract alleged on behalf of CWS in the Particulars of Claim was denied. Rather, so it was said, the work done to seek to develop GlobalSTORE for CWS was undertaken pursuant to the CRS Agreement after the obligations of CRS under that agreement had passed to CWS. On this basis ICL sought to rely upon clauses 9 and 13.7 of the conditions having the reference UKGC0998, clauses 11.1 and 17.1 of the conditions having the reference UKPS0998 and clauses 6.1 and 9.1 of the conditions having the reference UKSE0998. Alternatively, it was contended that there was no contract under which the work was done, the position being that it was anticipated that a contract would be agreed as a result of negotiations in which CWS and ICL engaged over an extended period, but that that never happened. It was asserted on behalf of ICL that, whichever of the foregoing was the correct analysis, the CRS Agreement did not run its full course, with the result that the provisions in Schedule One for revision upwards of the charges made for the services actually provided to CRS came into effect. ICL thus counterclaimed a sum of £1,018,034 under this head. Further or alternatively, so it was contended, the termination by CWS of the continued involvement of ICL in the development of software for the former CRS stores itself amounted to a repudiation of the CRS Agreement in respect of which ICL was entitled to damages by way of compensation for loss of profits calculated at some £1,473,000.</span>

Both parties were familiar with the CRS agreement and the modes of working provided for by that agreement. These provided (amongst other things) for the production of detailed FRS, project plans with delivery timetables, change control and a testing and acceptance regime. The negotiations between CWS and ICL proceeded on the basis that those terms would be carried forward to the CWS agreement and this was reflected by the draft written agreements passing between the parties.

These went through a number of changes but reached their final form in the draft agreement Version 7 dated 14/6/2000.

In any event the alleged terms pleaded in respect of the alleged agreement were not agreed and are insufficiently precise to be capable of being enforced.

The contract in question was said to have been made in or about March or April 2000 by conduct or implication. That suggests that it was not said that it was formed by the acceptance on the part of one side of an offer made on the part of the other. I shall turn in the next section of this judgment to consider the law of England in relation to contract formation, so far as is relevant to this case. Suffice for the present to say, that, while a contract can theoretically come into existence either by conduct or by implication, these are not the means by which commercial contracts are usually made.</span>

It is therefore surprising to find the plea in paragraph 24 of the Particulars of Claim that, </span>

But if one finds two parties working together in circumstances where quite clearly they both treat a contract as being on foot, then the function of the parties is to show to the court what the contract was and what its terms were. It serves no useful purpose to say, “Well, both of these parties were wholly mistaken. They never had a contract at all. They were all doing it for nothing.” That would not be a pragmatic or sensible solution to a problem if… The court may come to the conclusion that they were not working to a contract and they simply hoped that one would be signed, but once the court is convinced that they are working to a contract, then the question has to be asked, what was the contract and how did it arise. It may well be no more than a court says, “It is clear that by point X in time there was a contract because both parties believed there was, both parties were working towards it”.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">[1949] 1 KB 628 at p. 630. The fact that the transaction was performed on both sides will often make it unrealistic to argue that there was no intention to enter into legal relations. It will often make it difficult to submit that the contract is void for vagueness or uncertainty. Specifically, the fact that the transaction is executed makes it easier to imply a term resolving any uncertainty, or, alternatively, it may make it possible to treat a matter not finalised in negotiations as inessential. In this case fully executed transactions are under consideration. Clearly, similar considerations may sometimes be relevant in partly executed transactions. Fourthly, if a contract only comes into existence during and as a result of performance of the transaction it will frequently be possible to hold that the contract impliedly and retrospectively covers pre-contractual performance.

What was said to have given rise to the claims in the action was the fact that ICL had not done that which it was contended it had agreed to do. Mr. Mawrey’s submission on analysis was that I should extract from the exchanges in correspondence and in discussion between CWS and ICL any element ever apparently agreed and aggregate such elements so as to make an overall agreement at the end. Mr. Henry Carr Q.C., who appeared with Miss Jacqueline Reid on behalf of ICL, submitted that on a consideration of the correspondence and other exchanges between the parties as a whole it was plain that there never was an agreement because of the matters as to which the parties wished to reach agreement but did not. The parties did not, submitted Mr. Carr, intend to enter into any binding contract unless or until they had reached complete agreement on all issues about which they had been in negotiation.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">There are in my opinion two grounds on which the court ought to hold that there never was a contract. The first is that the language used was so obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention. The object of the court is to do justice between the parties and the court will do its best, if satisfied that there was an ascertainable and determinate intention to contract, to give effect to that intention, looking at substance and not mere form. It will not be deterred by mere difficulties of interpretation. Difficulty is not synonymous with ambiguity so long as any definite meaning can be extracted. But the test of intention is to be found in the words used. If these words considered however broadly and untechnically and with due regard to all the just implications, fail to evince any definite meaning on which the court can safely act, the court has no choice but to say that there is no contract. Such a position is not often found. But I think that it is found in this case. My reason for so thinking is not only based on the actual vagueness and unintelligibility of the words used, but is confirmed by the startling diversity of explanations, tendered by those who think there was a bargain, of what the bargain was. I do not think it would be right to hold the appellants to any particular version. It was all left too vague. There are many cases in the books of what are called illusory contracts, that is, where the parties may have thought they were making a contract but failed to arrive at a definite bargain. It is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to give it a practical meaning. Its terms must be so definite, or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties, that the promises and performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain. In my opinion that requirement was not satisfied in this case.</span>

They did, indeed, accept the position that there should be some form of hire-purchase agreement, but they never went on to complete their agreement by settling between them what the terms of the hire-purchase agreement were to be. The furthest point they reached was an understanding or agreement to agree upon hire-purchase terms.</span>

This may be misleading, since the word “essential” in that context is ambiguous. If by “essential” one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true: the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract. If by “essential” one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract, then the statement is tautologous. If by an “essential” one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail, the statement is untrue. It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and, if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant. It is the parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge “the masters of their contractual fate”. Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. It happens everyday when parties enter into so-called “heads of agreement”.</span>

It seems to me that that for which Mr. Mawrey was contending is exactly that which Lloyd LJ pointed out was not legitimate, namely that it was for the court to decide which terms it regarded as important and which terms it regarded as less important or as matters of detail, and on that basis to decide whether the parties had agreed all that which the court considered necessary for there to be a workable agreement. That, in my view, is a total misapprehension as to the correct principle. The correct principle, as Lloyd LJ put it, is that, </span>

Mr. Mawrey reminded me that the action was listed for trial of all issues and that it had not seemed to anyone, including the judge who had had responsibility for managing the case up to that point, that a trial of any issue preliminary to any other was appropriate. Mr. Carr did not suggest that any course should be taken other than that all issues should be tried. I was conscious that ICL had an interest in vindicating, if it could, its commercial reputation in relation to serious allegations of almost a professional negligence character which had been made against it by CWS. In the end I decided to let the trial run its course. However, it is clearly necessary to consider what should be the costs consequences of claims being advanced on behalf of CWS against ICL which were, from a legal point of view, doomed from the start, and those claims being persisted in notwithstanding a transparent indication from me on more than one occasion at the beginning of the trial what the difficulties were.</span>

Mr. Carr, in a brief, but helpful, opening on behalf of ICL, made plain that one of the alternatives for which ICL contended was that there was no relevant contract between ICL and CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project. He reminded me of the analysis of Lord Goff of Chieveley, then Robert Goff J, in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">British Steel Corporation v. Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co. Ltd. </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">[1984] 1 All ER 504, in particular from page 511 onwards, of the implications of there being no relevant contract between parties who had had mutual dealings, namely that there could be no question of any breach of any obligation of a contractual character by one side or the other because neither side owed the other any obligations of a contractual character at all. However, as Mr. Carr made clear, it was actually ICL’s primary case that the work done in relation to the GlobalSTORE project was carried out under the CRS Agreement, the obligation of CRS to perform which had transferred to CWS upon the transfer of the engagements of CRS to CWS. That case was pleaded at paragraph 31 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim as follows:-</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The way in which the case was put in paragraph 31 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim rather ran together two issues which are logically separate. The first is whether, after the transfer of engagements, CWS became under the obligations arising under the CRS Agreement which it fell to CRS to perform prior to the transfer. As to that there has been no dispute before me. It was accepted on both sides that the effect of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">s.51</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> of the 1965 Act</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">was that that result was achieved. The second issue is whether, the burden of performing the obligations previously falling to be performed by CRS having passed to CWS, the CRS Agreement should be treated as governing the work undertaken by ICL in relation to the GlobalSTORE project for CWS. That, as was implicitly acknowledged in paragraph 31 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, depends upon whether the CRS Agreement was varied after the transfer of engagements so as to apply to the work carried out for CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project in place of the Phases 2, 3 and 4 for which the CRS Agreement provided initially. As a matter of law an existing agreement can only effectively be varied by the making of a further legally binding agreement by which the parties to the original agreement, or, in this case, the parties for the time being bound to perform the obligations for which the original agreement provided, agree to the variation. In other words, exactly the same issues in respect of the mechanism by which the agreement can in law be made and as to contractual intention arise in relation to an agreement to vary the CRS Agreement as arise in relation to the contract for which CWS contended. Applying the principles discussed in the preceding section of this judgment ICL’s primary case that the CRS Agreement was varied so as to apply to the work done for CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project seems unpromising given that it is common ground that the parties engaged in extensive negotiations for a new agreement, which negotiations did not come to fruition as a result of failure to agree on issues regarded by CWS as fundamental, namely that ICL should agree to pay liquidated damages in the event that it failed to deliver what it should deliver by some date which also needed to be agreed, and as to whether the standard conditions of ICL should be incorporated into the agreement.  Whether a variation of the CRS Agreement was agreed is ultimately a question of mixed fact and law, but it is ironic that the answer to the question whether such a variation was agreed seems, in advance of considering the evidence of fact, likely to be negative for the reasons summarised in paragraph 32 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim.</span>

If there was a contract and ICL was in breach of it, no damages are likely to be recoverable for misrepresentation that would not equally be recoverable as damages for breach of contract.

None of this was of any practical relevance, as was accepted at paragraph 212 of the submissions, if the contract for which CWS  contended was found proved. Equally, bearing in mind that at this stage in the submissions what was being said was that the representations alleged induced CWS to enter into the alleged contract in the first place, and thereafter to agree to a variation of the contract, none of this was of any relevance if it were not found that the contract contended for had been concluded.</span>

As to paragraph 20.1 ICL represented that it was capable of adapting GlobalSTORE so as to incorporate the additional functionality required by CWS (including the Dividend). As set out in paragraph 27, it was not so capable and admitted as such. Similarly, as to the representation set out in paragraph 20.2, GlobalSTORE was not at the time of the representation (nor ever became) sufficiently advanced in its development to permit a pilot project to be run in August 2000 and the system to be rolled out across the network of former CRS stores in September 2000.

To that extent therefore, and if and insofar as it may be necessary to do so, CWS will contend that ICL was negligent in making the misrepresentations.</span>

In the absence of any pleaded claim I do not propose to consider the possibility of a restitutionary claim further, beyond remarking that it by no means follows from the fact that there was no concluded contract between CWS and ICL for the undertaking of the GlobalSTORE project that there was no consideration for the making of any payments which CWS actually made to ICL in connection with that project. ICL would, in principle, have a claim in restitution for payment for work done at the request of CWS. Payments made voluntarily by CWS to discharge that liability would be amply supported by consideration.</span>

However, that conclusion is reinforced by a consideration of the evidence as to the facts of the negotiations between the parties. Those facts also demonstrate that the primary case of ICL, that the CRS Agreement was varied so as to encompass the undertaking of the GlobalSTORE project for CWS, was not made out. My overall conclusion is that no contract of any sort was made between CWS and ICL in relation to the carrying out of the GlobalSTORE project. Quite simply, the negotiations between the parties in respect of a contract to govern the carrying out of the GlobalSTORE project never fructified as a concluded agreement. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to rehearse extensively the steps in negotiations between CWS and ICL in relation to a possible contract for the undertaking by ICL of work for CWS in respect of the GlobalSTORE project. It is common ground that there were extensive negotiations over an extended period and that in the course of those negotiations a number of versions of a proposed written contract were produced. It is also common ground that no written agreement ever was signed. A major reason why negotiations never progressed beyond the stage of consideration of commercial terms to seeking legal advice on drafting on the CWS side was the refusal of ICL to agree to the payment of liquidated damages. Mr. Mawrey, in opening CWS’s case, sought to deal with that question in this way:-</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Our case on that is that if the parties do not reach agreement on penalties, then there are no penalties, but it is not fatal to there being an agreement with regard to the essentials of the contract.</span>

	    <p class="BlockText" style="margin-left:0.49in">For the reasons which I have sought to explain, that solution just is not satisfactory. The real question is whether the parties had any intention of entering into any contract at all, whether a fresh agreement or by way of variation of the CRS Agreement, without the issue of liquidated damages being resolved, and so my consideration of the evidence will focus on what the positions of the parties was on that question. Mr. Mawrey’s suggested solution really amounts to no more than saying that in order to bring into existence a contract upon which it can sue CWS retrospectively did not seek to insist upon that which at the time was of fundamental importance.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">While the question of liquidated damages was probably the most important single issue raised during the course of negotiations between CWS and ICL over which agreement was not reached, it was not the only one. Associated with it logically was the question of agreement of dates for the provision of something failure to produce which on the part of ICL would trigger the obligation to pay liquidated damages. ICL’s case was that no fixed dates ever were agreed, only target dates identified by CWS. Mr. Mawrey, on behalf of CWS characterised what ICL contended were only target dates as contractually binding, notwithstanding that they changed over time in the light of progress. Mr. Mawrey submitted that the correct analysis of the alteration in dates over time was that the parties had agreed variations to their contract. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">ICL also asserted through Mr. Carr that there was never any agreement as to the exact scope of the GlobalSTORE project or what CWS would pay ICL for carrying it out. On those issues the position of Mr. Mawrey on behalf of CWS was more equivocal, no doubt because of the potential link with ICL’s counterclaim for loss of profit in relation to the cancellation of the GlobalSTORE project. Essentially the position of CWS was that the scope of the GlobalSTORE was sufficiently clearly known for there to be a binding agreement in relation to it, but not sufficiently defined for ICL to be able to demonstrate what loss of profit it sustained as a result of the cancellation of it. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">As I have indicated, negotiations at least on the CWS side were conducted at a commercial level. The leading role in the conduct of those negotiations on that side was entrusted to Mr. Adrian Marks, who at the material time was employed by CWS as Head of IT Development, IT Retail. He reported directly to Mr. Brydon. He was assisted by Mr. Garry Goodby, who is now the deputy general manager of IT at CWS, but at the material time was head of IT services. Mr. Marks was also assisted in the negotiations by Mr. Peter Dennis, who was employed at the material time as a business systems development manager for the in-store information technology systems of CWS and who was brought into the CWS/CRS IT integration project team to take responsibility in particular for in-store systems. It seems that Mr. Brydon was in overall charge of the negotiations on the CWS side, although he himself had little involvement in the actual discussion of particular proposed provisions. His role appears to have been simply to deal with matters of principle, either directly with representatives of ICL or by giving appropriate instructions to Mr. Marks, Mr. Goodby or Mr. Dennis. However, the ultimate strategic direction of negotiations and focus of decision on matters of principle appears to have resided with Mr. Malcolm Hepworth, the Retail Controller of CWS, or with Mr. Graham Melmoth, the Chief Executive.</span>

The first was that, as Miss Corinne Taylor-Smith, who at the material time was employed by CWS as an Information Systems Auditor, said in her witness statement, CWS, and in particular Mr. Brydon, was aware of the provisions of the CRS Agreement for the increase in the price of the services undertaken by ICL thereunder for CRS in the event that the CRS Agreement did not run its full course.

Hence the identification by Mr. Brydon as early as December 1999 in his contact with Mr. Pickett of ICL of the issue of what was to happen to the CRS Agreement.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The second circumstance the malevolent influence of which hung over the dealings of CWS and ICL in relation to the GlobalSTORE project was the perception of Mr. Melmoth, and, it seems, of Mr. Brydon, that a grievous wrong had been done to CWS by ICL over some project concerning the funerals side of the business of CWS, and that ICL’s performance under other arrangements between CWS and ICL had been less than satisfactory. This factor is obviously linked to the circumstance to which I have referred in the preceding paragraph, as it would have increased the reluctance of CWS to deal further with ICL. Exactly what the perceived injustice in relation to the funerals side of the business was did not emerge during the course of the trial before me. Mr. Hepworth told me in cross-examination that he had heard about it, but he denied that the issue influenced his own actions. I accept that evidence, but, for the reasons which will appear as I consider the course of contemporaneous communications later in this judgment, I am satisfied that the funerals issue did colour the approach of Mr. Brydon, and the terms of his reports to Mr. Hepworth, who, of course acted on the terms of those reports in good faith. To put it bluntly, I am satisfied that, in the light of whatever it was that was considered to have happened in relation to the funerals side of the business of CWS, Mr. Melmoth and Mr. Brydon would not willingly have had further dealings with ICL, but felt that they had little choice commercially because of the sums which CWS would have to pay by way of price revisions under the CRS Agreement if CWS was not able to negotiate a discharge of that agreement. Had it been necessary to do so, I should have found that CWS was in fact wholly uninfluenced by the alleged representations of ICL which were said to have induced CWS to enter into the contract for which it contended. It was the consideration to which I have referred which was the determining factor in CWS dealing with ICL at all.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Having been dragged reluctantly into dealing with ICL at all, there was then a concern on the part of Mr. Brydon, and, it seems, Mr. Melmoth, either to extricate CWS from its dealings with ICL in relation to the GlobalSTORE project, if that could be done without exposing CWS to risk under the CRS Agreement, or at least to seek to use any opportunity presented by the course of the GlobalSTORE project to exact revenge for what was considered to have happened on the funerals project. Either way, Mr. Brydon and Mr. Melmoth were looking for trouble, given the slightest pretext. As I shall demonstrate, the feeling of Mr. Brydon that a very firm line should be taken with ICL was communicated to his subordinates and influenced their own approach to ICL. While it seems that the festering issue of the problem over the funerals project was the main grievance of Mr. Melmoth and Mr. Brydon, they also felt aggrieved over the quality of the service which ICL had provided to CWS in relation to what were called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“break fix arrangements”</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> were, in general terms, support and maintenance arrangements for ICL equipment installed in the existing CWS stores.

That is perhaps understandable, given the fact that at the outset of discussions, before the transfer of engagements, and, indeed, for a time after that, ICL was continuing to perform the CRS Agreement in accordance with its terms. As discussions continued, Phase 4 was spoken of as split into two, with Phase 4A being talked about as that part of the GlobalSTORE project which CWS was minded to have implemented first so as, for example, to be able to offer the Dividend in the former CRS stores, and Phase 4B being less urgently required features of GlobalSTORE.</span>

We had spent £1.78 million on GlobalSTORE licences and CRS had already paid for the ISS/400 licences which would be needed in conjunction with the GlobalSTORE licences. We therefore explained to ICL that we felt extremely exposed if they failed to deliver as promised and as a result we wanted them to make proposals to us as to what penalties they would agree to in order that it should be painful for them if they failed to deliver. At the time we did not mention any figures but we wanted them to be significant enough for it to be painful for ICL and to focus their minds on ensuring that they delivered everything that had been agreed within the timescale. I do not recall them ever saying no to our request for penalties, however they never truly responded. Each time I raised the issue with John Pickett he said he would discuss it internally at ICL and come back to me. However, he never responded with a firm yes or no, which led me to believe the issues </span>

Adrian and I both felt very strongly that if ICL had the solution they claimed to have, and the skills and resources to implement it within their timeframe, they should be prepared to back this up with financial penalties of some description if they failed to perform. Although our discussions on this issue went on for many months, they never really “got off the ground”.

There are a number of indications in contemporaneous documents, to which I shall refer later in this judgment, that Mr. Brydon was antipathetic towards ICL, was dealing with ICL with reluctance, and was on the look-out for any serious opportunity for CWS to terminate its connection with ICL unless ICL provided in former CRS stores a mirror of the functionality available in former CWS stores in relation in particular to the Dividend very swiftly. The rigid insistence of Mr. Brydon and other senior executives of CWS upon the agreement of ICL to pay liquidated damages was, I am satisfied, largely a reflection of this animosity.</p>

However, for the present it is sufficient to identify particular events which provide the background to stages in negotiations. The first particular event which needs to be mentioned is the suggestion made by ICL in mid-May 2000 that in order to overcome difficulties in specifying in detail the technical requirements of Dividend for ISS400 and to avoid the delay which resolving those difficulties could cause, it might be sensible to use ISS300, the platform in the existing CWS stores, as the platform also in the former CRS stores.

He then prepared a briefing paper for Mr. Hepworth on the question whether CWS should accept the development of GlobalSTORE so as to operate on an ISS300 platform.

However, what his summary in his witness statement does not mention, but which is clear from the briefing paper itself, is CWS was not prepared to pay ICL any additional sum for the revised scheme using ISS300.

It is clear from the evidence of Mr. Brydon in cross-examination in the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph that he at all times knew that the issue of liquidated damages was not resolved and that CWS had no intention of concluding a binding agreement with ICL which did not include a provision for liquidated damages. According to the evidence of Mr. Brydon, which I accept on this point, a decision had been made at the highest level in CWS, Mr. Melmoth, that ICL was to agree to accept liability to pay liquidated damages.</span>

It seems to me that the reality is that far from it being the anticipated failure of ICL to deliver software of satisfactory quality that prompted the drafting of the letter, it was exactly the opposite fear, that the software would be of satisfactory quality, that prompted the drafting of the letter. By this stage, in my judgment, Mr. Brydon, at least, had decided to use the GlobalSTORE project as a means of seeking revenge against ICL for the grievances real or imagined to which I have already referred. There is no other obvious explanation for steps being taken as early as the beginning of December to anticipate the termination of relationships between ICL and CWS or for the fact that when ICL was indicating a cast iron guarantee of delivery of software no later than 5 February 2001 CWS purported to terminate its supposed contract with ICL on 29 January 2001. Moreover, it is obvious from a consideration of the terms of the letter in fact sent to Mr. Christou on 5 January 2001, which contained references to a meeting arranged with Mr. Christou on 26 January 2001 and to events on and after 18 December 2000, that if it had been first drafted as early as 8 December 2000, the draft was substantially revised thereafter.</span>

No notes of the meeting were apparently made by any of the participants. Mr. Brydon at paragraph 127 of his first witness statement said that at that meeting Mr. Pickett told him that a pilot date, that is to say a date upon which a pilot trial of GlobalSTORE in a store could commence, of 29 January 2001 was achievable. When Mr. Brydon asked whether he could believe ICL, he was told, according to him, </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Mr. Pickett’s evidence in paragraph 23 of his second witness statement was that he could not recall exactly what was said. That was also his position when he was cross-examined about this matter. I am inclined to accept the evidence of Mr. Brydon as to what Mr. Pickett said, as Mr. Pickett does not contest it. That account was confirmed by the terms of an e-mail dated 3 January 2001 sent by Mr. Brydon to Mr. Pickett which referred to the assurance as to which Mr. Brydon spoke having been given. Mr. Pickett replied to that e-mail in an e-mail dated 4 January 2001 and did not dispute that he had said that the date of 29 January 2001 was achievable.</span>

I think this is appropriately highlighted by the fact that at no point did I ever feel that a new agreement had been reached between ICL and CWS as to the timescales for the development. As set out above, under the agreement between ICL and CRS, a broad estimate had been put on the timescale for the development of GlobalSTORE, in the context of detailed contractual terms which made clear that ICL’s only obligation was to develop the software within a reasonable period of time. All subsequent discussions with CWS as to timescale involved CWS attempting to insist that ICL make a definitive commitment to produce developed software within a specified period of time, with liquidated damages (or “penalties” as CWS often referred to them) which would apply if ICL did not meet those timescales. What ICL anticipated was that the existing contractual obligation as to development within a reasonable period of time, but that with an estimate for that period of time stated in the agreement, would subsist in any new agreement between ICL and CWS. In the context of such a major difference between the parties as to what the obligations as to timescale would be. </span>

I also accept that those discussions never did result in the conclusion of a fresh agreement. Moreover, I accept that a consequence of the failure to make a new agreement in respect of the GlobalSTORE project was that the CRS Agreement continued in full force and effect, even if neither party took any real steps to perform it in relation to stages after the installation of ISS400 software in the former CRS stores, other than by continuing to run in two former CRS stores until the end of August 2000 a pilot trial of SSM which had commenced prior to the transfer of the engagements of CRS to CWS. However, what seems to me to quite clear is that both Mr. Pickett and Mr. Carlin were in error, at least as a matter of law, in taking the view that the work done on the GlobalSTORE  project after the transfer of engagements was referable to and governed by the CRS Agreement. In my view, if understandably, both Mr. Pickett and Mr. Carlin have failed to distinguish between the question whether the CRS Agreement continued in force, and the question what, if it continued in force, it governed. The answer to the first of these questions, in my judgment, is that the CRS Agreement continued in force because the parties bound by it did not agree to discharge it. However, it could only apply to something other than its original subject matter if the parties bound by it agreed that that should be so. As to the latter question, both Mr. Pickett and Mr. Carlin were firm that no fresh agreement was made between ICL and CWS, and that means that, as a matter of law, the CRS Agreement could not have been varied so as to apply to the development of GlobalSTORE undertaken by ICL for CWS.</span>

Mr. Butt felt that the conclusions which he and Miss Taylor-Smith reached were the result of their own consideration of the totality of the material available to them.

It certainly is striking that the conclusion which Miss Taylor-Smith and Mr. Butt reached coincided with the view expressed in their respective witness statements by Mr. Pickett and Mr. Carlin. However, for the reasons which I have already set out, it seems to me that Mr. Pickett and Mr. Carlin were incorrect as a matter of law.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">That the parties failed to conclude a legally binding agreement in relation to the GlobalSTORE project because, principally but not entirely, of an insistence on the part of CWS that ICL agree to include in any contract some liquidated damages provision which ICL was not prepared to concede could not, it seems to me, be clearer. Thus CWS has failed to make out the contract upon which it seeks to sue. No alternative contract was contended for in the Particulars of Claim, although Mr. Mawrey in opening CWS’s case did at one point suggest that I might find some other, unpleaded, contract upon which CWS might be able to succeed in its claims. In fact, for the reasons which I have given, I am satisfied that there was no contract between the parties in relation to the GlobalSTORE project. There were negotiations for a contract. No doubt, initially at least, both sides expected that such negotiations would result in a contract. However, they plainly had not done so by the time CWS decided to walk away from further dealings with ICL. Had CWS left it there, and itself borne whatever costs were thrown away as a result of a decision to revert to the solution of installing Vision on an ISS300 platform in the former CRS stores, neither side could have had any complaint against the other in relation to the termination of the GlobalSTORE project. As it is, CWS has sought to recover from ICL its perceived losses as a result of the decision to abandon the GlobalSTORE solution. To do that it has needed to establish a contract with ICL of which ICL was in breach such that CWS was entitled to treat ICL as having repudiated the contract. CWS having failed to make out the contract for which it contended, this action fails and must be dismissed.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The way in which Mr. Mawrey explained the nature of the case in the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph was a considerable departure from the pleaded case. It was also wholly unsupported by any evidence. I have already set out the passage from the witness statement of Mr. Hepworth in which he dealt with the making of the decision to cease going forward with ICL. I have also quoted the letter dated 29 January 2001 written by Mr. Hepworth to Mr. Christou. What seems plain from those two pieces of evidence is that at the meeting with Mr. Christou on 26 January 2001 the question of whether ICL was prepared to agree to pay liquidated damages was raised. Mr. Christou indicated that ICL was not prepared to agree to pay such damages. On the CWS side the possibility of a cessation of relationships was then brought up. Mr. Christou indicated that ICL would be prepared to accept a termination of its association with CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project, if that was the wish of CWS, in which event ICL would co-operate in an orderly process of disengagement. In the letter dated 29 January 2001 Mr. Hepworth recorded that it was the wish of CWS to proceed no further with ICL. In the result, therefore, any contract between ICL and CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project was either terminated by consent or by reason of the failure of ICL to agree to vary it so as to include a provision for liquidated damages. While Mr. Hepworth in his letter professed a lack of confidence on the part of CWS in ICL, neither in his witness statement nor in his letter dated 29 January 2001 did he indicate that the reason for termination of any contract was that ICL had failed to do by a particular date something which it had promised to do by that date. Although Mr. Hepworth’s letter to Mr. Christou was dated 29 January 2001, it would seem likely that the decision to proceed no further with ICL was in fact taken immediately after the meeting on 26 January 2001 in the light of the refusal of Mr. Christou to offer that ICL would agree to pay liquidated damages. Consequently, whatever Mr. Mawrey now says, it does not appear that in fact ICL doing something by 29 January 2001 was actually critical to CWS at all. Thus even if I had been persuaded that CWS had made out the contract for which it contends, I should have held that ICL had not, as a matter of law, repudiated that contract, because it had not, as at the date the contract came to an end, been in breach of a term of such significance as to indicate that it did not intend to be bound by its contract. Further and in any event, even if I had found that ICL had been in repudiatory breach of a contract, I should have held that CWS had not accepted such repudiation as bringing the contract to an end. Rather the contract was terminated either by mutual agreement or by CWS in breach of contract on account of the failure of ICL to agree to a variation which CWS wanted, namely the introduction of a provision that ICL should pay liquidated damages. For these reasons also, therefore, the claims of CWS in this action fail.</span>

However, in order to be entitled to damages for delay CWS would have had to establish that the delay of which it complained amounted to a breach on the part of ICL of some contractual obligation to do something by a particular date. That CWS failed to do, so Mr. Mawrey’s point is not relevant.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Much of the evidence at trial was devoted to the question of the quality of the performance by ICL of the work of development of GlobalSTORE to suit the requirements of CWS. Broadly speaking the complaints were that ICL did not produce software, or code, of acceptable quality by the dates required by CWS or indicated by ICL as achievable. A number of CWS witnesses, in particular Mr. Brydon, Mr. Young and Mr. Dennis, told me that they believed that ICL was fully informed as to the requirements of CWS in relation to what the software being developed should be capable of doing because of the fact that the ISS300 platform upon which Vision operated in the existing CWS stores was an ICL product and ICL had been the prime contractor in relation to the existing CWS system. This was notwithstanding that Vision was a product of PCMS, a commercial rival of ICL. Mr. Dennis told me that he thought that as a result of the previous work done by ICL it had within its corporate being the knowledge of what Vision did and thus should easily have been able to determine what functionality GlobalSTORE needed to possess to be able to service the Dividend and the other requirements of CWS for the software in the former CRS stores to be able to mimic the performance of the software in the existing CWS stores. I accept that that is what Mr. Dennis actually believed. He is no longer employed by CWS, and in common with other former CWS employees who were called to give evidence on behalf of CWS at the trial was noticeably more relaxed and even-handed in his evidence than those witnesses who had leading roles and who continue to be employed by CWS. It is possible that Mr. Young also genuinely believed that ICL was already in possession of all it needed to know in order to develop GlobalSTORE to suit the needs of CWS. Mr. Young gave oral evidence for some two days and so I had a good opportunity to assess him. I am quite satisfied that he was completely out of his depth as project manager of the GlobalSTORE project on the CWS side. He accepted that his technical knowledge of software was limited. This was not necessarily a deficiency in a project manager for the project, but it meant that he needed to be conscious of his need on occasion for technical input from an appropriate colleague. He seems to have given little attention to the communicated requirements of ICL for specifications and information and wholly insufficient consideration of the detail of project plans sent to him by ICL. He was inclined to regard as written in stone dates communicated to him by ICL as estimates contingent upon CWS doing something, and thus to make over-optimistic reports to his superiors. His main concern seems to have been his status. He appears to have been obsessed with the concern that he should be the sole point of communication between ICL and CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project. The deficiencies of Mr. Young as project manager seem to have been a major contributory cause in the course the project took. I have already commented on Mr. Brydon and his reluctance to deal with ICL at all. I do not believe his assertions that he thought that ICL already possessed the information which it needed to develop GlobalSTORE to suit the needs of CWS as a result of its earlier involvement with the provision of Vision on an ISS300 platform in the existing CWS stores. Mr. Brydon was, I find, always astute to find fault with ICL if he could. In my judgment his preferred solution to the problem of harmonising the information technology systems of CRS and CWS was installing in the former CRS stores software identical to that in the existing CWS stores. It suited his purposes for Mr. Young to overlook a vital aspect of equipping ICL to progress the GlobalSTORE development work so that Mr. Brydon could be able to criticise ICL for failing to meet its estimated dates for completion of various activities.</span>

ICL was invited to make presentations to representatives of CWS and CRS on 27 October 1999 and again on 15 December 1999 of possible information technology solutions to the problems which would arise on a merger of CWS and CRS.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Risks &amp; Issues”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. A risk identified was, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Lack of co-operation and commitment between ICL and PCMS due to conflicting agendas.”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> The impact of that was said to be, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Could result in key dates not being met and/or lack of quality solution”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The way to avoid that contemplated was,</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> “CWS/CRS ensure clear definition of roles, responsibilities, key deliverables &amp; dates”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Plainly the issue was that both ICL and PCMS had been invited to make presentations in relation to the resolution of the problem of integrating the information technology systems of CRS and CWS, the CWS system depended upon various PCMS software applications, and in particular Vision and the software application which stored details of the Dividend entitlements of cardholders, called the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Scheme Service Centre” </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“SSC”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, and whoever was unsuccessful in the obtaining of the integration work could be expected to be reluctant to co-operate with the successful party in the integration programme. As it turned out, lack of co-operation on the part of PCMS proved to be a significant obstacle to the achievement of the development of GlobalSTORE to provide the functionality desired by CWS.</span>

I have set out my findings as to the motivation of Mr. Brydon in engaging CWS in the GlobalSTORE project. I do not think that timing had anything to do with it, although no doubt Mr. Brydon wished that the former CRS stores would be able to offer to customers the same range of facilities, in particular the Dividend, as were available in the existing CWS stores as soon as possible.</span>

In his cross-examination Mr. Young was asked about the Risks and Issues Document. He said that he had first seen it about the end of February or beginning of March 2000, at about the time he was appointed as project manager. He said that when he saw the Risks and Issues Document it was apparent to him that it had been put together without any input from CWS and that ICL’s understanding of the requirements of CWS was limited in various areas. Mr. Young does not seem to have thought that particularly important at the time. His evidence was that some of the risks and issues were discussed at a meeting on 10 March 2000 and encapsulated in a later document.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">There was quite a lot of confusion at the trial before me as to what it was that ICL needed to know about the Dividend in order to be able to provide the functionality within GlobalSTORE to handle the Dividend. On the CWS side it seems to have been thought that ICL’s case was that it needed information as to how Vision provided the functionality to transfer data in relation to the Dividend to and from ISS300. Thus it seems to have been thought that it was an answer to that point that ICL was aware, from its involvement in supplying ISS300 and Vision to CWS in the first place, of the requirements which needed to be met for ISS300, an ICL product, to record data at the point of sale in relation to entitlements to the Dividend, and to send and receive such data through Vision. That supposed answer was, however, based upon a misunderstanding. What actually mattered in respect of operating the Dividend in the former CRS stores was not the ability of GlobalSTORE to communicate with Vision, as to which there was no requirement at all, but the ability of GlobalSTORE to send and receive data to SSC via whatever file transfer mechanism was selected. In order for ICL to be able to configure GlobalSTORE so that it could communicate with SSC ICL would have to be told of the format of the files used in SSC.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It seems to me that it was made plain in the Risks and Issues Document that it would be easier to integrate the existing CRS systems into the CWS system if as much use as possible was made of the existing CRS systems. That was also what was contemplated in the Definition Document. If the use of existing CWS systems was to by maximised, the consequence would be that more work would have to be done to develop GlobalSTORE and that work would be likely to take longer. As I have already recorded, it was the firm desire of Mr. Brydon that the existing CWS systems should form the base of the information technology systems of the merged societies. It does not appear that Mr. Young appreciated the critical significance, in terms of the amount of work which would need to be done to develop GlobalSTORE and how long that work would be likely to take, of the fundamental decision as to which systems were to form the base of the information technology systems to be used after the merger in the former CRS stores. Certainly he does not seem to have raised it as an issue with Mr. Brydon when considering what would be the best course to take with a view to securing early implementation of the Dividend in the former CRS stores. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">At the same time as the possible merger between CWS and CRS was under consideration thought was being given within CWS to taking advantage of the opportunity which the merger might provide to undertake a trial in a region in which the Dividend had not previously been offered of the Revised Dividend. The region identified was the area served by Harlech Television. The trial was thus known as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Harlech trial”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Essentially the object of the exercise was, and can only have been, to assess the attractiveness to customers of having the Revised Dividend as compared with having nothing. The Harlech trial could not possibly provide information as to the impact of substituting for the Original Dividend the Revised Dividend. The relevance of the Harlech trial to the development of GlobalSTORE for use in the former CRS stores was that the stores proposed to be involved in the Harlech trial were all former CRS stores. If the Harlech trial was to take place it would depend upon the software installed in the stores in the trial being able to handle the Dividend at the rates of the Revised Dividend rather than simply at the Original Dividend rates. The Harlech trial was potentially a complicating factor in the development of GlobalSTORE because the original intention, as was made clear in the Definition Document, was that in the first instance GlobalSTORE should duplicate the Original Dividend and not provide any facilities for modifying or enhancing the Dividend offering. One of the assumptions set out in the Definition Document, at section 6.1 was:-</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> in respect of the GlobalSTORE project which was dated 20 March 2000. That bulletin contained a list of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“New Issues/Proposed Actions”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Issue 9 identified in that list was, </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The action recorded was, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Detailed reverse engineering of the file required within CWS”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Mr. Young was cross-examined about that entry. He said that the language used was not ideal and that what the item related to was CWS trying to identify what understanding it possessed internally concerning the file specification. He agreed, however, that he knew that in order to be able to address the question of replicating the functionality of Vision concerning the Original Dividend ICL would need information from PCMS as to the file definitions of SSC relating to the Dividend. I have to say that I thought his attempt to avoid the implications of the language which he in fact used in the list of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“New Issues/Proposed Actions”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> at item 9 was disingenuous and that he in fact meant exactly what he had written. That he wrote it is indicative, I find, of the fact that, although it was known to CWS to be critical to ICL’s ability to replicate the functionality of Vision in respect of Original Dividend that ICL should be made privy to the appropriate file definitions used in SSC, CWS had not been able by the date of the bulletin to obtain the relevant information from PCMS and he appreciated that that failure was likely to have an effect on the ability of ICL to produce GlobalSTORE with the desired functionality by the date then in contemplation for the first installation of a pilot of GlobalSTORE in a store, 28 August 2000.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">I understand that Garry Goodby telephoned Simon O’Regan following our meeting and gained a somewhat different impression, despite which we are still unable to make progress as PCMS will not release the file specifications for Dividend. As far as Dividend is concerned I cannot speak on behalf of PCMS as they operate entirely independently of ICL in the provision of the Dividend service. However, I would like to take the opportunity to put in writing my understanding of the current situation.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">My understanding of the PCMS position is that if the RSM service is provided by CWS then PCMS will provide the Dividend service in ex-CRS stores directly to CWS, they will not see any value in working with ICL. ICL’s role will be limited to providing the software but ICL can only do this if the specifications are released by PCMS to ICL. PCMS will not release the specifications to ICL unless a commercial agreement is reached between PCMS and CWS for the provision of the service. In order to reach a commercial agreement with PCMS, CWS will need to accept that PCMS cannot be responsible for the end to end service and will need to ensure that CWS can manage this responsibility themselves.</span>

I am in the process of preparing a proposal with ICL’s Operational Services Division (OSD) for ICL to provide the RSM service. I believe that in the event of a contract for this service being awarded to ICL, it would then be possible for ICL and PCMS in partnership to offer a full end to end service for Dividend which would be the equivalent of the service currently provided by PCMS for Dividend in the CWS stores.

Minutes of the meeting were put in evidence. Apart from recording the matter, important to Mr. Young, that all future communication or reporting for GlobalSTORE should be to him at the CWS end, the minutes did record at item 12 that the FRS sign off date for GlobalSTORE Dividend had been missed. By this time four weeks had passed since the date which ICL had indicated needed to be met if a pilot date of 28 August 2000 was to be achieved. There was still no sign that the Dividend FRS was about to be signed off.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Young did not appear to take seriously ICL’s comments that it could not sensibly begin work on adapting GlobalSTORE to accommodate the Dividend without an FRS in relation to the Dividend which, in particular, gave details of the file definitions used in SSC. His general approach to any problem seems to have been simply to have a meeting. So far as the question of an FRS is concerned, the underlying concept, as it seems to me, is not particularly challenging. It is a mechanism for identifying the precise requirements of a customer so that those requirements can be met. One can illustrate the significance of the FRS by taking the example of a car. A customer who wishes to have a manufacturer design and build a car for him can simply identify his requirement as being for a car. In such a case all decisions as to how many wheels the car should have, how many seats, what size the engine should be, whether the engine should be petrol driven or diesel, whether it should have a turbocharger or a supercharger or no enhancement, what the dimensions should be, and the like are made by the designer with no contribution from the customer. If the customer has particular wishes with regard to characteristics which the finished car should possess, then he has to make those known. If he does not, he cannot complain if some unexpressed wish is not reflected in the completed car. Coming closer to the facts of this case, if the customer wishes to have a car designed and built which is identical to one which he already possesses, he can say that to the designer, but in order for the designer to be able usefully to take account of the expressed wish he will need to be made aware of the particular characteristics of the existing vehicle. It is not enough for him to know that it is a car. It is not enough for him to be able simply to look at the outside of the existing car. Truly to be able to replicate it he will need to be able to look under the bonnet and perhaps to an extent to disassemble the car, unless he is provided with plans and specifications of the existing car. Thus, in order for ICL to be able to replicate the Dividend it needed to know not only how the Dividend was presented to a shopper in a CWS store, it needed to know how, technically, that presentation was achieved in terms of, amongst other things, the format in which data relating to the Dividend was passed from the initial point of capture at the till to the relevant software application in which data was stored, and the format in which data was transmitted from that application to the till, where that was necessary. All of this seems to have eluded Mr. Young.</span>

It seems to me to be more likely, given that by the time the file definitions for the Dividend were provided the original date for signing off the Dividend FRS was nearly six weeks past, that ICL had in mind to obtain more time by reference to that circumstance, in the event that its proposal for a change of direction was not accepted. However that may be, I do accept the evidence of Mr. Jennings that once he had obtained the file definitions for the Dividend it was obvious that the date of 28 August 2000 could not be met without some exceptional measure being taken.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">A software application like GlobalSTORE is composed of modules. Those modules are put together, or </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“integrated”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, on a base platform to comprise the application. Each module as it is completed is tested to see whether it performs in the way intended. This stage is called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“modular testing”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Once the modules have been integrated onto the base platform testing is undertaken to see whether the various modules as integrated perform together as they should. This stage is called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“integration testing”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Assuming that modular and integration testing produce results considered satisfactory, the next stage of testing is what is called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“validation”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Validation is testing by the supplier against the specification of the software, the FRS, in the case of ICL, to see whether the application meets the identified requirements of the customer. On delivery of bespoke software to customer the customer will often subject it to HAT to assess whether the software is in fit condition for the last stage of testing. The final stage of testing is UAT. This is testing by the customer to see whether the software meets his needs. It is obviously possible for validation and UAT to proceed in parallel, if that is acceptable to the supplier and the customer, and such a course has the benefit to the customer of permitting him access to the software application earlier than if it is not released to him until after validation by the supplier. The risk, if validation proceeds in parallel, is that errors in the software which would have been detected in the process of validation will still exist and may affect UAT. As I understand it, the process of validation does not directly involve correcting bugs. Rather, once bugs have been detected during the process of validation, appropriate remedial measures can be devised and implemented. At least so far as ICL was concerned, appropriate remedial measures could be implemented either for a collection of bugs in an Error Correction Release or by means of a single immediate intervention called a </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Modular and integration testing will be carried out by the development staff before the software is passed to the validation team. Modular testing involves each unit of software being tested by the development team separately before they are all integrated on to a base platform. Naturally, modular testing will not identify certain issues which can only be picked up during integration testing. Integration testing is the next step. This involves fitting together all the modules of the retail software product correctly onto the base platform. The system is generally not formally tested using test scripts at this stage, but rather a person with good technical knowledge will carry out high level confidence testing on each general functional area of the system to ensure that it works broadly as a whole. Generally integration testing will not involve the use of a specific test script, and it will be done slightly differently from project to project, but its general purpose is to determine whether or not the software or the software components when packaged together are capable of operating together as a software release, and to determine whether the software is suitable for validation. Integration testing would normally be carried out by either a member of the development team, or by a member of the validation team with appropriate technical knowledge of the software.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">What section 4.4 of the Development Plan dated 15 May 2000 thus contemplated was that, after modular and integration testing, Drop 1 would be released to CWS for UAT at the same time as ICL commenced validation. In other words, Drop 1 would not have been subject to any validation when released to CWS. The Development Plan dated 15 May 2000 also provided for release of Drop 2 and Drop 3 to CWS at the same time as validation commenced by ICL. A Development Plan dated 21 June 2000 produced by ICL and sent to CWS altered that situation. It provided for each of Drop 2 and Drop 3 to be subject to one week of validation by ICL before release to CWS. However, the position in relation to Drop 1 was unchanged in principle.

	    <p class="BlockText" style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr. Young in his second witness statement maintained that he had expected Drop 1 to have been subject to a week’s validation before release to CWS. When he was shown the Development Plan dated 21 June 2000 he accepted that he had agreed to it and he accepted that it was plain from it that Drop 1 was not to be subject to any validation by ICL before release to CWS. He said that he had simply overlooked, when considering the Development Plan dated 21 June 2000, the fact that Drop 1 was not to be subject to any validation by ICL prior to release to CWS. If that were true it would postulate incompetence of a high order on the part of Mr. Young. If it were really important to CWS to have at the earliest possible date not merely GlobalSTORE to subject to UAT, but partially validated GlobalSTORE to subject to UAT, one would have expected Mr. Young to have been interested in reading carefully the Development Plan, which was not a long or very complicated document, and digesting accurately its contents. In fact I am satisfied that what Mr. Young said about having overlooked the indication in the Development Plan dated 21 June 2000 that Drop 1 would not have been subject to validation by ICL before release to CWS was not true. Mr. Ogston sent to Mr. Young an e-mail on 21 June 2000 which said this:-</p>

If the e-mail set out something contrary to what he had expected up to the point at which he received it, I am confident that he would have remembered it. Its importance was obvious. Mr. Young in fact forwarded the e-mail to Mr. Dennis, Mr. Kevin Williams and Mr. Hevican of CWS on 18 July 2000, so there is no doubt that he received it. On this issue I am satisfied that Mr. Young is simply telling lies in order to try to support CWS’s case that ICL’s performance in relation to the GlobalSTORE project was lamentable.</p>

He made so bold as to suggest both to Mr. Jennings and to Mr. Ogston, after referring to Mr. Jennings’s e-mail of 22 June 2000 and Mr. Murphy’s e-mail of 23 June 2000, that there had not even been any modular or integration testing. That was a surprising suggestion to have made bearing in mind that Release Notes and an Integration Report were in evidence. What Mr. Ogston and Mr. Jennings said was that after the sending by Mr. Jennings of his e-mail a great deal of work was done by ICL to produce a drop fit for release. That drop was tested in the presence of Mr. Ogston himself. What Mr. Ogston said in cross-examination was:-</span>

I had the developers in front of me go through the release module by module to convince me, and if not at the time to fix bugs that would then convince me, that the system was a workable system. It went through every programme of which there were 50 delivered, of which a small number were Dividend programs, but a large number of other programs I have previously mentioned that all loaded and ran reasonably well and executed cleanly.

Why this was all very unfortunate was that, as Mr. Cook accepted when shown his timesheet for the week ending 8 July 2000, which week began on 3 July 2000, he was on holiday all week. His evidence about the testing and the decision to reject was thus pure invention. I found Mr. Cook generally to be a most unsatisfactory witness and I am convinced that his evidence as to the alleged deficiencies in Drop 1 and his involvement in the decision to reject it was not advanced as a result of faulty recollection. Later in his first witness statement Mr. Cook dealt with the testing of a subsequent delivery of software on 17 October 2000 and UAT of that software during November 2000. Unhappily his timesheets showed him to have been on holiday between 30 October 2000 and 20 November 2000, both dates inclusive.

	    <p class="BlockText" style="margin-left:0.49in">That grading scheme was that used by ICL generally to assess the significance of bugs, but it was common ground between Mr. David Baker, a software expert retained on behalf of CWS for the purposes of this action, and his opposite number on behalf of ICL, Dr. Gillian Hunt, that the grading in fact carried out by CWS of the 43 alleged bugs in Drop 1, and, indeed, of other bugs detected later in the history of the GlobalSTORE project, reflected commercial priorities as well as the system significance of particular bugs. CWS contended that it had identified in 10% of Drop 1 8 category A bugs, 3 category B bugs, 6 category C bugs, 10 category D bugs and 16 category E bugs. All of the alleged category A bugs related to a single SSC file definition, HMEO. In those circumstances none of them met the criteria for a category A classification because none of them – not even all of them taken together – could have caused a system breakdown. They simply impacted on one part, albeit an important part, of the software delivered in Drop 1 and prevented the HMEO file being tested at SSC. According to the evidence of Dr. Hunt, which I accept, four of the alleged category A errors were in any event known to ICL at the time of Drop 1. Both Mr. Baker and Dr. Hunt reassessed the significance of the errors alleged by CWS in Drop1 using a different classification system. That system categorised as Class 1 a bug which would have a severe impact, preventing other tests in the relevant functional area, having a major business impact and preventing testing of other functional areas. A Class 2 bug was one which had a major impact, preventing many other tests in the relevant functional area and/or having a major business impact. Class 3 described a bug having a minor impact, preventing some other tests in the relevant functional area and/or a minor business impact. A Class 4 bug was one which would not prevent other tests and had no business impact. The remaining classes were U, a bug the priority of which could not be determined, N, which was not a bug at all, C, which was a change request, and D, a duplicate. It was, I think, common ground between Mr. Baker and Dr. Hunt, that the classification of bugs is a somewhat subjective exercise. A bug is, when reduced to its essentials, a respect in which software does not perform as expected. In considering what was expected one has to have regard to what was specified as the functionality to be provided. Vagueness of wording of the relevant specification is the first area in which different assessors may reach different conclusions as to whether a supposed bug really is a bug or not. A conclusion that what it is said the software should do was not covered by the specification as written could lead to the view either that what was complained of was not a bug at all, or that it was really a request for the software to be modified to provide a different functionality, in other words, a change. There is obviously also great scope for difference as to the business impact of a particular alleged bug. Mr. Baker, having no experience of the retail grocery trade, candidly told me that he relied upon CWS to tell him of the alleged business impact of particular alleged bugs. That was understandable from his point of view, but introduced a significant element of unreliability into his grading of bugs, in my judgment, not least because those at CWS whom he consulted were not involved at the coalface of retailing but were Mr. Young and Mr. Cook. On the evidence of the original grading of bugs by CWS, it was plain to me that CWS was inclined to exaggerate the business effect of bugs. How else could eight alleged bugs which only affected testing of one file, HMEO, possibly have been graded as causing a complete system breakdown? There was some difference between Mr. Baker and Dr. Hunt as to the appropriate regrading according to the scheme which they used of the 43 alleged bugs in 10% of Drop 1, but they both agreed that, for reasons about which they differed in detail, ten at least of the alleged forty-three bugs were not bugs at all or requests for changes or related to functionality not included in the software delivered in Drop 1. </p>

That software had been developed over a shorter time scale than had originally been envisaged because of the late decisions as to network architecture and hosting and the late provision of information as to the file definitions for SSC. It did contain some errors, but not as many as CWS contended at the time and those which did exist were of less seriousness than CWS contended at the time. It was common ground between the parties and their respective experts that bespoke software will always contain some errors. Contrary to the suggestion of Mr. Mawrey that there was at the time every reason to suppose that the number of errors which would have been revealed by continued testing would have increased exponentially, it seems to me that there was in fact every reason to suppose that the apparently most significant errors were concentrated in limited areas of the software, specifically those parts related to the Dividend. Although an important part of the whole, those areas were nonetheless just a part. It was accepted by Mr. Baker in cross-examination that the inaccuracies in the file format data supplied by PCMS in relation to SSC as at the date of Drop 1 meant that it would not have been possible successfully to have tested Drop 1 with SSC anyway, quite apart from any bugs in Drop 1 itself.</span>

If one is in business and one has a customer who says he is dissatisfied, it seems to me just common sense that disputing with him whether he has proper cause to be dissatisfied will only make him more dissatisfied. Realistically one’s options are not to deal with the customer further or to try to alleviate his expressed concerns. ICL chose at this stage to do the latter so far as CWS was concerned. To seek to elevate that business decision into some sort of admission on the part of ICL strikes me as wholly unjustified.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">That e-mail was important. First, it made plain that from the point of view of the information technology department of CWS Retail there was no definite plan for the carrying out of the Harlech trial. What was being looked for from GlobalSTORE was simply the functionality to offer the Original Dividend. Second, it was clear from the e-mail that it was well-understood that the Harlech trial would provide no information of any value to an assessment of the likely impact of introducing the Revised Dividend in place of the Original Dividend in stores in which the Original Dividend had been offered. The making of an assessment of that likely impact was the purpose of what was called the </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Vision 32” </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">project, the installation of Vision in former CRS stores in existing CWS regions, was the desire to be able to offer the Original Dividend in those stores as soon as possible, allegedly as a result of the non-delivery of GlobalSTORE in useable condition earlier than was then anticipated. There had been no previous indication by CWS to ICL, and of course this internal e-mail was not itself an indication to ICL, that any particular urgency was attributed to the offering of the Original Dividend in former CRS stores in existing CWS regions. Fourth, for reasons personal to himself, Mr. Brydon sought to suggest to the addressees of the e-mail that ICL had indicated that it would not be able to deliver working GlobalSTORE software before Christmas 2000, when in fact what ICL had said was that it would seek to provide validated software by 10 October 2000.</span>

It seems to me that that is a complete misreading of Mr. Young’s e-mail. The reference to correction and testing of the remaining category A, B and C bugs can only sensibly have referred to those bugs in such categories of which ICL was aware. It is wildly improbable, in the light of the history of the GlobalSTORE project up to this point, that ICL should have even contemplated asserting that there would be no category A, B or C bugs at all in the software as delivered. </span>

It is, further, right to say that on the evidence of the relevant ICL witnesses, which I accept, the testing which had taken place had taken place by comparison of the outputs of GlobalSTORE with the equivalent outputs from Vision, and any difference was logged as an error. In other words, exactly those criteria were being applied which the Acceptance Criteria document stated should not be applied. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“this has not previously been discussed”</span>

The proposed date for the start of the Harlech trial at that time was not, as was contended on behalf of CWS in this action, 8 January 2001, but some time in May 2001. It was not then envisaged that the Revised Dividend would be offered in all CWS stores as from 8 July 2001, as was alleged in this action, but that it would be offered first in South West Region as from the fourth quarter of 2001, with there being no definite plan for any other stores. That was broadly consistent with Mr. Bowes’s apparent contemplation in early August 2000 that the introduction of the Revised Dividend on a national level would take place early in 2002.</span>

What organisation in their right mind, having committed to delivering their biggest single till training programme ever, would choose to restructure, risk losing half their staff and make the rest totally immobile?  If Training are unable to meet the requirement then we should immediately contract with ICL to obtain the additional resources to do the job. I don’t have a great deal of confidence in ICL’s ability to deliver, and this rollout is more aggressive than any ever attempted before by ICL or CWS, but we are running out of time if we want to give ICL any chance of success.

There was no response in writing to that request. However, by early in January 2001 ECR2 had been split into two components, respectively called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“ECR2a”</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The reason for the split, so Mr. Jennings explained at paragraphs 150 to 152 of his first witness statement, and I accept, was the time which it was taking CWS to undertake UAT. UAT proved to take much longer than originally anticipated. A reason, according to the evidence of Dr. Hunt on behalf of ICL, which I accept, was that CWS did not assess correctly the amount of resources which would be required for UAT. </span>

This also was something up to which it does not appear that CWS, by which the necessary arrangements had to be made with ATOS, faced.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The terms of the letter are curious. It amounts to an ultimatum requiring Mr. Christou to present himself in Manchester on a date apparently fixed without reference to him to meet executives of a rank lower than his equivalent, Mr. Melmoth. That alone seems calculated to cause offence. Apart from anything else, it strikes me as just plain bad manners to treat the chief executive of a major company in this way. The letter was written in a rather hectoring tone. Further, instead of presenting Mr. Christou with a single, if important, grievance with which to deal, other matters of less significance than the GlobalSTORE project were included in the letter, for no obvious reason other than that suggested by Mr. Goodby in his initial comments on the draft </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> letter, namely to provide apparently greater justification for CWS terminating relationships with ICL. The summary of allegedly relevant events in relation to GlobalSTORE was, to say the least, contentious and misleading. In particular, the question whether regression testing was actually necessary was controversial between ICL, which considered that it was not, and CWS, which was looking for a fight. The only definite complaint about ECR1, apart from a vague allegation that it was of poor quality, was that incorrect documentation had been supplied with it and had not been replaced. In addition, the way in which the alleged dates for the original testing of software by CWS and original pilot were presented was calculated to suggest longer delays than was actually the case. It would have been more accurate to render each of the relevant dates as, respectively, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“end June 2000”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> and </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">What in essence happened at the meeting of 19 January 2001, which had been requested by ICL to discuss issues arising out of the GlobalSTORE project, was that its representatives were ambushed. Instead of beginning with the project which ICL had come to discuss, CWS representatives began by raising a completely different matter, complaints about the service provided under Service Level Agreements. That may have been a deliberate ploy to make the ICL representatives feel unprepared and consequently ill at ease. The CWS representatives collectively then harangued ICL about its alleged incompetence before seeking to force the long outstanding and vexed question of agreement of liquidated damages. Finally, Mr. Brydon refused point blank to permit discussion of the detail of the GlobalSTORE project, which was the one thing which the ICL representatives, and in particular Barbara Dixon, had come to the meeting to discuss. Mr. Brouwer told me in cross-examination that he considered by the time of his involvement in the GlobalSTORE project CWS had already decided to withdraw from it. Certainly the events of the meeting on 19 January 2001 lend ample support for that view. In fact, unknown to Mr. Brouwer at that time, CWS, or at least Mr. Brydon and Mr. Melmoth, had been plotting what they conceived to be the downfall of ICL for months previously.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It is difficult to consider meaningfully whether ICL performed adequately in relation to the GlobalSTORE project without some yardstick by reference to which that question can be addressed. In the absence of a contract between CWS and ICL under which ICL agreed to do certain things by particular dates the issue of whether it could or should have produced better software earlier than it did does not really arise. However, it is plain, in my judgment, that the initial efforts of ICL to try to meet the requirements of CWS as to when software was required were frustrated by the failure of CWS to specify precisely what its requirements were in relation to the Dividend, and in particular the failure to obtain from PCMS the correct file formats which ICL needed if it were to be able to produce software which would enable data to be passed through to SSC and back again. CWS also dithered over the issue of hosting and in fact changed its mind, or at any rate the mind communicated to ICL, on that issue. The result was that ICL was left in about mid-May 2000 trying to produce by 28 August 2000 software which it had indicated it would need five months from sign-off of appropriate FRS to produce. ICL then tried to meet the date desired by CWS by, first, suggesting a change in the platform from ISS400 to ISS300, and, second, adopting a co-operative approach to release of software, such that the software would be released to CWS for testing at the same time as it entered validation by ICL. That laudable effort to assist its customer was thrown back in the ICL corporate face. ICL’s witnesses involved in the delivery at the end of June expressed to me in cross-examination their surprise at the attitude of CWS, and in my judgment that was an entirely justified reaction in the light of the agreement of Mr. Young to the Development Plan of 15 May 2000. I am quite satisfied, despite the colourful language of Mr. Mawrey, that Drop 1 was not </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“rubbish”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, and that useful work could have been done with that drop to turn it into useable software. The experience of the rejection of Drop 1, into which so much effort had been put under difficult circumstances by Mr. Ogston, Mr. Jennings and their team must have been very disheartening. It may be that that was a relevant circumstance in the deficiencies experienced with the delivery of software made on 17 October 2000. Certainly the quality of that delivery as made left something to be desired. There were a considerable number of bugs, and Mr. Christou in his letter of 8 November 2000 accepted that as at 27 October 2000 there were still problems with the Dividend functionality which prevented that module going into UAT at that time. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the fact that testing by CWS did in fact continue until 2 November 2000, notwithstanding the phantom </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“rejection”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> of 25 October 2000 referred to in Mr. Brydon’s letter to Mr. Christou of 30 October 2000, and then resumed on 7 November 2000 after a re-run of handover tests by Mr. Featherstone and Mrs. McCoan, that the deficiencies in the software delivered on 17 October 2000 were nothing like as great as CWS then, and in this action, made out. Although the delivery of the software on 17 October 2000 was a week later than ICL had predicted would be possible when making the suggestion in Mr. Turner’s letter dated 28 July 2000 that there were two ways in which the project could move forward, either continuing with the drop approach, which would require co-operation between the parties, or waiting for a longer period so that ICL could validate the entirety of the software, the decision to follow the latter route was that of CWS. The delivery of ECR1 was also a week later than first predicted by ICL, but otherwise it seems to have been substantially satisfactory. That no further deliveries of corrections were made was entirely the result of the decision of CWS to terminate the GlobalSTORE project. Overall, while ICL would no doubt wish that the software as delivered from time to time had had fewer bugs, and that deliveries had been made when predicted, rather than, in the cases of the delivery of software in October 2000 and of ECR1, a week later, it does not seem to me that it is appropriate to criticise ICL for its attempts to meet the expressed needs of its customer within tight timetables. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In expressing the conclusions which I have in the preceding paragraph I have taken into account the evidence of Mr. Baker on behalf of CWS and that of Dr. Hunt on behalf of ICL. It was agreed between them that a total of 454 alleged errors which were reported by CWS or ICL as detected in the GlobalSTORE software during the course of the GlobalSTORE project fell to be considered for the purposes of this action. Of those, 96 were reported in relation to Drop 1, including the 43 to which I have already referred. A further 82 were identified during design reviews in the period between the rejection of Drop 1 and 17 October 2000. That period is not really relevant to any assessment of the validity of complaints of CWS as to the quality of what was delivered to it, because it was during this period that ICL was working on GlobalSTORE aiming for delivery in October 2000. 97 alleged errors were discovered during HAT, and a further 109 during UAT. The balance of 70 were said to have been found in ECR1 or in Hot Fixes subsequent to it. As classified originally by CWS or ICL, 12 of the 454 were Category A, 92 were Category B, 113 were Category C, 159 were Category D and 78 were Category E. Of the Category A bugs, 8 were those in Drop 1 upon which I have already commented. The balance were found on UAT. 22 of the Category B bugs emerged from Drop 1, 10 from design reviews, 5 from HAT, 35 from UAT and 20 from ECR1 or subsequent Hot Fixes. So far as Category C errors were concerned, 11 were found in Drop 1, 18 in design reviews, 45 on HAT, 26 on UAT and 13 in ECR1 or subsequent Hot Fixes. While perhaps I need not worry too much about Category E bugs, the breakdown for Category D was 21 in Drop 1, 40 found in design reviews, 38 on HAT, 30 on UAT and 30 in ECR1 or subsequent Hot Fixes. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Baker and Dr. Hunt were asked to sample 100 of the reported errors and to reassess them, with a view to extrapolating the results across the totality of 454 reported errors. The result of doing that was that Mr. Baker considered that 89% of reported errors were indeed errors, while Dr. Hunt thought that the percentage of true errors was of the order of 85%. Mr. Baker considered, and I agree, that the assessments of himself and Dr. Hunt as to the numbers of true errors represent a close measure of agreement for the type of analysis undertaken. Broadly Mr. Baker assessed the errors which he considered to be errors as being more serious than Dr. Hunt. I am satisfied that the principal reason for that difference in assessment of seriousness was the reliance which Mr. Baker placed on CWS in assessing the business impact of errors. Another reason, which both Mr. Baker and Dr. Hunt accepted during cross-examination, was probably a difference in interpretation of the relevant FRSs. Using the classification system which Mr. Baker and Dr. Hunt adopted and which I have already explained, Mr. Baker found that in the test sample there were 11 Class 1 errors, 25 Class 2, 35 Class 3, 12 Class 4, 11 Class N, 4 Class C and 2 Class U. He extrapolated from those findings that the breakdown of the total of 454 errors would be 20.2 Class 1, 88.2 Class 2, 222.9 Class 3, 62.8 Class 4, 40.7 Class N, 9.5 Class C and 9.8 Class U. Dr. Hunt’s extrapolations were 2 Class 1, 51.2 Class 2, 197.7 Class 3, 124.2 Class 4, 59.8 Class N, 9.5 Class C and 9.8 Class U. In the light of the contemporaneous evidence as to how the quality of GlobalSTORE  delivered to CWS in Drop 1 and on 17 October 2000 was viewed by CWS, to which I have already referred, I prefer the assessment of seriousness made by Dr. Hunt to that made by Mr. Baker. The fact is that at the time the perception of those assessing the quality of the software on behalf of CWS was pretty favourable. Even Drop 1 passed confidence testing on initial delivery with no problem.</span>

She therefore considered all 454 reported errors to see whether she considered them really to be requests for changes. As a result of this exercise she found some 64 or 65 of the 454 reported errors which she considered to be requests for changes. Her opinion as to which reported errors came within this category did fluctuate a bit. At one point she identified 71 reported errors as coming within the category. However, her ultimate position was that there were 64 or 65. I accept that revised assessment.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The way in which Mr. Mawrey put the case for CWS as to the quality of the software delivered was to emphasise both the numbers of errors reported and their seriousness as perceived at the time of the initial report. He submitted that, by and large, ICL did not dispute the categorisation of bugs made by CWS. That is true, but I accept the evidence of Mr. Jennings that he considered that little was to be gained by doing so. If an error existed or was perceived by CWS to exist, the matter needed to be dealt with. If it was a genuine error nothing was to be gained by an argument as to whether it was truly Category B or really Category C, for example. It needed to be fixed. I have already mentioned that it was common ground between CWS and ICL that some errors are to be expected in bespoke software. The only sensible enquiry, therefore, if an assessment has to be made as to whether the software delivered by ICL was of satisfactory quality, is what number of bugs is to be expected in bespoke software and what is the expected seriousness of those bugs. Dr. Hunt expressed the conclusion in paragraph 5.109 of her report for the purposes of this action that:-</span>

Mr. Mawrey did not really contest Dr. Hunt’s view, other than by suggesting that the software industry had unacceptably low standards.

In the absence of any contractually binding deadlines for the achievement of any particular progress it does not seem that any worthwhile purpose would be served by considering, to any greater extent than I already have, why the project lasted as long as it did. </span>

Although in the event ECR2A was never delivered to CWS it was completed by ICL. Dr. Hunt undertook testing of ECR2A. She was criticised by Mr. Mawrey for departing from the agreed testing protocol, but it seemed to me that that was rather an unfair criticism. She explained to me in cross-examination that she had not understood that the agreed testing protocol was in any sense a limiting feature so far as her consideration of issues which seemed to her to be relevant was concerned. That, in my judgment, is a proper professional attitude and to be commended rather than the subject of adverse comment. Dr. Hunt expressed her conclusions following her consideration of ECR2A in paragraph 7.45 of her report in this way:-</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">I can confirm that the ECR2A release was stable and robust and that as far as I have been able to determine ICL’s statement of which errors were fixed is accurate. I did not discover any significant new errors, although as might be expected, I did record one or two minor cosmetic errors during testing. In my opinion ECR2A would have been capable of running successfully in a pilot store. This does not mean that no further errors existed in ECR2A, just that all significant errors with operational impact had been resolved. Part of the purpose of pilot running is to find exactly those errors that have not been found in testing but which come to light when the system is used in an operational setting by real users.</span>

	    <p class="BlockText" style="margin-left:0.49in">I accept that evidence. It follows that had CWS only waited and accepted delivery of ECR2A on about 5 February 2001 it would, so far as anything needing to be provided by ICL was concerned, have been able to proceed to a pilot installation in stores. However, as I have indicated, CWS would not actually have been able to proceed to a pilot installation for want of things which it had to do, specifically complete UAT, arrange training of staff and organise testing of GlobalSTORE with RSM.</p>

He relied, further, upon the comments that Microsoft had advised against the use of its ActiveStore application in GlobalSTORE, that replacing ActiveStore had been difficult for ICL, and that there had been a lack of appropriately skilled resources for ICL to integrate the Dividend into ISS400. All of these factors were presented by Mr. Mawrey as being, in effect, admissions of incompetence and inability on the part of ICL.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The picture presented by Mr. McFall in the Post Mortem Report is considerably different from that which seems to me to be correct in the light of all the evidence which I have examined and the cross-examination of the many witnesses which I have heard. The question arises how that could be. Mr. Pickett was asked about the Post Mortem Report, and in particular about those comments in it upon which Mr. Mawrey especially relied. Mr. Pickett told me, and I accept, that he had no idea who Mr. McFall was, that he had never met him, and his only contact with him was one telephone conversation which he thought lasted about ten minutes. From the Post Mortem Report Mr. McFall seems also to have spoken to Mr. Carlin, a Mr. Coombs, Mr. Ogston, Mr. Brouwer and Mr. Bennett. These gentlemen, and Mr. Pickett, were described in the Post Mortem Report as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Review Team”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, while Mr. McFall described himself in the Post Mortem Report as a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Facilitator”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. It was clear from the evidence of Mr. Pickett that there never was a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Review Team”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, in the sense of a group of people to whom was entrusted a function of reviewing collectively the GlobalSTORE project so as to draw lessons for the future. Rather Mr. McFall, whose qualifications for undertaking the task, if any, did not emerge during the trial, undertook an investigation on his own in the course of which he spoke on an individual basis, and briefly, to the members of the so-called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Review Team”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Mr. McFall does not seem to have spoken at all to some people who could have made a significant contribution to the exercise on which he was engaged, such as Mr. Jennings, Mrs. McCoan and Mr. Featherstone. Mr. Jennings, in particular, explained to me during his evidence that he was unaware that Microsoft had advised against the use of ActiveSTORE in GlobalSTORE. Mr. Carlin told me, and I accept, that that was the final position of Microsoft, but only after it had found itself unable to resolve the task of rendering ActiveSTORE suitable for use in GlobalSTORE in a retail environment. Mr. Brouwer told me, and again I accept, that there are many installations using GlobalSTORE with ActiveSTORE successfully on the Continent – he especially mentioned Amsterdam – but those are warehouse installations. As he put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“The only problem is for the food part of the business you need to increase the speed.” </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Thus it is obvious that Mr. McFall was misinformed as to the true position concerning Active STORE. His opinion that in early 2000 GlobalSTORE was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“more of a concept than a product or solution kit”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, was not shared by any of the ICL witnesses who were asked about it. His conclusion that the reason for changing from ISS400 to ISS300 was a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Lack of appropriately skilled resources”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, although part of the picture, was a long way from being the whole of it.</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the CWS GlobalStore Root Cause Analysis was a superficial undertaking which reached glib conclusions for a number of which there was little basis in fact. At all events I did not find that the Post Mortem Report was of any assistance to me in making the findings which I felt I should make as to the progress of the GlobalSTORE project.</span>

Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding CWS had the right to extend the provision of services by ATOS to 31/03/2001 but, after that date, ATOS was to cease providing services to CWS. If ICL had complied with the terms of the CWS agreement, GlobalSTORE would have been installed into all the former CRS stores by the end of March 2001 and the bulk printing service would no longer have been required. As a consequence of the delay in delivering GlobalSTORE  (and the further consequent delay in the installation of a back-office solution for the former CRS stores) CWS entered into a new agreement with ATOS dated 18/01/2001, for the continued provision of bulk printing services.

The other individuals allegedly concerned were Tim Donovan, Peter Croll, Nancy Wilson, Mike Maybery and Alex Conner. The allegedly wasted development costs were said to be sums paid to ICL and PCMS for work in relation to GlobalSTORE, while the wasted licences were alleged to be licences obtained for use of GlobalSTORE software and other software for use in connection with GlobalSTORE, namely an SQL server client access licence and an SQL workstation client access licence.

The reason why both cannot be claimed is obvious. If the contract had been performed in accordance with its terms the so-called wasted expenditure would have been incurred in any event in seeking to obtain the benefits for lack of which the sum necessary to put the claimant in the financial position in which he would have been if the contract had been performed in accordance with its terms is awarded as compensation. To award both the sum necessary to put the claimant in the financial position in which he would have been had the contract been performed and alleged wasted expenditure is to over-compensate the claimant by reimbursing expenditure which he would have incurred even if there had been no breach of contract. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">I shall comment later in this judgment upon the suggestion that it might be appropriate to ignore the actual cost of Vision in assessing CWS’s claims for alleged additional expenditure. However, the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph from the written closing submissions of Mr. Mawrey and Mr. Bergin seems to me to be no answer to the point that one cannot claim, as damages for breach of contract, alleged wasted expenditure as well as alleged expenditure arising from the alleged breach of contract and alleged loss of profits. The analogy taken by Mr. Mawrey and Mr. Bergin at paragraphs 249 and 250 of their submissions is not a true one so far as the facts of the present case are concerned. What was being claimed in this action as allegedly wasted costs was all of the alleged actual expenditure of CWS upon the GlobalSTORE project which it would have incurred anyway even if the project had been successful. The sums claimed were all of the sums paid to ICL and PCMS in connection with the project, all of the cost of the time of its own employees and contractors allegedly spent on the project, and so forth. There was no identified claim simply for some extra alleged expenditure to which CWS was said to have been put as a result of some breach of contract other than that which was said to have justified termination of the project. I therefore reject the submission that it was not necessary for CWS on the facts of this case to elect between a claim for allegedly wasted expenditure, on the assumptions that there was a contract between CWS and ICL in relation to the GlobalSTORE project and that ICL was in breach of that contract, and a claim for damages for loss of profits and for any expenditure additional to that to which CWS would in any event have been put had the project proved to have carried to a successful conclusion.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Had it been necessary or appropriate to consider on its merits a claim in respect of allegedly wasted expenditure, the sums allegedly paid to ICL and to PCMS for development work in connection with GlobalSTORE were not really in dispute and were supported by invoices. I should have found the amount of those payments proved in the sum claimed of a total of £589,467. However, there was no satisfactory evidence of the time spent either by contractors or by employees of CWS working on the GlobalSTORE project. No timesheets or breakdowns of hours said to have been worked by the contractors named were put in evidence. The sole evidence as to the numbers of days alleged to have been worked by each named contractor was an estimate made by Mr. Young. Although Mr. Young explained in his first witness statement what his estimate was in each case, he provided no explanation as to what justification he said there was for it. I am not satisfied that his estimates are accurate.  No contemporaneous time records were kept by the CWS employees the cost of the alleged time of whom devoted the GlobalSTORE project was claimed. Rather what happened was that each relevant employee was asked, some considerable time after the event, to estimate how much of his or her time had been devoted to work on the GlobalSTORE project while it was on foot. The estimates were set out in the witness statements of the various witnesses in very broad general terms. Those estimates were all so vague that I do not accept any of them as accurate. Had it been necessary to evaluate a claim for damages in respect of the cost to CWS of employing outside contractors or personnel from its own staff in connection with the GlobalSTORE project I should have rejected these heads of claim as unproven. Finally in relation to this element of the claim, I do not see how sums paid for licences granted not to CWS as such but to CRS under the CRS Agreement could be said to be expenditure wasted by CWS in connection with the GlobalSTORE project. Those sums were due because licences were granted by ICL to CRS before the transfer of the engagements of CRS to CWS. As such they had nothing to do with the GlobalSTORE project as carried forward between CWS and ICL. I should therefore have held that this element in the alleged wasted expenditure claim failed.  </span>

Now, if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated. But, on the other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the most, would only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of contract. For, had the special circumstances been known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract by special terms as to the damages in that case; and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them.

How this alleged loss was said to have been caused by the performance of ICL in relation to the GlobalSTORE project is extremely difficult to understand. What seemed to be said was that it was essential to the process of making a decision whether to introduce the Revised Dividend that the Harlech trial should take place, the delay in producing GlobalSTORE resulted in a delay in the Harlech trial, and thus delayed the decision which was in fact made in the light of the perceived success of the Harlech trial. It was further said that but for the defaults of ICL in failing to deliver GlobalSTORE in a condition fit for installation to commence in all former CRS stores in September 2000, the Harlech trial would have been able to commence on 8 January 2001. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">There are a number of problems with the analysis set out in the preceding paragraph. The first is that the Harlech trial logically had nothing to do with a decision to substitute the Revised Dividend for the Original Dividend. The Harlech trial was simply an exercise which assessed the impact of introducing the Dividend in some form into an area in which there had previously been no Dividend at all, as Mr. Braithwaite accepted in cross-examination. Thus I do not accept that the decision to introduce the Revised Dividend was influenced in any way by the results of the Harlech trial. If, contrary to my finding, the decision was influenced by the results of the Harlech trial, that that was likely to be so was not foreseeable for the purposes of the rule in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Hadley v. Baxendale </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">(1854) 9 Ex 341. There was no evidence that anyone at CWS told anyone at ICL in or before March or April 2000 that a decision as to whether to introduce the Revised Dividend was dependent upon the outcome of the Harlech trial. Further, the contemporaneous internal communications of CWS to which I have already referred make plain that, from the point of view of the Retail IT Department, the modification of the GlobalSTORE and ISS400 or ISS300 to enable CWS to offer the Revised Dividend in the Harlech Television region on a test basis formed no part of the GlobalSTORE project as originally conceived, and was always contemplated as following a rollout of GlobalSTORE and ISS400 or ISS300 in the former CRS stores. Moreover, even when a pilot date for GlobalSTORE and ISS400 was envisaged as occurring on 28 August 2000, it is plain that the Harlech trial was not seen as taking place any earlier than February 2001. By November 2000, when the pilot date envisaged for GlobalSTORE was 29 January 2001, the Harlech trial was envisaged as not commencing until about May 2001. In August 2000 Mr. Bowes was contemplating introduction of the Revised Dividend on a national basis, assuming success in the Harlech trial, in early 2002. As it was, in cross-examination Mr. Bowes told me that he understood that a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“quick fix”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> to enable the Harlech trial to proceed had been devised by the CWS Retail IT Department in about January 2001. He was quite unable to explain why, in those circumstances, the Harlech trial did not proceed in January 2001, rather than starting in July 2001, if a trial commencing in January 2001 had ever been contemplated. Thus, on the facts I find that the commencement of the Harlech trial was not delayed by any difficulty over GlobalSTORE, that the trial was never envisaged at any stage as commencing any earlier than February 2001, and that the date for implementation of the Revised Dividend on a national basis was not envisaged as being any earlier than early 2002. In addition, and in any event, the results of the Harlech trial, which I summarise later in this judgment, were in fact so variable that no sensible conclusion could be drawn from them. For that reason also I do not accept that CWS in fact took them into account in deciding to introduce the Revised Dividend in place of the Original Dividend.</span>

Those which were excluded from the trial were excluded because the particular circumstances of the store were considered to mean that including the store in question would distort the results. In other words, using the vocabulary of Mr. Weeks and CWS, they were not </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">had been refurbished. In the 50 stores the sales performance of which was assessed as part of the Harlech trial the Revised Dividend was actively promoted by advertising and the like. A control group of 39 former CRS stores, considered to be </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“like for like”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> to the stores in the trial, was constituted from other stores in the former CRS South West and Wales &amp; Border regions which were not in the Harlech Television region and not the beneficiaries of any particular advertising. The average weekly sales turnover of both the trial stores and the control group in the eight week period prior to the trial and during the period of the trial itself were compared with the turnover of the particular store in the equivalent periods of the previous year. The results of the Harlech trial were that, on average, the percentage increase in the sales turnover of the stores in which the Revised Dividend was offered over the period of the trial and the eight weeks preceding that, as compared with the sales turnover in the equivalent periods of the preceding year, was 3.61%, while the stores in the control group sustained, on average, a decrease in sales turnover of 0.47%. The difference between +3.61% and –0.47% is 4.08%, rounded to 4.1%. It was thus considered by CWS that the stores in which the Revised Dividend was tried outperformed the control stores by a growth of sales turnover of 4.1% on average. However, that average concealed a wide range of variations. In eleven of the stores in which the Revised Dividend was tried the sales turnover during the trial period as compared with the previous year was actually down. The largest decline in turnover was 12.44%, but there was also one store where the decline was 5.22%, one where it was 3.12%, three where it was more than 2% and three where it was more than 1%. All bar one of the stores in which the Revised Dividend was tried and which showed a decline in sales turnover as compared with the previous year showed declines of percentages greater than the average decline in sales turnover of the control group. Of the stores which showed an increase in sales turnover during the trial period as compared with the previous year, the largest increase was of 14.08%, two stores showed an increase of in excess of 11%, one an increase of over 10%, five showed increases of more than 8%, while nine showed increases of 2% or less, with the lowest increase being just 0.56%. Obviously, with such a wide spread of results the possibility existed of individual results having a disproportionate effect on the overall average. There was simply no discernible pattern to the results of the trial of the Revised Dividend as compared with the trading performance of the various stores in the previous year. Even in a similar geographical location, such as Bath, in which there were four stores in the trial, the results were quite different. The best performing Bath store increased its sales turnover by 8.88% during the trial of Revised Dividend as compared with the previous year, while the worst performing Bath store achieved only 1.60% increase, and the other two achieved increases of 2% and 3.75%, respectively.    </span>

Convenience of the location of a particular store to a particular customer might well be significant. Lack of local competition could also be relevant. These unaided thoughts were confirmed by the results of market research undertaken for CWS as part of its marketing strategy review in 1997 prior to the introduction of the Original Dividend. At that time, of those respondents who indicated that they were likely to shop at a Co-op, that is CWS, store in Price Band 1 the overwhelmingly most frequently stated reason was convenience. No other reason came anywhere near in terms of popularity. The next most popular reasons were that the customer already shopped at the store and that the store had a good selection of items. Conversely, of those respondents who indicated that they were unlikely to shop at a CWS store, the overwhelmingly most frequently given answer was that it was not convenient.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> I accept the evidence and conclusions of Mr. Gaysford in the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph. That passage was put to Mr. Bowes by Mr. Carr in cross-examination. Mr. Bowes disputed the correctness not only of Mr. Gaysford’s opinion, but also the accuracy of the research to which he referred. Mr. Bowes plainly has a fundamentalist faith in the value of loyalty schemes as an attraction to customers for groceries. He went so far, in cross-examination, as to attribute the recent poor market performance of Safeway and Somerfield, which has also recently discontinued its loyalty scheme, substantially, if not entirely, to the decision of each to withdraw its loyalty scheme. Those opinions of Mr. Bowes not only are not supported by any evidence other than his own conviction, but are contradicted by the mass of evidence to which I have referred, and also by the results, to which I am about to come, of the introduction of the Revised Dividend throughout the CWS stores group as currently constituted, that is to say, including the former CRS stores. I unhesitatingly reject the evidence of Mr. Bowes as to the attractiveness to customers of grocery shops of loyalty schemes. I am satisfied that, while there may be an initial high level of take-up by customers upon the launch of a loyalty scheme, that is largely attributable to the advertising associated with the launch of a new scheme. No evidence was put before me which demonstrated that any significant number of new customers was attracted by a loyalty scheme. Rather the evidence suggested that those most likely to apply for membership of a loyalty scheme were existing customers of the offeror of the scheme. There was no evidence put before me that the amount spent on average by holders of loyalty cards increased after they had become card holders, whether assessed per spend, that is to say, by reference to the amount spent in the offering store on any given occasion, or over some chronological period, such as a week or a month or a year. Mr. Bowes did draw to my attention during his cross-examination the fact that Sainsbury has offered a loyalty scheme for a number of years and that it has recently relaunched its scheme as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Nectar”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> scheme. Mr. Bowes relied upon that fact as evidence in support of his view as to the value of loyalty schemes. He told me that the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Nectar” </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">scheme is in fact organised jointly between Sainsbury, the Debenhams stores group, BP and Barclaycard. He did not seem minded to draw any conclusion from the fact that four substantial presences in the retailing sector had felt it appropriate to co-operate to run a loyalty scheme which presumably was designed to attract custom to each of them in part by reason of their respective associations with the others. What that circumstance suggests to me is that each participant in the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Nectar”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> scheme considered that the well-established single group loyalty scheme did not achieve its professed aim, and so it was appropriate to seek to combine through a single loyalty scheme the activities of grocery shopping, departmental store shopping, purchasing petrol, and paying for all this enthusiastic retail therapy with a credit card. Whether the scheme succeeds remains to be seen. What is, however, quite obvious, is that the offering is completely different from any feature of the Revised Dividend.</span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The first was an amount of £145,000 in respect of alleged delay in implementing the Revised Dividend in the Harlech Television region as part of the Harlech trial. What was contended was that if the GlobalSTORE  project had been completed for rollout on 28 August 2000 the Harlech trial would have commenced on 8 January 2001, whereas it in fact commenced 25 weeks later, on 2 July 2001. I have already indicated my findings of fact as to that assertion. The claim related to the period of 25 weeks between 14 January 2001 and 30 June 2001. The amount of the claim was revised in the evidence of Mr. Brian Boothroyd, an accountant called as an expert on behalf of CWS, to a total of £286,000. A number of elements went into the calculation of that figure. The first was the amount of the alleged average increase sales turnover of 4.1%, the derivation of which I have already explained. That factor of 4.1% was then applied to an earned margin said to have been calculated on a store by store basis and expressed as a percentage of actual sales turnover in the relevant period. According to Mr. Boothroyd, earned margin for each relevant store was arrived at by taking total turnover of sales, deducting cost of goods sold and leakage, and adding back retrospective income. The totals of the earned margins for each relevant store for the relevant period were then aggregated. The result was said to be £1,563,432. To that figure was added an amount of £100,787 in respect of what was described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“margin mix gain”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The justification for that addition was said, in essence, to be that different product lines in the various stores produce different margins for CWS. As a result, it was contended, of the introduction of the Revised Dividend in the Harlech trial stores the mix of products sold altered in the 25 week period under consideration as compared with the mix achieved in calendar year 2000, producing an increase in margin of 0.07%. That figure was, as I understand it, applied to the total alleged sales turnover in the relevant period of stores in the Harlech trial which did not previously offer the CRS loyalty scheme, uplifted by 4.1%, to produce the figure of £100,787. The next element in the calculation was an amount of £653,968, described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Dividend support”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The alleged basis for the inclusion of this element in the calculation at all was that those who supply CWS with products which rank for the Dividend make a contribution towards the cost of paying the Dividend in the form of a rebate of part of the purchase price of the goods in question. There is not, apparently, any single rate at which rebate is allowed by suppliers. Whether any rebate, and if so at what rate, is allowed by a particular supplier is a matter for individual negotiation with that supplier. Some suppliers have been accustomed, according to Mr. Boothroyd, to contribute in effect half of the cost of the Original Dividend. Overall, according to Mr. Boothroyd, the Dividend support expressed as a percentage of the total turnover (that is, of both goods which were eligible for the Dividend and those which were not) in 2001 amounted to 0.4. That percentage was applied to the alleged total turnover in the relevant period of stores in the Harlech trial, uplifted by 4.1%, amounting to £163,491,915, to produce an amount of £653,968.The remaining positive element in the calculation of the claim in respect of the alleged delay in the commencement of the Harlech trial was an amount of £142,229 in respect of non-redemption of Dividend pay-out vouchers. This element needs to be taken with a deduction from the total so far produced by the calculation which I have explained of £1,653,822 in respect of the cost of Dividend pay-outs in stores participating in the Harlech trial which did not previously offer the CRS loyalty scheme. That cost was apparently calculated on the basis of the percentage which the costs of paying out the Revised Dividend since the actual introduction of the Revised Dividend in the Harlech trial stores represented of the turnover of each of those stores considered individually. The Dividend is paid out twice yearly in the form of vouchers exchangeable for cash or goods. CWS evidence showed that on average 8.6% by value of vouchers were not redeemed. The other elements in the calculation of the sum of £286,000 were allowances for costs saved in respect of staff costs and distribution costs, which CWS treated as, to a degree, variable with sales, and costs of administering the Revised Dividend had it been offered.</span>

The relevant stores were divided into four sub-categories, namely, (i) former CRS stores which were refurbished before 8 July 2001 and which were in areas abutting regions in which there were existing CWS stores and in which Original Dividend was introduced as soon as possible after the merger of CRS and CWS in the interests of consistency of offering by stores then within the CWS umbrella, (ii) former CWS stores in the North East and Cumbria region, (iii) other former CWS stores and (iv) other former CRS stores in areas abutting regions in which there were former CWS stores. The former CRS stores in the first of these categories numbered 33 and included 25 stores in what was called the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Vision 32”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> project, about which I shall have more to say a little later in this judgment. The purpose of the division between categories (i) and (iv) is obscure. In each case the claim was for alleged loss of profit over a period of 46 weeks, from 8 July 2001, when it is said that the Revised Dividend would have been made available to CWS customers nationally had the GlobalSTORE project proved successful in achieving rollout in September 2000, until 27 May 2002, when the Revised Dividend was made available to customers in all CWS stores nationally.  The justification put forward for the division between categories (i) and (iv) was that the stores in category (iv), which numbered 29, were refurbished during the period 8 July 2001 and 1 May 2002 and, so it was said, would, had the GlobalSTORE project been successful at achieving rollout in September 2000, have gone on 8 July 2001 straight from offering no loyalty scheme to offering the Revised Dividend, while the stores in category (i) would have gone through a period of offering the Original Dividend before changing over to the Revised Dividend. Whether or not that is so, it was not said to affect the period over which it was appropriate to claim damages or the basis of the calculation. In the case of categories (i) and (iv) what was done to calculate the alleged loss of profits was to compare the average weekly turnover of sales of the aggregate of the relevant stores in what, in CWS terms, were weeks 1 to 19 of 2001, with the turnover of the stores in the equivalent period of the previous year, and to do the same exercise for weeks 20 to 30, initially. Subsequently the second exercise was extended to the period from week 20 to week 39. The first part of the comparison, that between weeks 1 to 19 in each of the years 2001 and 2002 was, as I understand it, designed to identify any general trend in sales prior to the introduction of the Revised Dividend. The Revised Dividend was introduced in week 20 of 2002, so that the comparison of average weekly sales turnover from week 20 in 2001 and from week 20 in 2002 was intended to assess the impact of the Revised Dividend since introduction over an equivalent period of the year. The division between categories (ii) and (iii) reflected the internal organisation of CWS. The significance of it was that CWS had no data relating to the actual performance of stores in the North East and Cumbria region, and so had simply adopted the same approach to those stores which had been brought into account in the damages calculation as had been adopted in relation to the other former CWS stores which were taken into account in the damages calculation. In fact not all former CWS stores were brought into account, but only those considered by CWS </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“like for like”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. In all 345 former CWS stores were brought into account. Similar comparisons to those which I have described in respect of the former CRS stores in categories (i) and (iv) were undertaken in relation to average weekly sales for stores in category (iii), but on a store by store basis. The average of the results of the comparison were then applied to the stores in category (ii). </span>

Apparently the number of the relevant existing CWS stores taken into account in the later comparison was reduced to 324, the 21 stores omitted in the new evaluation having been refurbished in the interim. Mr. Boothroyd recalculated the second element of the claim for damages in respect of alleged delay in the introduction of the Revised Dividend at paragraph 2.11 of a report dated 8 November 2002 at a total of £3,815,000. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The methodology adopted in relation to the calculation of the loss of profits said to have been sustained by each of the categories of store included in the relevant former CRS stores or the relevant existing CWS stores was similar to that adopted in relation to the loss of profits claim in respect of stores included in the Harlech trial. The starting point in each calculation was the aggregate earned margin which it was contended would have been made on the sales turnover actually achieved as adjusted by the uplift which it was contended was appropriate. No element was included in any of the calculations for margin mix gain. Dividend support was taken into account, but in the earned margin calculation and not shown as a separate item. That notwithstanding, non-redemptions were shown separately, but as a credit item against the claim in each case. The only positive addition to the earned margin element in each calculation was a sum said to represent net savings in the cost of the loyalty scheme. Those net savings were said to result from the fact that the actual amounts which CWS would have had to pay out by way of the Dividend to card holders would be less under the Revised Dividend than under the Original Dividend. In other words, from the standpoint of the card holder, the Revised Dividend was less advantageous than the Original Dividend. I shall make further comment upon that later in this judgment. Mr. Mawrey submitted that, even if I were unpersuaded that CWS would have achieved any additional sales as a result of the introduction of the Revised Dividend, CWS had at least lost from the alleged delay in introducing the Revised Dividend the savings in the costs of the scheme as compared with the costs of the Original Dividend. Staff costs and administration costs were assumed to be unaffected by the introduction of the Revised Dividend. Allowances were made against the claim for each category of store in respect of distribution costs.   </span>

The best performing store achieved an increase in average weekly sales turnover of 19.84%, while the worst achieved a reduction in turnover of 23.57%. In all 27 stores sustained a reduction in average weekly sales turnover, seven of them of more than 10%. Conversely, eight stores achieved an increase of more than 10%. There was no obvious pattern to the results. The picture was identical if one considered the calculation of the increase in sales turnover in the relevant existing CWS stores of 1.14%. The highest increase was 20.06%, while the greatest decline was by 16.93%. Roughly half of the relevant existing CWS stores sustained a decline in average weekly sales turnover.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Mawrey, in urging me to accept the average figures advanced on behalf of CWS in support of its claim for loss of profits, submitted that the methodology which produced those averages was one used by CWS over a number of years on a regular basis, and it was simply a feature of retail grocery trading that there were large divergences between particular stores. He contended that the correct view was that averaging smoothed out the divergences and produced a result with which I could be confident. That struck me as far too simplistic an approach. I have already indicated my assessment of the evidence relating to the attractiveness or otherwise of loyalty card schemes so far as the business of CWS was concerned. That assessment took into account the variability of the results of the comparisons of the performance of the individual relevant former CRS stores and relevant existing CWS stores between week 20 and week 30 in 2002 and 2001. It also took into account the fact that if one extended the comparison to week 39 the apparent average increase in weekly sales turnover in the relevant former CRS stores and the relevant existing CWS stores diminished substantially. If one were playing the percentages game, the decline in the increase in average weekly sales turnover in the relevant existing CWS stores comparing a week 20 to week 39 period with a week 20 to week 30 period was 29.83%, while in the relevant former CRS stores it was 75.29%. All of these factors indicate, in my judgment, that the comparison upon which CWS relied was completely unrealistic. The vast spread of results and the absence of any discernible pattern are, it seems to me, only consistent with a conclusion that there is no evidence that the Revised Dividend produced any increase in sales turnover whatever. Rather a whole lot of individual factors affect individual stores and on the material put before me it is not easy to isolate any particular one. All one can say with confidence is that the results of the comparisons relied on do not prove that the Revised Dividend has any beneficial effect on turnover.</span>

That would at least be some indication of whether new customers were being attracted into CWS stores. That has not been done. One could also usefully consider whether existing holders of Dividend cards had spent more after the introduction of the Revised Dividend.  That, too, has not been done.

This analysis would have been clearly relevant to the claim. For example, if the majority of sales increases were due to non-loyalty card holders spending more money at tCG stores, then it would be illogical for tCG to argue that any increase in sales was due to the new “3 and 1” scheme. Such a result may simply reflect a sales increase due to the intense marketing and promotional activity around the time of the introduction of the “3 and 1” scheme, and possibly other factors.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Bowes and Mr. Braithwaite were asked by Mr. Carr in cross-examination about the points made by Mr. Lemar in paragraphs 2.14 to 2.16 inclusive of his report dated 11 October 2002. Each confirmed that the data to which Mr. Lemar referred was held by CWS, although not routinely analysed by CWS for its own purposes. When the points were put to Mr. Boothroyd in cross-examination it seemed to me that he had no real answer to them. He made a half-hearted attempt to suggest that analysis of the data might actually increase the amount of the loss of profits sustained by CWS. This attempt involved conjuring up one of the mythical figures of this action, the Dividend card holder who never used his card during the period of the Original Dividend because all he bought was cigarettes and a newspaper on his way to work, or cigarettes and lager on his way home. This phantom personage, it was suggested, was an existing card holder whose purchases of his cigarettes and beer, if continued at their level during the period of the Original Dividend, when they would not rank for the Dividend, would show during the period of the Revised Dividend, when they would rank for the Dividend, as increased purchases. While it may be that there were some people who held Dividend cards during the period of the Original Dividend who for practical purposes never used them, it seems to me to be far more likely that someone most, or all, of whose purchases did not rank for the Dividend would be unlikely to have taken the trouble to apply for a Dividend card in the first place. Certainly the explanation offered did not seem to me to be remotely satisfactory as a reason for not undertaking investigations which were both possible and extremely significant. There was a suggestion from Mr. Boothroyd that the production of the information to which Mr. Lemar referred would be expensive. Mr. Lemar disputed that, saying that all that was involved, at most, was writing a simple software program to search out the data required from that which was already stored by CWS. I accept the evidence of Mr. Lemar on this point in preference to the assertion of Mr. Boothroyd.  I have a strong suspicion that the real reason why such investigations were not undertaken was that it was believed within CWS that the results would not be helpful to the claim for damages for loss of profits as a result of the alleged delay in introducing the Revised Dividend.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">There are two principal reasons for the suspicion which I have expressed at the end of the preceding paragraph. I have already drawn attention to the facts that the results of averaging a very broad range of both positive and negative figures for growth of sales turnover at particular stores on an average weekly basis was to produce very small positive percentages of growth, and that the effect of considering a longer period than that first considered as indicating the impact of the introduction of the Revised Dividend was that those percentages decreased so that each was less than 1, in one case barely above zero. The question therefore arises what was the reason or were the reasons for that limited average growth in the initial period of the Revised Dividend, which was introduced nationally on 27 May 2002, and what might explain how the initial burst of growth, if that is not overstating what even on CWS’s figures amounted to little more than a shoot of growth breaking cover, thereafter subsided. Logic would suggest that perhaps something or some things occurring in the period of the introduction of the Revised Dividend or immediately thereafter could be relevant. That certainly seems to be how CWS sees it. The interim report of the Co-operative Group for 2002 was put in evidence. My attention was drawn to a section in that report dealing with </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Co-operative Group Trading”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. The </span>

Despite this, consumer spending nationally remained positive, with the Golden Jubilee and the World Cup together helping to give a strong finish to the period. Away from food retailing, however, the picture was far more mixed, with non-food doing well to hold its own, while the difficult trading conditions in the travel industry resulted in both sales and profits in Travelcare being below expectations.</span>

	    <p class="BlockText" style="margin-left:0.49in">I accept that the impact of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Her Majesty the Queen and of the football World Cup was positive so far as what is loosely called food retailing is concerned. I therefore accept that the attribution of CWS in its interim report for 2002 of those events assisting in a strong finish to the period under review is correct. The interim report did not attribute the performance of Co-operative Group Trading during the relevant period in any way to any beneficial effect of the introduction of the Revised Dividend, although that that had happened was mentioned in the report. It was accepted by Mr. Boothroyd in cross-examination that the beneficial effect upon trade of events such as the Golden Jubilee and the World Cup would be likely to be smoothed out over time. Thus, it seems to me to follow that a reduction in the average increase in weekly sales turnover the longer the period after the introduction of the Revised Dividend one took was exactly what one would expect if it were attributable in substance to special events such as the Golden Jubilee celebrations and the World Cup. It may also be material that, as Mr. Braithwaite accepted in cross-examination, the fact that the Revised Dividend was introduced nationally some two weeks after a Dividend payout, would tend to increase sales during the period immediately following. </p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The second reason for the suspicion which I have expressed as to why the data to which Mr. Lemar referred and which is available was not produced is that the introduction of the Revised Dividend was never actually envisaged or intended as a means of increasing the volume of sales turnover. The intention, as Mr. Bowes made plain in his cross-examination, was simply to save money. I have already indicated that it was in the event accepted by Mr. Braithwaite that the Harlech trial could provide no worthwhile information on any view as to the likely impact of replacing the Original Dividend with the Revised Dividend so far as attractiveness to actual or potential customers of CWS was concerned. Mr. Bowes gave evidence that a trial (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Hatfield trial”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) was undertaken in former CWS stores in the Hatfield area to seek to assess directly the impact of replacing the Original Dividend with the Revised Dividend. The trial sample was small, only 11 stores in which the Revised Dividend was introduced and 10 </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“like for like”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> control stores in which the Original Dividend was retained. It was, I think, accepted by the end of the trial of the action, at least by Mr. Boothroyd, that the size of the sample for the Hatfield trial was too small for anything worthwhile to be derived from the results. The point about the limited value of the Hatfield trial was put to Mr. Bowes in cross-examination. What Mr. Bowes said in response was:-</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The reduction of the cost to CWS of operating the Dividend by introducing the Revised Dividend was sought to be achieved by a combination of two principal means. The first was a reduction of the total amount paid out to Dividend card holders as the Dividend. The second depended on Dividend support. The hope was that those suppliers who allowed a rebate to CWS in respect of Dividend support in connection with the Original Dividend, at 5% on Co-op brand goods, and who might, and in some cases did, contribute half of the Dividend amount, or 2½% of the retail price of the goods, would be prepared to continue to contribute at the same rate notwithstanding that the rate of the Dividend paid to card holders on Co-op brand goods was to reduce to 3%. To the extent that this hope was realised, therefore, the bulk of the burden of the cost of the Dividend on those items would be transferred from CWS to its suppliers. In addition, the extension of the net of the Dividend into other branded products potentially introduced new providers of Dividend support to CWS. However, whatever the success of CWS in relation to Dividend support for the Revised Dividend, no secret was made at the trial before me of the fact that actually the expectation was that the Revised Dividend scheme would result in smaller payouts to cardholders. Although commendable frankness was shown to me in relation to this reality, the same cannot be said of how the Revised Dividend was presented to current and potential card holders. Mr. Carr put it to Mr. Bowes that what the public was told was that the offer with the Revised Dividend was better than the offer with the Original Dividend. As Mr. Bowes candidly replied:-  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">What it comes to, therefore, is that current card holders and potential card holders were, in effect, exposed to the risk of becoming the victims of a confidence trick, whereunder the benefits of the Revised Dividend, which were actually expected to be less than those of the Original Dividend, were presented as being greater. I see no reason to suppose that this deception would not have been detected by at least a significant number of those at whom the Revised Dividend was directed. The reduction of the rate at which the Dividend was paid on Co-op brand goods from 5% to 3%, but the inclusion of a Dividend of 1% in place of nothing on other branded goods, made it difficult for customers to assess the relative attractiveness of the two schemes.

The first distribution of vouchers after the introduction of the Revised Dividend was to take place in December 2002. That would be the first occasion upon which card holders familiar with the Original Dividend would be able to make some definite evaluation of whether they individually have been better off with the Revised Dividend than with the Original Dividend. Given that it is not expected that on average they will be, some adverse reaction could prudently be anticipated. Anything other than a minimal adverse reaction would be sufficient to eliminate entirely the extremely modest overall average increase in weekly sales turnover now put forward as having resulted from the introduction of the Revised Dividend. It could also eliminate the benefit of the reduction in the cost of the Revised Dividend, as compared with the cost of the Original Dividend, to CWS if a decline in profits counterbalanced the savings in costs. I am not, therefore, satisfied that Mr. Mawrey’s submission that CWS had on any view lost the benefit of the cost savings brought about by the introduction of the Revised Dividend was well-founded.</span>

In the light of the point that any scheme has a life limited in point of time, Mr. Carr submitted that the claims for loss of profits on the part of CWS were in any event misconceived. The calculation of the claims proceeded on the basis that the profits said to have been lost were lost forever. In fact, submitted Mr. Carr, those profits, if otherwise there would have been any, were not lost forever, but merely deferred. If one supposed that the effective life of the Revised Dividend was five years, then it was still five years, even if the period of five years commenced at a date later than that originally anticipated. I accept that submission. The logic of it is impeccable. It would follow that, even if any reduction in sales turnover during the period, or some part of the period, which formed the basis of the claim for loss of profits in stores other than those involved in the Harlech trial, as compared with what they would have been had the Revised Dividend been introduced, had been shown, the appropriate basis of assessment of compensation would be deferred receipt rather than total loss. It would essentially be a claim for loss of interest on the amount of demonstrated reduction in profits for whatever was the period of delay in receipt.</span>

The effective date of the New PCMS Agreement was said in Section 16 to be 1 July 2001, that is to say, the earliest date upon which the Original PCMS Agreement could have been terminated by CWS. Various services to be provided by PCMS were set out in Schedule 1 to the New PCMS Agreement. These included the provision of a helpline service. The basis of charging set out in the New PCMS Agreement was somewhat different from that set out in the Original PCMS Agreement in that it provided for payment of an amount per card holder per month on the basis that the helpline service was provided within stated standards, namely </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Average call durations are 2.0-2.5 minutes. Average call numbers for all opening hours are 130,000-150,000 per calendar quarter.”</span>

The amount of service provided by PCMS under the New PCMS Agreement in respect of the helpline for the flat fees paid thus was substantially less than that for which the Original PCMS Agreement provided. Quite apart from the reduction in the out of hours and weekend service, answering time per call was reduced from an average 5.12 minutes to an average 2 to 2½ minutes, and the number of calls answered per calendar quarter from 156,000 (12,000 per week for 13 weeks), to a maximum of 150,000.

As I have already pointed out, assuming that the New PCMS Agreement came into force on 1 July 2001, it succeeded the Original PCMS Agreement on the earliest date that that agreement could have been terminated by CWS. It is obviously possible that PCMS would have been inclined to renegotiate the Original PCMS Agreement during the period in which it could not have been terminated in accordance with its terms, but no evidence has been put before me to indicate that that was in fact so. Unless PCMS was prepared to forgo the benefit of its existing contractual rights under the Original PCMS Agreement, the New PCMS Agreement came into force at the earliest date it could possibly have done. On that basis there is no conceivable basis for this element of claim. In any event the reduction in levels of charge under the New PCMS Agreement by something of the order of £0.30 per card holder per annum, or about 22%, at best (comparing the charge of £1.38 under the Original PCMS Agreement for up to 1.25 million cardholders with £1.08 per annum under the New PCMS Agreement for up to one million cardholders) seems to reflect a reduction in levels of service to card holders on the helpline of some 113% in terms of </span>

My analysis suggests that CWS is paying under the New PCMS Agreement proportionately more for a significantly worse service for its card holders.</span>

According to the evidence of Mr. Mel Dutton, who is a contract project manager whose services are provided to CWS through an organisation called Project One Consulting, in his first witness statement, the total cost of what was called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Vision 420”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, which was the project to install ISS300 and Vision in those former CRS stores which had not participated in Vision 32, was £6,956,238. For the purposes of seeking to evaluate the counterclaim of ICL for loss of profits on the assumption that the termination of the GlobalSTORE project amounted to a breach of the CRS Agreement, Mr. Lemar sought out documents which indicated what the total revenue anticipated by ICL from the GlobalSTORE project was. There was a lamentable paucity of documentation, but Mr. Lemar did find three draft budgets apparently produced with a view to being attached to an agreement between ICL and CWS in relation to the GlobalSTORE project, had such an agreement been executed. The budgets were dated, respectively, 14 June 2000, 19 October 2000 and 18 December 2000. The total budgeted revenue in each of those budgets, respectively, was £13,149,000, £12,989,000 and £12,994,000. Each of those figures suggests that it is likely that CWS achieved very substantial savings by adopting the ISS300 and Vision solution as compared with completing the GlobalSTORE project. However, it is fair to say that very little attention was given at the trial before me to the precise composition of the various budgets or their accuracy as an indication of the likely cost to CWS of completing the GlobalSTORE project. It is also right to say that no point was taken on behalf of ICL that CWS was overall better off by following the course it did than by completing the GlobalSTORE project. I therefore proceed to consider the individual claims for additional costs on their merits, on the assumption, of course, that CWS otherwise has a valid claim against ICL for damages for breach of some contract.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The sum claimed in respect of Vision 32 was what was said to be the additional cost to CWS of carrying out the Vision 32 project separately from the Vision 420 project in order to meet its commercial need for former CRS stores adjacent to former CWS stores to start to trade as soon as possible as CWS stores offering the Dividend. The Vision 32 project was in fact carried out by ICL. The validity of the claim in principle, on the assumption that CWS otherwise has a claim for damages for breach of contract, was disputed on the ground that the alleged loss was not foreseeable at the date of the contract for which CWS contended. I do not consider that that ground of objection would be sound if one supposed, as one has to for the purpose of considering the possible validity of this head of claim, that ICL had bound itself by contract to do something by a particular date which, had it been done, would have rendered the Vision 32 programme unnecessary. On that assumption the loss in respect of this element of claim would plainly have been foreseeable. If something agreed to be done by a particular date had not been done by that date and the failure to do it had implications for the business of CWS, it is obvious that steps might have to be taken to mitigate the effect of the breach by providing in some other way that which should have been provided.</span>

On the assumption that the need for two programmes arose because of a failure on the part of ICL to do by a date which it had contracted to meet something which, had it been done, would have rendered the Vision 32 project unnecessary, I agree with that analysis.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Boothroyd evaluated the additional cost of installing ISS300 and Vision in the stores which participated in the Vision 32 programme separately rather than as part of an enlarged Vision 420 programme at £238,532, the pleaded sum. Mr. Lemar raised two points on that quantification. The first was that it had been made on the basis that only the variable costs of the Vision 420 project would have increased if the Vision 32 stores had been included in an enlarged programme, and the fixed costs would have been unaffected. While he agreed with that approach in principle, he considered that the description, in a schedule prepared by Mr. Dutton, of some of what were contended to be fixed costs indicated that they were in fact variable costs. The second point was that there may have been some benefit to the managers involved in the Vision 420 project from experience gained in the Vision 32 programme, and that some allowance should be made for that in evaluating the worth of the Vision 32 claim.</span>

He explained that CWS held a stock of tills and peripherals which was in effect recycled. He also said that the additional PCMS resource to which he had referred in his listing related to a contribution sought by PCMS to costs which were allegedly being incurred as part of rollout. I accept the evidence of Mr. Dutton on these points. Mr. Lemar in his cross-examination by Mr. Mawrey was effectively asked to assume that the facts of which Mr. Dutton spoke in relation to each of these items were correct, and, on the basis that the assumed facts were true, invited to agree that his concerns were misplaced. That he did. In the result I am satisfied that the first of Mr. Lemar’s points had no substance on the facts.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">), but also of other items, including price books, Multisave newsletters and order books. As I have already mentioned, CRS effectively outsourced its information technology requirements to ATOS, in fact under an agreement between them dated 30 June 1998. Following the transfer of the engagements of CRS to CWS CWS had a requirement for the format of, and information contained in, SELs in former CRS stores to match that used in former CWS stores. The information technology systems in place in and serving the former CRS stores were not able to provide this facility, although there were printers in the stores which could have undertaken the physical printing if the desired message as to what to print could have been communicated. Consequently, it was necessary for SELs to be printed at a central location in bulk and then distributed to individual stores weekly. One of the facilities which the GlobalSTORE project was supposed to provide to former CRS stores was the ability to print SELs in the format required by CWS in store. However, until that facility was available it was arranged by an agreement (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Memorandum of Understanding”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) dated 31 May 2000 and made between CWS and ATOS that ATOS would continue to provide various services formerly provided under the agreement with CRS dated 30 June 1998 to CWS until 28 February 2001, with an option granted to CWS to extend that term until 30 April 2001. The services which ATOS continued to provide included bulk printing and distribution of SELs.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The facts in relation to SELs which I have set out so far were not controversial. Nor was it controversial that the sums in fact paid by CWS to ATOS in respect of the bulk printing and distribution of SELs totalled £469,948. The latter figure was agreed between Mr. Boothroyd and Mr. Lemar. What was controversial was what Mr. Foster contended would have been the cost of printing SELs in the format desired by CWS in the former CRS stores in the period January 2001 to November 2001 if the facility for such printing had been in existence. That cost Mr. Foster put in his second witness statement at just £87.41 per store per year, which would mean that the cost of printing SELs in the former CRS stores in the period January 2001 to November 2001 would have been only £29,843. The costs included in the calculation of that figure were only cost of paper and cost of additional toners for the in-store printers. Mr. Lemar’s position was that the reduction in alleged costs was so great that it just could not possibly be right. He identified various likely costs of printing in-store which did not appear to have been included. In particular, Mr. Lemar noted that there was no allowance for cost of distribution of the paper or toners, no allowance for additional printer maintenance, no allowance for extra printer depreciation and no allowance for the labour cost of printing. The answers suggested to these points were, first, as appeared from the breakdown of the actual costs incurred by CWS in respect of bulk printing of SELs in the period January 2001 to November 2001 set out at paragraph 6.33 of Mr. Boothroyd’s second report, the largest single element in those costs, amounting to almost half, was the cost of distributing printed SELs to stores. Apart from that, it was suggested to Mr. Lemar, and he agreed, that if the paper and additional toners, the delivery of which was not time-critical, were sent to stores when there happened to be space available on a delivery vehicle which was going to the store anyway, there was really no marginal cost of distribution. Again, it was suggested to Mr. Lemar, and he agreed, that if the additional printer usage resulting from printing SELs in-store was of the order of 7%, there may well not have been any significant need for additional printer maintenance. It was also suggested that the contract which CWS had for printer maintenance was fixed price regardless of the number of call-outs. As for printer depreciation, I think that Mr. Lemar accepted that, at the suggested level of increased usage, there was no need to adjust the basis upon which printers were depreciated. Finally, Mr. Lemar accepted that, broadly speaking, the labour cost of loading paper into a printer, switching it on and thereafter removing the printed SELs, would be likely to be equivalent to the labour cost of receiving printed SELs from a delivery vehicle, opening the package or packages, and putting the SELs in order.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In the end, while I share, and sympathise with, Mr. Lemar’s unease about the dramatic alleged savings resulting from being able to print SELs in-store in the former CRS stores, unless one can put one’s finger on what was wrong with the calculation performed by Mr. Foster, upon which Mr. Boothroyd based his calculation, there is no reason not to accept it. Thus, had it been necessary, I should have assessed the value of this part of the claim at the sum which is the arithmetical result of subtracting from the agreed actual cost of £469,948 the cost calculated by Mr. Boothroyd for in-store printing of SELs during the period January 2001 to November 2001 of £29,843, namely £440,105.  </span>

The equivalent application within the existing CWS information technology system was CTS. Once the decision had been made by CWS that hosting of price update files should be by means of CTS rather than RB2 for the former CRS stores, one of the objectives of the GlobalSTORE project was that CTS should replace RB2 for the former CRS stores. RB2 was originally provided to CRS by ATOS. ATOS subcontracted the provision of support to CRS for RB2 to a company called AIM Commercial Systems Ltd. (</span>

Strictly, therefore, the relevant subcontracts were novated as between CWS and AIM. Subsequently, by an agreement contained in an order and agreement form numbered 01/02/11980 made between AIM and CWS AIM agreed to provide out of hours support to RB2 from 1 March 2001 at a price of £17,845 per quarter.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It is, I think, plain from the exchange of e-mails between Mr. Pearson and AIM to which I have referred that Mr. Pearson was unaware of the need for CWS to give 13 weeks notice to terminate the support arrangements with AIM. It was suggested by Mr. Boothroyd in answer to cross-examination from Mr. Carr on this item of claim that he had been told that had the need to give notice arisen in about February 2001 it would not have been Mr. Pearson who would have dealt with it, but a Mr. Hardman. Mr. Hardman was not called to give evidence, so it is a matter of speculation whether, as was suggested, Mr. Hardman would have appreciated the need to give 13 weeks notice under the arrangements made in February 2001. What seems more relevant is that new arrangements were made between CWS and AIM just at the time when Mr. Garner suggested that notice would otherwise have been given to terminate the support agreement. No evidence was led of what notice, if any, was required to be given under the sub-contracts originally made between ATOS and AIM which were novated as between CWS and AIM. It seems to me realistic, if the factual foundation for this head of claim was otherwise sound, that is to say ICL had been in breach of a contractual obligation to enable pilot to take place on 28 August 2000, which, had it happened, would have enabled CWS to complete the installation of GlobalSTORE in former CRS stores by the end of March 2001, to suppose that the new arrangements made in February 2001 would never have been made. However, if one then assumes that the new arrangements were made in an attempt to mitigate loss, prima facie the sum paid under the new arrangements, in respect of which it seems notice to terminate was given as soon as it was considered prudent, would be recoverable in full, subject to the foreseeability point. Consequently, the issues raised by Mr. Lemar do not really arise. Whatever the position was under the previous arrangements, new arrangements were made which did require 13 weeks notice. Mr. Pearson evidently did not appreciate the notice period required. However, accepting as prudent Mr. Lemar’s point that CWS could not really be expected to give notice to terminate the support arrangements until it was confident they were no longer needed, it is difficult to see any scope for criticism of CWS for not raising the prospect of termination any earlier than it did. At that time the earliest date upon which effective notice could begin to run was 1 December 2001, and notice was given which did run from that date. However, the point as to foreseeability raised by Mr. Carr in relation to this item seems to me to be a complete answer, no matter how reasonable the steps actually taken by CWS. Even if CWS had established the contract for which it contended and breach of that contract I should have held that this item of claim failed.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The alleged foundation for this element of claim was that, at the time of the change in the GlobalSTORE project from using an ISS400 platform to using an ISS300 platform ICL agreed that there would be no additional cost to CWS in respect of the provision of licences for ISS300. That is indeed so, so far as licences for ISS300 used in connection with GlobalSTORE is concerned. However, the contention upon which this item of claim was based was, as it were, that ICL was bound to grant licences free of charge to CWS to use ISS300 in the former CRS stores whether or not used in connection with GlobalSTORE. Thus, so it was said, because when PCMS was employed to undertake the Vision 420 programme it had to obtain ISS300 licences from ICL which it passed on to CWS at a cost, that cost should be recoverable as damages from ICL. The Vision 32 programme was undertaken by ICL itself and no issue was alleged to arise in relation to the provision of the licences to use ISS300 installed as part of that programme.</span>

That is a false analysis. Once a contract has been broken and brought to an end, as CWS contended the contract which it alleged with ICL had been, there is no surviving obligation on either party to perform it. In place of any obligation to perform the contract there is substituted an obligation on a party in breach of contract to pay damages by way of compensation. The amount of those damages depends upon proof of loss, as I have already said. No loss, no damages, no matter how flagrant the breach. CWS not having attempted to demonstrate that the sum paid to PCMS for providing ISS300, with licences, and Vision to the former CRS stores included in the Vision 420 programme exceeded the sum which would have been payable to ICL for providing ISS400, with licences, or ISS300, with licences, and GlobalSTORE to those stores, can recover no damages in respect of this item.</span>

Mr. Boothroyd, in paragraph 8.22 of his second report, listed a number of different figures derived from a variety of different documents which were said to be indicative of the charge actually made by PCMS for the licences in question. The figures ranged from £586,500 to £977,500. Curiously, two of the documents emanated from ICL and were addressed to CWS. They therefore indicated what ICL had in mind at May and June 2000 to charge CWS for ISS300 licences. Why they should be considered relevant, but not the evidence of what ICL actually charged PCMS for the relevant licences I confess I fail to understand. In a document entitled </span>

On the totality of the evidence, if I had to determine what was the cost to CWS of the ISS300 licences granted in relation to the former CRS stores included in the Vision 420 programme, I could only hold that it was at least £300,000, the sum paid by PCMS to ICL for the licences. I imagine that it is to be expected that PCMS would have applied some sort of mark-up to its actual cost figures, but there is no worthwhile evidence before me as to what the mark-up, if any, in fact was, or what a reasonable mark-up would be.</span>

Again, it was not in dispute that outside contractors, such as Mr. Croll, were also involved in this work and charged £19,750 in respect of their involvement. There was a dispute as to the sum which it was sought to charge in respect of the time allegedly spent by CWS employees on this work, a total of £12,103. The issue was whether there was reliable evidence of how much time was spent, given the absence of time records. Once again, in my judgment the absence of contemporary records of time spent, and the reliance upon vague estimates of how long it was, in this case provided by Mr. Garner, is fatal to proof of that part of the claim. The main issues in relation to each of the alleged items of software development were whether it would have been necessary in any event if CWS had elected not to engage in the GlobalSTORE project and what prompted it.

As far as I am aware this was the consequence of the change to ISS/300 and, given that this change was proposed by ICL in order to make up lost time on GlobalSTORE , I would not have expected tCG to have been charged for the conversion.

It was therefore possible that, on installation of the Vision back-office, the information held on the back-office might not be the same as prices held on ISS/400 in that store.

ICL’s case was that the item file conversion work was rendered necessary by the decision of CWS eventually to use CTS rather than RB2 as the relevant central system. In this state of confusion I am simply not satisfied that, even if there had been a contract between CWS and ICL and ICL had been in breach of it, the item file conversion work had anything to do with any breach of contract on the part of ICL.</p>

The terminals provided by the bank were not seriously considered due to the time it would have taken to develop Vision to pass transaction values to the bank’s terminal and accept authorisation messages back from the bank’s terminal. It would also have required bank approval, which itself can take 2 to 3 months alone.

I am not persuaded that that is correct. On the assumption that there had been a contract between CWS and ICL and that CWS had validly terminated that contract for breach on the part of ICL in failing to provide satisfactory software by an agreed date, it does not seem to me that it would in any way have been unreasonable for CWS to consider that whatever the solution to the problem of the routers, it did not have to pursue one involving ICL. </span>

Vision did not have that functionality, and so, when Vision replaced GlobalSTORE as the application for the former CRS stores, that functionality had to be developed in Vision.

That meant that it was not possible to upgrade software at the till remotely using the existing CWS system of sending it with instructions displayed on the screen which could then be followed. Some alternative means of remote upgrading, or remote software distribution, was necessary. The solution was for Vision software to be modified so that remote upgrading could take place without the need for someone to follow instructions on a screen. GlobalSTORE was supposed, according to the evidence of Mr. Cook, to include the functionality to do this. Thus, on the case of CWS, the cost of employing PCMS to develop Vision was a cost consequent upon the failure of ICL to produce GlobalSTORE.

The sums claimed in respect of these items were not broken down between the individual items. All I could do in those circumstances would have been to treat each as having equal value, and thus awarded three-quarters of the costs which I found proved, namely the sum paid to PCMS and the sum charged by contractors, making a total of £89,812.50.</span>

That meant, according to Mr. Cook and Mr. Garner, that modems had to be installed in each of the stores in the Vision 420 programme to enable remote collection of the relevant files. Thus, on the hypothesis that, save in relation to the items claimed as additional costs in the amended Schedule 7 to the Particulars of Claim, the costs of the installation of Vision on an ISS300 platform were the same as the costs of completing the GlobalSTORE project, this element of cost does seem to me to be an extra the need to incur which was the change from GlobalSTORE to Vision.</span>

Vision utilised DAT drives for the purpose which I have described. GlobalSTORE used a more modern means of backing up information and so did not need a DAT drive. As a consequence of the change from GlobalSTORE to Vision DAT drives had to be provided, so it was said, in each of the former CRS stores which participated in the Vision 420 programme. Again, therefore, on the hypothesis which I have adopted in a consideration of this part of the claims of CWS, the claimed cost of DAT drives would be recoverable if there had been a contract and ICL had been in breach of it.</span>

However, as Mr. Garner accepted in cross-examination, the existing CISCO routers had a resale value. What that value was was not established.

However, it was contended on behalf of ICL that the otherwise agreed sum was not recoverable in any event for two reasons. The first was that it was not foreseeable at the date of the contract contended for on behalf of CWS, namely March or April 2000, that CWS would want to proceed with the Harlech trial as part of the installation of GlobalSTORE, or at a time fixed on the assumption that particular progress would be made with GlobalSTORE. On the totality of the evidence it seems to me that that submission is well-founded. It is plain, in my judgment, from the contemporaneous communications between the information technology department of CWS Retail, on the one hand, and Mr. Bowes, on the other, that while Mr. Bowes wished the Harlech trial to take place starting in February, not January, as now alleged, 2001, the information technology department was not prepared to commit itself to anything.  Moreover, there was no evidence that it was ever made clear to ICL at the time of the alleged agreement that the date of the Harlech trial was in any way fixed, dependent upon the conclusion of the GlobalSTORE project. Thus it seems to me that the first ground of objection to this item of damage taken on behalf of ICL was well-founded, and that the claim fails on that account. In my judgment it also failed for the second reason advanced on behalf of ICL, namely, that on the facts, in the light of the evidence of Mr. Bowes in cross-examination (Transcript page 962 line 19 to page 963 line 13), it seems that the necessary modification to the software already in the former CRS stores in the Harlech Television region to enable the Harlech trial to proceed had been made in, or at least shortly after, January 2001.

As stated above, I was involved in the Vision 32 roll-out, installing Vision into 25 historic CRS stores, some of which were installed with RF. RF is generally only used within the historic CWS estate if there are logistical reasons which make it difficult to cable, for example, in petrol stations. In the historic CRS estate RF was more prevalent. Problems were encountered during the roll-out of Vision 32 stores which utilised RF. RF is the means by which the tills communicate with each other and the back-office server. In the ISS/400 stores the tills all communicate individually with the back-office server and each till either needs to be physically attached to the server by wiring or by RF transmitters. In the ISS/300 stores, the tills operate on the basis of having one master till which communicates with the back-office and several “slave” tills. The master till communicates with the back-office server and then information is fed to the other tills (or from the other tills) via the master till.</span>

I am unsure as to why this was the case although at the time there were discussions as to whether ISS/300 put more traffic through the RF system because information was being transmitted by each till to the master till and then relayed to the back-office. Matters were also not helped by the fact that ISS/300 tends to find it difficult to recover once it finds a break in the network. Essentially, the Vision 32 project showed that RF was not as stable when used in conjunction with ISS/300, as it had been working on an ISS/400 platform with the tills in the historic CRS stores.</span>

He was reluctant to admit that there was a problem with the RF and proposed a solution known as a time-out change, which makes it easier for an application to recover when it loses the network. By the time this solution was available we had already hard-wired most of the stores. At the request of ICL we did leave one of the stores (at Yeading) on RF so that they could see where a problem was occurring in the system and to allow them to install their time-out change solution. However, this did not make the system as stable as it had been with ISS/400 and the store was eventually hard-wired.</span>

We could see that the tills were dropping out of the network and failing to recover, along with the other symptoms that we had encountered with Vision 32. My overall view was that RF in conjunction with ISS/300 was fragile. I say this particularly because I recall that in some stores, the location of fridges and other electronic equipment had a bearing on when the RF would fail. Similarly, I recall that one of the stores was close to a fire station and thought that the proximity of the radio communications in the fire station was having a bearing upon the RF. It became difficult to predict whether we would have a problem in store or not, but if a problem occurred then it caused a lot of disruption. Once Vision is installed, if tills go down, they have to be recovered and attempts made to make the system work. If this doesn’t work then you have to make arrangements for the store to be hard-wired, which causes further disruption, a second visit from engineers, etc. It was also extremely difficult to identify which stores might or might not have a problem with RF. It was not possible to spot stores which would have a problem, hard wire those stores and leave the others on RF.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The alleged justification for the claim in respect of RF seemed to be that the need to hard-wire was caused entirely by the decision to change from an ISS400 platform to an ISS300 platform. It seemed to be contended that while RF would work perfectly satisfactorily with an ISS400 platform, it would not with an ISS300 platform. That contention was disputed by ICL on technical grounds. Mr. Christopher Kent, who is an employee of ICL who is expert in the field of RF, was called to give evidence in relation both to the supposed problem and in relation to investigations which he made at the time of the complaints of CWS about problems with RF. Mr. Kent’s witness statement included the following:-</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">4. My involvement came about because ICL, through Geoff Williams, the project manager on the ICL side for the Vision 32 rollout, had become aware that there were difficulties being experienced with the operation of the RF network in a number of stores to which ISS300/Vision had been installed. I was asked to carry out a technical investigation into exactly why this was happening – the Yeading store was chosen as the subject store for my investigation. In January 2001 I therefore began this task – my job was to “troubleshoot” these issues, and in particular to work out whether or not the ISS300 software was causing greater network traffic to be generated which would impact on the efficient operation of the RF network. A copy of the report which I produced from this investigation is annexed to this statement as Exhibit CK1.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">5. The report showed that the problem was nothing to do with any fundamental difference between ISS300 and ISS400, because the network traffic being generated by ISS300 was if anything less than ISS400. What I actually discovered was that the way ISS300 had been set up was causing a problem and also that the tills were all trying to back themselves up continuously due to problems that occurred during a master/alternate swap. This was causing them to slow down somewhat in their operation.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">6. As a result of this discovery, ICL introduced a timeout change into the configuration of the ISS300 software, which was trialled in the Yeading store. I do not know what the results of that trial were, but I do know that the problem which we had identified was a small configuration problem, which, even if the Yeading solution hadn’t worked, was quite capable of resolution both cheaply and quickly. It was not a big technical issue.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">7. A further important point to make is that the efficient operation of a RF network can be affected by a huge number of factors, its interaction with the till software being only one. A common cause of RF network problems is any change of store layout, which can easily affect the radio transmission – the network may then fail, and cause knock on problems with the tills when they cannot communicate over the network. I have no idea whether any of the stores either in Vision 32 or the subsequent Vision 420 rollout had any changes made to them, but any refit of those stores or change to their layout or to the facilities in them generally could have affected the operation of the RF network….</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">13. There is no reason why this should be the case. The LAN analysis at Exhibit CK1 shows that there is no significant increase in network traffic, if anything ISS300 seems to send less data, although the set-up or configuration issues with ISS300 when it was installed were causing slow operation of the tills. ICL has provided perfectly stable solutions to other customers using ISS300 and RF. I would reiterate the points made above, that lots of other factors could have impacted on the operation of the RF network outside the till software, and in particular changes to store layout or content. RF hardware is fundamentally sensitive to objects placed near it (in the same way as any radio based hardware), hence any refit or change to store layout could affect its operation, and no doubt did. From Stephen Garner’s statement, it doesn’t look as though any effort was made by CWS to investigate this possible problem. If ex-CRS stores had had their layout changed, the operation of the RF equipment would have been affected irrespective of whether the till software was ISS300 or ISS400.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The evidence of Mr. Kent which I have quoted was not contradicted on technical grounds by any evidence led on behalf of CWS. Mr. Kent was cross-examined but faintly by Mr. Mawrey, and there was no suggestion made to him that his technical conclusions expressed in his witness statement were flawed. Rather the line taken by Mr. Mawrey in cross-examination of Mr. Kent was that Mr. Kent was not a retail grocer and so he could not say that it was unreasonable of CWS to want to have functioning tills in its stores. That wholly missed the point of what CWS had to show in order to succeed in this item of claim, which was that, however reasonable the decision of CWS to go for hard-wiring, the need for it was the result of some default on the part of ICL. That was not shown, and so this head of claim would have failed even if there had been a contract between CWS and ICL and ICL had been in breach of it.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">This action fails in its entirety and is dismissed. For the reasons which I have set out in this judgment, it seems to me that the claims made in this action were ill-considered and misconceived. In the absence of a contract between CWS and ICL there could be no question of ICL being in breach of contract or of CWS having been induced to enter into a contract by misrepresentation. The formidable problems of showing a contract seem never to have been seriously addressed before the trial of this action, and even at the trial Mr. Mawrey showed no enthusiasm for grappling with them. The whole focus of CWS’s case was how outrageous it was that ICL could have conducted itself as it did, as if indignation would carry the claims forward past the legal and factual difficulties. No attention appears to have been given to the issue whether, assuming that the contract for which CWS contended was made out, CWS was in law justified in treating that contract as having been repudiated at the time the decision to proceed no further with the GlobalSTORE project was taken. No one even seems to have looked at CWS’s own evidence as to the ground upon which it was actually decided to proceed no further and to have wondered whether that ground could seriously be presented as acceptance of some repudiation of the contract contended for. In the formulation of the claims for damages elementary principles as to quantification, foreseeability and the circumstances in which allegedly wasted costs can be claimed were disregarded. The approach to considering the quality of the evidence as to causation of alleged loss of profits was in my judgment so far deficient as to involve a wholesale suspension of disbelief when looking at what conclusions could fairly be drawn from the results of the Harlech trial and the introduction of the Revised Dividend. The result is that there was not merely a fatal flaw in CWS’s case from the outset, but that that flaw was compounded rather than mitigated by looking at other parts of the case. Making the most generous assessment of the totality of the evidence CWS’s case was not worth anything like the sum which it needed to be worth to justify the cost incurred in the litigation.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Although this is already a very long judgment, in particular having regard to my conclusion on the contract issue which was fatal to the claims in the action on its own, I find it necessary to add a paragraph on the organisation of the trial bundles in this case. What was thought appropriate, I know not by whom, was to organise the bundles so that the statements of a factual witness who made more than one statement were found in different bundles and that attached to each statement of each witness of fact, again in bundles separate from the statement itself, were copies of the documents to which reference was made in the statement. There was no bundle or series of bundles in which was to be found a straightforward collection arranged in chronological order of contemporaneous documentation of any particular category, such as communications between the parties, records of tests, specifications or the like. Some contemporaneous material was to be found in bundles annexed to expert’s reports. The first avoidable consequence of the approach which was adopted to the preparation of the bundles was that there was far too much physical material in the bundles. Each document which was referred to by more than one witness was copied separately for each witness who referred to it. That had the consequence that any given document had a number of different references in the bundles, so that the same document could be, and was, identified during the trial by a number of different page and bundle references, which does not assist comprehension. The failure to organise the bundles of contemporaneous material in chronological runs meant that, during cross-examination, it was often necessary to have open three or four bundles simultaneously in order for a line of cross-examination based on a particular sequence of exchanges between the parties to be pursued. It has also meant that it has been quite unnecessarily difficult for me to organise the material which I have needed to consider for the purpose of preparing this judgment. In short, the way in which it was decided to organise the trial bundles seemed to have been contrived to make life as difficult as possible for anyone who actually had to use the bundles, rather than to charge for their preparation. Given the conclusions which I have reached in this case, it may be that there is no separate need to consider a special order for costs in relation to the mindless and wasteful way in which the trial bundles were prepared. However, it is a matter which those responsible for preparing bundles for use at a trial should consider carefully, for on any occasion upon which it does matter, it may be expected that the court will take an unfavourable view of bundles which contain needless numbers of copies of the same document and are organised so as to be as difficult to use as could be devised.</span>
