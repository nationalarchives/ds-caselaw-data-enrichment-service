	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) at Coldfield Drive, Oakenshaw Wood, Redditch in Worcestershire belonging to the Claimant in each action, Tesco Stores Ltd. (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Tesco”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">). In the Fire the Store was seriously damaged. Instead of rebuilding it as it had been before the Fire Tesco chose, no doubt for sound commercial reasons, to have constructed a larger store, some 10,000 square feet larger than the Store. The detailed implications of that decision, if they need to be considered at all, are for a second round of the present litigation.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The Store was originally constructed for Tesco between about April 1989 and about March 1990 by Costain Construction Ltd. (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Costain”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">). Costain is the First Defendant in each of Action 07 and Action 439. Costain is, and has been at all times material to Action 07 and Action 439, a member of a group of companies (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Costain Group”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Other Costain Company”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">). The Other Costain Company was, until notice of discontinuance of the claims against it was given during the course of the present trial, the Second Defendant in each of Action 07 and Action 439. There were no other defendants in Action 439. Action 07 was commenced by a claim form issued on 9 January 2002. I shall come to consider the nature of the claims made in Action 07, but after that action was commenced it was decided on behalf of Tesco that it wished to make additional claims against both Costain and the Other Costain Company. As I shall explain, questions of limitation are relevant to the claims which Tesco seeks to pursue against Costain and it was considered appropriate in the first instance for the claims which it was desired to pursue against Costain and, at that time, the Other Costain Company in addition to those made in Action 07 to be made in a new action so that any question of limitation which arose in relation to the new claims could be dealt with on its merits, and not be prejudiced by seeking to add the new claims by amendment in Action 07. Action 439 was commenced by a claim form issued on 13 November 2002.</span>

In Action 07 complaint was made in relation to the report contained in a letter dated 19 October 1993. In Action 439 complaint was added in respect of the report contained in a letter dated 27 May 1994. In its Amended Defence in Action 07 Costain denied that it had concluded any contract with Tesco in relation to the construction of the Store, although it was admitted that Costain had in fact built it. Costain further denied that it owed to Tesco the duties of care in respect of the construction of the Store for which Tesco contended. The inspection of the Store in October 1993 was admitted, but it was contended that it had been competently carried out and the results properly reported. Limitation defences were advanced in respect of all claims.</span>

However, Costain seemed to have no very positive case as to what inspection was undertaken before the letter dated 19 October 1993 was written. Rather its case as pleaded was that it was not possible now to say who had carried out an inspection or of what that inspection consisted. To supply that deficiency a case was set out as to what the inspection most probably amounted to and it was asserted that it would not have been practicable for the person making the inspection to have damaged the structure of the Store in order to inspect all that which might have been inspected had there been no objection to invasive investigation. Moreover, it was contended that it would have been reasonable for the person making the inspection to proceed on the basis that the original drawings of the Store showed what was required under relevant regulations at the time of construction, and thus reasonable for such person to conclude that the relevant requirements were met if what was shown on the drawings was what was seen on site, without revisiting the question of what the relevant requirements were. Further it was contended that on the balance of probabilities whoever made the inspection on behalf of Costain had been accompanied by a representative of PHJ. The point was also made that Tesco could not have relied on the letter dated 19 October 1993 as in its letter dated 28 April 1994 it requested PHJ to undertake an identical inspection to that upon which Costain reported in its letter dated 19 October 1993. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It appears that certainly from the latter part of the 1980s Tesco had embarked upon a programme of having constructed for it a considerable number of new supermarkets all over the United Kingdom, other than in Northern Ireland. The preferred means of arranging for the construction of a particular supermarket seems to have been on a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Design and Build”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> basis. As operated by Tesco what that basis apparently involved in the first instance was Tesco putting together a team of professional organisations appropriate to the task of designing the supermarket, in particular architects, structural engineers, and building services engineers, and Tesco itself entering into appropriate contracts of engagement with the relevant organisations. Thereafter Tesco would identify a building contractor to undertake the actual work of construction and enter into a contract (a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Main Contract”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) with that contractor. Under the terms of the Main Contract the contractor was obliged to assume liability for the design of the supermarket in question. However, it was contemplated that the contractor would enter into contracts of novation with Tesco and each relevant professional organisation engaged to design any aspect of the supermarket under which the benefit and burden of the contract originally made between Tesco and the particular organisation was effectively transferred to the contractor. Separately, so it appears, Tesco engaged quantity surveyors to act in connection with the particular project to advise on costs and, to an extent, to act as agents of Tesco in relation to such matters as securing the execution of appropriate contract documentation.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">I shall come separately to deal with the involvement of PHJ in the design of the Store, but it is material at this stage to notice that that involvement commenced some time in 1988. That was a considerable period before the execution of the PHJ Agreement. Costain’s involvement seems to have commenced when it was invited, by a letter dated 16 November 1988 written on behalf of Tesco by Bucknalls, to submit a first stage tender for the construction of the Store. That was not the first time that Costain had been invited to submit a tender for the construction of a supermarket for Tesco. It was clear from the material put before me that Costain was at that time familiar with Tesco’s wishes to use Standard Documentation and to have the contractor for any supermarket enter into a Main Contract under seal under which the contractor accepted design responsibilities. It also appeared that Costain was in principle prepared to deal with Tesco on the terms desired by Tesco, subject to appropriate back-to-back arrangements being made with the relevant architects and other professional organisations.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">My attention was drawn in particular to the involvement of Costain in three projects for Tesco in 1988 and 1989. One project concerned the construction of an extension to a warehouse at Crick. In that case it appeared that Costain executed a form of the Main Contract included in Issue No. 6 with amendments which included deletion of clause 4 (which was not materially different from clause 4 of the Conditions). That form of contract as executed was sent to Messrs. Spicer Partnership (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Spicer”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">), quantity surveyors acting on behalf of Tesco in relation to that project, under cover of a letter dated 24 March 1988. Execution seems to have preceded the execution of novation agreements with the relevant professional firms involved with the design in that case. Novation agreements were executed subsequently, but in the interim no form of agreement was concluded as between Tesco and Costain because the amendments made by Costain to the form of agreement which it executed were not acceptable to Tesco.</span>

Mr. Paine chased up the matter at intervals until June 1992, writing a total of four letters over a period of a year and a half or so. Then, just as Tesco and Bucknalls seem to have lost interest in the matter by about the end of 1990, he lost interest also. There the matter rested until the events which led up to the commencement of this action. As some reliance was placed upon the particular terms of Mr. Paine’s four letters, dated, respectively, 12 February 1991, 16 August 1991, 6 January 1992 and 24 June 1992, I should set out the terms of each letter.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">On 17 July 1993 a fire was started deliberately in a newsagent’s shop adjacent to a supermarket belonging to Tesco at Grove Green, Maidstone in Kent. The fire spread from the point at which it had commenced to the supermarket and caused serious damage. That prompted a concern on the part of Tesco, and in particular Mr. Fletcher, that all Tesco supermarkets constructed in the previous six years should be inspected so as to ensure that all appropriate fire prevention works had been incorporated in the construction. Tesco seems to have considered it appropriate to seek to require, in the case of each supermarket constructed during the relevant period, the contractor who built it to carry out the inspection considered necessary as a matter of urgency and without payment. That was perhaps inviting as a response an injunction in emphatic terms to depart. However, Tesco’s view of its power in the construction market place being such that contractors would be anxious to maintain its goodwill seems in large measure to have been justified, at least insofar as inspections were undertaken, and apparently without charge, but at nothing like the pace which Tesco seems to have considered was appropriate.</span>

In such circumstances, he told me, it was his practice to request the architect for the project to undertake the requisite inspection, engaging a new contractor for any necessary opening up works. I reject that as the explanation simply because the letter dated 28 April 1994 in terms asked PHJ to undertake an inspection <span style="font-style:italic">“in conjunction with </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">the </span><span style="font-style:italic">main contractors”</span>.

That is to say, rather than there being any conscious consideration of reports of inspections, it was more a case of ticking off a supermarket if there had been a letter saying that fire stopping works were satisfactory, and not ticking it off if there had not. The writing by Mr. Dainty of the letter dated 28 April 1994 presupposes that he overlooked when he did it not only Mr. Gibson-Leitch’s letter of 19 October 1993, but also both of the versions of Tesco’s running listing of supermarkets. However, the question whether Tesco in fact relied upon either Costain’s letter dated 19 October 1993 or Costain’s letter dated 27 May 1994 is one for resolution following the second round of this litigation, and so I say no more about it now. However, Tesco’s case as to what it would have done had it not received assurances as to the position concerning the Store does have a relevance to the preliminary issues, and so, without deciding whether that case is well-founded or not, it is material to set out the indications in the evidence given before me as to what that case is.</span>

I certainly do not recall suggesting that Charles Truman may have been involved in such an inspection, but if I did raise this suggestion, it must have been pure guesswork on my part, based on the assumption that if PHJ had been involved in any inspection, he may have been a likely individual to have been involved. I knew that Redditch was Graham Welch’s project and that Charles Truman worked for Graham. Charles Truman was not an architect. He was employed as a “clerk of works” and was responsible for sorting out site problems. I believe he managed small projects on site and it may well have been his job to do routine inspections for Graham Welch. However, for large inspections, the contractors would, I think, normally wish to use the architect who designed the building. A fire-stopping inspection would be a big job with lots of opening up to do. It would probably take more than a day. I do not think it is the sort of job that I would ever have expected Charles Truman to carry out, and I have to say, therefore, that it seems to me now unlikely that I would ever have suggested to Mr. O’Connor that I thought Charles might have carried out such an inspection.</span>

If I did say what is recorded, it may perhaps have been that I assumed that Costain would have wanted someone from PHJ to go with them on such an inspection. My experience is that contractors can be reluctant to take on responsibilities relating directly or indirectly to design matters and this may perhaps be why I may have supposed at the time that PHJ may had </span>

However, it was an important part of the case of Costain that I should draw inferences in particular from the file note of Mr. O’Connor as to the participation of PHJ in the inspection made by Costain prior to Mr. Gibson-Leitch writing his letter dated 19 October 1993 to Tesco. I find it impossible to draw the suggested inferences. I have already indicated my view of the accuracy of the file note. The position on the evidence which I have indicated I accept is that it is not possible to say who on behalf of Costain made an inspection of the Store with a view to reaching a conclusion as to whether it had been constructed in accordance with its design and in accordance with applicable statutory regulations, or when, other than approximately. No witness asserted that the inspection had been made jointly with some representative of PHJ. The evidence on behalf of Costain went no further than to suggest that it would have been usual for an inspection of the kind in question to have been made with the architect who had in fact designed the building, and possible that that had happened in this case. However, Mr. Gibson-Leitch did not in either of his letters dated, respectively, 19 October 1993 and 27 May 1994 mention that an inspection had been made jointly with a representative of PHJ or that advice had been sought from PHJ as to whether its design of the Store did in fact comply with relevant statutory regulations. As Mr. Gibson-Leitch was contemplating a visual inspection of the Store to confirm that it had been constructed in accordance with the drawings of PHJ, there was no obvious reason for a representative of PHJ to attend at the inspection. The contribution which PHJ was, on Costain’s case, expected to make, was to confirm, or not, that the design complied with applicable statutory regulations. That was not specifically requested in Mr. Burley’s letter dated 9 September 1993, or at any other time, on the evidence. Had it been requested, what providing the relevant information involved was simply a consideration of the drawings against the background of a knowledge of the relevant regulations. That could have been done without whoever was entrusted with the task on behalf of PHJ leaving his desk. No one has been identified as the person who was likely to have attended an inspection on behalf of PHJ who is a viable candidate for the role. The only suggested person, Mr. Truman, no longer worked for PHJ at the relevant time, and was not appropriately qualified to advise as to compliance with relevant statutory regulations in any event.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In their closing submissions Mr. Marcus Taverner Q.C, and Mr. Simon Hargreaves, who appeared on behalf of Costain, called attention to the documents relating to the New Oscott Store which had by then become available and changed their focus somewhat from that which it had originally been – an invitation to infer that a representative of PHJ had made an inspection of the Store jointly with a representative or representatives of Costain – to an invitation to infer that following the request to Mr. Heckels to supply the fire precautions drawings for the Store PHJ had reconsidered the adequacy of the design of the fire precautions and assured Costain that those designs were satisfactory, as well as inspected the Store jointly with Costain. Given that the letter dated 7 September 1993 written by Mr. Heckels indicated, so far as it went, that PHJ had </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">not</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> undertaken a joint inspection of the New Oscott Store jointly with Costain, one can readily understand that alteration in focus. In fact it seems to me that there is no reason to infer that PHJ did reconsider the adequacy of its design of fire precautions at the Store following receipt of Mr. Burley’s letter dated 9 September 1993. Whereas the request in relation to the New Oscott Store had been dealt with by the job architect, Mr. Heckels, the request in relation to the Store was dealt with by someone who had no knowledge of the Store and was not even a qualified architect, Mr. O’Connor. The reconsideration by Mr. Heckels of his design of fire precautions for the New Oscott Store had not revealed any problems and that may well have reassured PHJ that there was nothing to reconsider in relation to the Store. The fundamentals of the design of fire stopping and inhibiting measures for each of the New Oscott Store and the Store seem to have been similar, although while the drawings for the New Oscott Store did show the lines of cavity barriers in the mono-pitched roof, those for the Store did not. It would seem that Costain did not request any representative of PHJ to attend any opening up at the New Oscott Store, and that circumstance also may have led PHJ to consider that there was no need to reconsider its designs in respect of the fire stopping and inhibiting works at the Store. In reality there appears to me to be nothing in the evidence to justify the drawing of the revised inference for which Mr. Taverner and Mr. Hargreaves contended.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">As a further point which appeared to arise from the documents relating to the New Oscott Store and the further cross-examination of witnesses called on behalf of PHJ in relation to them, Mr. Taverner submitted that the letter dated 20 August 1993 from Tesco put the request contained in the letter dated 31 August 1993 written by Costain to PHJ in a context which could usefully also have informed PHJ’s response to the request contained in the letter dated 9 September 1993, namely that both Tesco and Costain were seeking reassurance as to the adequacy of the design by PHJ of fire stopping and inhibiting measures, and not simply seeking to be provided with copies of drawings. That that was so, Mr. Taverner contended, was plain both from the terms of the Tesco letter dated 20 August 1993 copied to PHJ, but also from the terms of the letter dated 31 August 1993 written by Costain. In particular, Mr. Taverner asserted that the sentence in the latter letter, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Please supply </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">by return</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> all relevant drawings indicating areas/details to be investigated”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, was to be understood as a request by Costain not merely for copies of drawings which showed fire protection measures, but for advice as to which precise areas of the building or details within it needed to be investigated. Mr. Taverner sought to support that submission by reference to Mr. Heckels’s response in his letter dated 7 September 1993 in which, so Mr. Taverner contended, Mr. Heckels gave just the sort of advice which had been requested. The force of that submission was somewhat diminished by a whiff of a criticism that by the terms of his reply Mr. Heckels had suggested, erroneously, that all that needed to be considered was the fire protection to the structural steelwork. In fact, in my judgment, the submission was unsound. The sentence from the letter dated 31 August 1993 upon which Mr. Taverner relied does not seem to me to bear the meaning for which he contended. It was not, in my judgment, a request that PHJ identify what investigations Costain should carry out, or as to what Costain should look for in undertaking its inspection, as Mr. Taverner seemed to assert, but a simple request that PHJ should provide copies of the relevant drawings. In other words, the expression </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“indicating areas/details to be investigated”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> was adjectival, describing the drawings of which copies were wanted, and not equivalent to a conjunction and an infinitive, which is what Mr. Taverner’s submission would involve. That Mr. Heckels, by his response in his letter dated 7 September 1993 sought to explain why the drawings of which he sent copies showed what they did, and not something else, cannot remotely, as it seems to me, be taken as any giving of advice that the designs were proper designs or any indication that PHJ accepted a duty of care to Costain or anyone else in relation to the provision of the copy drawings or what was shown on them.</span>

It seems to me to be plain that, whatever the merits of the assertion that there was in fact a novation by conduct of the PHJ Agreement as between Costain, PHJ and Tesco, or the assertion that Costain is estopped from denying that there had been such a novation, the issue is not advanced by reliance on Mr. Laird’s infelicitous use of language as to a matter concerning which it would seem he had no knowledge, as it was not suggested that he had had any involvement in the construction of the Store or in the making of any contractual arrangements in relation to it. All he was really saying to PHJ in his letter, as it seems to me, was a question has arisen as to the structural safety of this building which you designed and I would like you to advise me about it.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It was a feature of the trial of preliminary issues that, although some issues were of direct interest only to Tesco and Costain, or only to Tesco and PHJ, each of Costain and PHJ sought, where it had no adverse implications for its own position to do so, to support the case of Tesco against the other. Nowhere was this more apparent than in relation to the Costain Contract Issues. While it seemed to me that the general nature of the case advanced on behalf of Costain by Mr. Taverner and Mr. Hargreaves was tolerably clear, namely that Costain only ever carried out work in connection with the Store pursuant to the terms of the letters dated, respectively 20 and 23 March 1989, the material parts of which I have set out earlier in this judgment, which were characterised as letters of intent, there seemed to be a considerable amount of forensic mystification expressed both on behalf of Tesco by Mr. Roger Stewart Q.C. and Mr. Graham Chapman, and on behalf of PHJ by Mr. Peter Coulson Q.C. and Mr. Derek Holwill as to whether Costain could possibly be contending that it had not entered into any contract at all with Tesco in relation to the Store. The position of each of Tesco and PHJ on this question seemed to be that it was so obvious that there was a contract that the contrary could not be advanced by someone in control of his facial muscles. </span>

In support of its contention that a contract (and a contract on its standard terms) was concluded between the parties Tesco relies on the following:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">(6) It is sometimes said that the parties must agree on the essential terms and that it is only matters of detail which can be left over. This may be misleading, since the word “essential” in that context is ambiguous. If by “essential” one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true: the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract. If by “essential” one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract, then the statement is tautologous. If by an “essential” one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail, the statement is untrue. It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and, if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant. It is the parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge “the masters of their contractual fate”. Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. It happens everyday when parties enter into so-called “heads of agreement”.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Before I turn to the facts it is important to consider briefly the approach to be adopted to the issue of contract formation in this case. It seems to me that four matters are of importance. The first is the fact that English law generally adopts an objective theory of contract formation. That means that in practice our law generally ignores the subjective expectations and the unexpressed reservations of the parties. Instead the governing criterion is the reasonable expectations of honest men. And in the present case that means that the yardstick is the reasonable expectations of sensible businessmen. Secondly, it is true that the coincidence of offer and acceptance will in the vast majority of cases represent the mechanism of contract formation. It is so in the case of a contract alleged to have been made by an exchange of correspondence. But it is not necessarily so in the case of a contract alleged to have come into existence during and as a result of performance. See </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">[1979] 1 WLR 294. The third matter is the impact of the fact that the transaction is executed rather than executory. It is a consideration of the first importance on a number of levels. See </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd. v. Novinex </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">[1949] 1 KB 628 at p. 630. The fact that the transaction was performed on both sides will often make it unrealistic to argue that there was no intention to enter into legal relations. It will often make it difficult to submit that the contract is void for vagueness or uncertainty. Specifically, the fact that the transaction is executed makes it easier to imply a term resolving any uncertainty, or, alternatively, it may make it possible to treat a matter not finalised in negotiations as inessential. In this case fully executed transactions are under consideration. Clearly, similar considerations may sometimes be relevant in partly executed transactions. Fourthly, if a contract only comes into existence during and as a result of performance of the transaction it will frequently be possible to hold that the contract impliedly and retrospectively covers pre-contractual performance.

Intention (although itself necessarily subjective) is judged objectively – i.e. by the words and conduct of the party concerned. The usual method of testing such an intention is to identify a clear offer by one party which has been unequivocally accepted by the other. However, the courts have recognised that in a commercial/construction context it will sometimes (and perhaps often) be difficult to identify with any precision a single offer to which a single acceptance is given in the course of complex and prolonged negotiations between the parties. What is important and determinative is whether from an objective point of view the parties can be said to have agreed on all essential matters and intend themselves to be legally bound by such agreement.</span>

In other words, offer and acceptance were not really relevant, and a contract could, as it were, be imposed upon parties as a result of negotiations between them reaching a point at which nothing of substance was the continuing subject of discussion. It also appeared to be suggested that such a conclusion, namely that a contract had come into existence, was reinforced if the parties conducted themselves in the manner which would have been appropriate if the contract under negotiation had been concluded and come into effect. This approach to contract formation obviously ascribes little or no significance to formality as an indication one way or the other of an intention or not to enter into contractual relations and seems to come close to disregarding the injunction of Lloyd LJ in </span>

Not only that, but in the circumstances of the present case it seemed to be contended that there should be imposed upon Costain a contract which was to be treated as if it had been executed under seal, because the contract being negotiated, if it had been concluded would, or probably would, have been executed under seal.

It is, in my judgment, a strong strand in the policy guiding the development of the law over the years that the question whether or not a contract has been made should depend, fundamentally, upon the intention of the parties to the supposed contract, objectively ascertained, to make an agreement by which they desire to be legally bound. In other words, the law does not impose upon parties a contract which they have not made for themselves, any more than it imposes upon parties who have made a contract a term as an implied term which they have not themselves agreed just because the court considers that the term would be a beneficial addition to the contract.

The court will not even improve the contract which the parties have made for themselves, however desirable the improvement might be. The court’s function is to interpret and apply the contract which the parties have made for themselves. If the express terms are perfectly clear and free from ambiguity, there is no choice to be made between different possible meanings; the clear terms must be applied even if the court thinks some other terms would have been more suitable. An unexpressed term can be implied if and only if the court finds that the parties must have intended that term to form part of their contract; if is not enough for the court to find that such a term would have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been suggested to them; it must have been a term that went without saying, a term </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The court adopts an objective approach to ascertaining the intentions of the parties to a contract or supposed contract for purely practical reasons. The orderly conduct of affairs depends upon people being taken to mean what they say, rather than being able to avoid the consequences of what they say in reliance upon unexpressed reservations. Thus if, objectively, a person conducts himself, by speech, writing or behaviour, in such a way as to indicate that he intends to assume by agreement legally binding obligations the law visits upon him the objective consequences of his conduct. However, in so doing the law is not seeking to disregard what his actual intentions were, only to confine the scope of the enquiry as to his actual intentions to objective manifestations of those intentions. In their closing submissions Mr. Coulson and Mr. Holwill seemed to place great emphasis upon the evidence of various witnesses called before me, particularly on behalf of Tesco, as to their personal thoughts and beliefs in 1989 and 1990 as to whether a contract had been concluded between Tesco and Costain, and, if so, on what terms. I disregard that evidence as irrelevant to the enquiry. It is trite law that the test of contract formation is objective, as Steyn LJ pointed out in the passage from his judgment in </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">If the consideration of whether, in a particular case, parties have entered into a legally binding agreement is to amount to more than a consideration of how to impose liability upon a party which is viewed as morally deserving of it, that consideration must involve the application of known principles in a predictable fashion. It is in this context that the notions of offer and acceptance are of significance. If parties execute an agreement in writing, then, subject to any expressed reservations that what has been agreed is </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Subject to Contract”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, or some similar suspensive condition, it may usually be taken that they intend to be legally bound by that which they have agreed. In any other case in which it is said that a legally binding agreement has been made, but that is disputed, it is necessary to consider, first, whether an agreement has actually been made, and, second, if so, whether the parties to it intended to be legally bound by it. Conceptually an agreement is a meeting of minds as to a state of affairs or as to mutual rights and obligations. An agreement which is not contained in a single document executed by both parties will normally be the result of one party indicating to the other his views or proposals, and the other indicating his assent to those views or proposals. Using the traditional language of the English law of contract, one party makes an offer to the other and the other indicates his acceptance. Thus the offer and the acceptance in the first place both establish that there has been an agreement and what are the terms of the agreement. Those terms are likely also to indicate whether the parties intend to be bound in law to observe the terms of the agreement. Consequently, the notions of offer and acceptance are, in my judgment, of the highest importance in any consideration of the issues whether an agreement has been made and, if so, what were the terms of the agreement and whether the parties intended to be legally bound by those terms. </span>

The view taken by the judge was that the battle should extend over a wide area and the court should do its best to look into the minds of the parties and make certain assumptions. In my judgment, the battle has to be conducted in accordance with set rules. It is a battle more on classical 18</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">upon which both Mr. Coulson and Mr. Stewart relied, need to be considered in the context of the issue in that case. What had happened was that the owner of a site in the London Docklands decided to develop it. A contractor, Wimpey Construction Management (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“WCM”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">), in May 1988 submitted a tender for the undertaking of the development as a management contractor. Part of the work necessary to the undertaking of the development was the building of a piled retaining structure around the site. Stent Foundations Ltd. (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Stent”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) was invited in June 1988 by a quantity surveyor acting on behalf of the site owner to submit a tender for the piling work. That tender was accepted on 29 June 1988, by which time WCM was the front runner for selection as the contractor for the development. On 14 July 1988 a meeting took place at which representatives of Stent, WCM and the quantity surveyors attended. WCM made clear at the meeting the form of contract which it intended should be made between it and Stent. On 17 August 1988 the quantity surveyors, acting on behalf of the site owner, instructed Stent to commence work and indicated that it would be required to enter into a sub-contract with WCM. At a meeting on 28 September 1988 WCM indicated to Stent that it would be entering into a form of management contract with all package contractors. Stent started work on 19 October 1988 and completed it by 31 January 1989. WCM said that it could not enter into a formal contract with Stent until it had entered into a contract with the site owner. That did not happen until 17 January 1989. At first instance there was an issue as to whether in those circumstances all of the terms essential to the making of a contract between WCM and Stent had been agreed. That point was not pursued on appeal. On appeal the sole issue was whether the parties intended to enter into an agreement other than formally in writing. That issue had been decided against WCM at first instance and the appeal against that finding was dismissed. Thus the context of the observations of Hale LJ was simply a consideration of the issue whether the agreement which it was accepted in the Court of Appeal had been made in terms sufficient to amount to a contract was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Subject to Contract”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. In that context it is hardly surprising that Hale LJ should call attention to those aspects of the case which indicated that the parties, far from behaving as if they did not intend to give effect to their agreement until it had been formalised, actually gave effect to it in their dealings after the agreement had been made. However, in a case in which the issue is whether an agreement has been made at all the conduct of the parties towards each other may have little or no relevance to the enquiry. As Lord Sumner pointed out in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Love and Stewart Ltd. v. S. Instone &amp; Co. Ltd. </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">(1917) 33 TLR 475 at page 477 even a statement by one party in negotiation for a contract to the other party to the negotiation that there was now a contract was not of any real assistance in answering the question whether there was in fact a contract, for the statement could simply be wrong as a matter of law. Equally, as it seems to me, the fact that parties have behaved towards each other in anticipation of the conclusion of a contract between them in the manner which would have been appropriate if they had in fact concluded the contract concerning which they were in negotiation is of little value in resolving the issue whether there was in fact a concluded contract.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In his oral submissions Mr. Stewart contended that on any view an agreement was concluded between Tesco and Costain by the despatch by Tesco of the letter dated 20 March 1989 to Costain and the return of that letter countersigned on behalf of Costain under cover of Costain’s letter dated 30 March 1989. He drew attention to the use of wording in the letter dated 20 March 1989 which he described as the language of contract, such as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“in consideration of the issuance of this letter”</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. Mr.Taverner and Mr. Hargreaves in their written opening seemed to contend that the letter dated 20 March 1989 as countersigned and returned to Tesco did not amount to any agreement of any sort. Rather, they appeared to submit, it was a simple request to Costain to commence work which was sufficient to support a claim to payment on a restitutionary basis for work done pursuant to the request, had such been necessary. They reminded me of the decision of Robert Goff J in </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Now the question whether in a case such as the present any contract has come into existence must depend upon the true construction of the relevant communications which have passed between the parties and the effect (if any) of their actions pursuant to those communications. There can be no hard and fast answer to the question whether a letter of intent will give rise to a binding agreement: everything must depend on the circumstances of the particular case. In most cases, where work is done pursuant to a request contained in a letter of intent, it will not matter whether a contract did or did not come into existence, because, if the party who has acted on the request is simply claiming payment, his claim will usually be based on a quantum meruit, and it will make no difference whether that claim is contractual or quasi-contractual. Of course, a quantum meruit claim (like the old actions for money had and received and for money paid) straddles the boundaries of what we now call contract and restitution, so the mere framing of a claim as a quantum meruit, or a claim for a reasonable sum, does not assist in classifying the claim as contractual or quasi contractual. But where, as here, one party is seeking to claim damages for breach of contract, the question whether any contract came into existence is of crucial importance.</span>

The latter transaction is really no more than a standing offer which, if acted on before it lapses or is lawfully withdrawn, will result in a binding contract.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">(2) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the “matrix of fact”, but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.</span>

They are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.</span>

The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars: the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax: see</span>

On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had.

Mr. Stewart, supported by Mr. Coulson, submitted that the work which Costain was being invited by the letter dated 20 March 1989 to undertake, and agreed to undertake, was the totality of the work which it was anticipated would later form the subject matter of a formal contract in the terms of the Issue 7 Main Contract, that is to say, both the construction and the design of the Store. Mr. Taverner submitted that it was plain from the structure of Issue No. 7 that it was not anticipated that a contractor entering into an Issue 7 Main Contract, and thereby accepting contractual responsibility for design work done by others already selected and engaged by Tesco, would actually enter into the Issue 7 Main Contract unless and until those for whose design work he was expected to accept contractual responsibility had entered into formal agreements with Tesco in the form of the Issue 7 Architect’s Agreement, or whichever was the relevant form of agreement in Issue No. 7, and an Issue 7 Novation Agreement had been made between the relevant professional firm, Tesco and the contractor. Thus, he submitted, against that factual background, upon proper construction of the letter dated 20 March 1989, all Costain was being invited to do, and agreed to do, in advance of the making of a formal contract in the terms of the Issue 7 Main Contract, was to commence the execution of the work which it itself, or sub-contractors engaged by it, were expected to undertake in relation to the Store, and not work which it was not contemplated that it would do itself or by sub-contractors, but only assume contractual responsibility for. So far as work which it was contemplated Costain in due course would assume contractual responsibility for, submitted Mr. Taverner, that had been commissioned by Tesco, possibly under agreements made between the relevant professional and Tesco, as was the case with the PHJ Agreement, coincidentally concluded by countersignature on behalf of PHJ on 20 March 1989 itself, and had possibly in part, as was the case with the work the subject of the PHJ Agreement, already been done before the letter dated 20 March 1989 was written. </span>

I have to say that there was an intangible quality about how exactly Mr. Stewart contended that the contract upon which Tesco sought to sue had been made and what precisely were said to be the terms of it. He did, I think, accept that he could not point to anything which was an identifiable offer or an identifiable acceptance. At times he seemed to be submitting little more than that it was notorious that Tesco would only engage contractors to build supermarkets on its own standard terms, that Costain had undertaken contractual responsibility for the design and construction of other supermarkets before the Store on the terms of the Standard Documentation, and thus should be considered as having agreed the same in respect of the Store. Certainly Mr. Coulson’s submissions in relation to the contractual arrangements between Tesco and Costain in respect of the Store amounted to little more than that. Obstacles to this approach were presented by the fact that it was undoubtedly contemplated that Employer’s</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">should be incorporated into any formal agreement between Tesco and Costain in respect of the Store. On the evidence, although both Employer’s Requirements</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">and Contractor’s</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Proposals were agreed between Costain and Tesco, acting by Bucknalls, this did not happen until about 3 April 1990 in the case of the Employer’s Requirements and about 15 March 1990 in the case of the Contractor’s Proposals, by each of which dates the construction of the Store seems to have been completed. Both Mr. Stewart and Mr. Coulson appeared attracted by the solution of dealing with the inconveniently late dates of the agreement of these documents by contending that the contract between Tesco and Costain incorporating the Issue 7 Main Contract should be considered as having been made without including Employer’s Requirements or Contractor’s Proposals. This would be a rather bizarre solution, as it would mean that the documents specific to the Store which indicated what precisely Tesco wanted built and what exactly Costain was going to do for the price which it was intending to charge would not be included within the contract.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It seems to me that in considering, objectively, the intentions of Tesco and Costain in respect of the Store in 1989 and 1990, and in particular in considering the proper construction of the letter dated 20 March 1989 written by Tesco to Costain, a factor of the first importance is that Tesco had caused to be prepared with great care a package of documents, Issue No. 7, itself the successor to a similar package of documents, Issue No. 6, which it wished to use to regulate contractually the construction of all of its supermarkets. The package contemplated a particular mechanism for structuring relations between those likely to be involved in any particular project, namely in the first instance identification by Tesco itself of the professional firms to be involved in the design of the relevant supermarket, the making of appropriate contracts of engagement directly between Tesco and each of the relevant firms, the subsequent identification of a contractor actually to build the supermarket, the novation of the engagements of the designers to the contractor and the making of a contract between Tesco and the contractor under which the contractor accepted as against Tesco contractual responsibility for the performance of all those engaged in the particular project as designers or constructors. Moreover, all of the contractual arrangements which the package  contemplated were either intended to be executed under seal, as was the position in relation to the Issue 7 Main Contract, or contained a provision like clause 9.1 of the PHJ Agreement which was apparently intended to produce by contract the same result as if the agreement had been executed under seal. Plainly, therefore, it was considered important by Tesco that those entering into agreements in the form of one of those in the package should be liable to Tesco for any breach of contract for a period of twelve years, rather than the six year period for contractual claims provided for in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Limitation Act 1980 s.5</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. No one soundly in possession of his critical faculties could contemplate for a moment accepting contractual responsibility for the specialist design work of another whom he has not selected and over whose terms of engagement he has had no control for a period of twelve years unless at very least he is in a position to enforce for his own benefit those terms of engagement in the event that he faced a claim based upon his acceptance of contractual responsibility for the work of that other. I am entirely satisfied that neither Tesco nor Costain had any thought of entering into a binding agreement under which Costain accepted contractual responsibility for the design work of PHJ, or others selected initially by Tesco, in relation to the Store unless and until, first, contracts of engagement had been concluded in the relevant standard form used by Tesco for the professional discipline in question between Tesco and each relevant professional firm, and, second, novation agreements in the terms of the Issue 7 Novation Agreement had been concluded between, in each case, Tesco, Costain and the relevant professional firm. The conduct of the parties during the period of Mr. Paine’s correspondence with Bucknalls demonstrates that this was the case, and it demonstrates that the issue of the execution of the Issue 7 Main Contract under seal was also of significance. Mr. Taverner relied in particular in his oral closing submissions on the rejection by Mr. Paine in his letter dated 2 November 1990 of the suggested </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“solution”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> to the difficulty presented by the non-availability of documents executed by Arup proposed in Miss Bell’s letter dated 30 October 1990 and her failure to seek to insist upon that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“solution” </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">as plain evidence that the parties did not intend to make a contract in the terms of the Issue 7 Main Contract in relation to the Store unless and until all relevant agreements by members of the design team had been concluded as between the relevant member and Tesco and had been novated as between the original parties and Costain, or otherwise than under seal. I accept that submission. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> was never used in contemporaneous exchanges between Tesco and Costain or that the only active negotiations between Tesco, acting by Bucknalls, and Costain seemed to have been over price and to have been resolved by about 28 June 1989. The latter point was particularly urged upon me by Mr. Stewart. He was also keen that I should notice that the expression </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“Subject to Contract”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> did not feature in exchanges between Tesco and Costain. The matter to which I have referred goes to the issue of intention to enter into contractual relations.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Coulson evidently saw the force in the points made at the end of the preceding paragraph, for he sought to deal with them by contending that the difficulties could be overcome in part by implying a term into the contract which he submitted had been made between Tesco and Costain to the effect that Tesco would procure the making of appropriate contracts between itself and the designers for whose work he asserted Costain was to be responsible and the novation of those contracts as between Tesco, Costain and the appropriate designer in each case. However, the implication of the sort of terms for which Mr. Coulson contended could not, in my judgment, be justified by application of the test formulated by Lord Pearson in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd. v. North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">. It would not represent the actual, but unexpressed agreement of Tesco and Costain, but rather the imposition of terms upon them in order to overcome an obstacle which obviously existed to the conclusion of a binding contract between them. Mr. Coulson’s suggested answer to the significance attributed by Tesco to the sealing of an Issue 7 Main Contract was that it was a matter of administration and no doubt Tesco would rather have had a contract with a six year limitation period than no contract at all. As the issue is what, objectively, Tesco and Costain intended in relation to the sealing of an Issue 7 Main Contract at a time when they were addressing the making of a formal contract, it is no answer to postulate what Tesco’s position would have been if it had known then what it knows now, namely that no contract would be sealed.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Given that, for the reasons which I have explained, neither Tesco nor Costain had any thought, contemporaneously, of entering into any contract which incorporated the terms of the Issue 7 Main Contract in advance of the making of appropriate contracts of engagement between Tesco and each of those involved in the project to construct the Store as designers, and the novation of such contracts as between Tesco, Costain and the relevant professional firm, it is in no way surprising that Tesco did not make any offer to Costain to enter into such a contract and that Costain did not make any such offer either. Rather it is plain from the contemporaneous exchanges between the parties, in Tesco’s case acting by Bucknalls, that the execution of appropriate contracts of engagement and novation agreements was what each party recognised as necessary before there could be any question of Costain entering into a contract incorporating the Issue 7 Main Contract in relation to the Store. I have little doubt that, had such contracts of engagement and novation agreements been made in respect of each of those involved in any way as designers of some part of the Store, Costain would, following agreement of the price to be paid to it, the Employer’s Requirements and the Contractor’s Proposals, have entered into a form of Issue 7 Main Contract in relation to the Store, and executed such form of contract under seal. It had done so in other cases, and the tone of Mr. Paine’s correspondence in the present case indicated a willingness to do so again. However, it just did not happen, and I see no justification for treating Costain in law as in the same position as if that which did not happen had happened.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">A curious issue which surfaced rather late, in fact only really during the hearing of the preliminary issues, was an alleged previous course of dealing. I have set out earlier in this judgment the terms of paragraphs 4A-4D of the Re-Amended Reply to the Defence of Costain and the Other Costain Company in Action 07, in which the issue was formally raised. I have already set out the evidence that in three cases prior to the project concerning the Store Costain had executed forms of the then standard version of the Tesco Main Contract before at least one of those involved in the design of the relevant project had executed an appropriate novation agreement. For the reasons which I have indicated that may have been unwise, although it does not seem to have mattered as things turned out in relation to any of the three cases. However, Mr. Stewart submitted that the fact that Costain executed forms of contract with Tesco in these three cases indicated that the absence of executed novation agreements with members of the design team in relation to the Store was no obstacle to the conclusion of a binding agreement between Tesco and Costain in the terms of the Issue 7 Main Contract concerning the Store. I confess that I just did not see the point of this submission. Whatever had happened in other cases, in the present case Costain never did execute a contract in the form of the Issue 7 Main Contract. The fact that Costain may have acted foolishly in other cases does not seem to me to present any hindrance to it acting wisely in this case. What Mr. Stewart seemed to be striving towards was some suggestion that a contract could come about as a result of a course of dealing. However, there is not the slightest justification, in my judgment, for any such suggestion. Whether, in any particular case, parties who may have dealt with each other before have concluded a binding agreement must depend upon the circumstances of that case. The relevance, if they do conclude a contract, of the fact that they have engaged in a course of dealing in the past, is simply that, if their previous dealings have been on a particular set of standard terms and their present contract is silent as to the terms which are to govern it, it can be implied from their previous course of dealing that the terms of the previous transactions are to apply – see, for example, </span>

In my judgment the </span>

It is not without significance, as it seems to me, that in the further letter dated 23 March 1989 which was written by Mr. Fletcher before Costain replied to his original letter dated 20 March 1989 he described the works which Tesco wanted Costain to commence as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the main contract works”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, a form of words which in the construction industry traditionally is used to refer to the works of construction which a main contractor carries out. By no stretch of the imagination was the request to Costain to accept contractual responsibility towards Tesco for work of design done by PHJ, Green, Sibley or Arup. Thus the answer to Issue 2(iii) is that none of the express terms alleged at paragraph 15 of the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim were terms of the contract. The material express terms were simply that Costain would commence the execution of the work of constructing the Store and in return Tesco would make payment in accordance with the terms set out in the letter dated 20 March 1989.</span>

Borderlines of responsibility cannot be defined in the abstract.

In many circumstance</span>

But responsibility for some such details may rest with other consultants, e.g. structural engineers, or with specialist contractors or subcontractors, depending on the terms of their respective contracts and their interrelationship. As with the carpenter choosing an appropriate nail, specialist details may be left to specialist subcontractors who sometimes make detailed “design” decisions without expecting or needing drawings or specifications telling them what to do. In appropriate circumstances, this would not amount to delegation by the architect of part of his own responsibility. Rather that element of composite design responsibility did not rest with him in the first place.</span>

Mr. Stewart frankly accepted that Tesco’s case that it was a term of the contract for which it contended that the limitation period in respect of any breaches should be twelve years was difficult. Absent at least a term like clause 9.1 of the PHJ Agreement, the effect of which I consider later in this judgment, it seems to me that Tesco’s case on this issue is unarguable.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">[2001] EWCA Civ 274, there is, as it seems to me, an obvious conceptual problem to be faced in relation to a submission that a party is estopped by convention from denying the existence of a contract which a fortiori has not actually been made. That is that it is plain from the authorities to which I have been referred that the essence of an estoppel by convention, if it is to exist, is an agreement between the relevant parties as to the state of affairs upon the assumption as to which they will conduct their dealings. At the same time it is fundamental to the making of a contract in English law that the parties to it should have reached agreement, quite apart from the necessity for other elements, such as consideration, in a binding contract. If the parties are actually agreed that there exists a binding contract between them, then the correct conclusion as a matter of law would seem to be that they have made the contract which they are agreed that they have made. If, for whatever reason, the correct conclusion in a particular case is that parties have not made a binding contract – and unless that is the conclusion the issue of whether there was an estoppel by convention in relation to a contract cannot arise – then it is logically impossible to see how there could nonetheless be agreement between them sufficient to give rise to an estoppel by convention that they have made the contract which actually they have not made.</span>

That seemed to prompt Mr. Stewart and Mr. Chapman, at least, in their closing submissions to concentrate more attention upon the proposition that, once a contract had been established, there could be an estoppel by convention as to its terms, than upon the proposition that there could be an estoppel by convention which prevented a party from denying that a contract which had not actually been made had been made. However, that does not actually deal with the problem, in my judgment, it merely alters slightly the precise nature of it. If one supposes that a contract has been made on set of terms A, the sort of estoppel upon which Mr. Stewart and Mr. Chapman concentrated their attention in their closing submissions involves the proposition that the parties to the contract on set of terms A are prevented from denying that it also incorporated set of terms B because they have agreed that their contract should be treated as incorporating set of terms B. However, if they really had agreed to incorporate set of terms B into their contract, the natural analysis would be that they had varied their original contract by subsequent agreement. If that were not actually the case, then again it is difficult to see that they had made a sufficient agreement to be estopped from denying that set of terms B had been introduced into their contract.</span>

The three decisions and the propositions they respectively established are (1) a common law or promissory estoppel cannot create a cause of action, Combe v. Combe [1951] 2 KB 215; (2) an estoppel by convention cannot create a cause of action either, Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co. Ltd. v. Tezas Commerce International Bank Ltd.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">In my view English law, as presently understood, does not enable the creation or recognition by estoppel of an enforceable right of the type and in the circumstances relied on in this case. First it would be necessary for such an obligation to be sufficiently certain to enable the court to give effect to it. That such certainty is required in the field of estoppels such as is claimed in this case as well as in contract was indicated by the House of Lords in Woodhouse AC Israel Cocoa Ltd. v. Nigeria Produce Marketing Co. Ltd. [1972] AC 741 and by Ralph Gibson LJ in Troop v. Gibson [1986] 1 EGLR 1, 6. For the reasons I have already given I do not think that the alleged obligation is sufficiently certain. Second, in my view, the decisions in the three Court of Appeal decisions on which M&amp;S rely do establish that such an enforceable obligation cannot be established by estoppel in the circumstances relied on in this case. This conclusion does not involve the categorisation of estoppels but is a simple application of the principles established by those cases to the obligation relied on in this. I do not consider that any of the dicta in the line of cases relied on by Baird could entitle this court to decline to apply those principles.</span>

As I have already said, the fact that there was never any agreement to reach or even to set out the essential principles which might govern any legally binding long-term relationship indicates that neither party can here objectively be taken to have intended to make any legally binding commitment of a long-term nature, and the law should not be ready to seek to fetter business relationships with its own view of what might represent appropriate business conduct, when parties have not chosen, or have not been willing or able, to do so in any identifiable legal terms themselves. These considerations, in my judgment, also make it wrong to afford relief based on estoppel, including relief limited to reliance loss, in the present context.</span>

Each version of the case is in fact, as it seems to me, a construct by means of which it is sought to impose a fanciful legal conclusion on substantially undisputed facts. The material facts, in summary, are that, as I find, in anticipation of the making of a contract in terms which were substantially agreed as from the date of the letter dated 20 March 1989 written by Mr. Fletcher to Costain, subject to finalisation of the Employer’s Requirements, drafting and agreement of the Contractor’s Proposals, and agreement of the price, Costain, PHJ and Tesco each conducted themselves in the manner which would have been appropriate had the contract eventually been concluded and had retrospective effect. The fact that each party so conducted itself in anticipation of the happening of that which did not in fact happen does not, in my judgment, lead to the conclusion that any of them is estopped from relying on the facts as they actually were and the legal conclusions which follow from those facts. It often happens in life that people make arrangements in anticipation of events. To hold that by so doing they are to be taken in law to be in the same position as if those events had occurred would be to elevate wishful thinking into a principle of the common law of England and Wales.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In the result it must follow, in my judgment, that the answer to Issue 3 is negative. It is not in law possible, as it seems to me, to establish an estoppel by convention that a contract which has not actually been made has been agreed to have been made. That is so for all of the reasons to which I have referred. Even if the conceptual difficulty which seems to me to exist could be overcome, the only purpose of seeking to establish a convention that a contract which has not in fact been made was made can be so as to be able to advance claims which depend upon such contract being treated as having been made, in other words to found a cause of action. The formulation of Issue 3 is in fact ambiguous as to whether the issue is whether Costain is estopped from denying that it had made a contract with Tesco at all, or whether the issue is whether, on the footing that there was in fact a contract, Costain is estopped from denying that that contract was on the terms of the Issue 7 Main Contract. It may be that in some circumstances it is possible to establish a convention, where parties have in fact entered into a contract, that some term actually agreed cannot be relied upon, although it might be more straightforward to analyse such a situation in terms of waiver or variation. However, what seems quite impossible is to establish a convention either that a contract which has not been made has been made or that terms not actually agreed should be treated as terms of a contract which has been made on different terms. In fact in the present case it seems that, because of the impact of the relevant provisions of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Limitation Act 1980</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, Tesco is not seeking to rely directly upon the contract which it contends was made between it and Costain in 1989, but rather to rely upon duties of care in tort which are said to mirror the duties said to have been assumed by Costain under the contract contended for. That circumstance does not seem to me to make the case any less one in which Tesco is seeking to establish a cause of action by estoppel.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> is not a shorthand, and rather imprecise, way of describing a particular type of contractual relationship, but a status to which legal incidents are attached.

Before coming to consider in detail the relevant authorities and applicable principles it is, perhaps, helpful to remind oneself of the essential features of this case from Costain’s point of view. The basis of the claim in tort against it is that it owed a duty of care to Tesco to exercise reasonable skill and care in the design and construction of the Store, in particular to include appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting measures in the structure. Costain’s main answer to that allegation is that it did not itself make the relevant design decisions in relation to fire stopping and inhibiting measures, PHJ did. Tesco’s counter to that answer is, in essence, that Costain assumed responsibility by contract for the adequacy of the design of the Store, and it therefore owed a duty of care in respect of the design which mirrored its contractual obligations. However that may be, and it is a point to which I shall return, the alleged deficiencies in design did not themselves cause any damage to anything. Rather they meant that damage in fact caused quite independently of Costain or any work it did, namely by the fire which broke out on 4 August 2001, was more extensive than it would have been, so it is contended, if appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting measures had been in place in the Store. In consequence not only was the Store itself damaged severely, but the contents of the Store, in the form of stock and plant and machinery, were damaged, as was an extension to the Store constructed in 1997. Moreover, Tesco lost profits, so it is said, as a result of the Store being unable to trade, or to trade to its normal capacity, for a period whilst it was being rebuilt. These features of the case give rise to a number of important questions of principle.</span>

Mr. Stewart accepted in his oral closing submissions that the existence of a duty of care of the nature and having the scope for which Tesco contended, namely a duty of care to provide as the Store a building fit for its intended use, depended upon Tesco establishing that Costain had accepted a contractual obligation to like effect.

The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of “culpa,” is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer’s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.</span>

The defendants there had in relation to the design been in contractual relations with the plaintiffs, but it was common ground that a claim in contract was time-barred. If the plaintiffs had happened to discover the defect before any damage had occurred there would seem to be no good reason for holding that they would not have had a cause of action in tort at that stage, without having to wait until some damage had occurred.

But if a manufacturer produces and sells a chattel which is merely defective in quality, even to the extent that it is valueless for the purpose for which it is intended, the manufacturer’s liability at common law arises only under and by reference to the terms of any contract to which he is a party in relation to the chattel; the common law does not impose on him any liability in tort to persons to whom he owes no duty in contract but who, having acquired the chattel, suffer economic loss because the chattel is defective in quality. If a dangerous defect in a chattel is discovered before it causes any personal injury or damage to property, because the danger is now known and the chattel cannot safely be used unless the defect is repaired, the defect becomes merely a defect in quality. The chattel is either capable of repair at economic cost or it is worthless and must be scrapped. In either case the loss sustained by the owner or hirer of the chattel is purely economic. It is recoverable against any party who owes the loser a relevant contractual duty. But it is not recoverable in tort in the absence of a special relationship of proximity imposing on the tortfeasor a duty of care to safeguard the plaintiff from economic loss. There is no special relationship between the manufacturer of a chattel and a remote owner or hirer.</span>

But if the defect becomes apparent before any injury or damage has been caused, the loss sustained by the building owner is purely economic. If the defect can be repaired at economic cost, that is the measure of the loss. If the building cannot be repaired, it may have to be abandoned as unfit for occupation and therefore valueless. These economic losses are recoverable if they flow from breach of a relevant contractual duty, but, here again, in the absence of a special relationship of proximity they are not recoverable in tort. The only qualification I would make to this is that, if a building stands so close to the boundary of the building owner’s land that after discovery of the dangerous defect it remains a potential source of injury to persons or property on neighbouring land or on the highway, the building owner ought, in principle, to be entitled to recover in tort from the negligent builder the cost of obviating the danger, whether by repair or by demolition, so far as that cost is necessarily incurred in order to protect himself from potential liability to third parties.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">, we can derive some understanding of the breadth of the principle underlying the case. We can see that it rests upon a relationship between the parties, which may be general or specific to the particular transaction, and which may or may not be contractual in nature. All of their Lordships spoke in terms of one party having assumed or undertaken a responsibility towards the other. On this point, Lord Devlin spoke in particularly clear terms in both passages from his speech which I have quoted above. Further, Lord Morris also spoke of that party being possessed of a “special skill” which he undertakes to “apply for the assistance of another who relies upon such skill”. But the facts of </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Hedley Byrne </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">itself, which was concerned with the liability of a banker to the recipient for negligence in the provision of a reference gratuitously supplied, show that the concept of a “special skill” must be understood broadly, certainly broadly enough to include special knowledge. Again, though </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Hedley Byrne </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">was concerned with the provision of information and advice, the example given by Lord Devlin of the relationship between solicitor and client, and his and Lord Morris’s statements of principle, show that the principle extends beyond the provision of information and advice to include the performance of other services. It follows, of course, that although, in the case of the provision of information and advice, reliance upon it by the other party will be necessary to establish a cause of action (because otherwise the negligence will have no causative effect), nevertheless there may be other circumstances in which there will be the necessary reliance to give rise to the application of the principle. In particular, as cases concerned with solicitor and client demonstrate, where the plaintiff entrusts the defendant with the conduct of his affairs, in general or in particular, he may be held to have relied on the defendant to exercise due skill and care in such conduct.</span>

In seeking to contain that category of persons within reasonable bounds, there has been some tendency on the part of the courts to criticise the concept of “assumption of responsibility” as being “unlikely to be a helpful or realistic test in most cases” (see </span>

Furthermore, especially in a context concerned with a liability which may arise under a contract or in a situation “equivalent to contract”, it must be expected that an objective test will be applied when asking the question whether, in a particular case, responsibility should be held to have been assumed by the defendant to the plaintiff: see </span>

The concept indicates too that in some circumstances, for example where the undertaking to furnish the relevant service is given on an informal occasion, there may be no assumption of responsibility; and likewise that an assumption of responsibility may be negatived by an appropriate disclaimer.

My own belief is that, in the present context, the common law is not antipathetic to concurrent liability, and that there is no sound basis for a rule which automatically restricts the claimant to either a tortious or a contractual remedy. The result may be untidy; but, given that the tortious duty is imposed by the general law, and the contractual duty is attributable to the will of the parties, I do not find it objectionable that the claimant may be entitled to take advantage of the remedy which is most advantageous to him, subject only to ascertaining whether the tortious duty is so inconsistent with the applicable contract that, in accordance with ordinary principle, the parties must be taken to have agreed that the tortious remedy is to be limited or excluded.</span>

It cannot therefore be inferred from the present case that other sub-agents will be held directly liable to the agent’s principal in tort. Let me take the analogy of the common case of an ordinary building contract, under which main contractors contract with the building owner for the construction of the relevant building, and the main contractor sub-contracts with sub-contractors or suppliers (often nominated by the building owner) for the performance of work or the supply of materials in accordance with standards and subject to terms established in the sub-contract. I put on one side cases in which the sub-contractor causes physical damage to property of the building owner, where the claim does not depend on an assumption of responsibility by the sub-contractor to the building owner; though the sub-contractor may be protected from liability by a contractual exemption clause authorised by the building owner. But if the sub-contracted work or materials do not in the result conform to the required standard, it will not ordinarily be open to the building owner to sue the sub-contractor or supplier direct under the </span>

In the case of an implied contractual duty, the nature and extent of the liability is defined by the term which the law implies. As in the case of any implied term, the process is one of construction of the agreement as a whole in its commercial setting. The contractual duty to provide a valuation and the known purpose of that valuation compel the conclusion that the contract includes a duty of care. The scope of the duty, in the sense of the consequences for which the valuer is responsible, is that which the law regards as best giving effect to the express obligations assumed by the valuer: neither cutting them down so that the lender obtains less than he was reasonably entitled to expect, nor extending them so as to impose on the valuer a liability greater than he could reasonably have thought he was undertaking.</span>

The doctor was asked for information on only one of the considerations which might affect the safety of the mountaineer on the expedition.

He is responsible only for the consequences of the information being wrong. A duty of care which imposes upon the informant responsibility for losses which would have occurred even if the information which he gave had been correct is not in my view fair and reasonable as between the parties.

The basis upon which it was contended that the highway authority was liable was that it had failed, negligently so it was said, to use its statutory powers to insist upon the removal of an earth bank which obstructed sight lines at the junction at which the accident occurred.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Donoghue v. Stevenson</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> [1932] AC 562 offers limited help … There are sound reasons why omissions require different treatment from positive conduct. It is one thing for the law to say that a person who undertakes some activity shall take reasonable care not to cause damage to others, it is another thing for the law to require that a person who is doing nothing in particular shall take steps to prevent another from suffering harm from the acts of third parties (like Mrs. Wise) or natural causes. One can put the matter in political moral or economic terms. In political terms it is less of an invasion of an individual’s freedom for the law to require him to consider the safety of others in his actions than to impose upon him a duty to rescue or protect. A moral version of this point may be called the “why pick on me?” argument. A duty to prevent harm to others or to render assistance to a person in danger or distress may apply to a large and indeterminate class of people who happen to be able to do something. Why should one be held liable rather than another? In economic terms, the efficient allocation of resources usually requires an activity should bear its own costs. If it benefits from being able to impose some of its costs on other people (what economists call “externalities”), the market is distorted because the activity appears cheaper than it really is. So liability to pay compensation for loss caused by negligent conduct acts as a deterrent against increasing the cost of the activity to the community and reduces externalities. But there is no similar justification for requiring a person who is not doing anything to spend money on behalf of someone else … Of course it is true that the conditions necessary to bring about an event always consists of a combination of acts and omissions. Mr. Stovin’s accident was caused by the fact that Mrs. Wise drove out into Station Road and omitted to keep a proper look out. But this does not mean that the distinction between acts and omissions is meaningless or illogical. One must have regard to the purpose of the distinction as it is used in the law of negligence, which is to distinguish between regulating the way in which an activity may be conducted and imposing a duty to act upon a person who is not carrying on any relevant activity. To hold the defendant liable for an act, rather than an omission, it is therefore necessary to be able to say, according to common sense principles of causation, that the damage was caused by something which the defendant did … Mr. Stovin’s injuries were not caused by negotiations between the Council and British Rail or anything else which the Council did. So far as the Council was held responsible, it was because it had done nothing to improve the visibility at the junction.</span>

That case was </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, to distinguish it from the other case with the same name to which I have already referred). The facts of the case were, in my judgment, important to an understanding of what actually was decided. The defendant building contractors had constructed a dairy building between 1981 and 1983 under a contract by which they undertook to construct the building in compliance with the relevant Building Regulations and, in particular, so that a particular wall (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“the Wall”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">) was constructed as a firebreak. The Wall was not in fact constructed as a firebreak in that it was not constructed sufficiently high. The building was subsequently sold to the appellants. A fire, which was not in any way the responsibility of the defendants, broke out in 1995. It spread across the Wall and caused damage on the other side from that upon which it had started. Had the Wall been constructed as a firebreak the fire would not have been able to spread to the far side of the Wall from that upon which it had commenced. On a trial of preliminary issues Bell J held that the defendants had owed a duty of care to the purchasers of the building to safeguard them from damage other than to the building itself, but that damages were not recoverable in respect of damage to that part of the building which lay on the far side of the Wall from the seat of the fire. The defendants appealed against the finding that they owed a duty of care to the purchasers of the building, while the purchasers appealed against the finding that damages were not recoverable in respect of damage to the building on the side of the Wall remote from the seat of the fire. Both appeals failed. The leading judgment was that of Schiemann LJ. On the question of the duty of care, at pages 100 and 101 of the report, he quoted the passage from the speech of Lord Hoffman in </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> that the existence of a duty of care positively to act, rather than simply to take care while engaged in some action, depends upon the existence of circumstances which in some way justify the imposition of such a duty. The focus of the attention of Lord Hoffman in the passage which I have quoted from his speech in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Stovin v. Wise</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> was whether it could be said, according to common sense principles of causation, that the omission complained of had caused the relevant damage. That was an approach which led in that case to the conclusion that the local authority had not owed a duty of care because nothing it had done had caused the accident in which the claimant sustained his injuries. However, it does not seem to me that Lord Hoffman could have been intending to suggest that the test of whether a duty of care was owed in respect of omissions was simply causation of the damage which eventuated in any particular case. If that were so, it would mean that there existed a general duty in law not to cause harm to others by act or omission from which an alleged wrongdoer would be excused if his default had not actually caused the damage in question. Such a general duty would represent a radical departure from the more traditional approach explained by Lord Hoffman himself in </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Stovin v. Wise</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> Lord Hoffman was seeking to do no more than to emphasise that in general a mere failure to act – a pure omission – cannot cause any loss. It is, of course, the case that traditionally a claim for damages for alleged negligence is pleaded by setting out all those things which it is contended that the defendant ought to have done, but did not do. In a sense, therefore, it can be said that all claims in negligence are based upon omissions. However, that is manifestly not the sense in which the term </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“omission”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> is used in the discussion of liability for omissions in the passages from the speeches of Lord Hoffman and Lord Goff now under consideration. In those passages the issue being addressed is in what circumstances it can be said that a person who has actually done nothing should have done something, which had it been done would have been to the advantage of the claimant and failure to do which deprived him of that advantage. Lord Goff in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd.</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> indicated that in circumstances in which a party had agreed by contract to do something the necessary ingredient for the creation of a duty of care in tort to act positively was present. That seems to me, with respect, not to be a particularly adventurous analysis, at least in relation to services which by his contract a party has undertaken personally to perform. It is difficult to see any circumstances other than where a party has specifically agreed to do something in which it would be appropriate to fix him with a duty to act positively, rather than simply to take care while doing something upon which he has decided to embark.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd. </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">was that a party to a contract owed to any other party to the contract who was affected a duty of care in tort in effect to perform his contractual obligations, whatever they were. Although Mr. Stewart did not in terms seek to rely upon it, the analysis of Lord Goff of the position under a chain of contracts in the construction industry might be considered, at first blush, as supporting his submission. It could be said that it was implicit in the consideration of a sub-contractor not owing a duty of care directly to the employer because of the chain of contractual arrangements which the parties had chosen, that the main contractor did owe not merely contractual, but also tortious duties to the employer in relation to the work of sub-contractors. However, that would be an extraordinary position, were it correct. A party to contract may assume a wide variety of obligations which do not require the doing of any act or the providing of any advice or information. He may give a guarantee of the performance by another of his obligations. He may warrant that a state of affairs is so. In relation to the performance of any obligation which does not require any act to be performed or any advice or information to be given the concept of negligence is not really meaningful. An obligation of such character is either performed or it is not. If it is not performed, there will be a cause of action for breach of contract. If it is proved that substantial, as opposed to nominal, damages have been suffered as a result of the breach of contract, they will be recoverable. Carelessness or not in the performance of the obligation just is not relevant to whether it has been performed. Moreover, by contract a party may accept liability to answer for the default of others who in fact are quite independent of him. In the context of liability for physical damage to person or property there is a well-understood principle that a person is not liable for the acts of his independent contractors. Mr. Stewart’s submission would seem to involve a negation of that principle in any case in which a party has by contract accepted obligations which are to be performed by sub-contractors. In my judgment it is clear that Lord Goff was not intending to lay down any proposition nearly as wide as that for which Mr. Stewart contended.</span>

Exceptionally, as on the particular facts of that case, but not usually, such a duty of care might be owed to a person higher up a chain of contracts than those immediately party to the relevant contract. The House of Lords was not concerned in that case to broaden the nature or scope of duties of care, so as to impose a duty of care upon a person in relation to something actually done by someone else, but simply to make plain that it was no answer to the suggestion that a party should be able to sue in negligence another party who had failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in doing something and had thereby caused the first party loss, to contend that the parties were in a contractual relationship and that their mutual rights and obligations should be determined exclusively under their contract.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd.</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> concerns economic loss. In that the only compensation which a court can award in respect of loss is money, all loss with which the court is concerned is economic. However, in the law of negligence the distinction between physical damage and economic loss, which is well-established in principle, even if its detailed application has not always been straightforward, has as its object the imposition of some limitation upon the scope of the consequences of his actions for which a negligent tortfeasor is held liable. It is in this area of the law that the concepts of the nature and scope of a duty of care (as to which see the extract from the speech of Lord Hoffman in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">South Australia Asset Management Corporation v. York Montague Ltd. </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">set out earlier in this judgment), causation (as to which see the extract from the speech of Lord Hoffman in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Stovin v. Wise </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">set out earlier in this judgment) and foreseeability shade into one another. However, the essential point in relation to the distinction between physical damage and economic loss is that physical damage is the immediate, and generally obvious, consequence of an act of negligence, while economic loss may not be. Thus if a duty of care is to be owed not to cause economic loss there needs to be some feature of the relationship between the parties which makes it fair, just and reasonable that the scope of the duty should extend to the avoidance of economic loss. That is most obviously so if the party alleged to owe a duty having that scope has consciously assumed obligations towards the party to whom the duty is said to be owed by entering into a contract with him in respect of those obligations. That point was made by Lord Goff in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">First, the skills of a designer and a builder create a product: the designer produces drawings, specifications etc; the builder produces the works, either in following through and completing the design of others for whom it is not responsible or in devising a design and completing it (as has always happened in very many cases – especially in those sectors where the Employer looks to the contractor for such a complete service – and as continues to be so today, since the trend towards design and build which began many years ago shows no signs of slackening.) Although a designer may decide what is to be done and, sometimes, how it is to be done, a builder has also to take decisions where the contract or the designer has left them to him. Matters of detailing and fixing call for the exercise of proper care and skill which must be provided to the standard expected of a builder holding himself out as competent to build the structure or work in question, which in the majority of cases will be no less than professional standards, and may indeed be higher where the work is specialised. Since many contractors have always been responsible for design as well as construction, there is in law an implied warranty of suitability for purpose (ie the core of every design obligation) as well of quality unless displaced by the terms of circumstances of the contract: </span>

For the purposes of liability in negligence in particular the relevant question is not who should be responsible but, rather, who took the relevant decision and thus failed to exercise the requisite care? Whoever took the decision is in law likely to owe some duty of care to avoid causing loss. In my judgment </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Murphy </span>

If any liability for such economic loss is to arise it must be for other reasons, eg as a result of advice or statements made upon which reliance is placed in circumstances which create a relationship where there is in law to be an assumption of the responsibility for loss – ie within the principle of </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Hedley Byrne v. Heller </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Murphy </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">which I have quoted above). In my judgment a designer is not liable in negligence to the client or to a subsequent purchaser for the cost of putting right a flaw in a design that the designer has produced that has not caused physical injury or damage, just as a contractor is not liable. Each is in the eyes of the law “a builder” as each is responsible for part of the process that leads to completion of a building or other works. Plainly the liability of such a builder in negligence cannot extend to becoming the equivalent of contractual liability for this would be the beginning of the “transmissible warranty” (see Lord Bridge’s speech) and would run counter to the policy that there is no liability in negligence for defects in the product, be it a building or a chattel. Because concurrent liability in tort cannot exceed the liability in contract it does not follow that in some way that concurrent liability must be elevated to the level of the contractual liability.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> was, first, that a contractor who assumed by contract obligations to construct the Wall as a firebreak and to comply with Building Regulations owed a duty of care in tort to do those things with reasonable skill and care not only to the other party to the contract, but also to subsequent purchasers. The second matter decided was that the scope of that duty of care in the case of subsequent purchasers did not extend to avoiding damage to the building constructed under the contract. The latter decision was simply application to the facts of the case of the decision of the House of Lords in </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Had I found that Costain had entered into a contract with Tesco in the terms for which Tesco contended I should still have found that the duty of care assumed by Costain was that which I have indicated in the previous paragraph. That is for a number of reasons. The first is that it is contrary to principle to impose upon a party a duty of care in respect of work which everyone knows is to be, and is in fact, undertaken by someone else. Such a duty of care cannot sensibly be characterised as a duty on the relevant party to do something with reasonable skill and care, for he is not doing anything. Rather it would be in the nature of a guarantee that the party actually doing the relevant work would do it with reasonable skill and care. The second is that the duty of care contended for in the present case was actually not simply a duty that design work would be undertaken with reasonable skill and care, but that the appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting works which should have been designed would then be constructed, and constructed without additional cost to Tesco. That goes far beyond any obligation to take care or to see that care is taken, involving, as it would, incurring expense in order to provide an amenity to Tesco. The law does, in limited circumstances, impose a duty upon a landowner to incur expense in order to deal with the consequences of a nuisance. However, the sort of obligation contended for arising under a duty of care in the present case is manifestly one that can, in my judgment, only arise under a contract. In considering the duty of care contended for in the present case it is also material, as it seems to me, to notice that the breach of it is not said itself to have caused any loss directly. No part of the Store collapsed as a result of the absence of appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting works, or anything like that. What is contended is that, had the appropriate works been undertaken, the consequences of a fire, for which neither Costain nor PHJ were in any sense responsible, would have been less severe. On analysis the nature and scope of the duty contended for were thus a duty not to cause Tesco the economic loss resulting from the fire. Shorn of its legal sheep’s clothing the duty contended for amounts to a duty to provide effective fire stopping and inhibiting works or to assume the risk of damage by fire to the Store and its contents. Even if, which I do not consider would be right, it were appropriate to impose upon Costain a duty of care to design and supply without additional cost to Tesco appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting works, it is well-arguable, it seems to me, that the scope of such duty was only to save Tesco from having to incur the cost of providing the relevant fire stopping and inhibiting measures. That would have been the obvious direct consequence of not designing and supplying the missing fire stopping and inhibiting works. To contemplate that the scope of the duty extended to saving Tesco harmless from the consequences of a fire the effects of which would or might have been less severe had the missing fire stopping and inhibiting works been present seems to me to raise precisely the same issue considered by the House of Lords in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">South Australia Asset Management Corporation v. York Montague Ltd.</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> and illustrated by Lord Hoffman’s example of the mountaineer and his knee. It would seem that the absence of fire stopping and inhibiting works in the present case no more caused the fire which destroyed the Store than the negligent assessment of the knee by the doctor in Lord Hoffman’s example caused the mountaineer’s accident. However, I have not had the benefit of full argument on this point and it is not actually material to any issue which I have to decide at this stage. It may be necessary to grapple with it in the second round of this action.</span>

While the duty of care owed by Costain in relation to the 1993/4 inspection and reports is modelled on more classical Hedley Byrne lines, the position on accrual remains the same as for the duty owed when designing and constructing the store. The question of when the cause of action accrues is a question of fact in each case. The normal position in a classic </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Hedley Byrne </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">case is that the cause of action will accrue when the negligent statement/advice is relied on. But this is not invariably the position. Thus, a mortgage lender who relies on a negligent survey report does not suffer damage (and hence its cause of action does not accrue) when it makes the advance in reliance on the negligent survey, but only when the value of the security and the borrower’s covenant taken together falls below that owed by the borrower: </span>

Similarly, in this case it would be strange if Tesco’s cause of action accrued when it relied on Costain’s reports. At that stage Tesco was no worse off than prior to the inspection and reports: it had a defective store that would suffer damage if (but only if) a fire began. If there was never a fire, then Tesco would not suffer damage for the purposes of setting time running. </span>

The chimney was built during June and July 1969. A material which was unsuitable was used in the construction of the chimney. No later than April 1970 cracks appeared at the top of the chimney. The damage to the chimney was not discovered until November 1977 and it was held that it could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered earlier than October 1972. The principal issue in the case in the House of Lords was whether, in the circumstances, a cause of action in negligence accrued when the cracks appeared in the chimney, when the existence of the cracks was discovered or when the existence of the cracks could, with reasonable diligence have been discovered.

The approach is consistent with the underlying principle that a cause of action accrues when, but not before, all the elements necessary to support the plaintiff’s claim are in existence.

Whether or not it is right to describe an undiscoverable crack as damage, it clearly cannot affect the value of the building on the market. The existence of such a crack is thus irrelevant to the cause of action. It follows that the judge applied the right test in law….</span>

After it was constructed in 1970 the church hall flooded on a number of occasions. In 1977 proceedings were commenced in which it was alleged that the causes of the flooding were the negligent design by the defendants of the drains serving the church hall and the omission from the design of a damp proof course. The defendants contended that the cause of action of the claimants had accrued when the church hall had been constructed and thus that it was statute-barred by the date of the commencement of the action. The trial judge rejected that contention and the defendants appealed. The leading judgment was that of Ralph Gibson LJ. At page 22 of the report he said:-</span>

They were capable of functioning properly as drains and they did so for some twenty months. When they failed effectively to function as drains because of heavy rainfall in the area they did not merely function unsatisfactorily, e.g. by making noises or emitting smells, but were the cause of physical damage to other parts of the building. The defect in design in this case was, in my judgment, as latent, and as distinct from subsequent physical damage caused by it, as was the negligent incorporation of unsuitable material in Pirelli’s chimney.</span>

The defendant solicitors acted for her in relation to the execution of the legal charge and did not advise her as to risks which she was assuming by entering into the charge. A demand was made under the charge in January 1975 and the lady repaid the loan. In January 1977 proceedings were commenced on behalf of the lady against the solicitors, but those proceedings were not pursued with diligence and in February 1980 an application was made on behalf of the solicitors that the action be dismissed for want of prosecution. In March 1980, in anticipation of the hearing of that application a further writ was issued on behalf of the claimant. The main question in the Court of Appeal was whether the action commenced by the second writ was statute-barred at the date it was issued. The leading judgment was that of Stephenson LJ. At page 98D he indicated that he accepted the submissions of Mr. Murray Stuart-Smith QC, as he then was, on the issue.

These are all illustrations of a kind of loss which is meant by “actual” damage. It was also suggested in argument, and I would accept it, that “actual” is really used in contrast to “presumed” or “assumed”.

The valuer is liable for the adverse consequences, flowing from entering into the transaction, which are attributable to the deficiency in the valuation. The principle of liability, easier to formulate than to apply, has next to be translated into practical terms. As to this, the basic comparison remains in point, as the means of identifying whether the lender has suffered any loss in consequence of entering into the transaction. If he has not, then currently he has no cause of action against the valuer. The deficiency in security has, in practice, caused him no damage. However, if the basic comparison throws up a loss, then it is necessary to inquire further and see what part of the loss is the consequence of the deficiency in the security….</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Indeed, for the cause of action to arise only when the lender realises his security would be a highly unattractive proposition. It would mean that, however obvious it may be that the lender will not recover his money, he cannot start proceedings. He must wait until he manages to sell the property, a process which may be protracted. This would be a surprising stance for the law to take. It would be all the more surprising when one has in mind that a lender’s cause of action against his negligent valuer for breach of contract, as distinct from a claim in tort, arises when the negligent valuation is given. If disaster were evident and the lender were to sue his valuer for breach of contract without waiting until he had realised his security, it is inconceivable that the court would award only nominal damages.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">As I have already remarked, the present is not a case in which it is said that the Store as constructed by Costain was defective in the sense that it contained some component which was destined to fail at some point or would not serve its intended purpose. The whole focus of the complaint in relation to initial design and construction is simply that the Store did not incorporate fire stopping and inhibiting measures which it ought to have done. By reason of the lack of those qualities the Store was exposed to the risk that, if a fire did occur, the extent of the damage which that fire caused would be greater than if the relevant fire stopping and inhibiting measures had been incorporated into the structure. Although Mr. Stewart did not accept the point and so whether it is right or not will have to be determined in the second round of this litigation, it would seem likely that, so far as initial design and construction were concerned, the Store was less valuable as a supermarket at completion than it would have been with better fire protection. If that were so, the nature of the loss which Tesco sustained in relation to any breach on the part of Costain of any duty of care which it owed in relation to the initial design or construction of the Store would plainly be economic. Because the nature of the alleged deficiency in the Store was not some feature such as the use of the unsuitable materials in the </span>

The answer to Issue 11 is quite simply that, on the assumption that the Store was at such date less valuable than it would have been had it had the fire stopping and inhibiting measures incorporated in it which it is contended it should have had, any cause of action in tort arose no later than the date of practical completion of the Store. If that factual hypothesis proves unsound once the relevant evidence is heard, the cause of action would have accrued at such later date as evidence establishes as a date at which Tesco sustained economic loss in respect of the Store by reason of its lack of the relevant fire stopping and inhibiting measures. For example, if Tesco would have had to have paid extra for the appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting measures to be carried out as part of the original construction of the Store, the cause of action would have accrued at the date at which the cost of the necessary works increased above what it would have been had the work been done by Costain.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The whole purpose of the inspection of the Store which Tesco wanted carried out in the autumn of 1993 was so that it could be reassured that adequate fire protection measures were in place in the Store or it could take steps to have appropriate measures provided. In writing to Tesco the letters dated, respectively, 19 October 1993 and 27 May 1994 Costain was representing to Tesco that it had investigated the position at the Store in relation to the presence of appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting works and that what should have been there was there. In my judgment, by making such representations Costain assumed a duty of care to Tesco the scope of which extended to compensating Tesco for the consequences of the fire stopping and inhibiting measures which should have been there being absent. I emphasise that I do not at this stage make any finding as to what fire stopping and inhibiting measures should have been present. That is a matter to be determined in the second round of this action. However, it does seem to me obvious that Costain knew that Tesco would be likely to rely, and intended Tesco to rely, upon the terms of its reports in deciding what, if any, steps needed to be taken to provide fire protection at the Store. Whether Tesco did actually rely upon the terms of the reports is again a matter for the second round of the action. All I am indicating at present is that in my judgment the scope of the duty of care which Costain assumed in writing the letters dated 19 October 1993 and 27 May 1994 was one which extended to compensating Tesco for the consequences of any fire which occurred at the Store which consequences would have been avoided if the terms of the reports had been accurate, on the assumptions that they were not in fact accurate and that reasonable care was not taken in making them.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">While, as I have indicated, it seems to me that the duty of care which Costain assumed by writing the letters dated 19 October 1993 and 27 May 1994 extended to liability for the consequences of any fire which consequences would not have been suffered had the terms of the reports in the letters been accurate, that is not the only liability which Costain would have incurred as a result of a breach of its duty of care in relation to either letter. Adopting the basic comparison analysis explained by Lord Nicholls in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Nykredit Mortgage Bank Plc v. Edward Erdman Group Ltd.</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, on the assumption that Tesco relied on the two letters, what it did in reliance upon them in the first instance was not cause fire protection works to be undertaken at the Store in 1993 or 1994. If, contrary to the findings which I have already indicated, Costain owed a duty of care to Tesco to undertake the provision of the necessary works without cost to Tesco, Tesco would probably have been put to some trouble and expense in chasing Costain to carry out the necessary works and to some disruption to its trading activities at the Store, and cost, while the works were carried out, assuming that Costain was in fact prepared to undertake the works in question. If Costain was not obliged to carry out the appropriate works without cost to Tesco, as I have found, Tesco would have had to fund the cost of the works itself. That would also have been the case, at least in the first instance, if Costain was in fact obliged to carry out the works, but declined to do so. The probability is that, in whichever way Tesco was going to sustain expense, the amount of that expense would at some point have been greater as a result of the passing of time and general inflation, than it would have been if incurred in 1993, following receipt of a non-negligent report in a letter of about 19 October 1993, or 1994, following receipt of a non-negligent report in a letter of about 27 May 1994. Whether there would in fact have been such an increase in cost, and, if so, when it would have occurred, are matters to be decided in the second round of this action. However, in principle, if there would have been such increase in cost the date at which it occurred is the date at which a cause of action would have accrued in respect of the letter of 19 October 1993 or the letter of 27 May 1994, as the case may be. That is the answer to Issues 12 and 13.</span>

That seems to me to have been a belated recognition of the plain fact that the claims against the Other Costain Company were unsustainable as a matter of law. It seems to me to be elementary that the rights of a third party, such as Tesco, against Costain could not in law be prejudiced by the terms of the Costain Agreement, to which it was not a party, and that, equally, it could obtain no rights under that agreement.</span>

There was abundant evidence to justify these findings. Many of the facts disclosed by this evidence were not known to Finers at the time, and evidence of them, while possibly relevant on questions of causation, was irrelevant in relation to the scope of Finers’ duty. This did not turn on the extent to which Virgin in fact expected to rely on Finers for advice on VAT, but on the extent to which they appeared to Finers to need such advice.

The principal, perhaps the only, significance of the question whether the PHJ Agreement had been executed under seal is the limitation period applicable to claims for damages for breach of it. The only sensible construction of clause 9.1 of the PHJ Agreement thus seems to me to be that by it the parties agreed that neither would rely as against the other upon a limitation defence unless and until a period of twelve years had elapsed from the date of any alleged breach of the agreement.

In my judgment that is a realistic assessment. As I have rehearsed at some length in my consideration of Issue 11 the relevant authorities and the principles to be derived from them it is enough to say that I hold that scope of the duty of care assumed by PHJ to perform, with the care and skill to be expected of a reasonably competent architect, the work of design and inspection which it agreed under the PHJ Agreement to carry out did include not causing economic loss. When any economic loss was incurred by Tesco would fall to be established in the same manner as would be necessary for the purposes of Issue 11.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">For the reasons which I have already set out, it seems to me that it is arguable that the scope of the duty of care owed by PHJ did not extend to bearing the consequences of the absence of fire stopping and inhibiting measures in the event of fire, but was limited to the loss, if any, occasioned to Tesco as a result of the Store being less valuable when completed than it would have been if PHJ had performed its duty of care, or to the additional cost of providing the appropriate measures, if Tesco would have had to have paid extra for them if they had been provided in 1989 or 1990 as part of the original construction of the Store. It was not up to PHJ itself to provide appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting measures, in the sense of installing them or paying for others to instal them, so that PHJ’s duty could have been no greater than to have included the necessary design details in its drawings or specifications and then to have taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the Store had been constructed in accordance with its designs. Had it performed its duty in respect of design, assuming for present purposes that it did not, Tesco would have known what fire stopping and inhibiting measures were appropriate, but it may have had to pay for them to be provided. If they were included within the price which Tesco had to pay anyway, Tesco’s loss as a result of them being omitted was the amount by which the Store was worth less, when completed, than it would have been with appropriate fire stopping and inhibiting measures having been provided. If they were not included within the price, Tesco sustained loss at the point at which the cost of providing them exceeded the cost had they been provided at the time of construction of the Store. </span>

In what circumstances will an architect be in breach of that duty? I find it convenient to consider an example. Let us suppose that an architect is engaged on the standard RIBA Conditions of Engagement to provide the full service (as PTE in the present case), including administering a building contract in a standard JCT form of contract. Suppose that he designs the foundations of a building (a large office block), the foundations are constructed in accordance with his design, and several years later, practical completion is achieved. Let us further suppose that the design of the foundations is defective and one which no reasonably competent architect would have produced: in other words, the architect was negligent. There can be no doubt that the architect commits a breach of contract when he completes the design and gives instructions to the contractor to construct the foundations in accordance with it. But in what sense and to what extent is the architect under a duty to review his negligent design once the foundations have been designed and constructed?</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">16. In my view, in the absence of an express term or express instructions, he is not under a duty specifically to review the design of the foundations, unless something occurs to make it necessary, or at least prudent, for a reasonably competent architect to do so. For example, a specific duty might arise if, before completion, the inadequacy of the foundations causes the building to show signs of distress; or if the architect reads an article which shows that the materials that he has specified for the foundations are not fit for their purpose; or if he learns from some other source that the design is dangerous. In such circumstances, I am in no doubt that the architect would be under a duty to review the design, and, if necessary, issue variation instructions to the contractor to remedy the problem. But in the absence of some reason such as this, I do not think that an architect who has designed and supervised the construction of foundations is thereafter under an obligation to review his design.</span>

The position is quite different where the architect (or solicitor) knows, or ought to know, of his earlier negligence. When that occurs, then he may well be under a contractual obligation to review his earlier performance, and advise his client honestly and competently of his opinion. Whether he is in fact under such a duty when he has actual or constructive knowledge of his earlier breach of contract will depend on whether the contract is still being performed. If the contract has been discharged (for whatever reason), then the professional person may be under a duty in tort to advise his client of his earlier breach of contract, but it is difficult to see how he can be under any contractual duty to do so.</span>

I consider him to be a man of the highest integrity, and, moreover, as I have said, a careful and cautious man. He would have had no reason to write as he did unless he considered that he had good grounds for what he wrote. He personally was totally unaffected whether or not an inspection had been carried out, and whatever it was that an inspection revealed. It is obvious from the evidence put before me that material in relation to the inspection of other Tesco stores in the Midlands which resulted in letters being written by Costain which were logged by Tesco as having been received, but now cannot be found, that relevant documentation has gone missing.  I accept the evidence of Mr. Gibson-Leitch that he delegated the task of inspection to someone – to whom, it is no longer possible to say – who seemed to him competent to undertake an inspection of the fire stopping and inhibiting works at the Store, and that that person subsequently reported to Mr. Gibson-Leitch in terms which persuaded him that a proper inspection had been carried out and that the appropriate works had been properly carried out in the first place.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It was, as it turned out, not in dispute that Mr. Truman had left the employment of PHJ at the beginning of 1993 before the question of an inspection of the Store had arisen. That meant, as it seems to me, first, that Mr. Truman could not have been the person who made a joint inspection, if joint inspection there was, of the Store with a representative of Costain. Second, it meant that Mr. O’Connor’s note upon which Mr. Taverner relied either recorded accurately inaccurate information as to Mr. Truman provided by Mr. Heckels or recorded inaccurately what Mr. Heckels said. I have already recorded that both Mr. Heckels and Mr. O’Connor were called to give evidence, but neither had any recollection of their conversation independent of the note made by Mr. O’Connor. In my judgment the possibility of misunderstanding at the time of the conversation was increased by the fact that neither Mr. Heckels nor Mr. O’Connor had any involvement with the Store apart from this conversation and, in the case of Mr. Heckels, being the PHJ person who was asked to provide the relevant fire precautions drawings to Costain. Mr. Gibson-Leitch in his evidence spoke of Mr. O’Connor’s note being inaccurate insofar as it suggested that Mr. Gibson-Leitch personally had carried out surveys of Tesco stores. A further mystery concerning the notes made by Mr. O’Connor was that they referred to Costain, according to Mr. Gibson-Leitch, having no record of having reported to Tesco following the inspection of the Store, when in fact Mr. Gibson-Leitch had done so in his letter dated 19 October 1993. As I have already indicated, it seems to me that it would not be safe to draw any inference from the terms of Mr. O’Connor’s notes. For whatever reason they were not accurate in a number of respects.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr. Coulson also drew attention to the fact that, if Costain had wanted PHJ to inspect the Store jointly with it, the logical point at which to make such request would have been in Mr. Burley’s letter dated 9 September 1993. That is a fair point. Moreover, in none of the subsequent written communications between Costain and PHJ was there any reference to any joint inspection. Mr. Gibson-Leitch’s letter dated 19 October 1993 was copied to PHJ, but that referred only to what </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“we”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, meaning in the context Costain, had taken it upon itself to do. There was no suggestion in the letter that the inspection had been made jointly with PHJ. While what prompted Mr. Dainty of Tesco to write his letter to PHJ dated 28 April 1994 was obscure, the responses to it did indicate a number of things relevant to the question whether PHJ had made a joint inspection with Costain in the previous autumn. If there had been a joint inspection one would have expected that that would have been recollected then by relevant personnel on both sides, specifically Mr. Gibson-Leitch on the Costain side and Mr. Welch on the PHJ side. One might have expected the fact of a joint inspection to have been mentioned in correspondence to Tesco, given that by his letter dated 28 April 1994 Mr. Dainty was specifically asking for PHJ to undertake an inspection. However, in his letter dated 27 May 1994 to Tesco Mr. Gibson-Leitch spoke only of what </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“we”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, that is Costain, could confirm. Mr. Welch in his letter to Tesco dated 3 June 1994 in terms referred to the inspection as having been carried out by Costain. He made that point in his letter to Mr. Gibson-Leitch dated 3 June 1994. While it is always possible that a response from Costain challenging that assertion has gone missing, given the terms of Mr. Gibson-Leitch’s letters to which I have referred, that seems unlikely.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The exposition of Costain’s case which I have quoted in the preceding paragraph demonstrated, as it seemed to me, the fallacies in it. To the extent to which it depended upon a finding that PHJ had inspected the Store jointly with Costain in the autumn of 1993, it failed because I have not made the requisite finding. In the absence of such a finding it seems to me that the case is all but unarguable. It is, with the greatest respect to Mr. Taverner and Mr. Hargreaves, verging on the absurd to suggest that by supplying, in response to a request, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“all drawings relevant to fire protection/prevention works at the Redditch store”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> PHJ was making any statement as to whether they did, or did not, indicate compliance with relevant statutory regulations. The request was a request to be supplied the drawings in fact prepared and used for construction, and the supply of drawings in response to such a request involved no more than an implicit statement that the drawings sent were the correct drawings. What PHJ had no reason to suppose, at the time it supplied the drawings requested, was that Costain would be so stupid as to represent to Tesco that the works shown on the drawings, if carried out properly, were such as complied </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">“with the requirements of the design and statutory regulations prevailing at the time of construction”</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, unless it was competent to do so. Yet, unless it is contended that PHJ should have envisaged that possibility, the alleged duty of PHJ is ridiculous. In his final closing submissions Mr. Taverner told me that it will be Costain’s case in the second round of the trial that, upon proper construction, Costain’s letters dated 19 October 1993 and 27 May 1994 meant no more than that Costain had made such inspection as could reasonably be expected of a contractor. I say nothing about that submission at this stage, save that it is not obviously easy to reconcile with the submission currently under consideration.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In the light of the answers which I have given to the preliminary issues it would seem that, subject to establishing that Costain was in breach of the duty of care which it was agreed it owed to Tesco in respect of its inspection of the Store in the autumn of 1993 and the reports contained in Mr. Gibson-Leitch’s letters dated, respectively, 19 October 1993 and 27 May 1994, and subject to whatever benefit from reliance upon the provisions of </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">32</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> Tesco may yet derive, Costain will be liable to Tesco only if the cost to Tesco of causing to have carried out whatever works it would have caused to be carried out if it had known of deficiencies in the fire stopping and inhibiting works at the Store in 1993/1994 would not have increased between then and 9 January 1996, the date six years before the commencement of Action 07. That, of course, assumes that, if there were any earlier breach of a duty of care, a cause of action in respect of it accrued some time round about 1990 and that no reliance could successfully be placed upon the provisions of </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">So far as PHJ is concerned, whether it has any liability to Tesco for breach of the PHJ Agreement would seem to depend upon proof of some deficiency in its work of design completed after 9 January 1990, or proof of some failure after that date to react appropriately to some trigger which ought to have prompted it to review its design, or proof of some failure to carry out a competent inspection after that date. Whether PHJ has any liability in tort to Tesco would seem to depend upon proof of a breach of a duty of care, the proper scope of that duty in relation to the type of losses to which it extended, and the benefit, if any, which Tesco can derive from the terms of </span>
