	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">2. Snamprogetti undertook with Phillips to provide engineering services, including specification of equipment, for the introduction of offshore compression facilities for gas from wells known as Upper Bunter wells. Those facilities were to be installed on an existing platform in the North Sea known as platform 52/5A. The contract in question is dated 6</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 1994 and is known as contract UK 0601. The claim is for damages for breach of that contract, plus a small sum said to be due under it. As originally pleaded, the claim for damages was quantified at £5,394,747. By an amendment made shortly before the start of the hearing, the claim was particularized at £3,405,702.58.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">3. Phillips shared the expenses of and revenue from the production and sale of gas from the Hewett field with six other companies owning rights to the gas in the field. Those companies have been called the co-venturers. Phillips had (by a small margin) the largest share in the co-venture. Under an agreement with them entitled the Unit Operating Agreement Phillips was designated as Unit Operator. The Unit Operator was required under that agreement to pay all unit expenses and was entitled to reimbursement from each co-venturer in proportion to its participation in the co-venture. For the incurring of large expenses, Phillips required the specific authority of the co-venturers.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">4. The purpose of the new compression facilities on platform 52/5A was to extract gas from the Upper Bunter wells at a greater rate than would otherwise be possible, in order to meet maximum demands for gas in some of the winter months. Platform 52/5A also received gas from wells known as Zechstein wells. Those wells contained gas at a high pressure, enabling it to flow at sufficient rates without further compression on that platform. The Upper Bunter gas was described as sour gas (in contradistinction to sweet gas) because it contained traces of hydrogen sulphide.</span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">5. There was a 24-inch diameter undersea pipeline, known as the sea line or the H line, from 52/5A to another platform, 48/29, known as the field terminal platform. Lines from other wells in the Hewett field converged at that platform. A compressor known as the alpha compressor was situated on the field terminal platform. The compression facilities on the field terminal platform had been designed by Snamprogetti. There were two 30-inch lines, the A line and the B line, from the field terminal platform to an onshore terminal at Bacton, in Norfolk. The A line was reserved for sweet gas, i.e gas containing no sour gas. The gas from the A and B lines was commingled at Bacton. At Bacton the gas was compressed to a pressure of some 1000 pounds per square inch (psi) for delivery to British Gas. Snamprogetti was also carrying out work in relation to the facilities at Bacton. There was at one time a proposal, not implemented, for ‘offshore commingling’. That proposal was to allow the A line also to be used for gas containing sour gas.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">6. The following is an outline of the works that the compression project involved. The Upper Bunter gas was compressed by a centrifugal compressor, which I call the main compressor. The main compressor was driven by a gas turbine co-axial with it. The fuel for the gas turbine was Zechstein gas. Before being fed to the gas turbine, that fuel was compressed by a reciprocating compressor. I call that compressor the fuel gas compressor. The main compressor and turbine and associated pipework were assembled on a skid offshore. The fuel gas compressor and its associated pipework were assembled offshore on another skid. The skids were then fitted to the 52/5A platform, the fuel gas compressor skid being borne by the main compressor skid. Other pipework, connections, gauges and so on were fitted on the platform. The offshore work was carried out by a contractor, AMEC Process and Energy Limited (“AMEC”).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">7. During the course of commissioning, in April 1996, the works were stopped by Phillips. At the end of May 1996 a hazard and operability review (“HAZOP”) was carried out. Such a review is a normal part of the procedure to verify the safety and integrity of a process design. Snamprogetti had carried out two such reviews in the course of the detailed design of the 52/5A compression facilities. But this one was ordered specially by Phillips. It was conducted under an independent chairman by Baker Jardine and Associates Limited. Representatives of Phillips and of Snamprogetti attended. It made a number of recommendations concerning the compression facilities. Following the Baker Jardine HAZOP Phillips decided to carry out extensive works on the compression facilities. Phillips required, and obtained, authorization from the co-venturers for the necessary expenditure. Those works were carried out by a contractor known as KYE Limited (“KYE”).  With the object of ensuring that those facilities would be in commission by the end of October 1996, Phillips decided to use a support vessel, Seafox by name, to enable the work to proceed as quickly as possible. A substantial part of the damages claim is for the costs of hiring Seafox. </span>

In my judgment, all the services undertaken by Snam, or at any rate those relevant to the issues in this case, can reasonably be described as professional services. That is, I think, recognized by clause 3.6 of the contract. I do not read clause 3.5 as implying that there necessarily exist second class contractors that perform work of a nature similar to that undertaken by Snamprogetti. Rather, it recognizes what may be described as the high class nature of the work undertaken. Nevertheless, whilst not requiring the services of a paragon, combining the qualities of polymath and prophet, the contract did, in my judgment, require something more than ordinary competence on the part of Snamprogetti.

In the event of failure on the part of the co-venturers to supply agreed quantities of gas to British Gas, British Gas was entitled to impose a penalty on them. In order to avoid the risk of a shortfall in the supply of gas to British Gas, Mr. King decided that the remedial work should be completed, and the facilities on 52/5A made ready to produce the full capacity, by the end of October 1996. He gave evidence that it was probably between the middle and the end of June 1996 that he made that decision. I accept that evidence. In consequence of that decision, he decided that it was necessary to use Seafox in order to expedite the remedial works. It is in issue whether it was necessary to complete the remedial works by the end of October 1996. I adopt the expression remedial works without assuming liability on the part of Snamprogetti.</p>

He submitted that the documents were important, but they had limitations: the court must decide the case on all the evidence, including the documents. So far, I accept his submission. The weight to be attached to documentary evidence must depend not only on its inherent probability but also on the other evidence in the case. Mr. McMaster further submitted that the fact that a statement appeared in a document was not, without more, proof of its truth. There was no application to admit hearsay evidence without notice. Many witnesses had been called to speak to the facts in the documents. It was the evidence of those witnesses that the court must assess using the contents of the documents as appropriate. I do not accept the full extent of Mr. McMaster’s submission. It is true that the parties’ agreement of the documents is simply agreement as to their authenticity. But at least since the passing of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 the civil courts have regularly admitted documents in evidence without consideration of the rules about hearsay (see Phipson on Evidence, 15</span>

Indeed, Mr. McMaster, like Miss Boswell, has relied on the documents. In those circumstances, I treat the fact that a statement is made in a document that is before the court as evidence of the truth of that statement. It is not, of course, “proof” of the truth of the statement if by “proof” Mr. McMaster meant conclusive evidence. Nor is the court bound to accept the evidence in the document.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">19. In spite of the statement in the letter that the histogram showed an estimate for production, it is clear from the other terms of the letter that the histogram was an estimate of production capacity, possibly net of usage as fuel gas by the producer. That conclusion is supported by the wording on the histogram and by the assumptions set out in attachment 2 to the letter. Using the histogram, Mr. King estimated that without the main compressor on 52/5A there would be a total under-delivery of 0.8 billion standard cubic feet of gas in the period November 1996 to April 1997, almost all of which would occur in November and December 1996. I am satisfied that if Mr. King had correctly interpreted the histogram, his estimate was a reasonable one. He calculated that that under-delivery would involve a penalty, the effect of which would be that the co-venturers would suffer a net reduction in revenue of £4 million. That sum he apportioned as to £3 million to 1996 and as to £1 million to 1997. The amount of the putative reduction in revenue and its apportionment are not in issue. For the purpose of calculating the net benefit of avoidance of the penalty by the avoidance of one year’s delay in the completion of the compression facilities on 52/5A, Mr. King used an estimate dated 4</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 1996 which he had obtained as an estimate of the cost necessary to complete the compression works for 52/5A. That estimate was in the sum of £4.3 million. For the “one year delay” case, Mr. King apportioned that £4.3 million as to £2 million in 1996, and £2.3 million in 1997. (The actual calculations appear to use £1.9 million and £2.4 million, but there are rounding errors, which I shall ignore). For completion of the work by the end of October 1996 (the “base case”), on the other hand, the whole £4.3 would be spent in 1996. On that basis, he instructed a Mr. Heberlet, an economist employed by Phillips, to run a one year delay case in order to show the benefit of avoidance of the penalty by avoidance of the one year’s delay. Mr. Heberlet calculated the post-tax net present value of the one year delay case as £3.8 million, using a discount rate of 10 per cent. a year. The base case had a corresponding net present value of £5.9 million. Thus the effect of Mr. Heberlet’s calculation was to show a net present value of £2.1 million as the benefit of avoiding the delay. The corresponding figure using a zero rate of interest was £2.4 million.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">20. The estimate of costs amounting to £4.3 million included not only remedial works but also outstanding works and an item of £1 million described as original overspend. It was based on the use of Seafox. If and in so far as the use of Seafox increased the cost of carrying out the works, the estimate of £2.1 million was an over-estimate, since Seafox was not needed on the one year delay case. Mr. King expressed the view in evidence that the use of Seafox did not add to the expense. It is said that the use of Seafox increased the costs by about £1 million. I have carried out a rough and ready calculation, which is the best I can do, of the net present value of avoiding the delay on the assumption that the use of Seafox increased the costs by £1 million. As I have said, on the calculation sheet of the one year delay case the cost of £4.3 million had been apportioned as to £1.9 million in 1996 and as to £2.4 million in 1997. I have apportioned £3.3 million, in the place of £4.3 million, in the same proportions, retaining in addition a figure of £1.2 million as capital expenditure for 1996 which is common to both the base case and the one year delay case. The pre-tax net present value of the one year delay case at the discount rate of 10 per cent. I calculate as £9.36 million (compared with Mr. Heberlet’s figure of £8.6 million). It is not possible for me to calculate the tax, but it seems that allowing for the discount the rate must average about 54 per cent., leaving a post-tax net present value of £4.3 million. On that basis, the net present value of the benefit of avoiding the penalty would be £1.6 million. I should add that net “present” value actually means value at July 1994.</span>

I am unable to say whether the co-venturers would necessarily have agreed to completion of the works by the end of October 1996 if the net present value of avoiding the penalty had been £1.6 million. But I am by no means satisfied that if Mr. King had correctly interpreted the histogram his decision to recommend completion of the works by that date or the decision of the co-venturers to accept that recommendation was unreasonable. Whether Mr. King had correctly interpreted the histogram is a question to which I now turn.</span>

Miss Boswell submitted that the 52/5A compression facilities were not intended to add to production or sales of gas until the fourth quarter of the calendar year 1997. That information was to be derived from a document entitled Hewett Gas Sales Forecast and dated 4</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 1996. Although that information was available to Phillips, it was not disclosed to the co-venturers at the material time. The document showed projected sales of gas with and without the 52/5A compressor for the calendar years 1996 to 2005 and, for each of those years, the difference (described as incremental annual gas sales) between the former and the latter. The incremental sales for 1996 were shown as nil. Miss Boswell submitted that the likely reason for the nil figure was that at low suction pressures the Upper Bunter wells were found to produce sand with the gas. Thus the whole of the theoretical increase in production from drawing down the Upper Bunter wells using the 52/5A compressor could not be obtained. But equivalent production could be obtained by directing the 52/5A gas through the alpha compressor, thereby using the alpha compressor to pull down both the Upper Bunter and Zechstein wells to a suction pressure that did not cause sand production. The document did indeed state that the figures for sales without the 52/5A compressor were based on the assumption that gas from 52/5A would go into the alpha compressor.</span>

The copy document on which Mr. King was first cross-examined did not show its date, since part of the original had, in the course of business, been covered by a yellow sticker which happened to cover the date. He said that the document was probably provided to him during the first week of July 1996. Mr. King accepted that at the time the document was prepared it showed that there was to be no production using the 52/5A compressor in 1996. He said he did not know when it was prepared, but it certainly did not reflect Phillips’s intent at the time that he provided it to Phillips’s economists. He said that from the time of his involvement in the project [that is, early January 1996] it was expected that the compressor would operate from the start of the 1996 winter. The sticker in question contained a message in Mr. King’s hand to John Gerd, who ran the Phillips economic group at Woking. It said “Herewith latest profiles…” It was put to Mr. King that it would appear that the document must be dated around the period in July when he had prepared the cost estimate [which was dated 4</span>

The histogram showed the contribution assumed to be provided by the 52/5A compression (some 35 million scuffs of gas per day at the end of October 1996, diminishing to some 25 million scuffs per day at the end of April 1997). She asked him on what pressures that histogram had been based. Mr. King said that he could not answer the question. He thought it would be better answered by the person or group that developed the histogram, namely the Phillips reservoir engineering group. He believed it was David White who had constructed the document, and he, Mr. King, had had the benefit of some discussions with him. (Day 24, pp.119, 112; Day 29, p.75). Neither Mr. White nor anyone else from the group was called as a witness. No documents were disclosed throwing any light on the production of the histogram. No documents were produced contradicting the figures in the Hewett gas sales forecast.</span>

Further documents from the reservoir group, also disclosed only during the course of the hearing, were production profiles for the Hewett Field dated 22nd November 1995. They showed substantial annual sales of Upper Bunter gas without compression facilities starting in the year 1996 and continuing to 1998, tailing off in 1999 and 2000 to zero in 2001 and thereafter. Figures for Upper Bunter with compression facilities were also shown. They showed zero for 1996, and sales building up from a small start in 1997 to a peak in 2003 and falling off thereafter. The sales from Upper Bunter with compression facilities started to exceed the sales from Upper Bunter without compression facilities in 1999. Those figures support the proposition that it was not intended to use the Upper Bunter compression facilities until 1997.</span>

Each of those three pages shows quarterly gas sales and annual gas sales by calendar year, among other information. The gas sales shown in the document headed Case Sens7-8 are, for each quarter and each calendar year, simply those shown in Case Sensitive 7 minus those shown in Case Sensitive 8 for the corresponding quarter or year, as the case may be. The figures on Case Sensitive 7-8 from the third quarter of 1996 to the third quarter of 1997 inclusive are all zero. That is not so for the preceding three quarters, going back to the fourth quarter of 1995. But neither party relies on the figures for those quarters in Case Sensitive 7 or in Case Sensitive 8. Mr. McMaster said that the first three quarterly figures were an apparent nonsense: there was probably a reason for them, but he could not identify it. The annual gas sales figures on the fourth page, which is the page to a copy of which Mr. King’s note to Mr. Gerd was stuck, were the same as the respective figures on the Case Sensitive 7, Case Sensitive 8 and Case Sensitive 7-8 pages, save that for the calendar year 1996 the figure for Case Sensitive 8 was adopted for both the Case Sensitive 7 and the Case Sensitive 8 columns, so that the incremental sales for 1996 were shown as zero.</span>

He did not recall receiving the document, but he agreed that it appeared to show that what was being considered was a flow configuration in which the Upper Bunter wells from 52/5A came in only at the highest nominations (periods of highest demand from British Gas), though it might continue to be run in that way if nominations were reduced, and that in so far as there was compression, the compression was through the Alpha compressor.

Thus all the documents disclosed from the files of the reservoir department proceed on the basis that there was perceived to be no advantage in using the 52/5A compressor in 1996. Mr. McMaster put forward a speculative argument that the calculation of incremental annual gas sales contained in the Hewett Gas Sales Forecast was based on the assumption that the 52/5A compressor would not be available in 1996. (Indeed, Mr. King speculated that they were prepared for the purpose of the one year delay case). To that end, submitted Mr. McMaster, the figures of gas sales for the contract year 1996/97 were set equal to those in Case Sensitive 8.

As explained by Mr. King in his second witness statement, they show the total increase in gas production from the wells tied to the platform resulting from the increase in compression over the expected remaining productive life of the reservoir. I observe that both documents show precisely the same increase year by year, and both documents show no increase occurring before 1997. The difference between the documents lies in two facts. First, the second document shows capital expenditure of £4.3 million divided between the years 1996 and 1997, which is shown in the first document as being entirely incurred in 1996. Second, the second document shows operating expenditure of £4 million, incurred as to £3 million in 1996 and as to £1 million in 1997, whereas both those figures are absent from the first document. Mr. King explained in his second witness statement that those figures of operating expenditure represented an estimate of the reduction in revenue that would have resulted from failure to have compression in place by the end of October 1996.</span>

If, she said, the production profiles had been produced merely for “economics” (a reference to Mr. King’s message to Mr. Gerd written on the yellow sticker), then Phillips would have been able to produce to the court another production profile generated at about the same time which showed the intended production for 1996 using the 52/5A compressor. No such document had been produced. If Mr. King had wanted to produce for the co-venturers a proper comparison between the economics of completing the compression works in 1996 and completing them in 1997, he could have obtained production profiles on different bases and assumptions specifically identified.

What Mr. King relied on in instructing Mr. Heberlet that the super shortfall penalty would be incurred and would cost £4 million by way of loss of revenue was the histogram.

The histogram was produced four days later in circumstances that are not satisfactorily explained. Mr. King used the histogram in support of an economic exercise designed to be put before the co-venturers to persuade them to authorize the relevant expenditure.

At that time we were struggling to make our nominations to British Gas, and I was aware that they had carried out a modification to enable the 52/5A gas to be routed to the Alpha Compressor while I was away from the area. And I had a look at the proposed modification, the HAZOP that was done, believed it was maybe an opportunity in the short term to increase the flow, a net gain in flow from the field. And we carried out some risk assessment work; and basically, on a trial basis, flowed the 52/5A to a suction of the machine. And we had a net gain from the field -- even though we lost gas from other wells, we had a net gain from the field of, say, 5 to 10 million, which enabled us to meet our DCQ. But obviously then the net gain dropped off and, after about two to three weeks, we lost that improved deliverability.</span>

The suction pressures of the 52/5A compressor in October and November 1996 varied between about 100 and 115 psia; the H line pressures were mostly between 190 and 275 psia. (Psia means pounds per square inch absolute, i.e. measured above the vacuum; psig means pounds per square inch gauge, i.e. measured above atmospheric pressure. The difference is approximately 15 psi). Miss Boswell submitted that whatever might have been the data giving rise to the histogram at attachment 1, it was clear from the Basis of Design that an increment of the order predicted in the histogram could be achieved only if the compressor could suck the Upper Bunter wells down to a suction pressure of 69 psia and discharge at a pressure of 143 psia. I am not persuaded that that is correct. Some figures were in evidence which showed shut-in pressures for 52/5A Upper Bunter and Zechstein wells for years up to 2001. (Shut-in pressures are pressures in the well when the gas is not flowing). They appear to be historic data, in that they are described as shut-in pressure data in the heading of the document in which they appear. Shut-in pressures for the Upper Bunter wells in 1996 were shown as lying between 186 and 189 psi (higher than those shown for 1995). Mr. Sylvester-Evans said that he understood that those figures were in psig. Dr. Robinson said that in the absence of other information he tended to assume it was psig, but he did not know. The figure of 69 psia referred to by Miss Boswell as giving rise to a flow increment of the order of 30 million scuffs a day was based on flowing wellhead pressures which must have been related to the assumed shut-in wellhead pressure of 167 psia stated in the Basis of Design, sheet 5. There is no evidence what the increment would be with a shut-in wellhead pressure of 186 psia or 186 psig and any given H line pressure, but I can see no reason why an increment of 30 mmscf/d should require a suction pressure as low as 69 psia. </span>

I find that figure entirely credible in the light of my own understanding of the evidence concerning the relationship between gas flow between two points in a given system and the pressures at those two points.

His evidence implied (and I take judicial notice of the relevant calculation) that the mass rate of flow of gas in a cylindrical pipe carrying gas at a uniform temperature is proportional to the square root of the difference between the squares of the absolute pressures at the ends of the pipe. The constant of proportionality depends on the dimensions of the pipe, the temperature and the molecular weight of the gas. The situation is not so simple where, as here, the pipework in question is of a complicated shape, or where the temperature is not uniform. The papers show instances of what may be empirical formulae used by Phillips where the gas flow is stated to depend, not precisely on the square root of the difference in question, but on powers differing slightly from 0.5 (a power of 0.5 represents a square root).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">46. Single-cylinder reciprocating compressors are peculiarly liable to cause vibrations. The vibrations are the result of unbalanced cyclical inertial forces. Those forces are associated with the cyclical accelerations of the massive parts of the compressor, specifically the piston, piston rod, crosshead, connecting rod and cranks. Those forces would be substantially balanced by equal and opposite forces in the case of a horizontally-opposed twin cylinder compressor. That is a compressor with two cylinders on the same axis but situated on opposite sides of a single crankshaft, and driven by diametrically-opposed cranks. In general, any twin- or multiple-cylinder compressor is likely to be better balanced than a single-cylinder compressor. One way of balancing a single-cylinder compressor is to fit it with opposing moving masses analogous to those in a horizontally-opposed twin. The fuel gas compressor on the 52/5A platform had a horizontal cylinder and was fitted with a balance-weight on the crankshaft which reduced the unbalanced horizontal forces but increased unbalanced vertical forces. It was a compromise which Snamprogetti considered acceptable.</span>

Simple harmonic motion is an oscillatory motion where the acceleration is always directed towards a central position and is proportional to the instantaneous displacement from that position. If, for example, a point moves round the circumference of a circle with uniform speed, the projection of that point on any diameter of the circle moves with simple harmonic motion about the centre of the circle. Since the generating point has a constant acceleration, always directed towards the centre of the circle, the projected point has its maximum acceleration, equal to that of the generating point, when it is at the extremities of its motion. The projected point has zero acceleration as it passes through the centre of the circle. At that instant, the acceleration of the generating point is at right angles to the selected diameter, and so has a zero component along the diameter. In general, the component along that diameter of the acceleration of the generating point at any instant is proportional to the projection along the diameter of the radius joining the centre to the generating point. That component represents the acceleration of the projected point, which is thus proportional to its distance from, and directed towards, the centre.</span>

The centre of that circle lies on the axis, produced, of the cylinder. Thus the motion of the projection of the big end on that produced axis is simple harmonic motion. But the motion of the piston is not simple harmonic motion. The reason is that the distance of the piston from that projection is not constant. At each end of the stroke, its distance from the projected point is equal to the length of the piston rod plus the length of the connecting rod. But that is not so at any other point in the cycle. At any other point, the distance is equal to the length of the piston rod plus the length of the projection on the produced axis of the length of the connecting rod. The connecting rod is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle of which the projection is another side, shorter than the hypotenuse. Thus for example when the crank is at quadrature the piston is closer to the crankshaft than when the piston is at the centre of its stroke.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">49. The oscillatory motion of a point may be plotted as a graph of position against time. Where the point is moving with simple harmonic motion, the curve obtained is a sine curve. That is because the projection, on the diameter, of the radius vector to the generating point is proportional to the cosine of the angle between that radius vector and the diameter, or to the sine of its complement. The angle may be expressed as the product of the angular velocity of the crankshaft and the time interval measured from some datum. The motion of the piston can be exactly expressed as the sum of an infinite series of sine curves. The first, or fundamental, represents the simple harmonic motion of the projected point, it has an amplitude equal to the radius of the circle, i.e. the length of the crank, and its frequency is the frequency of rotation of the crankshaft. The others (‘harmonics’) are of even multiples of the fundamental frequency and of ever-diminishing amplitudes as the multiple increases. It is common ground that the effect of all the harmonics except the first is negligible. Thus, the relevant frequencies are the fundamental frequency and twice that frequency.</span>

The magnitude of those forces is proportional to the degree of displacement and depends on the shape of deformation. If the object is released, it will oscillate until the energy used in deforming it is dissipated. The more rapidly the energy is dissipated, the more heavily damped is the object said to be. The nature of the oscillation will depend on the shape to which the object is deformed. The frequency or frequencies of such an oscillation, known as natural frequencies, will depend on the physical characteristics of the object. Each natural frequency corresponds to a particular mode of deformation, or “mode shape”.</span>

The different members of the structure had different natural frequencies. Any member that was excited at a frequency at or near a natural frequency of that member was liable to resonate, i.e. to oscillate with an amplitude greater than would otherwise be the case. The greater the amplitude, the greater the stress in the member. Thus resonance was liable to cause damage to the structural member of the platform, by fatigue or otherwise. What I have said about the structural members of the platform applies also to the pipework, instruments and gauges on the fuel gas compressor skid. Oscillations can also have an adverse effect on persons subjected to them. Whilst the platform was intended to be not normally manned, the presence of persons on the platform had to be allowed for.</span>

The module which was to support the new equipment, including the fuel gas compressor, was a structure in the form of a cantilever, projecting from the side of the existing platform. As such, the structure was of a relatively flexible design attached to an edge of the platform that itself had some flexibility. In those circumstances equipment should not have been considered which generated unbalanced forces during its operation. Had it been impossible to specify a compressor that would minimize vibration and operate in a balanced manner, a fuel gas system without a compressor should have been designed. Phillips’s case was that it might or might not have been possible to secure a suitable compressor (i.e., one that did not induce unacceptable vibrations): Phillips made no positive case that any other type of compressor would have been viable.</span>

A publication produced from Snamprogetti’s library states the following. Any stationary compressor must be anchored to a solid mounting. Most reciprocating compressors require attention to foundation design. A proper foundation minimizes vibration and prevents its transmission to adjacent building structures. Those remarks are clearly directed to onshore installation of compressors. The extract from that publication that is before the court gives no indication of the title or date of the publication. Dr. Walker gave evidence that usually in land-based applications a single-cylinder reciprocating compressor would be mounted on a large block of concrete that itself is often buried in the ground. The large mass reduces vibrations to acceptably low levels. Mr. Middleton agreed that that was sound engineering advice for reciprocating compressors on the ground.</p>

Hardly any, if any at all, are unbalanced single-cylinder compressors. A single-cylinder compressor was supplied to Phillips for intermittent use on a platform known as the Maureen platform. On the same platform, there is a three-cylinder compressor which, as Mr. Davies told the court, caused vibration by out-of-balance forces. Whilst that compressor was much more massive than that used on platform 52/5A, the Maureen platform is much more massive than the 52/5A platform. Mr. Sylvester-Evans gave evidence that there had been four large compressors and two large unbalanced reciprocating pumps on the Piper Alpha platform in the North Sea. In the early days, he said, there had been a series of piping failures associated with the reciprocating compressors and also with the reciprocating pumps.</span>

The material failed to comply with the requirements of NACE (National Association of Corrosion Engineers). Compliance with those requirements was a condition laid down in the invitation to tender. Dr. Walker considered that the specification by Snamprogetti of compliance with NACE requirements was unreasonable, since the equipment would not be exposed to the sour Upper Bunter gas, but only to Zechstein gas, which was sweet. However, at a design HAZOP study held in August 1994, conducted by M. George of Snamprogetti and attended by, among others, A. Hess of Phillips Operations Department and M. Webster of Phillips Engineering Department, the possibility of sour gas operation at some future date was mentioned. An observation that the system was designed for operation with sour gas was noted, and it was decided to add a note to the P &amp; I (process and instrumentation) drawings to that effect. Whilst that does not relieve Snamprogetti of responsibility, it does suggest that there are two reasonable views on this subject. I am confirmed in that view by evidence from Mr. Sylvester-Evans, who said (Day 70, p.29) that it was very common to assume that reservoirs would sour. It was a problem that had occurred in the past and therefore it was common to apply the NACE standard especially where you had sour gas on board. </span>

The natural frequency of the knock out drum drain valve/pipe was not tested, but in view of the very high level of vibration measured at 18.75 Hz, it was likely that its natural frequency coincided with the second harmonic of compressor speed.

Mr. Natarajan was the Snamprogetti engineer who had calculated the effect on the structure of the unbalanced forces from the fuel gas compressor. The essence of what he said was this. He understood that the main vibration problems were on a diagonal member, number 153 (the ‘south diagonal’). It was described as 273 X 8 CHS, which means a circular hollow section of 273 mm diameter and of 8 mm wall thickness. The south diagonal had an unacceptable level of mid-span vibration in the north-south direction. The local vibration mode of that member was very close to twice the running speed of the reciprocating compressor. Although the north diagonal had identical geometric characteristics, its vibration was slight. Therefore, only the mid-span vibration of the south diagonal was influenced by the running speed of the fuel gas compressor. In Snamprogetti’s dynamical analysis calculations, the sectional properties of the diagonals had been taken as 219 X 10 CHS, contrary to the fabrication drawings. The detailed drawings were developed subsequently to the dynamic analysis. The end constraints of the two diagonal members had been correctly applied, with moment releases at supports in the north-south direction. The natural frequency of vibration of the diagonal using 219 X 10 CHS was 14.1 Hz, which was between the operational frequencies of the compressor. He had attached to the memorandum a summary of the natural frequencies of vibration of the diagonals with three possible end conditions. That table confirmed that by changing one of the end conditions to fixity the local vibration problem could be minimized if not eliminated. The additional restraints against bending could be achieved by stiffening the gusset plates either by welding or by using mechanical connections. Increasing the mass of the diagonal by filling it with a suitable material would also eliminate the present mid-span vibration problems. The density of the filling material was crucial. For example, using a non-structural filling material with a density of 2000 kg per cubic metre could easily give rise to a natural frequency close to the running speed and introduce another set of vibration problems. On that basis, he recommended that a suitable modification be made to the south diagonal. He indicated his willingness to be of further assistance, if required.</p>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> March Snamprogetti sent to Phillips their comments on AMEC’s proposal. They stated that they did not recommend filling the diagonal with a water solution. They commented as follows. They had calculated that filling the diagonal with water would introduce a mid-span vibration frequency of 12.6 Hz, which lay between the running frequencies of the fuel gas compressor and was close to the running speed. The main disadvantages of water filling were leakage, ice formation and thermal expansion, corrosion, inspection and maintenance requirements, and introduction of stress concentration in the structural member at its ends. Changing both the end restraints against bending in the north-south direction would bring the frequency of mid-span vibration to 40 Hz, away from the running frequencies of the fuel gas compressor. By changing one of the end conditions to fixity, the corresponding frequency of vibration would be 28 Hz, again separated from twice the running frequency of the compressor. It was recommended that achieving end fixity to the south diagonal brace was by far the suitable [sic] and permanent way of minimizing the mid-span vibration of the member. They recommended that in the first instance a gusset restraint should be added to one end of the diagonal brace at 90 [degrees] to the existing gusset, shaped and welded to the outside of the tubular [member] and supporting deck beam. The new gusset would have to be installed in two pieces and if possible welded to the existing gusset. If the vibration was still unacceptable a second gusset should be installed at the other end of the member.</span>

However, the force amplitude of the first harmonic of the fuel gas compressor is only about 30 per cent. of the force amplitude of the fundamental. This point has not been explored.</span>

The report included the following statements. The impact response test on the south diagonal brace showed that filling the tubular brace with water had lowered the fundamental natural frequency from 19 Hz (empty) to 13.5 Hz (full of water).

The bracket added to support the knock out drum drain had reduced the vibration level in the vertical direction from 134 to 2 mm/sec. Apart from those items, the vibration levels were generally similar to, or higher than, those measured previously with the fuel gas compressor working off load and prior to the modifications. Of the items tested, the report mentioned some which were subject to relatively high vibration levels. They were the LSLL-903 level switch, the fuel gas filter, the [fuel gas] compressor suction line, the thermo-syphon, the LSHH-915 level switch and, on the gas turbine compressor set, the fuel gas solenoid valve, the turbine lube oil vent and the turbine air inlet filter framework. Though not impact tested, those items probably had natural frequencies close to the excitation frequencies associated with the fuel gas compressor.</span>

It is clear from an examination of the detailed results set out in the report that in the eleven locations on the structure of the platform (other than the south diagonal brace) tested, the only significant changes were to the vibrations of the north diagonal brace and of the tubular north-south diagonal brace. Those changes represented in both cases increases in the overall levels of vibration, but not to an extent which gave rise to any complaint. Dr. Walker did, however, mention (Day 51, p.81) the increase in the vibration level of the north diagonal brace as an illustration of the complex inter-relationship between the members of the structure. He attributed that increase to the filling of the south brace with water. I accept that that must have been at least a major cause of the change. The load on the compressor may have contributed. </span>

There had been a number of operating problems with the equipment due both to changes in the operating conditions from the original design data and also, possibly, due to deficiencies in the design of the package. The timing of the HAZOP had been intended to allow the action recommendations to be considered and acted upon during the summer, when no compression was required, so that the platform would be fully operational in time for the start of the winter operation mode. There were sixty-nine recommendations. The number of recommendations was higher than would normally be expected for a plant that had been installed and commissioned. The majority of the issues concerned minor changes to the plant which were unlikely significantly to affect the design or cause major modifications offshore. There were, however, several significant issues concerned both with the safety and with the philosophy of the design and construction. The overall safety and operability of the design would depend on their satisfactory resolution.</span>

First, item 1), Snamprogetti had to review the second ATL report and advise on remedial measures. The only remedial measures which they could specifically advise related to the north and south diagonals, where they recommended changing the end condition, as they had before. As to the equipment and instruments, they recommended that a comprehensive review should be carried out in consultation with the manufacturers (George Meller). They did not advise Phillips against going to ATL, or discourage them from doing so. Indeed, consulting ATL was an obvious way of conducting a comprehensive review. There was nothing to prevent Phillips from asking Snamprogetti to take part in such review.  Recommendation 2) of the response sheet clearly left it to Phillips to decide whether to obtain specialist advice.</span>

In the case of the first weld, he calculated that a fatigue crack would begin to develop after four days of operation (and would rapidly develop). In the case of the weld attaching the bottle to the skirt, he calculated a fatigue life of 8 months, which would be reduced if the bottle had been inaccurately positioned.

Mr. Middleton considered that the finite element analysis could not properly be used because it assumed that the foundation on which the bottle was mounted was not itself vibrating. I accept that as a theoretical objection. But in my judgment Dr. Walker’s assumption was a reasonable one for the purpose of carrying out an approximate calculation. In relation to the nozzle, Mr. Middleton also made the point that no account had been taken of possible movement of the bottle at the root of the nozzle. Moreover, one had to allow for an unknown phase difference between the oscillations in the nozzle and the oscillations in the bottle. Those points cast doubt on the accuracy of the calculation, but in my judgment the principal objection to Dr. Walker’s analysis is that he assumed that the support of the level switch was perfectly rigid. I cannot accept his calculation of the fatigue life of the weld at the nozzle as being necessarily even approximately correct.

The ATL report also showed that there was significant vibration of the casing of the fuel gas compressor and of the south, north and middle feet of the fuel gas compressor. The root-mean-square [(rms)] velocities recorded by ATL at those points were up to, but did not exceed, 9.0 mm/second. The level of those vibrations, though outside the limits applied by Snamprogetti in the design of the module, fell well within those stated in a standard, VDI (Verein Deutches Ingenieur) 2056. That standard, which is dated 1964, relates to the vibrations of machines. It divides machines into groups. Group D is machines and motion parts having mass effects which cannot be balanced, and installed on high-tuned mountings (rigidly mounted). The standard says (p.11) that for Group D, root-mean-square velocities of 20 to 30 mm/second, and in certain cases higher than that, may arise without any complaint necessarily resulting. Group S includes machines and motion plants [sic] having mass effects which cannot be balanced, and installed on low-tuned mountings (flexibly mounted). Closely similar standards apply in British Standard 4675 : Part 1 of 1976. The comment in relation to Group S (Class VI in the British Standard) is clearer in the language of the British Standard. It reads, so far as material, ‘The resiliently mounted machines in Class VI permit a greater tolerance [sc., than Class V, which corresponds to Group D] in this respect. There is an isolation effect and the forces transmitted by the mounting into the surroundings are small. Under these circumstances vibration levels measured on the machine side of the mounting system are greater than those measured when the machine is fastened to a large relatively rigid support’. BS 4675 : Part 1 was superseded by BS 7854 : Part 1 in 1996.</span>

The lightweight steel frame cantilevered off the main platform provided a flexible support to the single-cylinder reciprocating compressor. I reject that evidence. Though the fuel gas compressor was not on a block of concrete, it was rigidly mounted. It is true that it was attached to a module that had a degree of flexibility. In any case, the less rigid the mounting, the greater the speed of vibration allowed by the standard. Dr. Walker said that Group M applied.

BS  7854 has an apparently more rigorous standard limiting the permitted root-mean-square vibration velocity to 2.8 mm/second. However, that British Standard does not apply specifically to reciprocating machinery. Class II, on which Dr. Walker relied, is similar to Group M in VDI 2056, though the express restriction to machines having only rotating parts is absent. Electric motors of 15kW to 75kW output are said to be typical. It is obvious that such machines are likely to produce less vibration than reciprocating machines, as appears to be recognized by VDI 2056. BS 7854 states that it is a basic document which sets out general guidelines for the evaluation of mechanical vibration of machines; that it is intended that evaluation criteria for specific machine types will be provided for different machine types; and that the limited criteria provided are a short-term expedient only.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> March 1996, and he concluded that they thus exceeded the permitted level of 2.8 mm/second. However, it follows from the vibration spectra and figures reported by ATL that the greater part of the vibrations of the electric motor was caused by the reciprocating compressor, and not by the motor itself. BS 7854 states at the beginning, under the heading Scope, that the evaluation criteria relate only to the vibration produced by the machine itself and not to vibration transmitted to it from outside. Thus I reject Dr. Walker’s evidence on this point. The vibrations of the fuel gas compressor and of the electric motor were not excessive.</span>

Mr. Middleton considered that a proper program of modifications to pipework and instruments on the fuel gas compressor skid would have been likely to be successful. He mentioned three methods of reducing the vibrations to a harmless level: bracing, stiffening and application of inertia dampers. He gave an illustration of bracing together attachments to the fuel gas compressor receiver to neutralize the vibrations of level switch LSHH-915. He envisaged a stiff connection between two nozzles attached to the receiver a quadrant apart. If properly designed, it would take the resonant frequency away from the excitation frequencies (Day 54, p.93 et seq.; Day 56, p.110). Dr. Walker said (Day 51, p.7) that an object should not be braced to something that is vibrating at an unacceptable level. I do not accept that that is an absolute prohibition, since the bracing can affect the resonant frequencies of the system.</span>

He estimated that to carry out the necessary survey, numerical modelling, design and modifications was likely to take six to eight weeks. Dr. Walker included the structure of the module in that estimate. He considered that even the pipework and instruments on the fuel gas compressor skid should not be rectified on a piecemeal basis, since a change to one part of the system would be likely to affect other parts. </p>

Many of which can be substantially improved by bracing.  It would certainly be wise before and after doing any of those actions to locate the points where the high stresses were likely to be and to strain gauge those points, if possible, to see how much reduction in vibratory strain one had achieved by the modifications and to see, once modified, whether the stress levels at the locations were adequately reduced to give, what Dr Walker has pointed out many times, a safe operating life, which is what we all have to strive for.</span>

Snamprogetti had laid down a specification for the fuel gas compressor. That specification included a seventeen-page document entitled ‘General specification for piping design in mechanical packages for offshore facilities’. It is not clear that the precise document is before the court, since the first page (sheet 1 of 17) has the reference Specification No. GSP/ENDP/5962, whereas the pages that follow (sheets 2 to 17 of 17) have the reference Specification No. E-99-S-P-0014. No point has been taken about that. I shall assume that the document, if not the actual specification, is substantially the same as the actual specification in all relevant respects. The specification provided for the use of gusset plates where fatigue stress due to vibration could cause failure of a pipe branch at the point of attachment. It provided that piping components and pipework should be designed and installed so that their natural vibration frequencies in operation were not excited by a regular forcing frequency from other system equipment such as a pump or fan. In case of dispute, the principal natural frequency of a suspect piping installation as determined by calculation or measurement and vibration frequency analysis on the fabricated system should be at least 20 per cent. removed from any significant coupled exciting frequency.</span>

The answer to that, my Lord, is definitely no, because there is no detail available, at the time of making the selection, to specify the detailed design of the piping or the instruments. So one does not have any detail, and in my experience I would not expect that to happen. It is normally handled by in-house codes which are then passed on and implemented, as such, by the contractor, subcontractor and the installer.</span>

From my experience, it would essentially be, my Lord -- and this is prior to this design period, so prior to 1994 -- one would expect, as I said, the design basis to go forward. You would not undertake a detailed calculation or assessment of the individual piping and its instruments. You would not have the details. In order to wait for that detail, even if such analysis were undertaken -- which, in my experience, you would not -- it would cause a long delay in the project. If you went all the way through and designed the piping, and then found you had a major problem with the vibration, you have a huge, long lead time, shall we say, in that exercise, which will delay the project.</span>

As regards the effect of vibrations on human beings, Mr. Morrell gave evidence about his experience when he was on the platform for the first time in February 1996. At that stage, the gas turbine, the main compressor, the after-cooler and the fuel gas compressor skid had all been installed. Some connections had been made, but not all the interfaces had been completed. When the fuel gas compressor was started, he was alarmed at the extent of what he called the vibration problem. He could feel the vibrations. They affected the skid itself, walkways, handrails and other things. At one point he stood on a walkway approximately 80 feet from the fuel gas compressor, off the deck itself, and still felt the vibrations. His entire body was moving, though it was not bad enough to give blurred vision. His major concern was with the pipes and instrument panels. He said that the south-west diagonal brace on the main compressor skid was resonating very badly. You could physically see it moving about. I accept that evidence of Mr. Morrell. But it is worth mentioning that the maximum vibration double amplitude (i.e., peak to trough) of any member of the structure whose vibration was measured by ATL on their first visit, namely that of the south diagonal brace, was less than 0.6 mm.</span>

That includes the time taken to find a firm willing to undertake the work. The work in question includes not only the work necessary to rectify the vibrations caused by the fuel gas compressor to the pipework and instruments and to things on the main compressor skid but also any work found necessary to rectify the vibration of any walkways, gratings or other places where operatives or maintenance engineers would have to work.

The gas turbine driving the main compressor required fuel gas at a pressure between 188 or 190 psig and 250 psig. The fuel gas was Zechstein gas taken from a point a short distance above the confluence of the Upper Bunter and the Zechstein gas, and thus at a pressure only a few pounds per square inch above that at the main compressor discharge. The main compressor had to be capable of providing a discharge pressure of 143 psia in 1995, falling to 100 psia in 2003 to 2005.

The shut-in wellhead pressure of the Zechstein gas was over 1000 psig in 1994 and 1995. Fuel gas could have been tapped off at a suitable pressure near one of the Zechstein wellheads, upstream of the confluence of the gas flowing from that wellhead with the gas flowing from the other Zechstein wellheads. A pressure reduction valve downstream of the tap-off point but upstream of that confluence point would prevent the high-pressure gas from reducing the flow from the other Zechstein wells. It would, however, reduce the flow of gas from the wellhead in question. Such a system was described by Dr. Robinson. I am satisfied that it would have worked in principle. It would have required the use of a fuel gas heater, since the driving turbine of the main compressor required superheated gas. No such heater was required with a fuel gas compressor, since the compression superheated the gas.</span>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.50in">I understand that Phillips has now adopted a new fuel gas system, which involves using two dedicated Zechstein wells as a source of fuel gas. The gas from the two dedicated Zechstein wells is currently of sufficiently high pressure to drive the turbine. A fuel gas heater is being used to supply superheat to the gas. This fuel gas system was never a design possibility during the compression study nor during the detailed design phase. There are a number of reasons why Snamprogetti could not have adopted such a design:-</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These dedicated wells would need to be operated at very low flow rates in order to provide substantially higher wellhead operating pressures. These pressures would be quite different to the predicted pressures for normal production flow rates. As a consequence of dedicating two Zechstein wells, the production from the platform would be substantially reduced. This would be totally contrary to the objectives of the compression study, which were to maximize production from the Upper Bunter and Zechstein reservoirs. If this design approach were to be adopted, it would totally undermine the economics of the proposed compression facilities. It is difficult to see how the investment in the compression facilities could be economically justified in the light of the reduced production.</p>

The use of two dedicated Zechstein wells for fuel gas would reduce the flow by around 10-12 mmscfd thus reducing the net production gain from this major investment by around a third.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The fuel gas system adopted by Phillips is only feasible because Phillips has changed the requirements to meter the gas. As I have indicated, we were required to meter this gas and its requirement is recorded in the gas compression study report. During the compression study, Phillips told us that it was their practice to meter all the gas on the platform, including the gas supplied to the generators. We were required to follow the same philosophy in our design. It was not until the third quarter of 1994 that Phillips appeared to change the take-off point for fuel gas from downstream to upstream of the metering package. This operational change was not communicated to us formally through the contract in any change notice, but I believe we learnt about the change in take-off point. I do not recall how this came to our attention. In any event, this change in take-off point did not affect our design because according to the pressure data in the Basis of Design there was insufficient pressure to operate the turbine without the fuel gas compressor, regardless of whether the take-off point was upstream or downstream of the metering package. By mid 1994, Snamprogetti’s detailed design was in any event well under way and Phillips was working to a fast-track programme. No changes to design or design philosophy would have been considered by Phillips, even if they were viable.</p>

The table did not define the operating envelope. That could be seen by reference to some figures given on sheet 11 in section 4 of the document, headed “Operating conditions”. Those figures showed a flowing wellhead pressure for Zechstein gas of 200 psig forecast for 1995. The main compressor must give a discharge pressure to blend Upper Bunter gas into the Zechstein gas. The pressure drop between the wellhead and the point of confluence was likely to be less than 20 psi. Thus the compressor must be capable of discharging at about 180 psig.</p>

In his oral evidence (Day 63, p.48) Dr. Robinson expressed the opinion that the flowing wellhead pressures of Zechstein gas shown in section 4 corresponded to rates of flow set out in section 2.3. On that basis, the flowing wellhead pressure of 200 psig corresponded to a rate of flow of 32 mmscf/d. Some figures in a table on sheet 8 of the basis of design were put to Dr. Robinson in cross-examination. Those figures, contained in a table said to show capacities by reservoir, showed a capacity of the Zechstein wells on 52/5A predicted to be about 55 mmscf/d in 1995. Dr. Robinson accepted that that could indicate a flowing wellhead pressure lower than 200 psig. But it could be that the wells had been re-calibrated since the production of the figures in section 2.3. It was put to him that what was contemplated when Zechstein gas was required for maximum nominations was that there would be a very high flow of Zechstein gas, which meant inevitably that that Zechstein gas would be flowing at a much lower pressure than the pressures set out on sheet 11. He accepted that that appeared to be a reasonable interpretation (Day 63, p.52).</p>

The front page of the Basis of Design states that the document relates to compression facilities at Hewett 52/5A. But the introduction states that it defines the basis for the offshore compression facilities to be installed on platform 52/5A and for modifications to the Bacton compression, amine and sulphur recovery facilities. Thus the figures may be relevant to the situation where the main compressor on platform 52/5A is not working. Nevertheless, I regard the figures on sheet 11 as an item of evidence in support of Mr. McMaster’s contention. I return to this point below.</p>

Mr. McMaster relied on a curve drawn in manuscript on one of those graphs as showing that the H line would be subjected to pressures of up to 225 psi and that accordingly the main compressor would have to be capable of discharging Upper Bunter gas at that pressure. His argument depended on an analysis of another document appended to the Basis of Design, called the flow strategy. That document appears as Appendix III and is headed Flow Strategy for Winter 1993/94.

They are both graphs of FTP pressure in psi (the ordinate) against flow rate in mmscf/d (the abscissa). FTP refers to the field terminal platform, also known as the 48/29A platform. Each graph shows four members of a family of curves. Each such curve is a plot of entry pressure of gas into the 30-inch line at the FTP against the flow rate of that gas. For any given curve, the lower the flow rate, the less the pressure. The pressure at zero flow rate appears as the intercept of the curve with the ordinate. Since with zero flow rate the pressure along the line would be uniform, the intercept represents the pressure on arrival at Bacton of the gas to which the curve applies. Thus the curve can be used to determine what pressure is required at the FTP for any given flow rate of gas to arrive at Bacton at the pressure represented by the intercept. The four curves are almost straight lines and almost parallel, especially at flow rates above about 150 mmscf/d. Especially below that pressure, they diverge. Because of that departure from linearity, it makes a difference whether the pressures shown are in psia or in psig. It is not stated which they are.</p>

That was the compressor giving the “49/29A” (i.e., 48/29A) compression mentioned in section 4.2 of the Basis of Design quoted above. At the material time, the alpha compressor fed gas only into the A line, though the system was later altered so as to be capable of feeding gas into either the A line or the B line. Curve 1 on the graph for the A line shows a pressure at the FTP (i.e. at the discharge of the alpha compressor) of approximately 190 psi at a flow rate of 200 mmscf/d. I call that the starting-point of Curve 1. Curve 2 on the A line graph starts at a pressure of 250 psi and a flow rate of about 240 mmscf/d. Thus the text explains that Curve 1 shows, as a function of flow rate, the pressure to which the alpha compressor is to compress the gas from 75 psig. And it explains that Curve 2 shows, as a function of flow rate, the pressure to which the alpha compressor has to compress the gas from 95 psig. It is also relevant to the present issue that it was contemplated that where 52/5A gas was to be fed to the alpha compressor, the suction pressure would be 95 psig (110 psia). That would be a few pounds per square inch less than the discharge pressure required of the main compressor on the 52/5A platform in those circumstances.</p>

(It thus appears from the text that the FTP pressure figures shown on the ordinate were being interpreted as representing pressures in psig). Curve 2 starts at about 136 psi and a flow rate of about 155 mmscf/d. The pressure remains constant down to a flow rate of about 130 mmscf/d, and at that point starts to rise to 250 psi at about 40 mmscf/d. There being no compression at the FTP for gas flowing into the B line, those figures indicate an H line pressure at the 52/5A platform of a few pounds per square inch over 136 psi at a B line flow rate of 155 mmscf/d rising to a few pounds per square inch over 250 psi at a B line flow rate of 40 mmscf/d. Where Upper Bunter gas was to be used, the discharge pressure from the main compressor on the 52/5A platform would have to be slightly above the H line pressure. It was upon those figures that Mr. McMaster’s argument depended.

As the flow rate of gas in the A line falls the pressure at the FTP will rise due to the reduction in the friction losses, the shutdown of lower pressure wells and the increased head available from the compressor. This will result in the pressure/flow relationship shown by curve 2 of Attachment 1.

When there is a pressure gradient of gas in a pipeline, the gas flows from the point of higher pressure to the point of lower pressure. The higher-pressure gas drives the lower-pressure gas in front of it, thereby losing some of its potential energy. I am satisfied on the evidence of Dr. Robinson that for any given rate of flow of gas in a given pipeline, the higher the average pressure of the gas, the less is the loss of power in that way. Thus in the interests of economy it is desirable to have as high a pressure as possible for gas entering the A line or the B line at the FTP.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">154. There is provision for control of the flow of gas from each well by means of a control valve near the well. If the valve is adjusted so as to reduce the flow of gas, pressure will build up upstream of it until the rate of flow of gas from the well is reduced to match the flow through the valve. In view of the large volume of gas downstream of the valve, the adjustment of the valve will have no immediate discernible effect on the pressure downstream of it. Thus the adjustment of the valve in those circumstances will cause a loss of potential energy as the pressure of the gas passing through the valve falls. That loss is irrecoverable. If, instead of using the valve, the pressure downstream of it were increased to a level slightly below the upstream pressure, such as to allow the same flow, that energy would not be lost. That conclusion was reached by Dr. Robinson by a slightly different process of reasoning. Thus it is more economic to control the flow of gas by means of the pressure of gas in the sea line than by using flow control valves. Dr. Robinson said that the valve should be viewed as a device for minor adjustment of flow, to balance one well against another. It is not intended as the primary means of controlling pipeline flows. The production objective is to maximize the flow of gas from each well in use, in such a way that the pipeline pressure is maximized. In that way the need for gas at any time can be met, whilst minimizing the use of energy at Bacton. (Dr. Robinson’s second supplementary report, 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2002, paragraph 2.22).  I read his reference to maximizing the flow of gas as meaning minimizing the reduction of flow caused by use of flow control valves. On that reading, I accept that evidence as representing the ideal state of affairs from the point of view of economy. But it does not represent the state of affairs envisaged by the figures in the flow strategy, on which Mr. McMaster’s argument depends.</p>

Dr. Robinson explained the association of high pressure with low mass flow shown by the lower manuscript curve on the graph for line B as follows. One starts with a steady state, i.e. a situation where the mass flow is constant and the pressure at any given point in the system is constant. The mass flow of gas into the system from the wells equals the mass flow out of the system at Bacton. If the take of gas at Bacton is reduced, the mass of gas in the pipelines upstream of it will increase, since the rate of influx is initially unchanged. That causes an increase of pressure everywhere in the system, including the back pressure at the wellheads. That in turn causes a reduction in flow from the wells. In time, a new state of equilibrium will be reached at a lower mass flow and higher pressures than before. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, if the take at Bacton is increased. It is not desirable, said Dr. Robinson, for reasons of economy, to make the changes at the wellhead end of the system by means of flow control valves (save for minor adjustments). Again, I accept that evidence as representing the ideal state of affairs.</p>

The flow strategy shows Upper Bunter production at 13 mmscf/d, to be fed into the B line, when the B line is passing a total of 67 mmscf/d. Therefore, said Mr. McMaster, reading off from the lower manuscript curve on the graph for the B line, the pressure in the B line at the FTP has to be 200 psi. Indeed, the Upper Bunter gas should start to flow when the flow in the B line is 54 mmscf/d. That implies a pressure of about 217 psi in the B line according to the curve on the graph. The main compressor on the 52/5A platform would have to discharge gas at a few pounds per square inch above those pressures.</p>

Those flows in the B line correspond to pressures ranging from 217 psi down to about 136 or 138 psi according to the curve. It is manifest that a constant flow over such a range of pressures requires more than tweaking of the control valves for those wells. On Dr. Robinson’s scenario, the pressure would have to be substantially constant over the whole range of flows in the B line in order to ensure a constant flow from wells 48/30-9. That constant pressure would also have to sustain variable flows from two of the Zechstein wells.</p>

I am fortified in my conclusion that the lower manuscript curve may be an ideal curve by the terms of the note accompanying the marked-up graph when, on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 1994, it was sent by Phillips to Snamprogetti. That note reads, so far as material, “Please find curves showing ideal max. pressure at FTP as a function of rate”.</p>

The normal method of operation described in the Operating Philosophy is that the pressure rises as the flow requirement falls, but it assumes that the low pressure wells are shut down as the flow requirement falls. The low pressure wells must by definition surely include the Upper Bunter wells, notwithstanding the proposed 52/5A main compressor. Indeed, it was contemplated that the 52/5A compressor would not be used in the summer, when demand is less than in the winter. If the lower pressure wells could not be cut out, then the H line pressure would be 138 psia, consistent with a discharge pressure of 143 psia for that compressor. The pressure of 138 psia is also consistent with a flow in the B line of 150 mmscf/d, the figure mentioned in the Operating Philosophy as the normal rate.</p>

It showed results of a simulation model in relation to the reservoir serving platform 52/5A, as confirmed by Mr. Halliwell in evidence (Day 44, p.131). It was sub-headed “Assumption of compression on 52/5A at 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 1994”. For the 3000, 4000, 6000 and 7500 HP cases it showed flow rates of individual Upper Bunter wells, increasing with each increment of power. It showed the corresponding flowing wellhead pressures, decreasing with each increment in flow rate. It showed pressures at inlet to the compressor, decreasing with each increment in power. It showed sea line pressures: in all those cases, 143 psia. The sea line pressure with no compression was shown as 141 psia.</p>

For the given sealine pressure more horse power allows you to lower the inlet pressure and increase the rate in that particular operating scenario.  So that does not mean to say that is the only scenario to which the compressor should be subjected, that is just the lowest pressure that we would expect to cope with.</span>

Clearly we could not expect if the sealine was at a higher pressure to get the same inlet pressure, the same production profiles and so on, but the compressor should still be able to cope with that to some degree or other, and it is a trade off between investment in terms of how much it cost for a certain size of compressor, a trade off on production profiles. It is a complex trade off, but to simplify it down to this compressor must just produce at these pressures and to these pressures is simplifying it too far in my view.</span>

The specification (Reciprocating Compressor Data Sheet) provided that where the inlet pressure was 142 psia the fuel gas compressor would compress the gas to a pressure of 233 psia at a flow rate of 59,373 scf/hr. Where the inlet pressure was 99 psia the fuel gas compressor would compress the gas to a pressure of 218.5 psia at a flow rate of 25,998 scf/hr. In fact, the latter flow rate would be substantially higher.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">174. The fuel gas compressor was not designed to operate with an inlet pressure of 180 psig, nor was it capable of doing so. Dr. Robinson gave evidence in his first report (paragraph 11.18), and I accept, that there was a high pressure trip on the fuel gas receiver. He said that it was set at 230 psig. The actual figure was 240 psig (255 psia). That trip would stop all production on the platform. At an inlet pressure of 200 psig, he said, the discharge pressure from the fuel gas compressor would be about 290 psig, well above the trip setting. I am satisfied that he was wrong about that. As Mr. Sylvester-Evans explained, there was a recycle pressure control valve (PV 923, sometimes called PCV 923) which was set to control the discharge pressure of the fuel gas compressor at about 218 psig at the start of the project. Some variation in the discharge pressure could readily be catered for by the fuel gas regulator on the gas turbine skid. The problem lay in the fact that when the fuel gas compressor had an inlet pressure of approximately 200 psig, it was scarcely compressing the gas, so that the gas was not superheated. In consequence, liquids condensed out of the gas in the fuel gas supply line. When commissioning was attempted, that problem was experienced. It was not acceptable for the operation of the main compressor. I am satisfied that the same problem would have existed with an inlet pressure of 180 psig. The requirement to take the supply of fuel gas from upstream of the metering skid made little difference, and was not a cause of the problem. In that connection I accept the evidence of Mr. Tomlinson (Day 39, p.115) that the upper limit of inlet pressure for the fuel gas compressor to provide sufficient superheat was somewhere between 143 and 180 psia (128 and 165 psig).</span>

That was an obvious error in design which in my judgment constituted a breach on the part of Snamprogetti of their contract with Phillips. What was needed to ensure sufficient superheat in the absence of a fuel gas heater was a suction pressure control valve for the fuel gas compressor. That would have reduced the inlet pressure to a sufficiently low value to give sufficient superheat on compression. Mr. Sylvester-Evans had carried out what he described as a back-of-an-envelope isentropic calculation which, allowing some margin, showed that there would be sufficient superheat with an inlet pressure as high as 175 psia (Day 68, pp.10, 11). I accept that evidence. Thus the inclusion of a suction pressure control valve limiting the suction pressure to 175 psia would have avoided this problem.</p>

If you look at the third column from the right on E4, 161, you will see that the pressure ratio is given.  Now, if the discharge pressure reduces, then the pressure ratio reduces and the power demand from the turbine also reduces.  And it reduces faster for a power ratio reduction than it does for a flow reduction.  So therefore the two compressors effectively would be in step.  One is having the gas flow reduced by virtue of the reduced volume it is producing, and the other one is having the power demand reduced by the power ratio, which reduces the power by the -- the power is the square of the pressure ratio.  So therefore the two work hand in hand.</span>

But I am more concerned with whether the fuel gas compressor was actually defective in the respects alleged by the claimants. On the question of the adequacy of the fuel gas compressor to carry out its functions I derived considerable assistance from Mr. Sylvester-Evans. Mr. Sylvester-Evans carried out calculations of the amounts of fuel gas available under three different conditions against the corresponding requirements of the main compressor for fuel gas. The three conditions were fuel gas compressor inlet pressures of 142, 125 and 175 psia. He used as his basis for those calculations the assumption (which was not in issue) that at an inlet pressure of 142 psia the fuel gas compressor could compress 59,373 scf/hr, as stated in the Reciprocating Compressor Data Sheet. He assumed that the discharge pressure of the main compressor exceeded the inlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor in each case by 15 psi. He also carried out calculations of the power required by the main compressor to compress Upper Bunter gas to those discharge pressures. He then calculated what flow of fuel gas was needed to meet those power requirements. In each case there was more than enough gas available to meet the power requirement. I accept those calculations as substantially accurate. They showed that the availability exceeded the requirement by proportions ranging from 9 per cent (at a fuel gas compressor inlet pressure of 125 psia) to 30 per cent (at a fuel gas compressor inlet pressure of 175 psia).</span>

Mr. Sylvester-Evans explained his assumption that the pressure drop between the discharge of the main compressor and the inlet of the fuel gas compressor was 15 psi. He took that as the pressure drop across the after-cooler of the main compressor and along the pipework from there to the sealine. He treated the pressure drop across the Zechstein metering skid as negligible. Slightly varying estimates were given by the witnesses for the latter figure. I am satisfied that it did not exceed approximately 5 psi. As to the 15psi pressure drop between the discharge of the main compressor and the sealine, the figures emanating from Phillips and incorporated in the Basis of Design included no allowance for that pressure drop. Mr. Sylvester-Evans made no allowance for a pressure drop across any suction control valve for the fuel gas compressor. He considered (Day 73, p.78) that the pressure drop across it would be small, not much more than “perhaps a couple of psi”.</span>

In order to carry out his calculations, Mr. Sylvester-Evans used compressor curves, i.e., graphs showing the characteristics of the main compressor. Those curves applied to a suction pressure of 65.5 psia. He also used a graph showing the thermal efficiency of the main compressor as a function of compressor speed and power output. From one graph of compressor curves, he read off the speed of the main compressor required to discharge a flow of gas of 155,035 lb/hr at the discharge pressure in question. From the other graph of compressor curves, he read off the power required to drive that flow of gas through the compressor at that speed. He added 200 horsepower to allow for power losses in driving the compressor. The efficiency of the turbine in turning the heat energy in the fuel into mechanical energy he determined by reference to the thermal efficiency graph, which showed specific heat input in British thermal units per horsepower hour. Mr. Sylvester-Evans said (Day 68, p.30) that the calculations were rough and ready calculations.</span>

Mr. Sylvester-Evans evidently selected the flow of 155,035 lb/hr because it was specifically marked on the graphs and facilitated reading them. I have calculated that that flow represents approximately 81 mmscf/d, which is substantially greater than the flows required by sheet 5 of the Basis of Design. Those flows vary from 74.1 mmscf/d for an inlet pressure of 69 psia and a discharge pressure of 143 psia through 39.3 mmscf/d for inlet and discharge pressures of 36 and 121 psia to 18.5 mmscf/d for inlet and discharge pressures of 35 and 100 psia. On that account Mr. Sylvester-Evans’s calculated requirements of power and fuel will be over-estimates. On the other hand, the use of the graph applying to a suction (i.e. inlet) pressure of 65.5 psia will tend to give rise to an under-estimate in the case of 125 psia sea line pressure, for in that case sheet 5 shows an inlet pressure of only 43 psia.</span>

That has a flow of 39.3 mmscf/d (75,200 lb/hr), an inlet pressure of 36 psia and an outlet pressure of 121 psia. Using Mr. Sylvester-Evans’s assumption, I have taken the inlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor as 106 psia. I have used the compressor curves for a suction pressure of 33.80 psia, the nearest available to 36 psia. The required speed is 94 per cent, the horsepower is 3300, to which I have added 200, and the thermal efficiency factor is 10,750. That leads to a fuel requirement of 40,000 scf/hr. The available fuel flow is 44,320 scf/hr, an excess of 11 per cent. The use of a lower suction pressure than that contemplated in sheet 5 leads to a slight over-estimate of the fuel requirement.</span>

I have taken the inlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor as 85 psia. Again I have used the compressor curves appropriate to a suction pressure of 33.80 psia. Here, the main compressor has to run on recycle. That creates inefficiency, but does not affect the method of the calculation. I have chosen a flow through the main compressor (including recycled gas) of 50,000 lb/hr (26 mmscf/d). The speed is 84 per cent and the power requirement is 2000 horsepower. Adding 200 horsepower yields a thermal efficiency factor of 12,800 and a fuel requirement of 29,900 scf/hr. The fuel available is 35,540 scf/hr, an excess of 19 per cent. (For any given compressor, there exists a minimum flow rate, dependent on other factors such as the pressure, below which the phenomenon of surge will occur. Surge is an unacceptable fluctuation in pressure. To avoid surge, flow through the compressor is maintained by recycling gas that has passed through it).</span>

This statement is correct, and is the standard design practice to ensure the adequacy of the compressor selection. Design then requires that a control mechanism be used to allow operation above the minimum pressure. The control mechanism must bring higher pressures down to the minimum value. In this instance the compressor was selected, as shown in the specification document.…., to operate at a design suction pressure of 127 psig. In fact the lowest pressure to be encountered for the fuel gas would have been late in the project, when the Basis of Design showed a fuel gas pressure of 85 psig in year 2003. This should have been the design suction pressure for the compressor. A pressure control valve should then have been provided to ensure that any pressure above this value was reduced to 85 psig. The process then has inbuilt flexibility. This is fundamental design practice. The specification of 127 psig for the suction pressure of the compressor suggests to me that the compressor may not have worked at all for the conditions at the end of the project. The design envelope for the compressor had been very badly selected. This was poor design, unworthy of a competent contractor.</span>

The claimants have interpreted the expression “the highest fuel gas rate…..to meet the requirements of the gas turbine” to mean the highest fuel gas rate that the turbine could at any time require. That is a possible reading of the expression. But in its context I take it to mean that even at the lowest inlet pressures, the fuel gas compressor must be capable of supplying, at the constant pressure, a flow of gas sufficient for the contemporaneous requirements of the gas turbine. As I have found in paragraph 185 above, it was capable of doing that. (In fact, at the lowest inlet pressure, 99 psia, the specification did provide for a somewhat lower outlet pressure, viz. 218.5 psia compared with 233 psia). It is true that if such a suction pressure controller had been used, the fuel gas compressor would not have been capable of supplying sufficient fuel to the turbine to allow the main compressor to fulfil the requirements of sheet 5 for the earlier years, i.e. for higher discharge pressures of the main compressor. I understand Mr. Tomlinson’s agreement that the sentence in question was the correct way to size a compressor to be based on a similar understanding of its meaning to mine, particularly having regard to the passage I have emphasized.</span>

That pressure was controlled by the fuel gas regulator, a valve situated on the main compressor turbine skid. Dr. Robinson and Mr. Sylvester-Evans differed over the operation of the fuel gas regulator. Both witnesses agreed that the regulator valve could not properly handle rapid variations in the pressure of the gas upstream of it. Dr. Robinson said (Day 65, p.26) that it was a device to produce a constant pressure drop. Thus if the pressure upstream of it varied [sc., slowly], the pressure downstream of it would likewise vary. Mr. Sylvester-Evans, on the other hand, said (Day 67, p.138) that the valve was designed to establish a constant pressure downstream of it. Dr. Robinson accepted that it was intended to produce a constant pressure downstream of it; but that it was intended for use where there was a constant pressure upstream of it. I am satisfied that it is Mr. Sylvester-Evans who is correct in this respect. He drew my attention to a technical description of the valve, I assume emanating from the manufacturer. It is clear from that description that the outlet pressure was regulated, and that that regulated pressure plus the pressure applied by a spring balanced the fixed pressure of a trapped mass of gas. Provision was made for correcting the pressure of the trapped mass of gas if it varied. The spring controlled the opening of the valve. If the downstream pressure departed from the required value, the resulting imbalance would cause the spring to move, restoring the downstream pressure to its required value.</span>

It was specified in the Reciprocating Compressor Data Sheet as 233 psia for a flow of 59,373 scf/hr and 218.5 psia for a flow of 25,998 scf/hr. It was nevertheless intended to be held constant over periods of time. Rapid fluctuations in it were not acceptable. It was controlled in the following way. Gas flow excess to the requirements of the turbine was taken off at the outlet of the fuel gas compressor and returned via a spillback line, through a control valve PV 923, to the inlet of the fuel gas compressor. The pressure at the outlet of the fuel gas compressor was controlled by controlling the flow though the spillback line. The degree to which the control valve was open was controlled by a device sensitive to the pressure upstream of the valve (i.e., to the outlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor). The flow through the control valve depended also on the pressure downstream of it (i.e., the inlet pressure for the fuel gas compressor). By controlling the flow through the spillback line so as to maintain a constant pressure at the outlet of the fuel gas compressor, the device ensured that the flow of gas supplied by the fuel gas compressor to the regulator matched the flow required by the turbine.</span>

A control loop of that type was efficient only when the discharge side of the control valve was at a steady pressure. The main purpose of PV 923 was to control the pressure of fuel gas at entry to the gas turbine, for which the gas take-off was upstream of that control valve. PV 923 must respond to demands from the turbine for changes in the gas flow and ensure that the pressure of 200 psig [sic] was always maintained for the fuel gas going to the turbine. It could not achieve that efficiently if the pressure on its discharge side was also changing in an uncontrolled manner. Without upstream pressure control to the fuel gas compressor, the pressure on the discharge side of PV 923 would “float” on the sealine pressure. Valve PV 923 would thus be required to achieve control in response to changing pressures on both its upstream and downstream sides. Such a requirement was grossly inefficient.

That reduction would be so severe that the turbine would be almost useless. Mr. Tomlinson was cross-examined about that (Day 39, pp.33, 34, 37):</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">202. Dr. Robinson criticized the idea of having different set points for the suction pressure control valve. He set out his argument in paragraph 6.9 and the succeeding paragraphs of his report of 28</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> August 2002. It was this. The fuel gas compressor must deliver gas to the gas turbine at a set pressure. The flow rate of gas to the gas turbine can vary from its maximum value, when the turbine power is a maximum, down to zero, when the fuel gas compressor is working at total recycle. When the turbine is operating at full power a small flow must be maintained through the recycle, or pressure cannot be controlled. The recycle (spillback) control valve must be capable of controlling the pressure, with a flow from 110 per cent. of the maximum flow required by the turbine, down to a flow of only 10 per cent. of that maximum. Because of the wide control range, valve PV 923 should have a nearly linear flow characteristic. That means that equal increments in valve opening should give nearly equal increments in flow, for any given pressure drop across the valve. A control valve can normally operate between 10 per cent. and 90 per cent. of its full range. (It is common ground that the recycle valve as supplied was in any event unsuitable. That is a separate question, but the properties that it should have had are relevant to the present question).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">203. The argument continued: if the setting of the suction pressure controller were changed from 95 psia to 142 psia, the flow rate through the fuel gas compressor would increase in the ratio 142:95=1.49. Thus in full recycle, the recycle control valve would need to handle 1.49 times the amount of gas that it would need to handle at suction conditions of 95 psia. The pressure drop across the valve would decrease from 233-95=138 psi to 233-142=91 psi. The capacity of a valve varies as the square root of the pressure drop across it. The effect of a reduction in pressure drop from 138 to 91 psi on a linear valve would be to require it to open in proportion to v(138/91)=1.23. The combined effect would be to require the valve to be 1.49 x 1.23=1.83 more open at full recycle at suction conditions of 142 psia than at suction conditions of 95 psia. Given that the system was designed to suction conditions of 95 psia the valve would simply be wide open on full recycle at 142 psia, and no control would be achieved. And the valve could not pass the required flow of gas. For at 95 psia the valve would be 90 per cent. open at the full flow rate appropriate to that suction condition. Manifestly, it could not open further by a factor of 1.83. If the valve were linear above 90 per cent. open, it could pass only 1.11 times that flow rate. Yet the increase required of it would be by a factor of 1.49 [I have slightly amended Dr. Robinson’s wording without affecting the argument].</span>

If, on the other hand, the recycle valve were designed to cover suction pressure controller set points from 95 to 142 psia, the position would be this. At 10 per cent. open, the valve would pass one-eleventh of the full recycle rate at 95 psia suction pressure. At 90 per cent. open, it would pass the full recycle rate at 142 psia suction pressure, i.e. 1.49 times the maximum recycle rate at 95 psia suction pressure. Not only that, but at 90 per cent. open and with a suction pressure of 95 psia, the recycle valve would pass 1.83 times the maximum recycle rate applicable to that suction pressure. Thus for maximum recycle rate at 95 psia suction pressure, the valve would be open only to the extent of 52 per cent. That would be grossly inefficient, because necessary adjustments to the valve in response to changes in pressure upstream of it would have to be unnecessarily fine. That would make control difficult.

In cross-examination, Dr. Robinson relied (Day 65, p.34)  on those arguments generally in support of his view that there should be a suction pressure controller limiting the inlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor to about 95 psia. He accepted that the changes in sealine pressure [and hence suction pressure] would be slow-moving (though large). Nevertheless, he considered that that did not affect the foregoing arguments.

The recycle valve cannot effectively control its upstream pressure if its downstream pressure is varying in an uncontrolled manner. 2. If a suction pressure controller is used and set at 142 psia, the recycle valve would have an insufficent range of opening to handle all contingencies. 3. If a suction pressure controller is used and set at 95 psia, the whole range of the valve is not used, and that is inefficient.</span>

Well, I do, my Lord, because effectively the sealine pressure changes slowly and the dynamics of PCV923 is a more dynamic situation where it is seeking to control pressures over a much shorter timeframe and the sealine pressure will change slowly and the demand by the gas turbine will also change slowly if there is a change in the sealine pressure.  So effectively this valve will be seeing a changing downstream pressure, that is on the sealine, but it is slow.  So as far as it is concerned it will control, in my view, quite adequately given such a slow movement in -- a relatively slow movement in the sealine pressure.  If I was expecting to see sealine pressures varying at the same sort of rate as this pressure control valve, the recycle valve, then I would concur with Dr Robinson but under these conditions we have a slow movement of sealine; we have an inventory there and therefore I see this as an acceptable system.</span>

In my judgment, Dr. Robinson’s view that having a suction pressure control valve set at 95 psia was the logical way to proceed is unjustified. According to his own criteria, the recycle valve in that case would be required to pass, when 90 per cent. open, 110 per cent. of the maximum flow required by the turbine even in the early years when the highest powers would be required of it. And it would be required to pass, when 10 per cent. open, 10 per cent. of the maximum flow required by the turbine in the later years. Those constraints would require of the recycle valve PV 923 a sensitivity in terms of incremental flow per incremental opening not far divergent from the implicit figure which he described as giving rise to gross inefficiency.</span>

Dr. Robinson considered that it would be grossly inefficient to have the required opening of the recycle valve limited to 52 per cent. when operating at 95 psia suction conditions. The maximum flow available from the fuel gas compressor at that inlet pressure was 39720 scf/hr. According to Dr. Robinson, that would have to be at least 110 per cent. of the relevant maximum requirement of the turbine. Thus the range of flows that valve PV 923 would have to handle over a range of 42 percentage points of opening would be 10/11 of 39720, or 36110 scf/hr.

(Dr. Robinson used the expression capacity in a different sense in paragraph 203 above). For any given setting of a given valve, it is a constant proportional to the ratio of the mass flow of gas through the valve divided by the square root of the product of the pressure difference across the valve and the density of the gas upstream of the valve. The wider open the recycle valve is, the greater the mass flow for any given pressure difference and upstream density. Thus Cv increases as the valve is opened. For a linear valve, Cv is proportional to the amount of opening. Those points are common ground. (In a document put to Mr. Sylvester-Evans in cross-examination the expression Cv, called the valve coefficient, was used as a constant for a valve. Its product with the flow characteristic of the valve, which was a function of the valve lift, was equivalent to the “capacity of the valve” Cv as used before me. I adhere to the latter usage).</span>

Those circumstances were the three conditions mentioned above in relation to which he calculated the flow of fuel required by the turbine and the flow available from the fuel gas compressor. In each case, he calculated the value of Cv for the minimum spillback, representing the case of maximum flow required by the turbine. Those values of Cv ranged between 435 for a fuel gas compressor inlet pressure of 125 psia to 2,225 for a fuel gas inlet pressure of 175 psia. In all cases, he assumed that the pressure upstream of the recycle valve was 233 psia. That implies that the gas upstream of the recycle valve was at the same density in all cases, and so the density could be ignored (as it was) for comparative calculations. I am satisfied that those figures are correct; nor were they controversial. The range represents a factor of about 5.</span>

The corresponding flow figures for the maximum requirement of the turbine and for the fuel gas compressor are mentioned in paragraphs 184 and 185 above. The respective differences represent the minimum recycle flows. The values of Cv are respectively 383 and 464. (If in the latter case one took the fuel gas compressor discharge pressure as 218.5 psia, as in the Reciprocating Compressor Data Sheet, the comparative value of Cv would be 504).

In his view, an equal percentage valve would be a reasonable approach for this application. An equal percentage valve is a valve where, over its range of operation, e.g. from 10 per cent. fully open to 80 per cent. fully open, the gas flow is an exponential function of the degree of opening (i.e. the degree of opening is a logarithmic function of the gas flow). That is, any given increment in opening will produce the same fractional increment in flow. For example, if the range of Cv of the valve is represents a factor of 50 from 10 per cent. open to 80 per cent. open, then for each increment of opening representing 10 per cent. of fully open, the value of Cv will increase by a factor of about 1.75. Mr. Sylvester-Evans made the position clear from a diagram that he drew. I am satisfied that my understanding of the equal percentage valve is at least substantially correct, notwithstanding some confusion in the oral evidence, possibly caused by a question of mine.</span>

The rated case for the equal percentage valve might be 59373 scf/hr at 70 per cent. open. But such a valve, if properly sized, would easily take 73170 scf/hr (the maximum flow of the fuel gas compressor at an inlet pressure of 175 psia) at 80 per cent. open. When the turbine was working, the flow through the valve would be at the low end of the range. In that case, for a given required change in Cv, the equal percentage valve would give a greater distance of valve travel (i.e. opening) than a linear valve working over the same range of Cv. I accept that evidence. A calculation of mine illustrates the position. Consider two valves, one of each type, both operating over a range of Cv representing a factor of 20. The linear valve operates from 10 per cent. open to 90 per cent. open. The equal percentage valve operates from 10 per cent. open to 70 per cent. open. To increase the Cv by a factor of 5 from the value of Cv when the valve is 10 per cent. open would require an increment of 16.8 per cent. in opening for the linear valve, and of 32.2 per cent. in opening for the equal percentage valve.</span>

That is a relatively smaller part of the overall flow. It is a small part of the region. Okay, it needs to also control at 100 per cent, or when it is on full root at [sic] recycle, if I may put it that way.

It is evident from the pleadings (see paragraph 133 above) that the fuel gas compressor was never needed, and that the fuel gas heater served in its place. There is no direct evidence why that was so. It is not for the court to speculate. Possibly the diminution in flow of Zechstein gas caused by the dedication of Zechstein wells to the fuel gas heater was permanently acceptable. But it is worth mentioning some evidence that may be relevant if that is not so. That evidence, which I consider in the following paragraphs, concerns the following propositions. 1. Shut-in wellhead pressures of Upper Bunter gas were substantially higher than those forecast by Phillips. 2. Average H line pressures may have increased so that lowest pressures did not fall below the minimum pressure (190 psig) required of the fuel gas. 3. If, contrary to 2, there continued to be fluctuations in H line pressure below 190 psig, the alpha compressor was available, if necessary, to draw and compress the Upper Bunter gas.</p>

The shut-in wellhead pressure for Upper Bunter well A1 in 1995 was shown as 174, which probably means 189 psia. For 1996, four of the Upper Bunter wellheads were shown as having shut-in wellhead pressures lying between 186 and 189 psi, which probably means between 201 and 204 psia.</p>

This claim is concerned with the HIPS in the main compressor system on platform 52/5A. The system consists of a device to measure pressure of the gas and firmly to cut off supply of the gas to the vulnerable parts of the equipment if the measured pressure exceeds a set limit. To increase reliability, the system operates in triplicate. That is, there are three separate devices to measure the pressure, and two of them registering excess pressure are sufficient to cut off the supply of gas. Thus the system works even if one of the devices fails. Moreover, one of the devices at a time can be removed for maintenance and testing to ensure reliability.

The HIPS was designed to guard the main compressor and the pipework and equipment upstream of it, in particular the suction knock-out drum, from overpressure arising from unintentional (“spurious”) closing of a valve in the sealine. If that were to happen, gas could back up from the Zechstein gas line to the main compressor and the pressure could build up fairly rapidly to the shut-in pressure of the Zechstein wells. That would greatly exceed the design pressure of the relevant pipework and equipment.

The HIPS would thus not be subjected to any surge in pressure from the Zechstein gas line, and would in consequence not operate. The compressor by-pass line would be subjected to overpressure. Moreover, valve XV 803 was not automatic. Although the procedure was for an operator to close that valve when the by-pass line was in use, the reliability of that procedure was insufficient for the exacting standards of safety required. Thus the whole of the compressor system, including the knock-out drum and the after-cooler, was insufficiently protected. (In fact, I am satisfied on the evidence of Mr. Sylvester-Evans that valve XV 803 was automatic).</span>

In that case, the compressor would be vented to the atmosphere. Thus the protection as designed was adequate. It was true that the protection had to be redesigned, but that was because of a change in operating philosophy adopted by Phillips. Phillips had decided that they did not want the compressor vented to atmosphere every time it was shut down.</span>

The claimants alleged that methane was unsuitable for starting the turbine, because it would not ignite reliably. The difficulties starting the turbine led the claimants to instal an alternative start-up system using bottled propane. This was originally a complaint that Snamprogetti should have enquired of the vendor of the turbine (European Gas Turbines: EGT) whether or not methane was a suitable start-up gas.</p>

No tests were performed using methane with the composition of Zechstein gas. (Zechstein gas contains some ethane and small quantities of higher hydrocarbons and other gases). The only start-up gas tested satisfactorily was propane. Notwithstanding that there had been no tests with methane, still less methane with the composition of Zechstein gas, Snamprogetti specified Zechstein gas as the start-up gas. Start-up was unsatisfactory. The problem was cured by using propane but at greater cost because the modifications did not take place until after the compressor had been installed on the platform.</span>

The contract required Snamprogetti “to review factory witnessed test procedure and specifications as prepared by respective Vendors” and to “verify the acceptability of the factory tests”. In performing those obligations Snamprogetti was “to observe and exercise the standards of skill, care and diligence adhered to by recognized first-class contractors performing work of a similar nature”. It is not in dispute that those were terms of the contract. It was argued that Snamprogetti were in breach of contract in not ensuring that the start-up of the machine was factory tested on methane, and that that breach of contract led to the propane start system being installed.</span>

Pressurized air and fuel gas mixed and ignited within each combustion chamber. The hot gases expanded and drove the turbine. Before the main fuel supply to each combustion chamber could open, there had first to be established, and proven, a pilot flame in each can. That was a safety feature designed to prevent the accumulation of an inflammable mixture within the casing and exhaust of the gas turbine. The starter gas was used to establish the pilot flame. Once the control system was satisfied that the pilot flame was proven the main fuel gas supplies were opened. Methane ignites readily, but propane more so since it has a lower ignition temperature.

They could not guarantee that the use of propane would be unnecessary if a flame detection system were used. They strongly recommended using the “inference flame detection” system, i.e. the thermo-couple system. It was fitted as standard to the EGT Rustronic panel offered as option 1.

The factory test of the start-up system incorporated in the design was not carried out because that system was not available at the material time. Both parties expected that further testing of the turbine would take place at AMEC’s fabrication yard. Mr. Thomson wrote a commissioning procedure which would implicitly, but inevitably, involve a test of the start-up system. Phillips decided to abandon such testing onshore, and to carry it out offshore. There is no evidence whether Phillips were aware of the fact that the factory testing had not included the start-up system as designed. There is no evidence whether Snamprogetti were aware of Phillips’s decision to abandon the onshore testing. Evidence on those two matters might have been available from Mr. Rayner, if he had been called as a witness. I am not satisfied that any breach of contract on the part of Snamprogetti in relation to this matter has been established. In particular, Snamprogetti were not under a duty to ensure that the machine was factory tested on methane. Their obligations to review the test procedure and to verify the acceptability of the tests did not include such a duty. </span>

It had to be stored in a manner that would ensure minimal deterioration during this period. It should have been designed for storage with a low corrosion gas locked within it. Nitrogen, the vendor’s preferred gas, was not available on the platform. Zechstein gas is sulphur free and was, therefore, the least corrosive gas available. This should have been used as the storage gas. Instead Snamprogetti proposed to use sour Upper Bunter gas for summertime storage. This is a corrosive gas and the design represented poor engineering.</p>

Snamprogetti proposed that during the summer shutdown the compression circuits be drained and purged with nitrogen and then kept with nitrogen in them at a pressure slightly above atmospheric. Phillips amended their claim accordingly, and alleged that the use of nitrogen in that way was not practical having regard to the excessive consumption of nitrogen and the need to replenish the system with nitrogen frequently. The amended claim went on to say that nitrogen was replaced both as a purge and as a storage gas by Zechstein gas. That necessitated pipework modifications offshore.</span>

It contained a recommendation that Snamprogetti should confirm how Zechstein gas could safely be used as a purge gas without the risk of overpressuring the machine.</span>

Snamprogetti had not, however, ascertained how much nitrogen would be required. It was not until that HAZOP was carried out that the proposal was made to purge the compressor with Zechstein gas.

It may have been to save nitrogen, coupled with the view that Zechstein gas was an unsuitable gas for storage. How much nitrogen it would save does not appear. Mr. Sylvester-Evans considered that Zechstein gas was unsuitable for storage since it contained water.

I have mentioned the recommendation of the HAZOP members that Snamprogetti should confirm how Zechstein gas could safely be used as a purge gas without the risk of overpressuring the compressor. They probably had in mind that the process used during commissioning did not avoid that risk. The new design involved taking the supply of Zechstein gas from the fuel gas compressor suction knock-out drum, and later from the fuel gas heater. That ensured that the pressure would not exceed the maximum permissible (250 psig on the inlet side of the compressor).</span>

I am not satisfied that that recommendation was made because it was thought that Snamprogetti’s design would require the use of excessive quantities of nitrogen. It may, for example, have been made because it was thought more convenient to purge the compressor with a direct supply of gas from a well rather than using bottled gas. The only thing shown to have been lacking from Snamprogetti’s design was a statement of the amount of nitrogen required.</span>

Automatic valves should have isolated the section of plant – in this case the main compressor - before any vent valves were opened. If the equipment is isolated from the well, venting will release only the gas in the article being vented. If the equipment is not isolated, venting creates a clear line of flow from the well to the atmosphere. All sequences should have been examined in detail during the design stage.  A final Hazop should have been conducted to finally assure safe operation. Properly conducted, these procedures would have ensured that wells could not vent to atmosphere.</p>

The incident in question occurred on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1996, during commissioning of the plant. Possibly as a result of erratic operation of the fuel gas recycle valve, the outlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor went outside the permitted limits. That caused the fuel gas compressor and the main compressor to trip. Upon tripping of the main compressor, the compressor circuit was automatically isolated from the wells and the blowdown valve XV 806 of the compressor circuit opened, as it should have done. That was to allow the gas in the compressor circuit to vent to atmosphere. The gas vented through valve XV 806. Valve XV 805 also opened. That valve was not isolated, and gas escaped directly from the Upper Bunter wells through that valve to atmosphere. The release of gas continued for about five minutes until the valve was closed manually.</p>

One was danger to helicopters in case the methane entered their engines. The other was the danger to persons on the platform of poisoning by hydrogen sulphide, which is heavier than air and could, it was said, have descended from the stack. I am satisfied that there was no danger. Mr. Sylvester-Evans gave detailed and convincing reasons why the escaping gas would rapidly be diluted by air and that the risk to persons would have been negligible. And the vent stack was designed to take excess gas blowing off directly from the wells. It can be seen from the drawings that near the wellheads there are relief valves. Those are valves that will blow off under excess pressure.</p>

It is said that two pipelines were incorrectly designed in that the drawings ought to have shown them as sloping, whereas the drawings gave no such indication. The lines were sub-headers for the vent systems. They were line number 1255 for the high pressure vent system and line number 1270 for the low pressure vent system. There is a general requirement to provide slopes for vent pipework to prevent the accumulation in the pipework of liquids, water and liquid hydrocarbons, which natural gas contains. Mr. Tomlinson accepted that there was an error in the design, and that it was not unreasonable to correct it. He was right to do so.</p>

Before the main compressor was introduced, water and liquid hydrocarbons from the Upper Bunter wells were collected in the contactors and removed from the gas stream. The water was sent to the sump tank and the liquid hydrocarbons were re-inserted into the gas stream at the ejector. A quantity of liquid hydrocarbons accompanied the water. Those hydrocarbons were separated out from the water in the sump tank and pumped back into the product gas header by means of the two sump pumps, described in the drawings as gasoline transfer pumps. (The product gas header was a 20-inch line into which Zechstein and Upper Bunter gas was discharged before passing into the H line).</span>

A distinction between the liquids predicted by the flash simulation and entrained liquids was implicit in much of the above questioning. Entrained liquids are liquids in the form of droplets that are carried along the pipework by the flowing gas. Where the speed of flow is low, such droplets tend to collect at the bottom of the vessel. Hence the use of knock-out drums to collect entrained liquids. The large cross-sectional area of the drum compared with that of the pipework reduces the speed of flow. Baffle plates can assist the process.</p>

But as I understand the evidence of Mr. Green and Mr. Tomlinson and the documents evidencing the simulation, it is a process of determining whether and if so to what extent water and identified hydrocarbons can exist in the liquid (as opposed to the gaseous) phase under certain thermodynamic conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) If, as Mr. Tomlinson’s evidence indicates is so in this case, the simulation shows that the hydrocarbons do not exist in the liquid state, that must surely imply that any such liquids formerly entrained as droplets must evaporate or have evaporated. Thus in that case, the simulation does tell you whether any liquid is entrained. The answer is none. If, on the other hand, the simulation shows that hydrocarbons exist in the liquid phase, it does not tell you whether they are entrained or collected at the bottom of a vessel, or partly one and partly the other. I accept Mr. Tomlinson’s evidence quoted above that if you cannot simulate that you have liquids present, then you would assume they could not be entrained.</p>

In the context it is clear that he was saying that it was Phillips who had told Snamprogetti that. That evidence was not challenged or contradicted, and I accept it. That information was incorrect. Removal of the internals from the contactors would prevent the extraction of the liquid hydrocarbons to the ejector and cause them to collect at the bottom of the contactors and pass to the sump. Thus Snamprogetti was unaware that the bulk of the liquid hydrocarbons had by-passed the sump and hence the pumps.

A Phillips handover note of November 1996 referred to problems relating to both gasoline transfer pumps which could not at that time be started or stopped from the control room. There was a handover note of about January 1997 which stated “<span style="font-style:italic">The production of gasoline is not that much of a problem</span> but should the water dump control fail (due to chamber waxing, sand or outlet to the sea blocking) the level in the water end will rise quickly, thus causing [high] level trip…..All of these problems should be resolved when the new sump tank is fitted during summer shut down”.

The following is clear from drawing FDD-84-MF-514. The pumps ran in parallel. They were operated by switches which were governed by the level of condensate in the sump tank. The smaller pump was switched on when the level of liquid reached 889 mm above datum. The larger pump was switched on when the level reached 1041 mm. Both pumps were switched off when the level fell to 381 mm. It is clear from the questions put to Mr. Tomlinson and his answers (Day 42, pp.116 to 119) that before the installation of the main compressor the smaller pump had been on more or less continuous duty, and the larger pump was there as an auxiliary for cases where the small pump had insufficient capacity or stopped working.</p>

Using the figure of 1.1 bbls/mmscf gives a flow of liquid hydrocarbons of 143 U.S. gallons per hour. Thus, with the pump logic described above, at that flow rate the smaller pump would be operating continuously and the larger pump would be running for more than half the time. However, even at that flow rate the system could cope with failure of the smaller pump, as it had been able to before the introduction of the main compressor. And at highest flow rates before then, the system could not cope with failure of the larger pump. The fact is that pump 67-1 was not a spare and never had been.</p>

Phillips used a standard figure of 1.1 bbls/mmscf for the concentration of liquid hydrocarbons in the gas from the Hewett field. Calculations showed an absence of liquid hydrocarbons under the suction conditions of the new main compressor. How reliable those calculations were does not appear. Mr. Tomlinson’s evidence that he did not know how much reliance Snamprogetti placed on the calculations suggests that not much reliance was placed on them. No doubt Snamprogetti relied on them to show that there was no reason to expect that the new main compressor would give rise to an increase in the concentration of liquid hydrocarbons in the flow of gas. Mr. Tomlinson referred to a reduction in gas flow (arising out of the depletion of the wells) but the compressor gave rise to an increase in flow over the immediately preceding values. Snamprogetti concluded that there was no reason to expect an increase in flow of liquid hydrocarbons. That conclusion itself has not been criticized.</p>

Snamprogetti made an error in failing to appreciate that not all of the liquid hydrocarbons that had previously been collected in the contactors had passed into the sump. In my judgment, Mr. Tomlinson was right to admit that error. It arose from a failure to read the relevant drawing with sufficient care. No doubt it was induced, at any rate in part, by incorrect information from Phillips. But in my judgment it amounted to a failure on the part of Snamprogetti to fulfil the duties it owed to Phillips under the contract.</p>

Following the Baker Jardine Hazop, Phillips decided to replace pump P-346 with a larger pump. If their standard figure of 1.1 bbls/mmscf, or anything like it, were applicable to the suction side of the main compressor, the demand on pump 67-1 would be increased by the introduction of that compressor. Thus the decision to replace pump P-346 with a larger pump which could take the whole flow if pump 67-1 failed would not have been unreasonable. But I am by no means persuaded that all engineers would, even in those circumstances, consider it necessary. I find that Snamprogetti’s failure to design for the replacement pump did not itself constitute a breach of duty. Moreover, I am by no means satisfied that the actual flow of liquid hydrocarbons experienced by Phillips after the introduction of the main compressor justified the installation of the new pump.</p>

The most that can be said is that if Snamprogetti had told Phillips that their standard of 1.1 bbls/mmscf implied a flow of 143 gallons of liquid hydrocarbons per hour, Phillips might have decided to replace pump P-346 before they actually so decided. If Snamprogetti had not made the mistake they did, it is possible that they would have told Phillips that. It is, indeed, a matter of elementary arithmetic following from gas flow figures of which Phillips were aware. In my judgment, Snamprogetti were under no duty to give the figure of 143 gallons an hour to Phillips.</p>

He said that Snamprogetti correctly piped the water to flow to the sump tank. The piping created a bottleneck, which was a design error and had to be corrected. There was back pressure on the line. In order to save time Phillips re-routed the wash line directly to sea. That allowed commissioning work on the turbine to continue. A Snamprogetti suggestion that the cause of the back pressure be identified and rectified rather than re-routing the drains was valid only when the project had no constraints of time. The investigation would stop all commissioning work on the gas turbine. The project did not allow time to investigate, when a simple solution was possible. Poor piping design was probably the sole cause of the back pressure. The routing of the piping from the turbine water wash was a very clear design error. The error had to be corrected. The water wash was re-routed to sea, as a matter of expedience. That was entirely reasonable in the circumstances.</p>

In that report, Dr. Robinson appears to have contradicted himself on whether the routing of the piping to the sump tank was a design error. (His reference to the routing of the piping must have been a reference to the directing of it to the sump tank rather than to sea or some other destination, not a reference to the route by which the line led to the sump tank, since no question of an alternative route from the turbine to the sump tank was raised). In his report of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2002 he quoted an expression showing that for a given rate of flow of a fluid in a pipeline the pressure drop per unit length of pipe was inversely proportional to the fifth power of the diameter of the pipe. Thus one metre of one-inch pipe would create approximately as much pressure drop as 32 metres of two-inch pipe. Bottlenecks would add a significant further pressure drop. He did not back up that evidence with any figures to show the practical effect in this case.</p>

As a matter of expediency and to resolve it quickly, Phillips put the line overboard. The other was that the bottleneck could not have been allowed to remain. It might have been the reason for the water wash problem, or it might not. He did not know. He did not know what was the cause of back pressure on the line. In a way, the water wash was a red herring which alerted people to the fact that there was a problem, namely the bottleneck, which he did not think anybody would have allowed to exist.</p>

He said that it was poor engineering practice at best. Doubtless he would have said the same or something similar if the two-inch to one-inch bottleneck has been put to him.

They were thereby in breach of contract. I am satisfied that that breach did not adversely affect the drainage of the turbine wash water. I cannot accept that nobody would have allowed the bottleneck to exist. There was a pre-existing bottleneck which Phillips had allowed to exist. Assuming that the pleading represents Phillips’s state of mind, Phillips appear to have removed the bottleneck under the misapprehension that it caused the problem with the drainage. The bottleneck was a red herring, to adopt the language of Dr. Robinson. Given that Phillips were evidently content to have another bottleneck in a drainage system, I am not satisfied that they would have wished to remove this one if they had appreciated the true position. No other reason has been put forward why Phillips should pick on this bottleneck for removal. It would be an arbitrary choice, and if so then in my judgment baseless and unreasonable. If Phillips had not in fact removed the bottleneck, they could not have recovered more than nominal damages for the breach plus possibly any fee paid for the relevant engineering. Phillips have failed to prove the case that they pleaded, and in my judgment are entitled to no more than such damages for this item.</p>

Gas was used to provide a dry seal which prevented the loss of process gas along the shaft of the machine and out to the atmosphere. The gas used for sealing was itself process gas which was bled off from the discharge from the compressor. At that point it was warm and at high pressure. It was piped through heat-insulated pipework to a coalescer and then upwards through more insulated pipework to the seals. The coalescer contained filters designed to remove any solid particles and droplets of liquids. Any water entrained with the sour Upper Bunter seal gas would have been particularly corrosive and possibly damaging to the seals, though they were made of stainless steel. The presence of solid particles and water would have reduced the operational life of the seals. The seals were expensive items. They cost about £80,000.</p>

They are world leaders in the design of compressors and have wide experience of operating in the North Sea. In Delaval Stork’s [drawing], they did not specify heat tracing on the gas lines but they did specify insulation (to be installed by others) for the gas lines, which is normal practice. Delaval Stork only specified heat tracing on the filter drains. The dry gas seals are specialist technology and it is normal practice for a designer in Snamprogetti’s position to rely on the specialist advice of the vendor of such technology.</p>

The cost of heat tracing, when carried out at the correct time, is small, probably of the order of tens of pounds. The cost of replacing the compressor seals is several tens of thousands of pounds. Loss of production also needs to be considered. The provision of heat tracing would have given a greater certainty that the seal gas was dry and hence less corrosive. It was a balance of expenditure of a few tens of pounds against the possibility of a loss of £80,000. The failure to provide heat tracing was a design error. The work, in relation to this item, was not that of a first-class engineering contractor. (Dr. Robinson’s first report, paragraphs 21.2 to 21.4; Day 61, p.97).</p>

In assessing that balance, a first-class engineer is entitled, in my judgment, to take into account the relevant experience of the specialist supplier. Mr. Thomson’s recall of his thought processes was incomplete (see Day 37, p.129), and it may be that he simply relied on the specialist supplier without himself assessing the balance.

It has not been suggested that in the absence of the heat sealing the risk of having to replace a seal (let alone of losing production of gas in consequence) is a substantial risk, nor, I think, could it have been. The claimants have not suggested that such expenditure could have been justified at the time of design. It follows that it could not be justified later.

On the suction side of the main compressor, there were two valves in parallel, a large valve XV 803 and a small valve XV 802. When the compressor was to be started up, the compressor system was first pressurized. That was done by opening valve XV 802, whilst XV 803 remained closed. When the compressor started up, it was necessary to open valve XV 803. Owing to a mistake in the logic, it was not possible to open valve XV 803. To correct the logic, it was necessary to insert upstream of valve XV 803 a pressure transmitter to provide automatic control of three flow control valves FV 944, 945 and 946 on the contactors, upstream.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.50in">The main compressor anti-surge controller is based upon the mass flow of gas through the compressor and the difference between suction and discharge pressures of the compressor. There was no means of measuring the actual suction and discharge pressures in order to calculate both the mass [sc., mass flow] and the pressure difference. This is discussed under item 3.2.3 of the Baker Jardine Hazop.…. The necessary solution…..was to replace a differential pressure transmitter with two new pressure transmitters, one in the suction and one in the discharge of the compressor.</p>

It is reflected in an amendment to paragraph 48.10 of the particulars of claim which does nothing to allay the confusion. There was an instrument for measuring the difference in pressure between the inlet and the outlet of the compressor, and there was a flow meter on the inlet side. If Dr. Robinson had not found fault with the flow meter, he would not have made this criticism of Snamprogetti. But the flow meter, said Dr. Robinson, would not work properly unless the pressure of the gas at its location was also measured. The flow meter did not measure that pressure. And the instrument that measured the pressure difference across the compressor could not be used for the purpose, since it did not measure either the inlet or the outlet pressure individually.</p>

In order to know the flow rate through an orifice plate, whether the volume flow rate or the mass flow rate, the pressure drop across the plate and the density of the gas must be determined. I am satisfied of those facts. There is apt to be confusion between the pressure difference across the orifice plate, necessary to measure the flow accurately, and the pressure difference across the compressor.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.51in">The most significant variable on which density depends is pressure. Pressure needs to be measured in order to calculate the density. A fluid density at a mid range condition of specified pressure would normally be set within the electronics performing the flow calculation. Pressure would then be measured to determine the density at any other pressure condition. That is the situation that should have been designed by Snamprogetti for the anti-surge controller.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.51in">The pressure at the inlet to the main compressor can vary from around 30 psia to around 120 psia, when the surge controller needs to be brought into action. That is a pressure range of 4, and hence a density range of 4. If density [sic; or pressure] were not measured, the only alternative is use of a constant fixed density to cover the range of conditions. The density at 60 psia might be chosen. This pressure is twice the minimum and half the maximum. Since flow depends on the square root of the density, the use of this average density could be in error by up to 40 per cent. Because <span style="font-family:Symbol"></span>2 equals 1.4, the measured flow [sc., mass flow] at 30 psia would be 1.4 times the true flow. No pipeline operator would accept information on flow rate, which is available to its plant operators and is used in plant control, that may be in error by up to 40 per cent.</p>

But I am satisfied that he had a sufficient understanding of the relevant thermodynamical considerations. He explained that the original design of Snamprogetti had provided three inputs of information for the device: the pressure drop across the flow meter, or flow transmitter FT 820; the pressure difference across the main compressor, given by the pressure difference transmitter PDT 853; and the setting of the speed controller of the main compressor. I would add that since the device governed the operation of the main compressor recycle valve FV 820, the setting of that valve must have constituted information available to the device. Whether it used that information does not appear. Mr. Sylvester-Evans explained that the device used the ratio between the pressure drop across FT 820 and the pressure difference across the main compressor to calculate how close the compressor was to the surge condition. If the compressor was too close to the surge condition, the device caused the flow through the recycle line to be increased. The device contained some algorithm to make that happen. It is true that its calculation was not precise, but the device would have been adjusted during commissioning to give satisfactory results.</span>

This is what he does (indicating).  And to gain a more accurate knowledge of pressure which includes another parameter that must be inputted -- and therefore the golden rule is to keep the safety systems as simple as possible and not complex, although you may say, “It is only another pressure measurement”, but it is one extra parameter that could go wrong.</span>

That is a blowdown valve upstream of the fuel gas compressor suction knock-out drum. The recommendation was that the downstream valve V-832 should be locked open and “FO-896” should be shown as “RO”. Then in heavy type there followed the recommendation “Both these changes to be general for all valves downstream of blowdown valves and restriction orifices”. The effect of the recommendation was twofold: first, that all valves downstream of blowdown valves should be locked open; and second, that all restriction orifices should be labelled “RO”.</p>

The purpose of installing restriction orifices downstream of the blowdown valves was to restrict the flow rate of gas entering the vent header so that the vent system would not be over-pressurized by an excessive flow. The restriction orifice is simply an orifice plate installed in the pipework. The orifice plate is a metal disc with a central hole, the flow requirements determining the diameter of the central hole. A flow orifice is essentially an identical device. It consists of an orifice plate with small tappings upstream and downstream of it to allow the differential pressure across the orifice to be measured. The orifice plate for the flow orifice is normally of a thinner construction than that for the restriction orifice.</span>

Such an instruction is not correct if all orifices are tagged identically. The standards for flow orifices are not identical with those for restriction orifices. Furthermore flow orifices can be removed if measurement is no longer required. Removal of a restriction orifice would overload the vent system and produce a dangerous situation. Incorrect labelling could lead to improper removal.</p>

If that valve should leak, gas pressure would build up behind the blind flange. At the Baker Jardine Hazop it was recommended (node 2.1.2) that a pressure gauge be fitted to the blind flange.

The conditions that should have been reached downstream of the suction pressure controller were about 80 psig.  That would have been the intent of the suction pressure controller, to keep the pressure around that figure.  The HIPS detectors were set at 240.  Now, the reduction in the pressure would, in my view, have given a good opportunity for a look at putting a safety margin on those figures now.  It would not have been a major item of work.  It would have been a software position in terms of changing the settings but it would have been much better to set those HIPS detectors much lower to give you a safety margin because that would have much improved their efficiency of operation to do that, but it would not have been a major issue.</span>

Dr. Robinson explained (Day 60, p.78 and first report, paragraph 13.11) that the pressure detectors had valves in the lines to them which needed little locks to keep them locked open, because you must not be able to shut off the pressure to those HIPS detectors, otherwise they become inoperable.

During commissioning, it was found that when the turbine was started the outlet pressure of the fuel gas compressor fell by about 50 psi, causing the system to trip. Dr. Robinson attributed that, correctly in my judgment, to an excessive ratio between the volume of gas downstream of valve XV 924 and the volume of gas between the discharge of the fuel gas compressor and that valve. The principal volume in the latter section was that of the fuel gas receiver. Dr. Robinson said that it should have been about twice as large as it was.

Unfortunately for reasons of needing to be able to remove access panels and things on the side of the turbine, the piping department ultimately routed the fuel gas line from the fuel gas compressor, down one side of the gas turbine, right to the far end of the exhaust, back round the back of the exhaust and back up to about two thirds up the other side.

A document emanating from Phillips dated 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1996 giving justification and premises for an authorization for expenditure on a power generation upgrade on platform 52/5A states the following. The power generation equipment consisted of two gas turbine generator sets rated at 300 kW each and one diesel generator set rated at 100 kW. The performance of the gas turbine generators had deteriorated. Their present output was 260 kW. The estimated platform load during normal [main] compressor operation was 253 kW. If two generators were to be run together, they would have to be kept synchronized. That could not be done without manned attendance on the platform.</p>

Phillips’s pleading was amended. By re-amendment, it was pleaded as follows. The claimant decided to instal a fuel gas heater because it was unlikely that works to remedy vibration problems or other remedial works for the fuel gas compressor system could be completed before the end of October 1996, if at all. The fuel gas compressor was eventually abandoned and the heater used in its place. The claimant did not see fit to incur further cost and effort in attempting to resolve the vibration problems.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">425. In that the fuel gas compressor was never used, the expenditure on it was indeed wasted. But it is in issue whether the fuel gas heater was installed because of problems with the fuel gas compressor. Mr. King gave the following evidence about that in his first witness statement in a section beginning at paragraph 15. He first became involved with the work on platform 52/5A in early January 1996 on his appointment as Manager, Southern Area Projects. Given the need for simplicity and reliability, he was surprised that it had been felt necessary to use a fuel gas compressor, because the Zechstein wells appeared to provide the potential to supply fuel gas at an adequate pressure for the foreseeable future. I comment that even in January 1996 the possibility (to put it at its lowest) that the fuel gas compressor might turn out to be unnecessary was in the mind of Phillips. Its views on the subject may have been developing since 1994 (see the extract from the minutes of a meeting held on 23</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> February (see paragraph 76 above). Mr. King went on to say that he requested Mr. Mobbs to commission a vibration survey by Acoustic Technology Limited to establish in more detail the magnitude and extent of the vibrations affecting the structure and equipment. Mr. Mobbs sent him a memorandum dated 28</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> February 1996 stating that the vibration was not severe. Mr. King was aware that others disagreed, and his own subsequent experience on the platform showed that Mr. Mobbs’s assessment was wrong. By mid-March, no consideration had been given by himself or by the Phillips team to the elimination of the fuel gas compressor as no reason had arisen to doubt its effectiveness from a process standpoint. He regarded the vibration problem as very serious and knew that it had to be resolved before the system could be handed over to Operations. But he felt confident that subject to resolving the vibration problems commissioning could begin in earnest. Mr. King went on to mention the problems of starting the turbine and tripping of the fuel gas compressor. On 18</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> April 1996 he was expecting a planned attempt to be made to run the main compressor to export sour gas to Bacton for the first time.

At that stage, he felt that there was a need to understand what had happened. He recommended that a design audit be carried out. He wrote to Snamprogetti’s managing director on 23</span>

However, there is a risk that the vibration problems with the fuel gas compressor will prove so difficult to rectify that a major fix such as purchasing another fuel gas compressor may be required. Should this be the case, the use of high pressure Zechstein production for fuel gas would be a short term solution while the fuel gas compressor problems are solved.</p>

There is a risk that after all of the problems identified in the HAZOP and the offshore survey are corrected, the fuel gas compressor will still not be usable because of excessive vibration. The fallback position discussed earlier was to add an electrical fuel gas heater and to use the high pressure Zechstein gas for fuel gas until the compressor problems could be solved. Our impression after the offshore survey is that addition of a fuel gas heater would be difficult and would require almost immediate action in order to have it available in time for the fall start-up. As we agreed to-day, the option of using fuel gas without any superheat should be pursued as the primary option for meeting the 1 Oct. start-up unless someone can demonstrate a reason this is not feasible. This option should be approached from the point of view of what we can do to make it work, and what is the potential damage to the turbine if some [sic] there are some liquid droplets in the fuel gas.</p>

There are a number of those, there was the power which we submit on all the evidence was clearly a problem and something they were looking at specifically, trying to get information and your Lordship has simply not been provided with all the information on that, your Lordship has not been provided with the survey of the power and so on.  There was also the problem of the reservoir management where it is clear from the documentary evidence, and indeed from Mr Halliwell's evidence, that in 1995 they had made assumptions which they should not have made, they had not looked at the basis of design and they had been predicting matters without looking at the truth.</span>

It is now clear that Phillips’s offshore personnel had a different approach to the operation of the offshore platform than the approach that was taken by the onshore personnel (and the project team dealing with the Snamprogetti contract, that is Rayner and Thurgood). The offshore personnel’s difference in approach had the effect that a different approach to the operation of the offshore platform only became apparent in May 1996 and not during the detailed design stage in 1994 and 1995…..Phillips’s requirements (as communicated in the contract HAZOP studies) to blow down gas in all shutdowns…..was contrary to Snamprogetti’s recommendation, but Phillips’s personnel required this procedure because they stated that it was their practice.</p>

Such proportion of their pay as was referable to the remedial works resulting from breaches of duty on the part of Snamprogetti is to be reflected in the damages, since that would not otherwise have been paid to them. But Mr. McMaster submitted that Phillips were entitled to recover a proportionate part of the pay of Phillips’s permanent employees who were engaged on the relevant work. He argued that they would have been working productively on something else if they had not been working on this project. It would be wholly unrealistic to assume that no additional managerial time was expended. There were accurate records to show what that management time was.

But there is a second reason, namely that the costs of Seafox were not incurred, and could not justifiably have been incurred, in consequence of the breaches of duty that I have found to have existed. They were incurred principally because of the vibration and the desire to have a fuel gas heater installed and commissioned by the end of October 1996.</span>

(That figure was further reduced in Mr. McMaster’s final submissions to £14,039 “in the light of certain aspects of Mr. Charters’s and Mr. Farrow’s evidence which Phillips accepts slightly change what it is able to recover”). But Mr. Farrow retained his retro-fit credit method of assessing the loss. And his retro-fit credit did not include overheads.

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.51in">In Mr. Charters’s analysis, the 40 per cent. figure comprises a reduction in the ‘HAZOP nodes’ direct hours together with the portion of the attendant indirect, non-productive and head office elements as well. Having considered the case, I do not think it reasonable to credit the attendant costs. This is because had the retro-fit been carried out onshore, during the Amec contract (i.e. had the work originally been designed as per the modified design and carried out by Amec onshore), there would have been little change in the overall attendant costs on the project. On the other hand, in the offshore remedial situation, Phillips had to remobilise the entire project set-up and these related costs are new costs. Consequently, I consider a more reasonable calculation is to take <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> the direct hours associated with the relevant item and credit an element of these. In this case, no attendant costs are credited.</p>

I now understand, however, that some of the works would have had to be carried out <span style="font-style:italic">offshore</span> in any event, with a consequent higher cost. In these cases, however, I consider that it is still only appropriate to credit the direct labour hours/costs rather than including the attendant hours/costs for the reasons set out in paragraph 1.2.6 of my first supplemental report.</p>

The burden of Mr. Farrow’s argument, to put it shortly, was that the marginal cost that would have been incurred if Snamprogetti’s contract had been performed is represented by the direct labour hours and does not carry any overheads. But by the same token, the marginal cost of carrying out those items of the remedial works that I have found to be due to breach of duty on the part of Snamprogetti would carry little or no overheads, since those works, too, are a small part of the whole remedial works. Mr. Farrow seems to have had in mind that Snamprogetti were liable for the whole, or substantially the whole, of the remedial works. At any rate on the facts as I have found them, his argument is seriously flawed. He himself expressed the view in the passage quoted above that it was a question of the extent of the works.</span>

Mr. Morell and Mr. Abernethy, who had checked KYE’s timesheets and job cards for the purpose of allocating the KYE work to the various HAZOP nodes, were unable to identify the work in relation to 5451.50 hours. Mr. Farrow spread those hours, which he called “All HAZOP” hours, across all the HAZOP nodes pro rata to the number of hours found to have been spent on each HAZOP node. Thus hours for unidentified work were included in the claim as formulated by Mr. Farrow. Since Snamprogetti’s  liability for each of the HAZOP items was in issue, and also because not all of the all-HAZOP hours were necessarily spent on any of the HAZOP nodes, I find that to be an unhelpful method of costing the work for the purpose of assessing damages. The effect of adding in the all HAZOP hours is, on its own, sufficient to add more than 50 per cent. to the number of hours attributed to each HAZOP node.</p>

And in his second supplemental report, Mr. Charters was able to allocate some of the all-HAZOP hours to HAZOP nodes; the rest he excluded from his costings of the remedial work. I use Mr. Charters’s second supplemental report, as amended, as the starting-point for my assessment of the damages.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">478. Mr. Charters considered that nine persons who worked at Woking would have been employed there in any event and did not represent an additional cost. I accept the evidence of Mr. King, however, that eight of them (the exception being Mr. Viganego) were agency personnel. Mr. King said that Phillips would not have required those agency personnel but for the need to carry out the remedial work. They were an additional cost which arose from the need to carry out the remedial work. Whilst Mr. King’s evidence on the point is not particularly clear, Mr. King may have been intending to convey the information that all the agency fees claimed were incurred in relation to remedial work. Mr. Charters, however, considered that that was not so. He had checked, or spot-checked, the time sheets. He reached two conclusions, expressed in his supplemental report dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2002, paragraphs 2.18 and 2.19. The first conclusion was that work to the value of £33,170.70 had been carried out after 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1996 through to May 1997. He considered that apart from the cost of finalizing paperwork, that work could not be linked to any default on the part of Snamprogetti. He had in mind, of course, all the alleged defaults. I reject that conclusion. Mr. Charters’s second conclusion was that the claim for management expenses was a global claim in the sense that it related to all the work done on the platform at the material time, not simply the remedial work. I accept Mr. Charters’s second conclusion. In his second supplemental report, dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002, Mr. Charters expressed the view at paragraph 2.165 that it was reasonable to assume that time related charges such as Phillips’s management were directly related to the labour resources employed. By way of amendment dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002 to paragraph 2.165 of his second supplemental report, he resiled from that view on the ground that Phillips had made no attempt to identify what management time was devoted to any specific breach of contract. In spite of that, I think it right to allow the variable management costs (i.e., those of the agents) pro rata to the KYE direct hours worked. On the evidence of Mr. King, I find that all the expenses mentioned above against the word “Offshore” were agency fees.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">482. There is a claim, originally in the sum of £104,958, in relation to Grootcon. Grootcon were contractors used by Phillips at Bacton for maintenance services. Grootcon supplied, in shifts, for work on the 52/5A platform, two crane drivers, an electrical technician and an instrumentation technician. The crane drivers also acted as labourers and watchmen. The electrical technician was present on the platform to act as a responsible person to issue permits for work, to deal with isolation work and any interface with the platform equipment. The instrumentation technician did similar work in relation to work carried out on the instruments. On the evidence of Mr. Abernethy, all of them were required for the remedial works. Since much of the expenditure was incurred after 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1996, after the fuel gas heater was operating, Mr. Charters considered that that expenditure was probably for work for Bacton or was a continuation of the power generation upgrade. He also considered that some of it was for supervision not related to the remedial work, since KYE had their own supervision. On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2002, in his first supplemental report, Mr. Farrow stated that Phillips had now located more invoicing records, and in consequence he reduced his valuation of the amount of the Grootcon claim to £88,978. I am satisfied on the evidence contained in Mr. Farrow’s third supplemental report, dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002, that the claim is well documented. Mr. Charters’s supposition is not borne out. I assess this claim in the amount of £88,978.</p>

I was involved in making sure that Mark was involved in the project, that he could go offshore and for co-ordinating between him and the offshore team.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">485. Restbury was a vendor of equipment used in the remedial works. Mr. Charters said that Antech was partly for Seafox (£1,612) and partly for commissioning (£8,524). In his final submissions Mr. McMaster said that in so far as that was correct, then it should not be excluded from the claim but would only be recoverable (in full) in the event that Seafox costs were recoverable. Mr. McMaster evidently had no instructions whether Mr. Charters was correct about Antech. I am satisfied that he was. The commissioning was not complete when the Baker Jardine HAZOP was held. Mr. Abernethy’s evidence does not go so far as to say that any extra money was paid to Antech on account of the remedial work. The totality of the evidence on this point is insufficient to establish whether any of the money, other than £1,612, was spent on the remedial works. The claim for £1,612 falls with the Seafox claim, and I reject the whole claim in respect of Antech.</p>

Mr. Farrow was able to say in his supplemental report that Phillips had now identified an invoice for Messrs. OTS in the sum of £2,360.67. It thus appears that this money was paid to an independent contractor for work relating to the remedial works. It is thus properly included in the claim under this head.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">490. I accept a conclusion of Mr. Charters, based on the evidence, that setting up the job was required for the whole of the work on the platform. That included the power generation upgrade, Bacton and AMEC. (“Bacton” refers to non-remedial work carried out by KYE for Phillips. AMEC refers to outstanding work not completed by AMEC when work was stopped by Mr. King). I accept that the relevant number of hours was 639. Mr. Charters allocated that number of hours to the remedial work in proportion to the numbers of offshore hours allocated to the remedial work and the non-claimed work. The numbers of those hours were respectively 30,158 and 19,542, totalling 49,700 hours. The respective proportions are 61 per cent. and 39 per cent. Before making his amendments to the second supplemental report, Mr. Charters had arrived at figures of 12,604 and 20,688 hours for the remedial work and non-claimed work respectively. Those figures lead to the respective percentages of 62 and 38, which Mr. Charters did not amend. Since this is not an exact science, the discrepancy is unimportant. He arrived at figures of 396 and 243 hours for the allocation of temporary supplies between claimed work and non-claimed work respectively.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">492. Mr. Charters explained that ‘Operations’ was a department of Phillips that was working on the platform dealing with the power generation upgrade (among other things) and whenever the platform was producing gas. It is clear on the evidence of Mr. Abernethy (Day 26, p.158) and of Mr. Morrell (Day 28, p.122) that the category of Assist Operations could include power generation upgrade and other work falling outside the remedial work. 1486 hours out of 1638 hours claimed against Snamprogetti under this heading related to the period October to December 1996. Of those 1486 hours, 565 hours were direct hours included in all-HAZOPS, and 921 hours were indirect hours. Mr. Charters allocated those 1486 hours to non-claimed work, removing them from the all-HAZOPS and indirect categories, stating that those incurred in the period from late October to December 1996 were “clearly not connected with the HAZOP node remedial work”. Mr. McMaster submitted that there was no reason to re-allocate any of those hours. Mr. Charters may have gone too far in saying that the hours were clearly not connected with the HAZOP node remedial work. But it is by no means clear that they were connected with that work, and in my judgment he rightly removed them into the non-claimed category. Phillips’s case that those hours ought to be charged to the remedial work, let alone that they ought to be charged to Snamprogetti, is not made out.</p>

He considered that the cost of commissioning work outstanding when work was suspended in April 1996 should be removed from the claim. That principle is not in issue, but the amount is in issue. On the basis of evidence contained in Mr. Morrell’s second witness statement, dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2002, Mr. Charters assumed that operations and vendor assistance would be required for two men for seven days (196 hours).

I was onshore construction supervisor when the works were suspended on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1996 and I have reviewed the database in relation to the hours expended to carry out work not done in April 1996. 148 hours of work was carried out by KYE in doing work which should have been done by AMEC but was not done because the works were suspended following the gas release. This work involved the grating at the north end of the cellar deck, modifications to the control room door, and replacing and calibrating 3 pressure indicators. All of this work has been excluded from the amounts being claimed from Snamprogetti as set out in the database as it does not relate to remedial work. AMEC did not provide any materials during this period. In relation to commissioning, the only work outstanding when the works were suspended on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1996 were minor tweaking works and the seven day run. As I was the onshore construction supervisor at this time I was fully aware of the work which had to be done. Phillips’s intention was to complete the commissioning work by the end of April 1996 and the only matters left to do were minor tweaking works and the seven day run. The seven day run is the final item of commissioning work. It is a reliability test and the resources required for this, over and above the operations team, would be two vendor representatives who would stay on the platform for around three of the seven days, subject to how the run went.</p>

He added that earth bosses were not in normal practice fitted for future general use of any facility but were items for a discrete purpose. As to the last proposition, I am not aware that it was in evidence. But if it is true, Phillips could have adduced evidence showing the purposes of the earth bosses. In the absence of such evidence, I am not prepared to draw an inference, from their location, that they related to the remedial works. Even if Mr. Charters’s assumption was wrong, there remains his opinion that the installation of the bosses did not seem to be linked to the HAZOP work, from which he made his assumption. Phillips have failed to prove their case on this point. In my judgment, Mr. Charters was right to remove the 31 hours in question from the all-HAZOPS category.</p>

His reason was that the work did not seem to be linked to the Baker Jardine HAZOP report, and presumably would have been necessary in any event due to the power generation upgrade.</p>

Mr. McMaster submitted that Mr. Charters was wrong to assume that the testing of the opened junction boxes was necessitated by the power generation upgrade.  He drew my attention to a wiring diagram index sheet that had been prepared by Snamprogetti for the compression project which listed the destinations of the cables running from the various relevant junction boxes. Those destinations were HIPS, emergency shutdown and marshalling cabinet. Mr. McMaster submitted that the work had obviously nothing to do with power generation upgrade and everything to do with the HAZOP works.</p>

That, I think, is some slight evidence supporting Mr. McMaster’s submission. On the other hand, the source or sources of the electrical power coming into the junction boxes was not stated. I reject the submission that the work had obviously nothing to do with the power generation upgrade. It may well have had something to do with it. It may well have been part of the remedial work. This is a matter on which Phillips could, I assume, have adduced clear evidence. They have failed to do so. In my judgment, Mr. Charters was right to remove the 15 hours in question from the all-HAZOPS category and place it into Bacton.</p>

It was possible that it was for the power generation upgrade because it seemed to him that that work would require scaffolding but Grootcon (who carried it out) did not have any scaffolding facilities. In view of the doubt, he said, he transferred the 313½ [sic] direct hours from all-HAZOPS to non-claimed work. </p>

Mr. Charters expressed his view that the figures adduced by Phillips as the direct labour costs of KYE were too great in that they made insufficient allowance for the travelling time of members of the labour force to and from the platform at each end of a work period. The mobilization allocation varied between 1 and 12 hours, and averaged 1.18 hours. Mr. Abernethy gave evidence that perhaps 2 or 2.5 hours per man were lost when the crew changed. I accept that evidence. Mr. Charters used a figure of 2.25 hours, and reached the conclusion that the time for mobilization plus demobilization had been under-estimated by 558 hours. I accept his calculation and conclusion. He then deducted a total of 588 direct hours (in error for 558) pro rata from the figures of direct hours for each item as adjusted by him. The effect of the error is negligible, and the indeed the effect of the whole adjustment is small.</span>

If a purchase order is spread against two nodes and it is impossible to tell what individual item relates to which node, we have apportioned this by taking the percentage of the direct hours and applying this apportionment to the amount of the purchase order in the same percentage.

Materials that were identified as relating to AMEC, Bacton or Seafox works were so classified. As to the rest of the materials, the process can be described as being in three stages. First, those materials that could be identified as applying to a particular HAZOP node were allocated to that node. Second, of the remainder, those that could be identified by the discipline within which they would have been used, e.g. electrical, mechanical, instruments, scaffolding, were apportioned in each case across those HAZOP nodes that had involved the relevant discipline in proportion to the numbers of hours that had been spent on the relevant discipline in those nodes. Finally, the balance of the material costs was apportioned to the HAZOP nodes proportionately to the direct hours allocated to those nodes. AMEC and Bacton materials were not included in the claim.</p>

He pointed out that an apportionment of £6,534 to summer storage (HAZOP node 3.2.13) should have been reduced to £691 when a correction in the number of hours of direct labour attributable to that node was made. The error was a large one: 1,225 hours had been taken, whereas the corrected figure was 130 hours. An amendment to the particulars of claim which corrected the number of hours did not amend the material costs claimed for that node. Mr. Charters concluded that that showed that Phillips’s method of apportionment was unreliable. I reject that conclusion. The failure to make the appropriate amendment to the material costs claimed was inadvertent. </p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">534. Mr. Charters carefully considered a major purchase of materials under purchase order 29620 in the sum of £38,986. The whole of that sum had been allocated to specific nodes in Rev6last, most of it to node 2.3.11. Mr. Charters divided the amount in accordance with the destined location of the materials as shown on the drawings and job cards. The main practical difference between his approach and Phillips’s is that he divided the amount attributed to node 2.3.11 between the fuel gas heater and the fuel gas compressor. Whilst I accept that division, since it is convenient, I am not satisfied that Mr. Charters’s allocation is otherwise an improvement on Phillips’s original. The differences between the two sets of figures are comparatively small. I should, if necessary, apportion all costs directly allocated to node 2.3.11 in Rev6last between that node and the fuel gas heater in proportion to the numbers of KYE direct offshore man-hours respectively attributable to those items. But since I find that the claim in respect of both of those items fails, it is unnecessary for me to do so.</p>

One was for a Tangye pump in the sum of £3,573, on the ground that there were no supporting invoices. The other was supplies from GY Fire and How Fire, amounting to £4,562, since the relevant HAZOP node had not been pursued as a ground of claim against Snamprogetti. The latter deletion is common ground. As to the former, Mr. McMaster referred me to a purchase order number 29872 together with invoices adding up to slightly more than £3,573. Mr. Charters was not cross-examined about this matter, but I find that he must have been mistaken in removing this item.</p>

Mr. Charters gave evidence about that in his second supplemental report (p.223, paragraphs 2.111 and 2.112) and in evidence in chief (Day 84, p.110). It is clear from schedule 7 to his report that he had looked at the vouchers in detail. He concluded, and I accept, that the total sum should have been £22,508. Of that sum, £6,875 was for insulation materials and not for scaffolding. I accept his evidence that the time allocated to insulation was 341 hours for the fuel gas heater and 190 hours for miscellaneous pipework, and that the cost of the insulation materials should be allocated in the same proportion. Accordingly, I allocate £4,415 to Bacton and £2,460 to the fuel gas heater.</p>

He re-allocated that sum to AMEC. He also arbitrarily re-allocated the remainder of the hire charges. Mr. McMaster accepted that half the hire charges should be disallowed. The hire charges were £15,633, of which I disallow one-half, say £7,800. I do not accept that the hire charges should be re-allocated. The result is that I allow £7833 out of the sum of £23,730.40, and thus deduct £15,897.40 from the claim.</p>

A higher figure was given by Mr. Farrow for sole use helicopters, however. Mr. Charters said, and I accept, that that higher figure was subsumed within the average of £1,190. Mr. Charters initially stated that the average number of passengers per flight established from the helicopter manifests was 9.5. Mr. Farrow took a sample of the helicopter manifests and worked out an average of five based on the sample (Day 83, p.81). On making another check for the entire month of September 1996 he arrived at an average of 5.7 (Day 83, p.85). In a set of calculations that he prepared overnight during his cross-examination, in answer to a question that had been put to him, Mr. Charters produced a table of dedicated flights from July to October 1996 that showed the average number of passengers per flight as 7.92. He produced that set of calculations at the end of his cross-examination, and was not questioned about them. Mr. McMaster submitted that the true average was 6.2 or 6.4.</p>

Mr. Farrow agreed with that calculation save for the average number of passengers per journey (Day 83, p.89). The calculated cost of £1,190 an hour included the cost of a standing charge which was charged whether or not the helicopter was used. In the further calculation that he produced at the end of his cross-examination, Mr. Charters deducted that standing charge on the basis that it was the marginal cost of the journeys that was relevant. Applying an average of 8 passengers per helicopter journey, he arrived at a new cost per passenger journey of £34.49.

Of those, 755 were for personnel other than KYE personnel travelling between July and December 1996. (Mr. Charters gave a figure of 745 in the body of his second supplementary report, paragraph 2.143, but a figure has been mistranscribed from his schedule 9. The figure in schedule 9 appears to be a correct figure). That leaves 818 person-flights attributable to KYE. (In the absence of evidence I take all the June flights to be flights of KYE personnel). The relevant cost of helicopter journeys is 818 times £44. That equals £35,992. The cost must be closely related to man-hours worked on the platform.

I am not satisfied that Restbury did any work in relation to the software concerning that valve or its potential replacement. Mr. McMaster in his submissions has apportioned the Restbury claim equally among those nine nodes to which he allocated it. I accept that that is a reasonable way to apportion these costs. I disallow the apportionment to HAZOP node 2.3.10. That leaves eight nodes among which the claim should be equally apportioned. I accept also that Restbury would have done software work on the main compressor HIPS, item 3.1.3, and on the main compressor blowdown sequence, node 3.1.5. Thus one-eighth of the Restbury claim should be apportioned to HAZOP node 3.1.3 and one-eighth to node 3.1.5. That amounts to £3,670 in each case.</p>

Thus I need not consider further those that do not relate to HAZOP nodes which arise out of any breach of duty on the part of Snamprogetti. It follows that I need deal only with the following: </p>

This claim, in relation to HAZOP  node 2.2.5, is for the cost of the new suction pressure control valve PV 1020 for the fuel gas compressor. That valve was introduced to produce a suction pressure of 99 psia. I have found that that was not appropriate, and a valve providing a pressure of 175 psia ought to have been supplied. There is no evidence as to the difference, if any, in price between the two articles. I shall assume that £5,031 represents a fair estimate of the cost of a suitable valve.</p>

The schedule that sets out the list of materials refers to HAZOP nodes 2.2.5, 2.3.11 and 3.1.3 in this connection. Mr. McMaster in his submission divided the sum claimed equally among those three nodes (£1,545 each). There is no evidence before me as to the price of each controller.

Mr. Charters, having studied the direct and indirect hours claimed for each trade, reached the conclusion that some of the direct hours in question ought to be, but had not been, allocated to AMEC and Bacton work. The persons concerned were foreman insulator, instrument fitter, instrument technician, insulator, logistics clerk, storeman, superintendent and welding inspector. Their direct hours totalled 1,423. Mr. Charters said, and I accept, that Phillips had failed to allocate any of that time to AMEC and Bacton work. I accept that it is highly improbable that none of those hours represented AMEC and Bacton work. As appears from Appendix 1, the number of offshore direct hours said to have been expended on AMEC and Bacton was 1948. That represents 11.44 per cent. of the sum of HAZOPS and AMEC and Bacton hours. Mr. Charters considered that that proportion of the 1,423 hours, namely 163 hours, should be apportioned to Bacton. (The distinction between AMEC and Bacton is not relevant for this purpose). Not knowing to what nodes any of the 1,423 hours related, Mr. Charters transferred the 163 hours from the All-HAZOPS category. I accept that he was right to do so.</p>

Most of that work appeared under HAZOP node 2.3.11. That node was concerned with advising on remedial measures concerning the vibration of the fuel gas compressor. Some of the work to the fuel gas heater was included under HAZOP node 2.2.5. That node was concerned with the fuel gas compressor suction pressure control valve PV 1020, but the job cards in question related both to that work and to valve PV 1021, which related to the fuel gas heater. Mr. Charters created a new category of quasi-node, Fuel gas heater. He transferred the relevant hours, 4,271 hours, that had been included under node 2.3.11 to the new category. He also apportioned half of the hours in the job cards that related both to node 2.2.5 and to the fuel gas heater to the fuel gas heater category. It is manifestly convenient to have the new quasi-node, and I accept Mr. Charters’s method of dealing with this matter.</p>

Mr. Charters transferred those hours into Bacton as not being the responsibility of Snamprogetti.

Mr. Charters transferred those 122 hours from node 2.3.11 to Bacton on the ground that the work in question was maintenance work.

For 8789.5 hours (see Appendix 1) that represents an average of £20.69 an hour. I calculate the onshore costs of KYE labour for each item as follows. First, I have discounted the head office costs of £139,740 by £6885, leaving £132,855 (see paragraph 529 above). That figure I have apportioned to the items by reference to the offshore direct hours. The onshore non-productive hours I have treated in the same way. They amount to £14,265.76, being 689.5 hours at £20.69 an hour. The total sum so apportioned is £147,120.76. Finally, I have taken the onshore direct hours applicable to each item and applied the average rate of £20.69 an hour. As regards the fuel gas heater, I have taken the figure of 815 onshore hours from Rev6last, which attributed those hours to HAZOP node 2.3.11. HAZOP node 2.3.11 recommended obtaining advice and report on the vibration of the fuel gas compressor. Manifestly, it was not in pursuance of that recommendation that the time in question was spent.  Mr. Charters transferred those hours to the fuel gas heater. He was right to do so. I have adopted that approach. The result appears in Appendix 3.</p>

Those allocated to nodes by way of the relevant disciplines are in the all-HAZOPS category and ought to be spread over AMEC and Bacton in addition to the nodes. I reduce each apportionment in proportion to the numbers of direct offshore hours spent on the nodes and on the nodes plus AMEC and Bacton. There is no evidence upon which any other adjustment could be made. The resulting figures appear in column (4) of Appendix 7. I have done the same in the case of those all-HAZOPS materials that were apportioned to the nodes without reference to disciplines, save that I have first reduced the total for reasons given in paragraphs 537 and 539 above. The materials in question all fell within the all-HAZOPs category. This part of the claim amounted to £58,558.65, of which I have disallowed £28,414.80, leaving £30,143.85.

The cost of materials purchased by Phillips was £107,341. It does not appear what proportion of the materials was transported to the platform. Not all the materials were physical objects.

It is said that that would not have been necessary but for Snamprogetti’s breaches of duty. However that may be, the costs of the HAZOP were probably increased by those breaches of duty. No doubt the variable costs are only a fraction of the total costs. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that Phillips have suffered some small damage in this connection by reason of the breaches of duty. In my judgment, a fair estimate of the damage is to be arrived at by apportioning the whole cost equally over all the HAZOP nodes, including those involving no claim against Snamprogetti. The expression HAZOP node strictly identifies an item designated by two numbers, each recommendation being identified by a third number. However, in these proceedings the word node has been universally used to refer to a recommendation identified by three numbers. In counting nodes, I use the expression in the latter sense. There were 69 nodes. Each one for which I have found Snamprogetti liable thus attracts £103.84 in damages under this head, save for the water wash drainage. The water wash drainage (HAZOP nodes 3.7.1, 4.1.1) is a matter which constituted a purely technical breach of contract, for reasons given in paragraph 321 above. In my judgment, it should not attract more than nominal damages of £2. On the other hand, item 2.3.10, concerning valve PV 923, though leading to no costs, as I have found, did justify investigation by way of HAZOP.</p>

That sum is made up as follows. £3,263 is claimed as one equal ninth part of the fees, £29,363, of Restbury International spread over nine HAZOP nodes. £88 has been allowed against that sum as a commissioning credit. There is no evidence what Restbury International did in relation to this recycle valve. I am not satisfied that anything was done. £223 is claimed as a share of the cost of supply vessels.

Of that sum, £138,710 is claimed as an entitlement under milestone provisions of the contract. Liability for that sum is admitted, subject to set-off. A further sum of £144,188 is counterclaimed for 4270 additional design hours spent by Snamprogetti. Finally, the sum of £38,245 is counterclaimed as damages for failure on the part of Phillips to make an assessment pursuant to a risk and reward scheme provided by the contract.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.16in;text-indent:-0.16in">598. It is common ground that Snamprogetti spent a further 4,270 man-hours on the project after (or after the beginning of) the Baker Jardine HAZOP. That appears on the pleadings. It is not possible for me fully to identify particular hours with particular design work. Mr. McMaster submitted that I should allow the proportion of the claim for design hours that reflected my findings on liability. I accept that submission. I shall assume that the design hours spent on each item were in proportion to the KYE offshore direct hours spent on that item. The KYE offshore direct hours spent on the HAZOP items plus the fuel gas heater are to be found in Appendix 2. They amounted in total to 9241.5, excluding the 1548 hours of all-HAZOP items. The latter were distributed pro rata among the former and do not affect the ratio. I found Snamprogetti liable to Phillips in relation to eight HAZOP nodes, of which six attracted KYE offshore hours. The offshore hours spent on the HAZOP nodes which I have found to be the responsibility of Snamprogetti amounted in total to 2077, again excluding the all-HAZOPS apportionment (Appendix 7). The balance is 7164.5.  That is 77½ per cent. of the total. I find Snamprogetti to be entitled to 77½ per cent. of its claim in respect of additional design hours. That amounts to £111,745.</p>

Thus the question whether the concession is voluntary is purely academic. I asked Miss Boswell whether she had some practical reason for inviting me to decide the point, and she gave none. I decline to decide this point. There are other points: whether the loss is Phillips’s loss, and whether Phillips has suffered loss to the extent that it has been reimbursed. It is unnecessary for me to decide those points.</p>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">612. I find the loss to be £97,052. The damages under the claim will be 72.65225 per cent. of that amount, i.e. £70,510. The sum due under the counterclaim is £250,455. There will be judgment in favour of Snamprogetti for the balance, £179,945. The claim against the second defendant is dismissed.</span>
