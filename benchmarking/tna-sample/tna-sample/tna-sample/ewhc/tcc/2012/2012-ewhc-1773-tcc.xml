	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This litigation raises extensive disputes which have arisen on a substantial new building project at 3, Boltons Place, London SW5. The project commenced in about 2004 and it is common ground that, when the Contractor, Walter Lilly &amp; Company Limited ("WLC"), was appointed as main contractor, design work was nowhere near completed. It was clear and became clearer that the employer, DMW Developments Ltd ("DMW"), had very high expectations. However, little if any design had been completed prior to the involvement of WLC. There were substantial delays, much of which initially at least were not the responsibility of WLC, and as time went on DMW fell out seriously with its Architect. It can certainly be seen with hindsight, and could probably have been foreseen, that the project was "a disaster waiting to happen". This certainly has proved to be the case.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The case raises a number of issues which may be of interest to the construction industry and specialist legal practitioners and these include global claims and concurrent delays. In one sense, this litigation is very old-fashioned because it has involved a full-blooded conflict between the parties in which there seems to have been little, no or belated room for compromise, although the quantum experts have gone some way to reducing what is in issue. There remain in effect hundreds of issues between the parties, hence the length of this judgment. Different approaches are adopted by each party on delay analysis. No quarter was given on any of the primary matters in issue. Some very personal criticisms and complaints have been made by each party about one or more of the other side’s witnesses. There have been over 32,000 pages of documentation put before the Court (albeit with a significant amount of duplication and irrelevant material), there have been 9 factual witnesses and 8 experts and the trial hearing has lasted 16 days. The expert bundles themselves run to 33 in number, totalling some 11,000 pages. It seems that the parties have expended between about £9m and £10m by way of costs, which is obviously disproportionate to what is in dispute.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">No, 3 Boltons Place, owned and occupied by Mr and Mrs Mackay, is one of three adjacent houses of similar design. DMW was a purpose designed vehicle for the acquisition of the land at what is now Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Boltons Place and was formed by three people, Mr Mackay, Mr Daniel and Mr West. The three houses were known during construction as Units or Plots A, B and C, of which C was to be Mr and Mrs Mackay’s. The houses are of reinforced concrete construction on piled foundations and the external walls are brick, although the ground floors are rendered in a faux rusticated manner. There are five floors, with a basement containing a below garden swimming pool set across a narrow courtyard, a ground floor and three other floors. The third floor is located behind a mansard style slate clad roof. Whilst each house was built to a similar shell and core, the interiors were fitted out to suit the requirements of the individual owners.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The basement at No.3 comprises on the west side a large habitable space, designated as the Library where the extensive bookcases are covered in stitched leather. The Library windows, which largely comprise a large sliding door, look out onto a courtyard with a water feature, on the other side of which behind a similar sliding door is the swimming pool, on the western side of which are glass screens behind which there are changing rooms, a lavatory and shower. The very substantial sliding doors which lead out from the swimming pool and the Library are known as the Courtyard Sliding Doors. The glass screens on the western side of the pool comprise and incorporate a lighting feature which allows a flow of changing coloured light from top and bottom to be diffused through the whole of the screen; this is known as the Light Wall. In the basement there is also a cinema and below the external area immediately outside the front door is a garage accessed by a car lift. The ceilings of the swimming pool and the cinema comprise what is known as Barrisol ceilings which essentially are a stretch light coloured fabric which conceals a substantial bank of lights which also change colour and are supposed to be diffused evenly through the ceiling downwards. There are also a wine cellar, guest toilet facilities, a kitchen, laundry and staff quarters. There is a secondary staircase to the ground floor. The ground floor comprises a large entry hall, to the west a large family room and to the east the drawing room in addition to which there are guest cloakrooms; the doors to these two rooms were known as the Stingray doors and were very substantial metal lookalike doors. The first floor contains the master bedroom suite, including bathroom and dressing rooms as well as two studies, referred to as His Study and Her Study. On the second floor there are two substantial bedrooms for each of the Mackays’ children, each having a bedroom with en-suite bathroom and a study. The third floor comprises a guest suite on the east side and a gymnasium on the west side. Rising up and down from the ground floor is a reasonably capacious circular staircase in the middle of which there is a lift which runs all the way up the house. Much of the flooring is of American Black Walnut ("ABW"); ABW was also used for much of the cupboard joinery as well as for the skirtings. </p>

The first permission was for the demolition of the existing Earls Court telephone exchange which had stood on the site for many years and the second was for the construction of three dwelling houses with basements and attached garages with access from Boltons Place. There was therefore some pressure on all concerned to get the job started within that timescale.</p>

In 2004 the three of them set up DMW as the corporate vehicle through which the development would be carried out. Initially, DMW used the original architects who had helped secure the planning permission. G&amp;T were retained in 2003 as were SLW, CBP and BLDA. In mid-2004, the Mackays retained Fox Linton as the interior designers, in particular Anthony Bevacqua, known as “Bev”. It was only later, in February 2005 that the Mackays retained Equation as the lighting consultants. In 2006, RLB was retained to provide a range of quantity surveying, building survey and project management services to manage directly employed artists and tradesmen.</p>

WLC was to describe itself as having particular and extensive experience of working on high-quality residential and new build projects. On 26 March 2004, WLC submitted its tender in the sum of £15,476,970.99 for construction of all three plots. It referred to there being limited information and how difficult it was to conclude an actual programme; although the stated completion period was 78 weeks, WLC’s experience suggested 80 to 90 weeks, notwithstanding the enclosed programmes showing a 78 week period and some 23 work packages. The Executive Summary stated that it would provide "a dedicated specialist team, which has extensive experience of working on high-quality residential projects including new build" and that it had a "strong track record of working on schemes which require design input from the contractor as well as the ability to work with design teams." There was a detailed breakdown of the preliminaries to be provided at a total cost of £1,438,500.62. There is no hint or suggestion at the time from DMW’s design team that this was an inadequate allowance. Indeed if anything it was somewhat higher than G&amp;T had estimated.</p>

On this basis, WLC’s tender was accepted in that amount; it had been confirmed that the overhead and profit percentage was set at 4.5%. The Date of Possession was to be 12 July 2004 and the Date for Completion was 23 January 2006. There were graded liquidated damages rates (£2,150 for each of the first seven days of culpable delay, £2,850 per the next 18 days, £4,300 to the next 44 days and £6,400 per day thereafter).

Apart from the preliminary cost items, all the actual building works were the subject matter of provisional sums and the Contract specification and drawings were largely outline with little or no detail. Over one year later on 19 August 2005, BLDA was to write to G&amp;T saying that: "The distance between client aspirations and cost has never been so far apart". This highlighted what was to be a continuing problem, namely considerable delays in securing design decisions so that WLC and its sub-contractors could progress the Works with reasonable expedition. </p>

This was confirmed at a project meeting on 4 May 2004. WLC negotiated with several piling contractors and on 28 June 2004 recommended that the piling package was awarded to Stent Foundations. BLDA issued an instruction (AI001) on 30 June 2004 for WLC to issue a letter of intent to Stent authorising limited works up to a value of £10,000, which in effect WLC did a few days later. The reason for the Architect’s reticence was that the demolition works being carried out by H Smith Engineers Ltd were delayed. Although it was not until 17 August 2004 that BLDA instructed WLC to enter into a formal sub-contract with Stent Foundations (in the sum of £736,976.06 by AI007)), a further instruction the following day deferred the start of the works until 31 August 2004 due to demolition delays. Indeed, WLC was itself instructed by the Architect (AI008) to carry out certain further demolition work of underground concrete and brick work. The works started on 30 August 2004. By 10 September 2004, WLC was reporting that the contract was in delay by some four months. Some delay and disruption was caused by the presence on site of trees subject to tree preservation orders and over the following few months permission was secured for the felling of such trees.</p>

For instance in late July 2004, G&amp;T communicated with WLC about splitting the overall contract sum into three separate sums. On 9 August 2004, Mr Corless of WLC provided a breakdown of the preliminaries for each house. There was concern on the part of WLC that the three houses were constructed as three legally separate contracts because the level of preliminaries could only be maintained provided that all works were and continued to be run in tandem. This led to a Deed of Variation dated 23 December 2004 whereby WLC was engaged by DMW to carry out building works for each of the three units effectively by way of three separate contracts. For Unit C, the Contract Sum was £5,281,974 with the same Possession and Completion Dates as before and the same contractual conditions.</p>

This was acknowledged in part by the Architect who confirmed at a meeting on the 16 November 2004 that the "Clients’ design decision deadlines [on] the current programme is [sic] are problematic”. There is little or no evidence that the Mackays were ever clearly advised by their professional team of the critical need for the design to be decided upon sooner rather than later. Major aspects of the interior design were not resolved until 2006, well after the original contractual date for completion. In this context, and given that it was open to DMW to designate within the confines of the contract that WLC design substantial elements of the Works, WLC wrote on several occasions in 2005 to BLDA seeking instructions and clarification as to what if anything else (other than the piling) it was to design. For instance on 21 March 2005, WLC wrote to BLDA in the following terms:</p>

This was followed by similar letters dated 13 May 2005 and 10 August 2005 which also elicited no substantive response. There is no evidence that BLDA ever raised this important issue with their clients. That DMW’s Design Team were aware of the need to formalise arrangements about who was to be responsible for design is clear from such correspondence as is available to the Court relating to the piling in relation to which Mr Elliott of G&amp;T e-mailed Mr McMorrow of WLC on 11 November 2004 confirming that "a set of documents can be gathered to pass back to the Clients’ solicitors” going on to say that "this will be necessary for all of those packages so that design responsibility is passed down to Water Lilly".</p>

In May 2005, WLC invited a company called Firmans to provide and fix the two Courtyard Sliding doors, an order following in September 2005. However, this had been preceded by extensive contact directly between BLDA and Firmans (as evidenced by example by a letter dated 7 January 2005 from BLDA to Firman discussing various design options and decisions, to which WLC was not a party. Firman indeed provided quotations direct to BLDA which continued to liaise with Firman about design as recorded in procurement meetings in April and May 2005). On 23 June 2005, Adams Joinery Ltd quoted for the supply and installation of joinery in a number of rooms (five bathrooms, two dressing rooms and two WCs); the scope of their work was to be extended substantially by later quotations and re-quotations. BLDA did not instruct WLC to place an order for this work until 3 October 2005 (AI166C). This led to an extension of time notification by WLC on 7 October 2005.</p>

A schedule was attached which showed agreed changes to the original programme occasioned by provisional sum instructions. It also placed on record "that the flow of information continues to lag behind dates agreed in both the Procurement and Information Required Schedules” and emphasised that it was "critical to adjust the programme in a timely manner to ensure that the employer is aware of the current forecast completion date as well as any adjustments to the Contract Arising from the architect’s instructions…”.

It is not wholly clear why BLDA was so far behind with the provision of information and instructions but there is no suggestion that it was in any way the fault or responsibility of WLC. One of the reasons however undoubtedly was that the clients’ wishes were not capable of being accommodated within the budget which they had set and a substantial amount of work had to be done to try to accommodate both. Certainly there were substantial tensions between Mr Mackay and the professional team; for instance he wrote to G&amp;T on 16 November 2005 complaining that they were:</p>

On 27 September 2005, Firman was invited to tender for the other elements of the glass cubicles for the swimming pool area. It was only in November 2005 that Mr Mackay saw a small mock-up of the Light Wall and instructed the team to proceed. It was only on 2 February 2006 that BLDA instructed WLC to place an order with Firman for the Light Wall, although WLC’s tender report of 24 November 2005 had said that a 23 week period was required by Firman from the sub-contract being let to it. It was also over this period that there were discussions (not involving WLC) about the Barrisol ceilings and the lighting arrangement above them, albeit that in early October 2005 WLC did receive an estimate for the supply and installation of the Barrisol sheeting in the swimming pool area.</p>

Further visits were being arranged in March 2006 however to organise "another veneer selection process" as referred to in an e-mail dated 7 March 2006 from Adams Joinery. This occurred when Mrs Mackay visited the workshop of a company called Reliance Veneers, who were to be the suppliers to Adams Joinery which was to be the sub-contractor; Mr Hawks of Adams Joinery attended but WLC did not.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An issue had arisen between the parties as to where the risk lay in relation to delay attributable to the issuing of provisional sum instructions with WLC arguing that, as the provisional sums were undefined, all programme risk was with DMW; thus, if a sub-contractor whose engagement was instructed by way of a provisional sum instruction failed to finish within the time otherwise reasonably allocated by WLC to such work WLC was entitled to an extension for overall delay caused by this as the delay would have arisen simply as a result of compliance with the instruction in question. DMW’s lawyers advised it that this was wrong as did BLDA. SLW appear to have disagreed with this for reasons set out in its letter to Mr Mackay of 5 October 2005; their view was that the problems and delays on the job could be traced back to the letting of the Contract at a time when there was incomplete design information. It advised that the design must be frozen to prevent any further extensions of time. It explained that it was trying to manage the “dynamic process” of design, information provision and construction but it was “difficult”.</p>

Mr Mackay referred to Mrs West as "avaricious and jealous” and as needing a “f***ing good slapping". The very clear inference from this and what had gone before is that Mr Mackay believed that he was spending far too much on the construction works and that he had been misled about likely costs. In an e-mail exchange on 28 February 2006, Mr Mackay said that the project "has turned into a fiasco where we all look like complete idiots unable to listen to or act on reason". By 16 April 2006, Mr Mackay was telling his architect and quantity surveyor that "a lot of people are late on this project due to no fault of mine and…the costs are being passed on to me with no regard to my approval or interests"; G&amp;T were appearing "to just act as a high-priced mail box in this whole affair” and their performance was "at best pitiful".</p>

Delayed procurement of finishing trades issues, the late resolution of the sub-station issue, late changes and alterations to installed work, late details relating to the Light Wall and late finalisation of the veneer were highlighted as the more recent primary problems. In late March and early April 2006, further extension of time notifications were dispatched by WLC to BLDA relating to additional works for joinery and to problems relating to the moving of the sub-station and additional work relating to pre-cast concrete features. By late April 2006, a total extension of time of 33 weeks with costs was being requested. By June 2006, the parties were anticipating completion of the Works on 28 November 2006, with over 36 weeks reported delay. At a site meeting held on 8 June 2006, it was recognised by DMW’s Design Team “that coordinated design information remains to be given to [WLC] and significant numbers of queries generated by [WLC] remain to be answered…”. By the end of June 2006 WLC was reporting an extension of time of 36 weeks and 2 days, that Adams Joinery was running five weeks late due to late instructions and information and that they were awaiting instructions to proceed with the leather finishes, including to the Library.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“The view of [BLDA] was that the main causes of delay to date were late instructions and design information…the splitting of packages into a smaller packages, poor coordination of services, the lifts and the substation. [WLC] were also claiming time and money due to there being only one staircase, but two was included in the original specification, which resulted in delay and disruption to the works owing to congestion.</p>
	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">[BLDA] also said that another problem was that [WLC] would not take on any design liability and this was causing delay…The building contract was checked and it set out a number of packages that may be [Contractor Designed Portion] packages. CF [of BLDA] said that he thought a list of such packages had been agreed early on…JA said that no work had been procured as a CPD package. [BLDA] confirmed that the mechanical and electrical services were fully designed by Chapman Bathurst.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The correspondence overall supports the general truth of these observations. Very few of the extension of time notifications were challenged by BLDA, albeit BLDA did occasionally do so (such as on 1 June 2006 in relation to ceiling details). At this stage, the causes of delay were primarily the late provision of instructions and information to WLC and poor coordination by DMW’s Design Team. There had been little or no complaint that WLC was responsible for any of the overall delay. Documentary evidence and indeed the evidence of WLC, which I accept, confirms that virtually no work (the piling package being an exception) had been procured by the Design Team as a Contractor Designed Portion package. What was not correct was the note that WLC was not prepared to take on any design liability. There had been a number of letters written by it unequivocally seeking clarification and instructions as to what design responsibility it should take on; those letters had been studiously ignored principally by BLDA and G&amp;T for no obviously good reason other than they believed that the imposition of design responsibility on WLC carried with it an additional financial burden for DMW. It is clear that there was and continued to be serious ill feeling between DMW and the Design Team about the escalating costs of the project.</p>

WLC’s progress report of 24 July 2006 identified that 45 weeks and four days extension of time had been requested, although at this stage only 20 weeks extension had been granted. Delays associated with the Light Wall were noted as one of the current delaying factors. Within several weeks, a further extension of time of seven weeks was granted. On 22 August 2006, BLDA reported to Mr Mackay that WLC was predicting contract completion at mid-February 2007, this date being "generated by the late delivery of bespoke ironmongery, the long lead in time for some door finishes and testing and commissioning". Following further extension of time notifications in July and August 2006, including one on 25 August 2006 relating to delays in relation to decisions on leather selection, WLC reported on 15 September 2006 that a total extension of 51 weeks was being requested with significant delays being recorded against pool areas generally, lifts, stairs, roof lights, doors and frames, courtyards generally and external works.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By October 2006, Mr Mackay had become disillusioned with, principally, BLDA and G&amp;T; cost had risen enormously and there was at least a year’s delay; he referred in an email dated 27 November 2006 to his Design Team to a doubling of the budget. He retained well known claims consultants, Knowles, by an agreement dated 19 October 2006 to provide nominally "contractual and adjudication advice". This retainer was initially kept secret from BLDA and WLC, albeit that it was no longer secret by early 2007. Knowles’ personnel attended a site visit on 18 October 2006. It is clear at this time that Mr Daniel believed that the main person at Knowles, Mr Rainsberry, was "very aggressive and thinks we should go after contractor now…through attack rather than negotiation"; he liked his approach and said that "all contractors are dishonest so let's nail the bastards!”. Mr Mackay evolved a strategy from about this time to pressurise the Design Team and WLC. Knowles was initially asked to carry out a critical path delay analysis for all three houses. One of the primary purposes of involving Knowles was or certainly became watching over BLDA and G&amp;T and influencing them as to how they should do their jobs on this project. This was an aggressive move against them. One facet of this was that BLDA was disentitled from issuing instructions without the approval of DMW or Mr Mackay. Another primary purpose became the development of a strategy to ensure that no further extensions of time were granted to WLC and that financial constraints were imposed. This strategy began to develop at least from about early November 2006 when Messrs Mackay, West and Daniel met at a Client Meeting on 1 November 2006 and mutually agreed that a completion date should be established with no further extensions of time to be granted past this date and that liquidated damages were imposed on WLC thereafter. In the case of Mr Mackay, this involved an increasing determination that a large amount of work should be omitted from the Unit C Contract to be performed by artists, tradesmen and others directly retained by him or possibly DMW, with WLC being left with such remaining works in respect of which, he anticipated, WLC would be in culpable delay or other difficulties. The motive for this by inference was to land WLC with a substantial liquidated damages burden. RLB was appointed as the project manager to superintend the work to be done outside the construction contracts. It is also the case that Mr Mackay as from this time began to be highly critical of the quality of WLC’s work, for instance in relation to the plastering and the lift.</p>

Although WLC was hoping that the Unit C work could be completed by the end of February 2007, problems with the Light Wall continued throughout November and December 2006, which included breakages of glass due to inadequate structural strength as well as uneven light distribution (scalloping) within the Light Wall. Further extension of time notifications were issued by WLC, including one on 14 December 2006 relating to the Light Wall and another on 11 January 2007 relating to problems associated with the external works.</p>

An example was that the extensive leather work in the Library in the basement had still not been finalised, either in terms of the type of leather or the stitching which was to be used. The Light Wall was undergoing substantial problems which were to continue throughout 2007 and into 2008. Both WLC and SLW believed that  the Light Wall would not be complete by the end of February 2007. By 19 January 2007, WLC was reporting that, although an extension of time of 47 weeks and 4 days (up to 2 February 2007) had just been granted by BLDA, various works including the Light Wall and the Leather in the Library along with a number of items of work which remained to be instructed remained to be completed. Subject to the items listed, WLC was reporting that works would be complete by the end of January 2007. An extension of 58 weeks was claimed. By 6 February 2007, WLC was reporting that final snagging to Unit C could commence as soon as possible, albeit with the Light Wall and Leather in the Library being still outstanding. At a client meeting on 26 January 2007 with BLDA and SLW, Mr Mackay accused BLDA of being complicit in the extensions of time granted on the basis that they masked BLDA’s delays in issuing information. It was said at this meeting that WLC was predicting that work would be completed by the end of January except for a number of items. There was talk about WLC providing a schedule of areas ready for snagging and it was resolved that the snagging process would be carried out by a senior architect and team from BLDA. On 29 January 2007, BLDA, clearly under pressure from its client, wrote no less than 15 letters to WLC. On 2 February 2007, BLDA issued instructions to WLC to omit almost all the hard landscaping in relation to Plot C, as well as various other works and items such as the supply of door ironmongery.</p>

BLDA and Mr Joyce of WLC had discussed snagging to Plot C and agreed that "it must commence as soon as possible". Mr Joyce said that it would have to take place "elementally because there are unfinished and late items in most rooms". The Leather in the Library was identified as a potential problem area because WLC and Adams Joinery were "waiting for confirmation on the leather stitching"; Adams Joinery had presented 10 samples of stitching and Bev (not in attendance) was expected to confirm a sample later that day. This was said to be "urgent as it affects installation of the Library joinery, the door and the large panels of the Lower Hall" with Mr Joyce stating that "none of the Library joinery can be fixed because it is dependent on the upper sections being covered in leather first and these are in abeyance until the leather stitching has been agreed". Mr Mackay sent three pages of comments on these minutes, although he had not been in attendance; he said amongst other things that when he and his wife visited the site on 10 February 2007 "the house was a complete mess" and "nowhere near complete"; he identified that the "plasterwork in every area is defective for a job of this quality and "price".”</p>

It is unclear what, if any, analysis Knowles had undertaken in relation to responsibility for these alleged defects. The involvement of Knowles caused some administrative confusion and in consequence WLC liaised with BLDA on Knowles’s letter (for instance on 15 March 2007) but also delivered a detailed riposte to it on 30 March 2007. Knowles was to write direct to WLC on a number of occasions, for instance on 29 March 2007 again in relation to alleged defects.  The introduction of Knowles was certainly to raise the temperature and did little to engender any feelings of trust and co-operation between employer and contractor. On 7 March 2007 also BLDA sent a list of what was said to be unacceptable areas of plaster throughout the building based on a "preliminary spot survey of walls". </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There still remained doubt as to whether the leather work in the Library was or was not going to be omitted and Mr McMorrow of WLC e-mailed Mr Cane of G&amp;T on 7 March 2007 asking whether the work was "to be in contract or out of contract", emphasising that it would take until July for this work to be completed. This e-mail was passed onto Mr Mackay who e-mailed back later that evening saying that the work was "in the contract – you’re all very late - so I would get on with it if I were you!!!!! Be advised everything stays in the contract where WL are late”. This highlights part of what Mr Mackay’s strategy was becoming: it included the desire not to omit from the scope of WLC’s work all those items of work which Mr Mackay, rightly or wrongly, regarded as the fault, risk or responsibility of WLC; the advantage, doubtless as he saw it, was that he would be able to extract the substantial liquidated damages agreed upon within the Contract. In mid-March 2007, Mr Mackay seriously considered that in the light of the reported defects on the lift and lift shaft a new lift shaft should be put in. WLC was on 20 March 2007 to estimate that this would take between six and nine months. He was however being told by BLDA (for instance at a meeting held on 7 March 2007) that the plastering was generally in accordance with the specification.</p>

Throughout March 2007, Adams Joinery was applying the agreed type of oil (Danish Oil) to the joinery, such as cupboards and skirtings, starting at the third floor and moving down.

In broad terms, the dispute between the parties relating to the plasterwork was one of degree, with WLC accepting that there were some areas of plaster which were out of specification and Mr Mackay saying that virtually all the plasterwork was defective; the argument revolved around what the contractual specification called for. The Federation of Plastering and Drywall Contractors was called in and reported in the third week of March that the standard achieved was "of a commercially acceptable standard". In the result extensive remedial works were done over the next two or three months which satisfied WLC and BLDA but not Mr Mackay.</p>

These had been provided over the first 30 months of the project and Knowles had complained about the absence of programmes. WLC wrote on 5 July 2007 saying that the circumstances were such that it was impossible properly to programme the works and forecast the completion of the works; the letter suggested that there were still significant outstanding information and instructions and that the activities and progress of directly employed artists and tradesmen was making it difficult to progress and complete.

Knowles wrote on 23 July 2007 on instructions from Mr Mackay to BLDA instructing them not to issue instructions to WLC without Knowles’ "written consent to the issue of each and every Instruction". Mr Mackay does not appear to have been advised that this was not justified under the construction contract and that, if implemented, could well result in yet further delays in the issue of instructions and information to WLC; this was copied to WLC who wrote on 26 July 2007 to Knowles complaining that this was not only invalid but also a repudiatory breach by DMW; WLC complained that "the reality of the situation is that the Architect has ceased to be an effective Architect in this regard and has been replaced by Knowles in all but name". By the end of July 2007 Mr Mackay had imposed a design freeze in relation to the work in the bathrooms. This reflected the fact that BLDA was at the very least severely constrained not only by the increasingly personal and hostile criticism offered but also by the close involvement of Knowles in the running of this project. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By this stage an adjudication had been commenced by WLC against DMW in relation to the sum of about £200,000 being withheld from certificates for the lift, some finishes and the Light Wall. Knowles was retained in that context by Mr Mackay and WLC had brought in its own claim consultants, Brewer. The adjudicator issued his decision on 30 July 2007 finding that, although there were some defects in the lift, only £30,000 was a reasonable withholding (as opposed to the £148,000 actually retained), that there was no justification for deducting anything in relation to the Light Wall and that only £5,000 could be withheld in respect of the finishes. It could justly be said that WLC was the substantial "winner". However, the adjudication in so far as it related to the lift led to a negotiation between WLC and DMW whereby WLC undertook to carry out an over-cladding solution in effect to cover up elements which were not acceptable to the Mackays. This resulted in a proposal made by WLC on 13 September 2007 whereby WLC offered to carry out work and waive any right for extension or delay related costs attributable to over-cladding work. This was accepted by DMW and the work was primarily done in October 2007. </p>

As is clear from its reply, BLDA did not consider that WLC was to blame as the colour change was inevitable and mostly attributable to the use of an oil rather than a lacquer finish. In early September BLDA instructed WLC to stain a door in the guest bedroom to see if the Mackays would accept it. The story relating to the ABW continued through various meetings in September and October 2007 and there is no issue that WLC and Adams Joinery stained virtually all the  veneered ABW throughout the building; this caused great consternation with the Mackays. However, WLC took the stance that it had done what the Mackays had asked and notwithstanding their complaints and concerns it was not prepared to replace the veneered wood or re-stain it or otherwise treat it again.</p>

Mr Mackay accusing them of "working full-time for” WLC, dissembling and being “truly a disgrace to your profession" (in an e-mail dated 13 September 2007). On 19 September 2007, he accused Mr Davis of BLDA of being "the most unprofessional person" he had met, that he was a charlatan and liar and that his head was "so far on the chopping block that it is holding on by a thread". Part of these complaints related to minutes or notes of meetings prepared by BLDA which Mr Mackay believed were inaccurate, either positively or by way of omission. He was therefore particularly alive to those concerns. These types of complaint continued over the following few months. At a walk around meeting on 31 October 2007, Mr Mackay referred to Mr Davis as a "f***ing Pussy” and said that he "wakes up in the morning wanting to kill him". At a similar meeting a week later he called Mr Davis to his face a "f*****g little twat” and said that "when this is finished (the building) I am not going to rest until I have taken you out and I have got the money to be able to do it". In an e-mail dated 19 November 2007 Mr Mackay wrote to Mr Davis saying: "…you lie, you cheat, you cut corners, you dissemble - frankly you would try the patience of God…You have wrecked what should have been an amazing experience by your conduct - we are nearly at the stage where I can sue you and frankly I can't wait!!!” During a conversation with Mr Davis on 18 December 2007, Mr Mackay said to him that he was "a joke", his "e-mails are full of lies" and that he was going to "take you out. When your PI cover is used up I'm going to go for you individually. I have a QC just waiting to go. I spent £750,000 on Knowles…” There were constant references to BLDA in general and Mr Davis in particular representing the contractor's interests over his, for instance in an e-mail dated 10 November 2007.</p>

Knowles advised that it would be "prudent to dismiss BLDA on or about 26 October". Part of the strategy included Mr Mackay sending a Knowles drafted letter instructing G&amp;T to issue no further recommendations for Interim Certificates, as was confirmed by G&amp;T in its letter to WLC, albeit copied to a number of other parties. G&amp;T clearly felt very embarrassed and apologised to WLC as recorded in a WLC e-mail of 2 October 2007.  This course of action was persisted in notwithstanding BLDA’s correct advice for instance on 19 October 2007 to Mr Mackay that it was inappropriate and a breach of contract. Further aggressive interference in the administration of contract was the direction from Knowles to G&amp;T (Mr Whidborne) that Adams Joinery should not have any preliminary costs on variations ordered after the extended date for completion; this was confirmed in an internal G&amp;T e-mail dated 25 October 2007; although Mr Whidborne thought that this was wrong and bizarre, he followed this direction. Knowles representatives told Mr Mackay that BLDA was the worst architect whom they had ever come across (as later referred to in an email of about 4 February 2008).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By early February 2008 if not before, Mr Mackay was beginning to fall out with Knowles. There were unpaid bills outstanding to Knowles but Mr Mackay sensed that Knowles was suspending work pending payment. In an e-mail dated 2 February 2008 to them, he made it clear that he did not like these tactics. He felt that he had spent over £800,000 on Knowles and that this "should have been enough for the fee for the whole action – WE have not really even started!!!” Knowles’ services were to be dispensed with by Mr Mackay within several months. As indicated in an e-mail dated 22 January 2008 to Mr West and Mr Daniel, Mr Mackay referred to Knowles in highly derogatory terms and as not providing value for money; Mr Mackay later (on 12 February 2008) referred to Mr Tomlinson as a “f*****g w****r”. It is also clear that Mr Mackay did not like some of the advice which he was receiving from Knowles to the effect that DMW would have some liability to WLC for delay; this is referred to in passing in Mr Rainsberry’s e-mail of 4 February 2008 to Mr Mackay. Meanwhile, adjudication had been initiated by DMW in relation to the ABW and the well-known adjudicator Mr Tony Bingham was appointed. On 21 May 2008 in a very short decision Mr Bingham decided that WLC was in breach of contract in the supply of the original ABW; he had not been asked to consider the question of the staining. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that by about February 2008 the works were substantially completed with certain exceptions. These included the Light Wall, snagging (namely final putting right or completing of minor items) and the outstanding ABW dispute. On 21 February 2008, WLC wrote to BLDA saying that, once the Light Wall work and some floor finishing were done by 29 February 2008, it considered that the Works would be practically complete. So far as the ABW issue was concerned, WLC reminded BLDA in effect that the latter had accepted the quality of the veneers in terms of material used and of workmanship and therefore this should not delay the certification of Practical Completion. Knowles wrote back on 22 February 2008 threatening the withholding of sums for the ABW and for the Light Wall. Mr Mackay wrote to BLDA advising it not to award practical completion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By mid March 2008, DMW had begun the process of terminating the employment of BLDA. As appears from an e-mail dated 4 February 2008 from Mr Rainsberry of Knowles, a primary explanation at least for the timing of this termination was a very real fear on the part of Mr Mackay that BLDA was about to issue a further extension of time to WLC. It was also Mr Rainsberry’s view that BLDA was not in repudiatory breach of its contract and that therefore the contract could not be terminated summarily.  On 28 February 2008 the first warning shot in this process was fired by DMW with a long list of complaints being listed. BLDA’s response of 13 March 2008 was to deny all the allegations and complain about Mr Mackay’s frequent interference with the administration of the project. Later that day, the employment was terminated and within about three weeks a new architect, Navigant Consulting, had been brought in. Unsurprisingly, it took a not inconsiderable time for the new architects to find out what the job was about and they were, through no fault of theirs, not in a position readily to address requests for extensions of time and the like with any promptness. However, Mr Priestley of Navigant very quickly took the view that the ABW workmanship was unacceptable as he confirmed to DMW’s solicitor in an e-mail dated 16 April 2008. He was also in May 2008 to form the view that the problems with the Light Wall were defects for which WLC was responsible.</p>

Investigations were done which involved Firman but ultimately WLC and Firmans took the view that neither was to blame for the problem. WLC did call in experts on the topic. WLC attributed responsibility to the design for which it said it had no liability. Navigant called on WLC to put the problem right on 22 May 2008.</p>

In the result, WLC did not do any further work on the ABW and so it was that Mr and Mrs Mackay employed a separate company, Interior Joinery, effectively to remove much of the existing stain and to stain it again with an equally or probably darker stain than had been done by Adams Joinery in September and October 2007.</p>

WLC complained about this in letters dated 1 and 2 July 2008 to Navigant.

On 17 July 2008 WLC wrote to Navigant referring to the fact that DMW had been installing soft furnishings, furniture and fixtures and fittings into the property and  suggesting that this was the clearest evidence that practical completion had in practice already occurred. Matters remained unresolved although Navigant told WLC that it was seeking instructions from its client whereby the contentious items could be omitted so as to enable Practical Completion to be issued.</p>

There was a continuing debate in correspondence over these three items into which it is unnecessary to delve because they remained and remain unresolved. No remedial works were done to them apart from the Interior Joinery work in about June 2008. On 26 August 2008, G&amp;T issued their Valuation No 40 which identified a gross sum due to WLC of £9,107,430.43. This was to form the basis of Interim Certificate No 38 issued on 17 September 2008; the product of this was that there was said to be a sum payable by WLC by reason of previous overpayments.</p>

He did not get on well with the Mackays, although I strongly suspect that, by the time that he came on the scene the relationship between them and WLC was rocky at best. He was undoubtedly faced with unpleasant verbal abuse from Mr Mackay and I formed the view that, although he found it difficult, he retained a level of restraint and politeness which was not reciprocated. He was slightly combative under cross-examination and he was clear and emphatic in answering what was often stern cross-examination.

The business, which he has set up by all accounts extremely successfully, is a focused well financed property investment company, run from offices in Chelsea Harbour. He is clearly an astute but very forceful man. He has been and is obviously very busy primarily at his business but he enjoys sailing, owning several substantial yachts; at various, possibly important stages, he had to leave the country to participate in sailing races or the like.

He unsurprisingly believed that his consultants, and in particular his architects, should act only in his interests but he seems to have been unaware throughout most of the project at least that, by agreeing to the standard JCT contract terms, he was leaving with the Architect an independent function of certifying sums due and of awarding, when appropriate, extensions of time. </p>

He has spent some £17 - £18 million so far on the construction and, he told me, over £6 million on the costs of this case. His introduction of Knowles, as claims consultant, at a total cost of some £900,000 for 17 to 18 months work, in effect mostly to keep an eye on the other consultants and to dictate to them how they should do their jobs is an example. Save for some of their work in connection with the adjudications, much of this expenditure was substantially wasted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in">(iv) He was and became increasingly frustrated as the project stumbled into substantial delay, rising costs and confusion as to who was responsible for what. I find it difficult to determine comprehensively whether it was the original architects, or other consultants, who were, so to speak, to blame or whether they gave appropriate advice at relevant stages to their client which was not followed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in">(v) Whatever the cause of his increasing frustration, his behaviour towards the Architects, some WLC employees and other consultants was not simply coarse (for which he apologised on a number of occasions when giving evidence); it was combative, bullying and aggressive and contributed very substantially to the problems on this project. He was particularly critical of the Architect's meeting minutes and, although on occasions he did point out to them criticism of some of the minute taking (see for example emails dated 4 and 27 February, 8 March, 19 July and 25 September 2007), this was usually done in a very aggressive way; however, for some critical meeting minutes, he did not come back to the Architect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in">(vi) I have formed the view that he is and has been for a long time angry. This seems to have started as 2006 went on and was originally directed primarily against the Architect. He has sued many of the parties involved in the development (the Architect, the Services Engineer, the lighting consultants and the interior designer); he has been sued by his second architect for fees, by Knowles and by several firms of solicitors for fees also. He has tried to wind up WLC (unsuccessfully in the summer of 2008), he sought through his solicitors in mid-2008 to suggest that WLC had "rigged" sub-contract tenders (an allegation not pursued in these proceedings), he has set up a website to attract additional complaints against WLC and to publicise complaints against WLC (“Beware of Walter Lilly”) and has sought to interfere with an acquisition by WLC’s parent company. Much of his anger has originated in his mounting frustration when matters did not go as he had hoped.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in">(vii) I found him to be an unsatisfactory witness. From my observations, I have formed the view that he has lost nearly all sense of objectivity in relation to this development and I consider that he simply does not understand why, given the amount of money which he has spent, the house is not perfect or exactly as he and his wife wanted. His attitude has almost become in the nature of a vendetta against WLC. Although I did not find him to be dishonest, he was at least careless with the truth in a number of respects. An example was his Third Witness Statement in which he stated that he believed that two representatives of Knowles were practising barristers or solicitors; he must have known on any account that they were not solicitors, practising or otherwise and, having taken the Bar exams himself, must have been conscious broadly of what was required to be a practising barrister; there was little if anything to suggest that they were practising barristers, albeit that they too, like him, had passed the Bar exams. Another example was his evidence in court that shortly before BLDA was dismissed he did not believe that BLDA would grant another extension of time to WLC; that was directly countered by contemporaneous documents which showed that he clearly had this in mind. His evidence that he could not remember issuing a direction to G&amp;T not to issue further valuation recommendations was expressly countered by the documentary evidence with which he had personally been involved at the time.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in">(viii) Having initially directed his ire against BLDA, he turned his attention also to WLC. I found him a most unconvincing witness. His objectivity having gone, I think that he has now convinced himself of the truth of certain matters such as those relating to the ABW issues such that, although he believes that he is right, he is obviously not.</p>

She had carried out extensive research before and even during the project as to what was required for the house. She was guileless and stood up well to cross-examination. She was also upset in the latter 12 to 18 months of the project as defects and delays began to emerge. She was clearly particularly upset about the way in which the ABW was eventually left by WLC, as it was she who had chosen the particular wood and, as she saw it, its appearance changed from what in her mind’s eye it should have been. Until she told the Court at the end of her evidence that she had a law degree and had practised as a solicitor in two well-known London firms for some 8 years, it had not been wholly obvious that she was well qualified to deal with people and business affairs in a businesslike fashion. She was frank and I had no reason to doubt her honesty.</p>

He was brought in to replace a Mr Bardsley who had been in charge of this operation prior to September 2007. Although he only worked on the project for 11 months and had no further contact until late 2011 for the purposes of giving a witness statement, he remembered what had happened at a key meeting in September 2007, the minutes of which he must have seen at the time but did not challenge; his memory was that, contrary to what the minutes said, no general instructions were given to WLC to stain cupboards and skirtings. I found him wholly unconvincing in this context not only because he did not challenge the minutes but because this work was not his area of responsibility and he would have had no reason to have any specific memory about it. </p>

He, broadly, logically and conventionally, adopted the approach of establishing critical delay by reference to the "logical sequence(s) of events which marked the longest path through the project"; Dr Aldridge accepted that this was generally the way to calculate delay (this being taken from Paragraph 9.1.9 of his January 2012 report). In the difficult circumstances facing both experts by reason of the absence of any usable contemporaneous programme from early 2007 onwards, Mr Robinson adopted a much more objective approach to his expert analysis whilst Dr Aldridge proceeded on a much more subjective approach (which he accepted at least in part). I amplify on this in the extension of time chapter in this judgment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Aldridge’s report also in some respects almost reads simply as a suggestion to the Court that the Claimant has not proved its case; an example is the opening words: “Walter Lilly’s case does not stack up"; his report is littered with this type of remark that WLC has failed to prove or demonstrate this or that or to make out its case; it is not for an expert to suggest this type of thing. He proceeds on an obvious logical misapprehension that, if works are finished before Practical Completion, they cannot have delayed completion. His suggestion that plastering defects delays could realistically have contributed to the overall delay is simply unsustainable in circumstances in which there was ultimately a limited amount of remedial work actually done and the remedial work was substantially completed by April 2007. His adoption of an approach based on determining the most "significant" matters preventing practical completion led to him adopting in many respects a subjective approach as to what his client thought was significant. This approach was one which Mr Robinson had never seen used.  He frequently descended into the arena of disputed facts and liabilities in which he was not the relevant expert; an example was Paragraph 2.2.35 of his January 2012 report when he felt able to criticise "WLC’s unwillingness to accept that the colour variation (and the very poor quality of staining which had made matters worse) was an unacceptable defect requiring rectification". Some parts of his report were based on conversations and information which were not in evidence and on occasion he had to accept that he was given information by Mr Mackay and by Navigant which was not contained or referred to in his report. He produced as Appendix D a “Weighted Significance Matrix” which was worthless and self-fulfilling when he on a largely subjective basis awarded weightings to the various possible causes of delay; this was taken through the project in 2007 and 2008 on a monthly basis and, unsurprisingly gave much higher weightings to the subjectively accepted factors (such as plastering defects) selected by him or his client as "significant".</p>

He was clear and positive throughout. Mr Josey is an experienced expert and was open, as one would expect, with the Court. He has, perhaps somewhat unfairly, been criticised by WLC’s Counsel for having been instrumental prior to the Defence and Counterclaim in drawing up detailed lists of defects; it was said that this was indiscriminate because it did not identify what defects were the fault of WLC. Whilst it is the case that initially very large quantities of defects and amounts were counterclaimed against in respect of defects (many of which were later dropped), I would not criticise Mr Josey for that; it would be up to those advising DMW, DMW and Mr Mackay himself to identify who had a contractual or legal responsibility for the defects. However, he did labour under the disadvantage that he had to accept that a large number of them could no longer be pursued against WLC, including some which he had himself supported. I would not criticise him but I found Mr Zombory Moldovan much more reliable.</p>

I much preferred the approach of Mr Hunter which was pragmatic and down to earth. I was disappointed with Mr Pontin who, although an experienced expert, I felt was trying too hard to reduce the delay and other quantum heads to an insignificant level. Whether he felt, subconsciously, pressurised by Mr Mackay or not I can not say. But his arguments were reduced to scraping the barrel in some respects such as suggesting that WLC had not demonstrated any loss and expense attributable to Plot C alone; this was absurd because it must follow that, if there was as here delay (almost 30 months delay), some time and resources must have been incurred in consequence and that obviously has a cost. He endorsed a totally artificial calculation to demonstrate that WLC had recovered all its preliminaries costs on the three Units.</p>

Normally, with this form of contract, as one of the expert architects confirmed, the areas of work which are to be part of the Contractor’s Designed Portion are specified in the contract documentation. That did not happen in this case. All that one had in the Specification was identification at page 1/5 of works which "may be designed by the Contractor". Clearly the word "may" is not permissive in the sense that the Contractor could choose to design these works. The use of the word “may” is clearly intended to identify those works which can be the subject matter of selection by the Employer to be designed by the Contractor.</p>

Thus, an element of work can only become part of the Contractor’s Designed Portion if and therefore presumably when DMW notifies WLC that this is to be the case. It is of interest and importance to note that it must be DMW which notifies and the Architect or the Quantity Surveyor are not as such given authority by the terms of the contract itself to notify; that is in contradistinction for instance to the Architect being given authority to issue instructions requiring Variations.</p>

In my view, the contract is clear that the Specification identifies those works which may or can be notified by DMW pursuant to the definition in the Second Recital. The Contractor cannot be asked to design works outside the list at page 1/5. Although the wording at Page 1/18 is possibly or partly otiose, it is interesting that there is a reference to sub-contractors to which the paragraph relates “including” those associated with specified works.  Page 1/5 does not provide a list, so to speak, by way of example. </p>

Elsewhere (at page 1/12R), Category A was to be work by “Domestic Sub-contractors” where the firms were "named in this Specification"; this Specification was, one assumes, a template used by the Architect or Quantity Surveyor and there are no firms "named" in it in this case. The 18 types of work are the first 18 of the 21 types of work refer to page 1/5. It could be said that the distinction is being made between the Contractor being asked to design as compared with certain Sub-Contractors being asked or required to design. Reading page 1/5 with page 1/18, the meaning becomes much clearer. If the Employer notifies the Contractor in writing that it requires any one of the 21 types of work set out at page 1/5 to be designed by the Contractor, Sub-Contractors are to be deployed to provide design services for any of the first 18 of those types. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One must then move on to consider how, contractually, the notification by DMW is to be made. Obviously, it must be in writing and that could doubtless be by letter, e-mail, fax or even by a meeting minute. It is obvious also that the notification must be to WLC because it must know, commercially and practically, that it is to assume design responsibility. The wording of any notification does not have to be in any particular form but what must be required is that it must be sufficiently clear to be understood as a notification that design responsibility is to be assumed by WLC for the particular item of work within one of the 21 categories identified on page 1/5. It follows from this that, as a matter of contractual interpretation, some sort of constructive or inferential knowledge on the part of WLC that it might have a design responsibility for a given item of work does not in itself deem there to have been notification. One needs to look at whatever the notification is said to be and, primarily answer two questions: is this clearly a notification under the Second Recital and is it a notification to WLC? </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In commercial and practical terms, it is important in my judgement under this construction contract for the notification to be clear and unambiguous. The main reasons are that everybody involved in the project, particularly the Architect and other professional consultants as well as the Contractor, need to know who has the ultimate or any particular design responsibility for any given work. If the Contractor has it, then the Architect knows to call for design documentation for approval. If the Architect or other of the Employer’s professionals retains responsibility, the Contractor knows from whom to call for information. Either way, each can protect itself by securing appropriate warranties or other protection from, say, sub-contractors who are to be retained. Another not unimportant reason for clarity is that, given that all works were the subject matter of provisional sums, it is more than arguable that the Contractor would be entitled to some additional compensation for design coordination as well as for the cost of procuring appropriate professional indemnity insurance as called for in the tender letter of 28 March 2004.</p>

	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) To secure an extension of time before Practical Completion, the Contractor has to give notice if the Works are being delayed or are likely to be delayed. This notice can relate therefore to actual delays being experienced or to future likely delays.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(b) The notice should be accompanied or be followed as soon as practicable by particulars of expected effects and an estimate of the expected delay. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(c) What is at least initially envisaged is that the Architect will carry out a prospective exercise; this is because the Contractor can give notice when progress is likely to be delayed and the Architect has to assess what the likely delay will be. This makes sense so that the parties and the Architect can plan for the rest of the job. Of course, notice can be given when the Works have actually been delayed but actual overall delay will not happen until after the original Date for Completion has passed. How the Architect does this prospective exercise of working out how much future delay will result from the Relevant Events in question is not prescribed but he or she will simply have to do the best that he or she can; this may well be assisted by programming exercises done by the Contractor.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(d) Once the notice, particulars and estimate under Clauses 25.2.1 and 25.2.2 are given, the Architect is required to grant the appropriate extension of time. This is not an optional exercise: the word "shall” is clearly and intended to be mandatory.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(e) No later than 12 weeks after Practical Completion, the Architect must carry out the final extension of time exercise, irrespective of whether notices and the particulars have been provided. This will necessarily be a retrospective exercise because Practical Completion will have passed and all the delays (whatever the causes) will have occurred. Again, the way in which this exercise is to be done is not defined.</p>

The basic pleading ran to 414 paragraphs and 140 pages along with detailed appendices. It is fair to say that there was a thorough response and a myriad of issues was raised. It claimed that there had been an overpayment in terms of the value of work, that no further extension of time was due, that substantial liquidated damages were due and that a sum approaching £2 million was due to defects and that WLC’s holding company was also liable under the terms of a guarantee.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The wood for the flooring throughout much of Unit C and the veneered cupboards and skirtings was American Black Walnut, which was a personal selection and preference of Mr and Mrs Mackay. Although the quality of the flooring was also criticised in 2007 and 2008, no allegations in relation to the flooring have been pursued in these proceedings. The complaints relate to most of the veneered cupboards and skirtings. There are essentially two main issues relating to ABW. The first is whether or not WLC owed any duty to DMW to advise it or its architect about the risk that ABW does have a propensity to fade in natural light. The second issue revolves around whether or not in September 2007 Mr and Mrs Mackay effectively instructed WLC to stain all the veneer wood throughout the house and whether WLC should have advised or warned DMW or the Mackays that the staining or staining process would or could suppress the effect of the natural grain. Whilst the second issue is arguably the most important issue, the first issue is relevant because it was the fading and changing of colour of the veneered wood which ultimately led to whatever the decision was about staining. This first issue involves a consideration of whether or not (and to what extent) WLC and Adams in effect on its behalf had some sort of design or designer responsibility to advise about the risk of fading. DMW immediately runs into difficulty on this first issue because Mr Justice Coulson has already decided in the Part 8 proceedings ([2008] EWHC 3139 (TCC)) that the fading of the ABW cannot, in the absence of an identifiable breach, give rise to a liability on WLC. There is no express term of the Contract that the wood should not fade; if WLC is not in breach of contract as such for the wood fading, it is difficult to see that it had any obligation to advise about the risk of fading. That said, it is still necessary and helpful to review what happened and what the contractual risks and responsibilities were because DMW argues that there was a design obligation on WLC which would have encompassed an obligation in effect to warn.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At some stage in the first half of 2005, Mr and Mrs Mackay had selected ABW as the wood which they wanted for the flooring and for the joinery and skirtings. On 27 May 2005, WLC invited, amongst others, Adams Joinery, to quote in relation to the joinery for "the supply and fit out of" various rooms in Unit C; this was said to be Package No WP 284 and the attached Contract Tender Enquiry document provides only general requirements for tendering, albeit it envisages that working drawings would be provided by the sub-contractor and for "design development". There is no evidence that this form of Enquiry was promulgated, required or otherwise called for specifically by DMW or anyone on its behalf. Adams Joinery quoted on 23 June 2005 (£410,275.93 for five bathrooms, two dressing rooms and two WCs) and on 8 July 2005 (£275,428.12 for the Cinema, Wine Store, Cloaks, Family Room, a WC, Library and Mrs Mackay’s study). These quotes were "for the supply and installation as per architect's drawings". There is no suggestion that the Architect’s drawings add anything which might suggest any design responsibility was being devolved through WLC to the selected joinery sub-contractor. There followed a period in which there were some discussions and negotiations on price, including as between G&amp;T and Adams Joinery.</p>

The works were briefly described as "fit out" works and there was a Schedule of Documents forming the Sub-Contract Agreement. This Schedule however related to more than just the rooms and the areas described in those two quotations and reflected further architects instructions relating to the later quotations by which WLC was again instructed to place orders with Adams Joinery "for the supply and installation" of various items of joinery. There is nothing on the face of all the Architects Instructions which called for design work as such to be done either by WLC or by Adams Joinery in relation to the joinery. The total sum identified in the Schedule of Documents was £747,573.91. The "Subcontract Pre-Order Agreement", said to have been incorporated identifies that the works extend not simply to joinery but also to other types of fit out including bathrooms and against Box 29, whilst "Full Design" was expressly excluded, "Development of Design", "Co-ordination of Design" and "Co-ordination of Design with other trades" was required. This Sub-Contract must have been entered into shortly after 6 March 2006 because the last documents referred to in the Schedule of Documents is dated 6 March 2006.</p>

No case in estoppel is pleaded by DMW in this context so, for instance, it is not being suggested that by way of some estoppel by convention the parties were proceeding on the basis that WLC had assumed a full or material design responsibility as between it and DMW. </p>

The basic design had in fact been done substantially by BLDA; this much is evident from the 39 BLDA drawings set out in the Schedule of Documents and also from the main Architect’s instruction which expressly referred to BLDA having finished the design and there being little need for “design development”. Even if, as between WLC and DMW there was some design obligation on WLC, it would be limited to "completing" the design; that must envisage that essential design decisions had already been taken and that those decisions were effectively immutable. There is no real suggestion that any obligation on the part of Adams Joinery to produce fabrication or working drawings carried with it a general design obligation or responsibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was Mr and Mrs Mackay who selected ABW as the wood which they wanted for the veneered cupboards and skirtings. This occurred essentially in 2005 at a time when Adams Joinery had not finally been engaged contractually by WLC. The documentary evidence shows that the selection of a Danish Oil finish as opposed to a lacquer finish (save in a few areas) had been made by mid February 2006. On 16 February 2006, BLDA emailed Adams Joinery confirming this. Bev from DMW’s interior designers did not like the lacquer finish because it looked "cheap" and Mr and Mrs Mackay did not like the lacquer finish, as confirmed in Bev’s email dated 17 February 2006 to BLDA. This selection was made notwithstanding the clear recommendation of Mr Hawks of Adams Joinery that lacquer was better because it gave added durability; he repeated that advice in an e-mail to BLDA on 17 February 2006, expressing his great concern. This is important because it does not appear that at least those advising Mr and Mrs Mackay were placing any significant reliance on what Adams Joinery were saying about this. To the extent that they were relying on anyone, the Mackays were relying on the interior designer (Bev) and BLDA. Mrs Mackay gave evidence that she went to Reliance Veneers in March 2006 but this must have been simply to select the particular piece of ABW from which the veneer was to be taken. The basic decision about using ABW had been made already many months before because Adams and others had been asked to quote for the use of ABW. Adams did send various samples of ABW in March 2006 and, I find, it is likely that they did not have a sticker on the back which suggested that the veneer might fade in sun light. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the General Chronology, I refer to some of the history as to the discovery of the perceived problem. This began to emerge mostly in June 2007 and, initially, there was complaint and concern that the Mackays had not been advised or warned that either wood generally fades or that ABW not only fades but also somewhat changes colour. Mrs Mackay thought that it was going yellow (although later she and her husband were to refer to it as orange). When she reported this to Sonya Hammond by e-mail on 25 June 2007, the latter’s response was that "the veneer will change in colour as it ages and is exposed to light"; she suggested that it would be possible to “stain it to any shade you find more agreeable if you prefer". Mrs Mackay's response later that evening was somewhat abrupt but she emphasised that she would have expected BLDA to “have spotted the problem anyway and asked for a solution on our behalf”. Again, this suggests that the reliance of the Mackays in this context was on their architect or possibly interior designer as opposed to WLC or Adams Joinery. The problem continued to be raised in the following walk around meetings. For instance at a meeting on 4 July 2007 Mr Davis of BLDA confirmed "that old timbers will change colour as they age and are exposed to day/sun light"; he said that it "was fortunate that the changing is occurring uniformly across the unit".</p>

There were natural variations in the colour of timber across the grain from a rich dark brown to a lighter orange-brown”. The TRADA expert carried out a detailed inspection throughout the house; he was the view that the use of the Danish Oil was "unlikely to cause" the colour change. He was of the view that the "stain has provided a high quality uniform finish" albeit that "the result of the stained walnut does not match the specified walnut veneer". He considered the specification in the context of the matching of skirting lengths; by reason of the staining he could not assess whether there were significant variations in the colour or shade of adjacent sections of the skirting boards.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By sometime in December 2007, Mr Mackay was seeking to have the whole of the ABW veneered wood replaced; that was called for in an e-mail from Mr Mackay on 10 December 2007. Mr Bates of WLC replied on 11 December 2007 saying that it had "correctly carried out veneered walnut joinery to the specification and AIs”; he believed that the "issue appears to lie with what aesthetic you perceived you would be getting as to what you have got". He said that WLC, Adams, BLDA and TRADA all believed that WLC had complied with “the specification in full by installing quality natural materials to a high standard of workmanship". This belief had been expressed by those four parties. However, Mr and Mrs Mackay clearly believed that the work was defective and, as Mr Mackay said at a meeting on 12 December 2007, either WLC accepted that or he would arrange for work to be undertaken and recover all costs from WLC. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position of the Mackays from about this time on (and as put forward by them in evidence) was that they did not authorise staining for the whole house at the meeting of 19 September 2007 but only a limited amount of staining within the Guest Suite and that the sample was not the third floor entrance door to it, as had been stained by Adams before that meeting. So far as my findings of fact are concerned, I am totally satisfied that Mr Mackay did positively instruct and ask WLC to stain all the veneer throughout the house and that the sample against which the staining, so to speak, to be measured, was to be that of the entrance door which had been stained by Adams before that meeting for that very purpose. My reasons are as follows:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) I found Mr Joyce to be a wholly believable witness generally but particularly on this topic. </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(c) Within a very short time after the meeting (on the same morning), Mr Fairweather who was at the meeting was instructing Adams to stain throughout the house. With a client who was known to be difficult and before the minutes had come out, he must have been absolutely clear on what had been said. It is unrealistic to believe that he would have made it up.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(d) The minute was not challenged by either Mr or Mrs Mackay. Since the ABW was something which was close to their hearts, and because they had been concerned in the past about the accuracy of minutes, it is not credible that they did not challenge these minutes if they were inaccurate in this particular regard. BLDA never withdrew or revised the minute.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(e) The later minutes, particularly in October 2007, do not hint at any complaint that staining was being done throughout the house. Again, it is simply not credible that WLC had not been instructed to stain throughout the house. If there was any issue about that, I would have expected it to have been raised in these later October meetings or at the very least in some contemporaneous documents; this did not occur.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(f) Simply, I did not find the evidence particularly of Mr Mackay on this topic credible; he was extremely faltering under cross-examination on the topic, unsurprisingly in one sense because almost all of the contemporaneous documentation, unchallenged by him, undermined what he was saying. Although Mrs Mackay was in some respects a "better" witness than Mr Mackay, I found her evidence on this area of the case particularly unconvincing. It is interesting that on several copies of the October meeting minutes she wrote various notes qualifying what had been minuted. She also did not challenge the 19 September 2007 meeting minutes and her solicitor background would have warned her of the need to challenge the minutes on a topic such as this, close as it was to her heart, if the minute did not clearly recall what was said.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What is clear to me is that Mr and Mrs Mackay were very disappointed in the summer of 2007 that the veneered wood had altered colour from that which they were expecting. BLDA had suggested that staining the wood might well get the wood to the colour which they wanted and with their knowledge and consent the main door to the Guest Suite was stained by Adams to be considered as an appropriate sample. Mr and Mrs Mackay saw that sample and, as the minute of 19 September 2007 indicates, liked what they saw and Mr Mackay expressly and clearly told WLC to go ahead and stain the veneer throughout the house. They found on reflection after the work was done that they did not like it because it took away, in their minds, some or all of the aesthetic qualities which they were looking for. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another very important factor is that the Mackays, when later in 2008 they instructed Interior Joinery to remove the old stain applied in September and October 2007, obviously approved an even darker stain throughout the house than that which was applied by WLC; this second staining operation has, to an even greater extent than before, covered the more natural look of the ABW. This supports the view that their state of mind back in September 2007 was that a dark stain was to be provided throughout the house because they repeated the mistake (if it was a mistake at all) some 8 months later. Whilst they now believe adamantly that the staining by WLC was a culpable mistake on its part, the mistake, if such it was, was that of the Mackays. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows from what was said earlier that I do not consider that WLC had any design responsibility for the selection of ABW in this case. There was no material notification of them that the joinery in general or the selection of the ABW in particular was an aspect of the design which was to be devolved upon WLC. If there was no material design responsibility, there can in logic have been no obligation on the part of WLC via Adams or otherwise to advise the Mackays that the ABW might fade or change colour in time on exposure to natural light. As indicated above, I do not consider in any event that the Mackays were relying on WLC or even Adams for that; to the extent that they were relying on anyone, it was BLDA or Bev. The selection of the ABW and the Danish Oil occurred before there was a sub-contract in law between Adams Joinery and WLC. As rightly accepted by Mr Sears QC for DMW, if there was no overall design liability on the part of WLC in relation to ABW, there was no duty to warn either that it might fade or that if stained it would lose or suffer a reduction in whatever aesthetic quality appealed to the Mackays.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is suggested that there remain some other defects. One other complaint is that WLC ensured that the feature is an ingrained pattern allying to regulate and/or symmetrically with the result that there was a marked variation in the colour of the ABW from one part of the skirting to another. It is claimed that the ABW is defective because it is not “book matched” (the practice of matching two (or more) wood surfaces, so that two adjoining surfaces mirror each other in appearance, thus giving the impression of an opened book). However, I am satisfied that there was no design/specification requirement for the veneers to be book-matched. On the contrary, the requirement in the specification was for "features and grain pattern aligned regularly and symmetrically” which I am satisfied has been installed. It appeared to be common ground between the experts that what one must do in that situation is one’s “best” with the veneer selected, given that there will be some variations between adjoining bits of veneered surface. BLDA at the time saw what had been carried out and was satisfied that it was in accordance with the specification and amounted to good workmanship. Another point was relating to the filled fixing pin heads; the only relevant evidence on the point is that it was normal practice to face-pin vertical (mitred) joints with lost-head pins, face filled, which is what has been done correctly by WLC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These relatively minor points in any event have been "lost” or covered over by the re-staining exercise done by Interior Joinery in 2008 which was done as a matter of choice by the Mackays.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An odd feature of DMW’s complaint relating to the ABW is the fact that for over four years since the problems which are now the subject matter of complaint were first raised Mr and Mrs Mackay have not had the work remedied. They are clearly an extremely wealthy couple to whom the cost of putting right (as they see it) of the defective veneer is relatively minor. Mr Mackay suggested that the only reason that they had not was because they did not want to destroy the evidence. That is not an obviously credible explanation because all that they would have had to do (as Mr Mackay must have known) would have been to notify interested parties that they were intending to replace the veneer and give them an opportunity to inspect, photograph and possibly take samples and then gone ahead and done the remedial works. They have lived, apparently happily, in the house since August 2008 with veneered surfaces which they give the impression are extremely upsetting to them. I have the strongest impression that this complaint although nominally worth a substantial six-figure sum in terms of damages as well as contributing, arguably, to critical delay, is and was always perceived, at least by Mr Mackay, as a makeweight complaint.</p>

It is clear that from this time onwards BLDA played the major role in determining what the essential elements of the Courtyard Sliding doors should be. Much of this was done in direct consultation with Firman and without the involvement of WLC. For instance, BLDA wrote to Firman on 7 January 2005 referring to a meeting at which Firman had been left "to consider that two of the houses require a one way single sliding door"; BLDA sent a preliminary typical frame section and asked whether the door would be top hung or run on bottom rollers. At a Procurement Meeting between BLDA and WLC on 1 March 2005 BLDA was shown in the "Action" column for this area of work which was to "be a combination of timber and steel, yet to be designed". Although the Courtyard Sliding doors (identified as Work Package 300) were on WLC’s list attached to their letter of 21 March 2005 to BLDA as potentially being one of the Contractor Design Portion packages (indicated as "Full Design-Subject to SC [sub-contract]”), BLDA confirmed at procurement meetings on 12 April and 3 May 2005 that it was developing the design with Firman.</p>

So far as technical documents were concerned, the tenderers were sent three BLDA drawings, three location plans and the NBS L40 specification. The BLDA drawings were described as having a “Construction” status and were relatively detailed. It was known at this stage that in the Courtyard garden (that is between the Library and Swimming Pool Courtyard Sliding doors) there was to be some sort of water feature, although the detail was not known. At a site meeting on 28 June 2005 it was reported that this water feature was still to be designed. Firman submitted a hand written quotation on 29 June 2005 "to supply and fix"; Firman indicated that the doors were to be constructed of “Iroko” wood. This was discussed at a meeting between WLC and Firman on 5 July 2005 at which, for instance, the programme and required attendances were discussed. The meeting led to a revision of the price as set out in Firman’s fax letter dated 12 July 2005.</p>

It seems that, because BLDA had had extensive contacts direct with it, Firman were asked to re-quote and its new price (on 17 August 2005) came in at about £1000 less than that of Haran. At a Procurement Meeting on 16 August 2005, BLDA expressly made it clear that they would prefer Firman to carry out this work. On 19 August 2005, BLDA issued its formal instruction (AI 145C) to WLC to place "an order with FA Firman for the fabrication, delivery and erection of the courtyards screens in the sum of £117,521.06."

The Mackays of their own volition had the ceiling access to the track and drive system for the Courtyard Sliding door to the Library in effect filled in for aesthetic reasons. It was in or by April 2008 that it was appreciated by the new Architect that the doors were catching and difficult to open fully. Essentially, Navigant instructed WLC to remedy the problems; WLC took advice from the Building Research Establishment which reported in May and June 2008 and suggested that the use of timber, the weight of the doors and the introduction of a square as opposed to a sloping bead caused or contributed to the problems, and the there were "fundamental design issues". WLC did not consider that it was responsible for the problems with these doors and did not comply with the Architect’s instruction; the work was omitted on the day of Practical Completion. The Mackays have not had the defects remedied.</p>

They agree that the Library door can not be opened and the Pool door only with difficulty. The bottom framing member of the doors has deflected (some 10-12mm at its mid-point) causing it to bind on the floor mounted bottom guide pins or otherwise to bind on the floor surface. The brush ceiling strips on the underside of the doors have been adversely affected by these deflections. They agree that the use of a square as opposed to a display or sloping edge detail at the base of the glass is unsatisfactory. They also agree that this as well as the deflection of the framing members are design matters. They do not find that there is any material bad workmanship or the use of non-merchantable materials. They agree also that the location of the doors in a humid environment has been a contributory factor in the propensity of the timber to deflect.</p>

There was no and certainly no clear notification by DMW to WLC that the latter was to assume the design responsibility for these doors. As a matter of fact, the key elements of the design, such as the deployment of a wooden (as opposed, say, to a metal) frame, were decided either by BLDA or by BLDA in consultation with Firman before the NBS H13 specification was issued by BLDA to WLC in late May 2005. That document itself as well as the BLDA drawings referred to in it shows that the key design decisions had been taken by BLDA. This specification was only informally issued by BLDA to WLC; it was not accompanied by an instruction on behalf of DMW in effect notifying WLC that it was to assume design responsibility as part of the Contractor Designed Portion in respect of the Courtyard Sliding doors. The Architect’s instruction in August 2005 requiring WLC to place the order with Firman in relation to these doors does not clearly identify that WLC was to assume design responsibility.</p>

As both experts accepted, architects often talk to potential suppliers, sub-contractors or specialist designers at a very early stage to help them develop their design for the particular item of work. BLDA was not to know that Firman would necessarily succeed in securing the eventual sub-contract and, indeed, Firman initially came third in the running. If BLDA wanted somehow to protect itself or indeed its client from any unsuitability or careless advice in what Firman may have proposed in those early initial discussions between the two of them, it could have tried to secure either some warranty from Firman or, even, required Firman to provide some sort of collateral warranty once it did secure the sub-contract.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) There is no evidence that the Employer authorised, consciously, by implication or otherwise, BLDA to notify WLC that the CDP provisions should apply to the Courtyard Sliding doors. If anything, there is evidence that BLDA did not either seek or secure such authority, that evidence being the repeated attempts by WLC to obtain clarification from BLDA as to what were or were not to be treated as CDP packages. It is logical to assume that BLDA either raised the issue with DMW or did not raise it. If it raised the issue with DMW and secured approval for the Courtyard Sliding doors package to be treated as a CDP one, I infer that BLDA would have informed WLC; if it did not raise the issue, there is no reason why DMW would have thought that it was necessary to do anything about it.</p>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(c) There was a strong disincentive to BLDA, G&amp;T and DMW not to have notified WLC that the Courtyard Sliding doors and indeed the other packages were to be treated as CDP packages, which was the clear and indeed correct perception that DMW would have to pay additional monies to WLC for the privilege. These sums would have included allowances for additional PI cover as well as specific design co-ordination and design and supervision of the particular sub-contractors, in this case Firman. Throughout 2005, 2006 and indeed 2007, there was a serious pre-occupation on the part of BLDA, G&amp;T and DMW to keep costs down if at all possible, with costs just for Unit C perceived almost to have doubled from the early budgets.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(d) The giving by BLDA of the specification to WLC at the end of May 2005 did not of itself amount to some sort of notification that the Courtyard Sliding doors or "Structural Glass Assembly" document was to be treated as a CDP notification. There is nothing on the face of the document telling WLC that this was to be the case: at best, the specification was simply to be used by WLC to secure tenders from potential sub-contractors. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(e) The specification on any account does not seek to transfer an overall design obligation onto the successful tendering sub-contractor. It requires only "completion" of the "detailed design" but this must be in accordance with BLDA’s design drawings and the specification itself. Thus, the sub-contractor can not for example choose to use a framing material other than wood and it cannot deviate from the detailed dimensions set out on those design drawings. There is a very real practical and engineering difference between completing the detailed design, which simply involves finishing off what has already been (at least in relation to the Courtyard Sliding doors) substantially designed by BLDA, and assuming a full design responsibility for everything associated with such doors. The completion of the detailed design essentially means providing such design detail as is not already contained within BLDA’s design drawings and the specification. BLDA was to retain overall control in any event by the approvals process, which in this case involved active decision taking such as in relation to the glazing beads. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(f) The requirement for a specialist supplier or sub-contractor to provide fabrication or installation drawings is not an overall design function. Such drawings are always taken to mean drawings which enable the supplier or sub-contractor to fabricate or install. An IKEA flat-pack for, say a cupboard (usually) contains an installation drawing which shows how the cupboard can be put together and then fixed to the wall. A fabrication drawing will show the people in the workshop or factory the individual components and for instance their dimensions and how to put the components together. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Much reliance is placed by DMW on the sub-contractual arrangements as between WLC and Firman in that it is asserted that, as Firman was invited by WLC to quote and WLC’s order to Firman was for the "design" supply and fix of the sliding doors, WLC was acting as if it had been notified that it was to assume CDP responsibility for the sliding doors. Strictly speaking, it does not matter what arrangements were made as between WLC and Firman if, as is the case here, there had been no CDP notification to or assumption by WLC of overall design responsibilty. There is no plea of some sort of estoppel, for instance by convention. It is wholly comprehensible however that WLC might wish to protect its position just in case the CDP notification came later (which it did not). Only five weeks before the order to Firman, WLC had written to BLDA asking for clarification generally about what packages were to be subject to CDP status and there had been silence from BLDA about it. The reference to "design" in the invitation and the order is also comprehensible, in contractual terms, as being qualified and explained by the specification which simply calls upon Firman to "complete" the design and, thus, Firman was not being contractually required to design <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span> the sliding doors but, merely, to complete the detailed design in accordance with and subject to the constraints of BLDA’s design.</p>

The experts are agreed that the problems were caused by and attributable to what are essentially design deficiencies. The primary deficiency was the use of very heavy wooden frames which deflected under load, in effect causing the doors to put such pressure and load on to the bottom guide channel arrangements that they cannot easily be moved by hand let alone by the motor drive arrangements. The use of the heavy wooden frames was the design decision of BLDA which was a requirement which WLC and Firman had to comply with. As there was no overall design responsibility on WLC in relation to the Courtyard Sliding doors, it is not in breach of contract with regard to the inability of the doors to move readily or at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another causative factor, although not a primary one, was the presence of the finally designed water feature in the Courtyard between the two sliding doors. Whilst it was always known that there would be a water feature, what was not known was the precise nature and dimensions of that feature. In the result, the whole of the Courtyard comprised a flooded or totally immersed courtyard (bar some stepping stone arrangements), with spraying water jets. BLDA’s drawings for the Courtyard Sliding doors do not actually show a water feature at all but instead indicate paving with edge drainage slots. As Mr Zombory-Moldovan has, rightly, said, the immediate presence of water permanently right beside the sliding doors, together with the water jets and splashing caused by them and heavy rain, has increased the amount of moisture. This, he said, also may well have been exacerbated by landscaping and balustrade works above and around the Courtyard (not on any account the responsibility of WLC) and high level works to the Courtyard facades above the sliding doors and Courtyard glazing. The decision by BLDA to replace the sloping glazing beads actually put forward sensibly by Firman with a square one actually led to more moisture being permitted to enter the wooden frames with the result that the bottom members will tend to have distorted more than might otherwise have been the case. As WLC had no overall design responsibility, it is not liable for the consequences, contributory only though they are, in relation to the enhanced level of moisture at or close to these sliding doors.</p>

Corrosion has been found on the top track of the pool sliding door and that suggests that there has literally been no maintenance of any sort for years. Mr and Mrs Mackay’s design decision to close off any access to the motor assembly for the Library sliding door means that no maintenance can in fact be carried out without creating a major hole in the ceiling of the Library.</p>

These adjustments would raise the doors by a sufficient number of millimetres so that in effect the doors would open and close without hindrance. The costs of the adjustment solution are essentially agreed at between £10,000 and £11,000, as opposed to the £95,276 claimed.

It is about 2.6m tall and 15m long. It separates the Pool room from the shower, changing and toilet cubicles behind. It was intended to have light beamed via lighting heads fed by fibre optic cables into its interior so that it provided a uniform glow of changing light. The pool screens and doors comprise a composite construction of an outer skin of 6mm thick sand-blasted and acid-etched, toughened glass, a 2mm air-space, a sheet of 3mm thick opal acrylic sheet, a 2mm air space, a 10mm thick sheet of “Prismex”, a 4mm air space, and an inner layer of 6mm thick sand-blasted/etched, toughened glass, and these components are bonded together at their perimeters by the use of a proprietary 2mm thick adhesive tape.  Prismex consists of a clear acrylic panel which has a ‘dot-matrix’ pattern screen printed onto its face.  When light is applied to the edge(s) of the Prismex panel the dot-matrix pattern diffuses light across its face, the evenness of which is dependent on the design of the lighting as well as on the detailed design arrangement of the panel.  Prismex is commonly used for signage, and for architectural features in retail and exhibition design applications.

This is important because, whoever was responsible for the design, it was developed by a process of trial and error on site (which after four attempts still remained flawed). It is common ground that on any count WLC had no design responsibility for the lighting aspects of the Light Wall; Equation was responsible.

For instance, on 28 September 2005 Firman sent direct to Diana Grobler of BLDA a proposed detail for discussion; she sent back more details by way of a section, telling Firman that “the top and bottom need to be drilled with holes to allow light to permeate the ‘Prismex’ when the door is in a closed position”. On 26 October 2005, Firman provided a budget price only for the rear glazed wall but said that it could not quote for the front screens as "the detail shown will not work". It arranged a meeting with BLDA to discuss "an idea which could work". Following that meeting, Firman submitted a quote on the basis of a sample submitted to BLDA consisting of "aluminium top and [bottom] rails…with [stainless] steel and milled out to allow the light through”. By its tender report dated 24 November 2005, the other tenderer (Haran) having declined to tender because the work was outside its area of specialisation, WLC recommended acceptance of Firman’s quote of 10 November 2005, which had been in very simple form referring briefly to "shower-changing room fixed screens, doors and DIV’s for the sum of £75,650” and "Rear glass wall to shower-changing rooms for the sum of £22,250”. The report referred to Firman having been “working on the design and [Value Engineering] options with BLDA”.</p>

Firman played no part in this aspect of the matter but simply did what it was told in relation to accommodating the lighting and fibre optic designs and specifications. It is clear from e-mails in at November 2006 that Universal Fibre Optics identified a risk of what is called scalloping which is an irregular and non-diffuse dispersal of light. In an e-mail dated 13 November 2006 the firm advised BLDA that it would be difficult to avoid or reduce this problem.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before considering the history of the First to Fourth Generations of the Light Wall, it will be helpful if I summarise my views as to whether and if so to what extent WLC assumed design responsibility as between it and DMW. I have formed the clearest view that it did not in any or any legally meaningful sense do so. My reasons are as follows:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) I repeat (mutatis mutandis) what I said in relation to the Courtyard Sliding doors on the comparable issue. Thus, there was no notification by DMW to WLC about CDP for the Light Wall.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(b) There can on any proper factual analysis be no reliance on WLC’s lists sent to BLDA in February and March 2005 about the status of the packages because at that stage the package which was to become the one under which the Light Wall was to be procured at that stage did not even relate to Light Wall but to a Glass Walkway; the Light Wall does not appear to have been considered then either by WLC or BLDA as something which was or was necessarily to be provided. That came later.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(c) The only oblique way in which it is argued by DMW that a notification of CDP status being transferred was made is on analysis by the reference in the Elemental Description Schedule dated 31 August 2005 issued by BLDA to “L40/250”. It is common ground that there is no part of Paragraph 250 of L40 which is of any material relevance. The argument therefore goes that, as a matter of proper construction of the Elemental Description Schedule, BLDA must have been referring to L40 generally and references to the completion of the detailed design by the sub-contractor. The Elemental Description Schedule was not issued as some sort of instruction or indeed, obviously or at all, as a CDP notification under the Contract. The fact that WLC sought to incorporate L40 in its sub-contract with Firman does not mean that the Elemental Description Schedule is to be treated as a CDP notification.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(d) The need for a clear CDP notification should not be considered to be satisfied if one has to try to scrabble around to find it in documents issued by BLDA, particularly without any evidence from BLDA as to what was intended, and in a document in particular which does not obviously identify the requirement that L40 was to apply as a whole. The Elemental Description is not an instruction, let alone a CDP notification; it is at best a document in which BLDA merely tried to describe the elements which it had in mind for the swimming pool area.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(e) The only real evidence of what BLDA intended is that it did not intend to provide any CDP notification in relation to the Light Wall. Its repeated and what must have been deliberate ignoring of a series of letters from WLC seeking clarification as to design responsibility both in relation to all known packages and specifically to the Light Wall points strongly by inference to BLDA taking a conscious decision not to provide any such notification. The positive knowledge that no such notifications had been made is in the Manches attendance note later in June 2006.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(f) The fact that as such Firman actually did actively participate in the development of the design both before and after AI208C was issued or even that WLC sub-contractually retained Firman to complete or develop the design does not infer or mean that there was an effective or indeed any CDP notification from DMW to WLC.  One must therefore not confuse Firman’s active participation in the design process with WLC’s contractual responsibility to DMW. That active participation is comprehensible simply as a direct and partial direct delegation by BLDA to Firman of a design responsibility which, in contractual terms, completely by-passed WLC.</p>

JJ stated that Firmans were not ultimately responsible for the design of the glass sandwich - its design being mostly driven by the requirements of the lighting designer.

However, he also said that whether this “would have entirely prevented breakages” cannot now be known for certain. I am satisfied that his evidence on this is helpful and logical and it must follow that the provision of clamping top and bottom would have been bound to assist at least somewhat in the greater rigidity of the screen or door structure.</p>

The Second Generation Light Wall was installed in February 2007. It was an alternative composite panel design which employed sandblasted, toughened glass instead of the white laminated specification. Firman was actively involved in this design process, although it is clear that BLDA was actively involved in considering and approving what Firman put forward. The changes were in relation to the structure and composition of the wall itself. A 1.2 metre high sample was produced by Firman on about 11 January 2007 and approved by BLDA and Janine Stone (albeit not by Mr Mackay, who was not present at the inspection) on 12 January 2007. In reliance on that approval, WLC told Firman to go ahead with the manufacture of the Second Generation. The new Light Wall was then put into production on the basis of what had been approved.</p>

In other words, it was not considered sufficiently opaque to obscure the showers, toilets and changing rooms which were located behind. The problem seems to have become apparent when some temporary  illumination was provided behind the Light Wall. The actual or perceived lack of obscurity or lack of opacity was, if anything, a fundamental design flaw.  The functions of the rooms behind had been known since the outset, and had long been identified on the Architect’s drawings for the area. Therefore, it was or should have been obvious that the screen would have to provide sufficient obscurity for the rooms behind. </p>

However, there was sandblasting of the glass and there was the Prismex within the sandwich of the units which would inevitably have provided a degree of obscurity. The degree of obscurity was very much within the purview of BLDA as opposed to Firman. </p>

At the site meeting on 20 February 2007, WLC repeated that they were awaiting instructions and were told that, although BLDA, Equation and Bev had agreed on the remedial actions, they were waiting for these to be approved by the clients. On 28 February 2007 at a meeting attended by the Mackays, BLDA, Equation and Bev, Mr Mackay indicated that the proposed opal perspex interlayer was not approved and Mr Lloyd Davis indicated that other interlayers of varying opacity would be tried out and offered for approval. There was also discussion about how the application of silk within the construction would spread the fibre-optic plumes of light. At a site meeting on 6 March 2007, Mr Lloyd Davis indicated that a report had been received from a company called Light Lab procured by Mr Mackay and he had responded to Mr Mackay. He indicated that there was still disagreement about opacity although a perspex had been selected; WLC asked in effect instructions to undertake works in this context and Mr Lloyd Davis would establish what the financial consequences would be.

Reinstallation did indeed commence as planned on 11 June 2007. However, soon afterwards, on 22 June 2007, BLDA instructed WLC to stop the installation because there was still visible “scalloping” of the lights; this was a non-diffused effect rather than a general spread of light throughout the screen. BLDA asked Firman to experiment with a different tape and diffusion silk to see whether they could improve the spread of light; three Firman operatives would work on the experimentation. The period of experimentation took about 5 weeks. On 26 July 2007, Mr Mackay at a walk around meeting said that the outstanding works to the Light Wall were required to rectify a defect for which WLC was responsible. The minutes do not suggest that any of the design team voiced agreement. On 30 July 2007, BLDA issued a further AI490C instructing WLC to set the glazed screens 2 mm clear of the light source and to stick the silk strips to the bottom and top edges of the Prismex panels. The instruction also required that fascia panels were to be applied along the top and bottom of the entire glass screen in order to obscure the worst of the “flaring" (which is otherwise “scalloping”).</p>

In order to establish the cause of these suggested blemishes Firman returned one of the glazed screens to their off site facility in order that it could be disassembled and inspected.  This revealed only a limited number of blemishes on the front acid etches surface and these marks were able to be removed using a weak hydrofluoric acid solution.  There were, however, concerns that the Prismex itself had a number of scratches beyond what was considered to be acceptable tolerances.  Firman wrote to WLC on 16 October 2006 following a visit to a specialist fabricator of the Prismex and reported that it had "a dot matrix pattern screen printed onto the surfaces” and that "due to the very nature of this product it cannot be guaranteed to be free from defects and discrepancies"; this was contained in an extract from the selling specification. To the naked eye, it wrote, panels would be acceptable and in accordance with the specification but if one lit each and every individual panel only two or three out of 18 panels would be acceptable; another problem was noted to be the need to remove a low tack film from each side of the Prismex which could lead to handling marks. It is clear that there were also some scratches which were unavoidably caused during the two additional re-fabrication exercises involved in the Second and Third Generation work because the panels had to be disassembled and the Prismex removed and then re-placed within the assembly. Mr Zombory-Moldovan said that these scratches were effectively unavoidable even if the work in the workshop was done with reasonable care. I accept that evidence as logical. </p>

Following an instruction (AI455C) from BLDA, this required, once again, the glazed screens to be returned to Firman’s off site facility, disassembled and re-assembled with the new Prismex panel.  This followed Firman’s assembly of a single panel for inspection, testing and approval by BLDA and Equation.

The Architectural experts agree that the first two are design matters. The fourth allegation is essentially also one of design. As for the absence of cover plates, it is likely that the WLC delivered such plates to site for installation but they were not installed; Mr Zombory-Moldovan has seen that two of them have been used on site elsewhere. It seems that the absence of the cover plates is likely to be an incomplete part of the work rather than a defect as such (and indeed is pleaded as such by DMW); the evidence suggests that the cover plates were not fitted pending an instruction from the Architect in relation to waterproofing of the floor spring boxes and mechanisms, which meant that the work could not be completed. </p>

There is a complaint relating to the access to the lighting in the rear walls which is that WLC should have warned DMW about the potential problem; if however there was no design obligation, there was no duty to warn about a potential design deficiency; indeed I accept Mr Zombory-Moldavan’s evidence that a warning was not required in circumstances in which BLDA had made it clear that they wanted a smooth flush backlit glass across the entire wall face which access panels would have interrupted and in any event access could have been provided for what he terms long-life service elements by removing the relevant glass panel. In relation to the cover plates, DMW by its architect omitting the work relating to the Light Wall, has effectively omitted the obligation to complete and therefore WLC has no obligation to complete this work and was not in breach of contract prior to the omission because it was awaiting instructions from BLDA in relation to some necessary prior work which had to be done before the cover plates were fitted.

Much of the glass was simply silicone bonded into the main structural openings. The connections between framing members where of bolted construction. The main horizontal frame was a rectangular ring beam of flat steel 131 mm wide by 20 mm thick. It had welded corners and would have had to be lifted into position as a single component.

Some issues were highlighted in BLDA’s letter dated 26 September to WLC such as the finishing of the shaft and metal work which was addressed by WLC and its sub-contractor and agreed to be satisfactory by BLDA. These issues however, broadly, seem to have been resolved before the end of 2006. </p>

It is clear that at about that time Mr Mackay believed that the lift provided, architecturally, was a "monstrosity", as he was to write later in an e-mail dated 4 May 2007 from him to the other directors of DMW and Knowles; he had completely forgotten about this and when he gave evidence he gave contrary evidence.

As a result, BLDA indicated that the enclosed interim certificate had been adjusted to take into account this defect; the total amount which otherwise would have been allowed for the glazed lift shaft would have been £133,697.39. On 6 March 2007 a meeting was held to discuss snagging and outstanding works to all three properties The meeting was attended by BLDA, WLC, and G&amp;T (amongst others); BLDA highlighted the following three main issues with the lift shaft, namely, grinding of joints (worse on the landings), poor quality of mastic with silvery lines caused by light “diffracting” and glass bowing. It was however reported that Mr Malishev considered that the shaft was generally fit for purpose and compliant with the specification. On 7 March 2007 Knowles wrote to WLC saying that the full value of the lift work, £133,697, would be withheld by DMW. This was clearly an aggressive move, which was probably unjustified given both that Mr Malishev considered that the lift was broadly compliant with the specification and that there had already been a reduction within the interim certificate for what BLDA and G&amp;T believed was appropriate for the perceived lift defects. </p>

The stainless steel trims had been inspected by BLDA and found to be acceptable as complying with the specification as had the joint couplers. There was an issue between the parties in relation to the mastic; although WLC accepted that the mastic exhibited a "mirroring effect" which was neither aesthetically pleasing nor accepted by the Mackays and that some of the mastic was of a poor standard, it believed that the silvering or mirroring effect was essentially an unavoidable design problem attributed at least in part to the impact of the use of glass.  This was recorded in a report dated April 2007 from WLC who had also brought in the Glass and Glazing Federation to report. The works which WLC accepted responsibility for were mostly put right in the first half of May 2007.</p>

However, there remained a number of areas in dispute, namely, the finish to the stainless steel joints/couplers was said to be unacceptable, the bowing to the glass panels had, it was said, not been satisfactorily resolved and BLDA remained of the view that the mastic was unsightly and that the fixing detail at the head of the lift shaft was unsatisfactory. WLC wrote back on 27 June 2007 substantially disagreeing.

He decided that the value of the lift frame should have been included in the previous interim certificate as it was not defective. He found that scratches to the glass had been adequately addressed and any scratches existing on 1 June 2007 were minimal and insufficient to justify withholding of the value of the glazing. He found that the general finish and appearance of the alloy trims and joint couplers was not satisfactory as they were not fixed or cut in accordance with the lift shaft specification; he found that a deduction of £5,000 for this default was reasonable. The surface finish of the mastic joints was generally inconsistent and poor in places and the rear face of the mastic had not been recessed as detailed. Although he accepted the BRE report, he found that £25,000 represented a reasonable sum in relation to what he found was a defective application of the mastic. In total therefore, the adjudicator found that over £100,000 had been wrongfully withheld. </p>

At another such meeting on 12 September 2007 Mr Bates of WLC demonstrated some bronze cladding. On 13 September 2007, WLC made to Mr Mackay a without prejudice proposal with regard to over-cladding. It offered (for free) to over clad the lift enclosure vertical steel hollows with bronze cladding on the basis that neither DMW nor WLC made any claim for delay against the other. It was predicated upon the basis that "irrespective of the standard of finish achieved to the joints, you dislike the general appearance of the exposed mastic and steelwork".

By October 2007, the only means of access to the upper floors was by way of the staircase that went around the lift shaft from the ground to the third floors. It is undoubtedly the case that the over-cladding work primarily between about 11 or 12 October and the end of that month did somewhat restrict access but it certainly did not prevent it. Mr Howie and Mr Joyce gave evidence to this effect; Mr Bartlett indicated that artists and tradesmen directly employed by the Mackays were working on the upper floors during this period.

This is because WLC accepted at the time that it would carry out these works at its own costs and as if doing it pursuant to an instruction requiring remedial works under Clause 8.4.2 of the Contract Conditions, which necessarily implies that it was putting right something which was its responsibility; there was to be no extension of time, and indeed it is no part of WLC’s Case or evidence that it was in any way delayed by the need to do the over-cladding work. The agreement to do this simply arose from WLC’s wish to draw a line under the lift issues and, although a significant part of its reasoning was that the over-cladding work resolved aesthetic or design objections which Mr Mackay (for which WLC was not responsible), another part of its reasoning was that there remained some mastic and other workmanship issues which would be difficult to address. </p>

However, these were put right mainly in the period up to the adjudication decision and they did not take an enormous amount of time or resources to resolve. It is clear that Mr Mackay either allowed himself or Knowles to exaggerate the extent, impact and scope for the Lift defects but that is consistent with the adopted strategy. A particular and good example is the continued withholding from WLC of a sum representing the total value of the lift and lift shaft works which was not simply unjustified; it was aggressive and it must have been known to Mr Mackay certainly by the adjudication and probably well before that the chances of holding on to the whole of the retained sum was close to nil.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The ceiling finishes to the Pool Hall and the Cinema in the Basement of Plot C incorporated illuminated ceilings which comprised two principal elements, the first of which is an elaborate lighting installation fixed within a recess to the structural soffit of the ground floor above; the intention was to provide diffused light which changed colour on a recurrent basis. The second element is the “Barrisol” ceiling which is fixed below the lighting installation.  A Barrisol ceiling is essentially a suspended ceiling system consisting of two basic components, a perimeter track and lightweight PVC membrane. The aluminium track is first installed to the line and shape that the finished ceiling will take.  Once the track is installed, lined and levelled, the PVC sheet (less than a millimetre thick) is then laid out and heated so that the PVC sheet becomes workable and able to be stretched.  Once the PVC sheet has been sufficiently heated it is then stretched and clipped into the perimeter track. The PVC sheet then cools and tightens into its final shape, tension and consistency. The PVC was about 50 m² for the swimming pool area and somewhat less for the Cinema.</p>

The gaps between the ends of the fluorescent strip lights resulted in dark areas (or lines) running perpendicularly to the direction of the lights. Equation asked WLC to have the Barrisol sub-contractor to hold up a sample so that they could test the lights before the ceiling was put in place. There were problems with Sound Ideas, a firm directly engaged by DMW to supply and install equipment in the ceilings and, as recorded in an e-mail dated 22 June 2007 from WLC to BLDA, it was proposed that Barrisol should not complete their installation until Sound Ideas had adjusted their equipment. This work by Sound Ideas took some time, until about 5 July 2007.</p>

The Barrisol ceiling in the pool was installed on 20 July 2007. By 26 July 2007, there had been continuing experimentation by WLC with the lighting effects in the pool hall ceiling and there continued to be a striping and shadow effect which was not acceptable to the client. A similar problem in the cinema ceiling was also reported at the Client Site Walk Around meeting on 26 July 2007. On 27 July 2007, BLDA issued AI485C which instructed WLC to request Stretch Ceilings (the installers of the Barrisol Ceiling) to remove the Barrisol ceiling in the Pool Hall. The Barrisol ceiling in the Cinema had already been taken down on 20 June 2007 (pursuant to AIs 492C and 496C) and was reinstalled (although not for the final time) on 28 August 2007. A complaint was made about the Barrisol ceiling material, which was manufactured in certain widths and was therefore jointed at the seams, to the effect that the joints should have been centralised. However as WLC pointed out, in an e-mail to BLDA on 27 July 2007, there had to be joints and there had been no specification as to the position of the jointing; in effect this could not be a valid criticism. </p>

In August 2007, BLDA issued variation instructions AIs 485, 486, 491 and 492 as well as those referred to below in relation to the Barrisol ceilings. RLB reported to Knowles on 6 August 2007 that Equation acknowledged this as "their fault" and had "offered to put it right at their cost". Pursuant to this concession, Equation itself provided six additional fluorescent batons to be installed to the Cinema ceiling and for existing fittings to be relocated to replace six of the fittings. These fittings were still awaited on 15 August 2007. On 16 August 2007 AI498C instructed further lighting revisions to the Pool Hall ceiling. Equation spent the whole week commencing 13th August 2007 on the site seeking with various workmen to resolve shadowing in the pool hall ceiling.  AI513C on 20 September then instructed further changes to the Pool Hall ceiling, changing the lights to LED rather than fluorescent in order to achieve a “twilight” effect.</p>

There was no suggestion that this programme was unreasonable. More changes to the lighting were instructed by AI513C dated 20 September 2007 based on a directive received by BLDA on 19 September and revisions to Equation’s design; work on the new free issue lighting had been suspended by Mr Mackay and Equation on 19 September 2007. Between 20 September and 4 October 2007 two types of sample lighting at either end of the swimming pool were installed.

AI551 was issued to this effect after the meeting. Barrisol’s position was justified on the basis that the ceiling material had been taken up and down on a number of occasions and it simply and unavoidably got somewhat stretched as a result and that Barrisol had acted with reasonable care. AI552C also issued after the site this meeting on 12 December) instructed Norstead to install the newly specified LED lights to the Cinema. This work was carried out between 8 and 28 January 2008.

This was mostly attributable to the need constantly to change and adjust the lighting and the lighting configurations; it was unnecessary to decide whose fault this was on DMW’s side but certainly the evidence strongly points to Equation to a large extent. There was never any real suggestion that WLC was responsible for the delays involved in securing completion of these two areas of work.</p>

The height of the doors is approximately 3.6m. The terminology of ”stingray” doors was used to describe the texture and finish of the doors, which are intended to resemble the skin of a stingray. The stingray finish was to be achieved by first cutting to size 12mm MDF panels which are then faced with bronze cladding.  The bronze cladding was to be sent off site to a company based in Greenwich called Based Upon to be finished with the “stingray finish” which was applied off-site. The finished stingray panels were to be positioned into a brass trim frame fixed to the door blanks.  In order to form the MDF panels it was first necessary for the brass trims and other ironmongery (such as pull handles and ironmongery) to be applied to the door blanks for site measurements to be taken.  The MDF panels were then sent off site to be cut to size before having their stingray finish applied. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two areas of issue relating to the Stingray doors, delays and defects. In relation to delays, WLC’s pleaded case is that firstly, following the installation of the Stingray frames and doors between November 2006 and January 2007, delays occurred to the forming of the MDF stingray finished face panels due to the late supply of free issue bronze angles on 13 July 2007 which formed the frames for the MDF stingray panels. Secondly, there was a delayed start between 13 July 2007 and 8 August 2007 of the initial cutting and temporary installation of the door face panels and the bronze angles until all the other components (including the leading edge angles and door handles) had been delivered to Adams, WLC’s sub-contractor. Thirdly, the initial cutting and installation of the door face panels, bronze angles and other components took 6 weeks between 8 August 2007 and 21 September 2007. Fourthly, the period for the off-site application of the Stingray finish to the MDF face panels took 6 weeks between 21 September 2007 and 29 October 2007.  Next, installation of the Stingray finished MDF face panels was delayed due to the late confirmation of an approval sample of the patinated leading edge angle and design of the doorstops between 29 October 2007 and 3 December 2007. The on-site installation of the stingray finished MDF face panels then took 2 weeks between 3 December 2007 and 18 December 2007. Finally, it is said that the installation of the door handles was prolonged following the completion of the stingray finished door panels due to the late supply to WLC of the free issue adhesive required to fix the door handles and back plates by 6 weeks between 18 December 2007 and 25 January 2008.</p>

A Tender Progress Meeting was held on 19 May 2006. The purpose was to deal with problems with the design and detailing of the doors, so as to allow Adams to fully price the package. In May and June 2006 BLDA provided WLC with tender information for the doors. On 2 June 2006 BLDA issued general layout and door detail drawings for construction. On 6 June 2006 BLDA asked WLC to provide a quote for the door package and the tender documents were sent to Adams, who on 22 June 2006 quoted for the supply and installation of the doors, frames and ironmongery. A 22 week programme from the order was identified by Adams, albeit not as part of its quotation, this being set out in WLC’s tender report; this programme left blank the installation of the ironmongery as “delivery details [are] awaited from Manufacturer”.</p>

Throughout August 2006, DMW was deciding whether to arrange for the supply of the ironmongery itself and there was uncertainty as to what the ironmongery would be. This was referred to in WLC’s report for the site meeting on the 22 August 2006 ("Ironmongery to plot C joinery remains unresolved"); the report went on to say that Adams was waiting for approval of certain ironmongery details but that those items were on an extended delivery and that therefore doors would lag well behind the installation of other joinery. At the site meeting on 5 September 2006, it was reported without demur that WLC was "awaiting instruction regarding plot…C ironmongery. Hoffmans has issued spec to [BLDA and SLW]. BLDA to revise instruction." Hoffmanns (or “HOF”) was to be the supplier. Ironmongery was again reported as something likely to affect progress in WLC’s report for the site meeting a fortnight later. At that meeting, it was minuted that the joinery ironmongery was still to be approved by JSI and the current plan was "for this ironmongery to be post fitted”. </p>

Somewhat later, probably by December 2006, it was resolved by DMW that it would issue such ironmongery to Adams, to fit to these doors. Mr Joyce said in evidence that Adams’ fabrication drawings were “only able to be issued on 16 November 2006” The reason given was “protracted design development and changes to the door panel sizes.” When asked about it in cross examination, Mr Joyce said that he thought the panel sizes changed in size and number but was unable to provide any further detail. When it was put to him that there was little or no documentation evidencing what he was suggesting, and that if it had been causing a significant problem one might have expected to see letters or emails making that known, he only said that “there was a lot going on at this time”. Certainly, there was uncertainty about ironmongery for the Stingray doors, not only as to whether Adams was to procure it but also as to what it was to be. </p>

As Mr Joyce said in his first Witness Statement (upon which in this respect he was not effectively challenged), WLC could not assemble the Stingray doors without the free issue materials; this was because the ironmongery back plates, bronze angles and brass division strips were required in order to work out the exact length and dimensions of the MDF panels before they could be individually cut and dry fitted before being sent off site for the finish to be applied. This was well understood by BLDA as is evidenced by its internal e-mail of 24 April 2007. The door frames and blanks for both doors were manufactured and installed by 24 January 2007.</p>

The back plates were only delivered to site on 26 July 2007 and the correct brass angles on 16 August 2007. Some changes to the design and shape of the MDF finished panels were instructed by DMW through Janine Stone in July 2007. Whilst the Stingray doors had been designed by BLDA to open in one direction only, Mr Mackay made it clear in mid August that he wished to consider the doors opening both ways; it was only on 22 August 2007 that he indicated that he was prepared to accept the original design intention. Between mid-August and the third week in September 2007, Adams marked up and cut the MDF panels which were to be fixed adjacent to the back plates; these had to be fixed to the door blanks.</p>

The installation of the doors could only be completed by 25 January 2008 because the free issue through bolts for the door handles were only delivered finally in January 2008.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am satisfied that, whatever the impact on overall progress, the Stingray doors work was materially delayed by delayed delivery of free issue ironmongery, late instructions and variations between January 2007 and the end of January 2008. This was mostly attributable to the decision on the part of DMW to procure the ironmongery itself, delays by the Design Team to secure earlier delivery of the ironmongery than was achieved, delays in the provision of information, and changes being made or considered. Again, it is unnecessary to decide whose fault this was on DMW’s side but certainly the evidence strongly points to JSI and DMW’s ironmongery suppliers to a large extent. There was never any real suggestion that WLC was responsible for the delays involved in securing completion of these two doors.</p>

So far as the complaints that parts of the ironmongery are missing (linking strips) and other parts are now loose are concerned, this has simply not been proved. If ironmongery was missing, it must have been because either it was not supplied to WLC to fit or it has been taken off by others, there being no reason why WLC should have removed it. As for loose pieces, this was not noted in 2008 on snagging and it is not possible to say probably what or who caused them to be loose.</p>

On 7 June 2005 BLDA produced an Elemental Description Schedule for the Library (cross referred to drawings No. C/816 and 817). The section dealing with the joinery had an item (4.10) relating to the shelves which provided that the MDF shelves in the Library were to be "clad all around with decorative stitching to ID specification and to architect’s approval" but stated that the material was to be confirmed. It is not clear what the "ID" specification was although there was a National Building Specification reference to Z10 and M60/185.

WLC confirmed this in writing that day and on the following day sent a site instruction to Adams Joinery in relation to this. On 25 August 2006, WLC reminded BLDA that Adams Joinery required a 50% deposit for the leather and fabric, albeit that WLC would pay for this out of advance payments; these payments were probably certified the following month. There was at this stage no information as to how the leather was to be applied; there had been talk of adhesive and stitching. </p>

Up to this stage, WLC and Adams had not been asked to provide any sample of the leather stitching but on 30 October 2006 BLDA passed on to Adams Joinery and WLC Bev’s e-mail. Bev indicated in an e-mail dated 8 November 2006 to Mrs Mackay that he was going to visit "the guys who are doing all the leather work next Wednesday to ensure that they have understood what it is we are after and to do a level of quality control” going on by asking: “Do you have any feedback on the sample of the shelf and it's stitching I left on Monday”? It is not clear who "the guys" are; although it could be Adams Joinery or Courtney Contract Furnishers (“Courtney”), WLC’s report for the site meeting of 14 November 2006 identifies that a visit to "the upholsterer is planned for w/c 13 Nov”. </p>

It is absolutely clear that by 18 February 2007 no decision had been reached in relation to the stitching because on that date Adams Joinery was providing quotations to WLC for three alternative types of stitch (“small hand-stitched, zigzag and looped”). On that date WLC produced a list of outstanding works which in relation to all joinery in the library said that it was "awaiting instructions the leather stitching. 10 further samples offered 5th February”; it was explained that once the stitching was accepted a price and programme would have to be offered.

It was also recorded that "the leather is very soft so the parallel lines are easily distorted" although Mr Mackay stated "that he has seen examples of this done successfully". It was agreed that a meeting should be organised with Courtney to discuss the technical solution. That meeting took place on 26 April 2007 attended by Courtney, Adams Joinery, WLC, BLDA and Bev; they looked at a sample which Mr Mackay had provided and there was agreement that it was not relevant; however having discussed the matter in some detail it was resolved that Courtney would produce one more sample. For instance, there was agreement that to avoid a raised seam effect the timber shelf underneath was to be grooved to take the double thickness of leather at joints.

Work was further delayed as a result of the need to install a fresh air duct behind the Library joinery, this work was not completed until 6 September and affected the installation of the shelving. A further design change affecting joinery installation in the library was that instructed by AI510C on 4 September 2007 which resolved a design clash between a bulkhead and the higher level leather clad shelving.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One first needs to analyse whether WLC had any design responsibility transferred to it in relation to the Leather in the Library. For reasons already given in relation to ABW, there was no such CDP transfer to WLC; nothing in the history of events relating to the introduction of the Leather in the Library suggests any such transfer. WLC as between it and DMW had no such or any material design responsibility. Even if there was an obligation imposed on Adams by WLC to "complete the design/detailing" of this Leather, that would not create some sort of design responsibility as between WLC and DMW. In any event, the Leather work was excluded from the Adams Joinery quotation which WLC was instructed to accept and it only came back into the equation by way of a relatively informal variation arrangement; in relation to the Leather in the Library (as opposed to the Lower Hall Lobby), there was no formal Architect’s instruction, albeit there is no issue that WLC was asked to instruct Adams Joinery ultimately to do this work.</p>

Even if and to the extent that Adams or its upholsterer sub-contractor, Courtney, were involved in the process of selection, any delay or incompetence on their part in that process would not be the contractual fault of WLC. To the extent that BLDA and Bev decided to use Adams Joinery and Courtney to help them assist Mr and Mrs Mackay in their selection of leather and stitching, that was their choice.</p>

They had no responsibility at all prior to March 2006 when the sub-contract between WLC and Adams Joinery was entered into. They had no responsibility indeed until about August 2006 when it could first legitimately be said that WLC was instructed, albeit informally, to go ahead with instructing Adams Joinery to proceed with the Leather in the Library. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if there had been some responsibility earlier, I have formed the overwhelming impression that the delay was all on the side of the Design Team and in part on the Mackays themselves. Whilst it is true that Mr Mackay had indicated to Bev that he had approved in mid-2005 what Bev had shown him, there is no indication that this was passed on to Adams Joinery or indeed to WLC. Indeed, all the documents produced (such as the Elemental Descriptions) were telling WLC that the type and detail of the Leather was "to be confirmed". There was no Interior Designer specification which identified the type of the leather or the type of stitching, at least which was produced to WLC. It is clear that going into 2006 the Design Team was worried about cost and tried to secure from Adams Joinery prices for other leathers. It was only in August 2006 that the Mackays and the Design Team indicated to WLC that they had selected what turned out to be the eventual type of leather to be used.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no specification for the type of stitching initially and Bev appears to have taken it upon himself to talk to Courtney in November or December 2006 as to what might be appropriate. There was then essentially a development primarily by Bev, albeit occasionally consulting with the Mackays, of an understanding of what might be not only acceptable to the clients but also practicably achievable. In effect, Bev largely but to a lesser extent BLDA were working out what they (together with their clients) wanted. This included consideration of different types of stitching detail and the provision of padding under the leather. This process went on up until May 2007. DMW suggests that the delays up to May 2007 were largely attributable to the production by Adams Joinery or Courtney of "unacceptable" samples. Whilst it is true that most of the earlier samples were not accepted by Bev, BLDA or the Mackays, that does not mean that they were or were necessarily sub-standard. There was simply, in my judgement, an evolving design process by which the Design Team and the Mackays got to a point that what was eventually produced in May 2007 was acceptable to them, aesthetically and practically. The whole process was in any event confused by changes of mind on the part of the Mackays, not the least of which was the requirement that the stitching should be like that on leather seats in an Aston Martin or Range Rover car. </p>

In relation to plaster on plasterboard, K10 provided for "permissible" deviation across joints of 3 mm, external angles of 4 mm and internal angles 5 mm (Paragraph 650a); for the "skim coat plaster finish" of a thickness of 2-3mm, the finishing was to be "Trowel/float to a tight, matt, smooth surface with no hollows, abrupt changes of level or trowel marks”. </p>

BLDA went some way to agreeing this in that it applied the same tolerance standard as that suggested by WLC, namely deviations not exceeding 3 mm in any consecutive 1.8 m direction were acceptable (as referred to in a report of Knowles dated 6 March 2007). It is also clear that even Knowles considered that the plastering defects said to exist in the coffered ceilings were exaggerated. BLDA said at the "Snagging and Outstanding Work" meeting on 6 March 2007 that Mr Lloyd Davis had seen many of the rooms and that "many may be within the specification and that the problem areas may be caused by visual deceptions relating to viewing angles"; he went on to say "there are two problems making it worse than it appears. The first coat of brush applied paint is naturally patchy and catches the light differently, and second, the fine finishing filler is being applied with a metal edge"; he suggested that a plastic edge be used. By 20 March 2007, Mr Joyce reported to a Progress Meeting that the remedial plasterwork had been finished and that the walls were within tolerance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Meanwhile, Knowles on behalf of Mr Mackay had retained surveyors called Chantons in March 2007 to survey the premises. On 3 April 2007, Mr Mackay demonstrated in an e-mail to Knowles that he was taking a very personal interest in the exercise involving Chantons, in particular in relation to a meeting several days later; specifications should be got together "so we can prove the defects"; he called for lights on site to shine at the walls to "help show up these defects", ending up that this was "our best chance to nail this once and for all". On 5 April 2007 there was a site meeting at which two setting out engineers from Chantons were present.  Mr Joyce recalled in evidence that Mr Mackay claimed that all of the plastering in Plot C was defective and that he instructed one of the setting-out engineers to "prove" this by applying a carpenter's square to both internal and external corners. He says that he was asked by Mr Mackay to agree that the plaster was "defective" but he refused to do so. There was then another meeting at which Mr Mackay was not present (attended by Mr Joyce, Mr Bates and Mr Rough for WLC and Mr Bardsley of RLB) at which Mr Joyce demonstrated the correct way to measure the surface tolerances of plaster. There is little doubt that a large majority of items previously identified as defective were found to be within the acceptable tolerance. However an agreed method for a detailed plastering survey was agreed on and the following week Chantons went through the house and physically marked on the walls those areas which were out of tolerance, by reference to the agreed method.</p>

However, what was done was to identify and mark on the relevant walls with tape the relatively few areas of plastering which were outside the agreed tolerances. Knowles wrote an e-mail on 18 April 2007 to Mr Mackay attaching what was said to be the agreed survey schedules which identify just over 40 relatively small areas of plasterwork. However, this document was never issued as such to WLC; it is curiously dated 19 October 2010 and it is likely that it was never issued to WLC. Mr Joyce said and I accept that the plastering defects marked out on-site were not very widespread and there were not many of them; he said that they were "just localised very small areas" and it did not take WLC very long to do the relevant remedial work.</p>

For instance at a Client Site Walk Around meeting on 23 April 2007 Mr Mackay agreed that the remedial work on the third floor looked better, albeit that he said that it required more work to be done to bring it to an acceptable standard. The work in question was substantially completed by 25 April 2007. It does appear that there were one or possibly two minor areas identified on 9 and 16 May 2007. It appears likely that several other minor plastering deficiencies were noticed in November 2007 albeit it is probable that they were put right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is worthwhile observing both that the perceived problems with the plastering defects arose very shortly after Mr Mackay had retained Knowles and had embarked upon the strategy to put pressure on particularly BLDA and WLC and that it was he, Knowles and RLB who took the lead in complaining about the plasterwork defects. There can be no doubt that there were some defects but it is equally clear that they were exaggerated. I do not suggest that Mr Mackay deliberately and dishonestly exaggerated the extent of the defects but he was much too quick off the mark to criticise WLC. He was not supported wholly by his own architect in these criticisms. The truth is that ultimately, upon advice, he accepted that the specification drawn up by his own Design Team did not provide as high a quality as he might have expected for the plasterwork; it may be that the Design Team can be criticised for that and for producing a more "commercial" level of specification. He was also prepared to accept the accommodation reached between Chantons, RLB and WLC in April 2007 whereby only the areas marked by tape on the walls (and possibly ceilings) were to be put right. </p>

However, in this context the Architectural experts are agreed that as to cracking in finishes as noted, these are such that might occur during the defects liability period as a result of drying out and shrinkage and would be resolved as part of the contractor's normal defects liability duties. They do not indicate a deficiency in construction. As to the crack in “His Study”, this is likely to have occurred as a result of blockwork shrinkage and remedial work would entail cutting out the plaster along the cracked line, filling/grouting the block work crack, fixing reinforcement mesh and reinstating plaster locally. In those circumstances, I do not consider that there is any liability on the part of WLC.</p>

It is unnecessary and undesirable to examine these hundreds of items in any detail. There is no suggestion that that any one of the listed snags was particularly serious and there is no doubt that they could all have been put right promptly and expeditiously. However, as the earlier and later parts of this judgement make clear, there still remained throughout 2007 substantive work which remained incomplete; this for instance included the Light Wall, the Barrisol ceilings, the Leather in the Library and the Stingray doors. As 2007 went on, it was and must have become clear that, irrespective of the snagging which was being identified and was being put right, the Works would not be achieving Practical Completion by reason of other matters. </p>

Nonetheless, I accept Mr Howie’s evidence that their presence disrupted the snagging process in 2007; he said for instance that BLDA had difficulties in snagging because artists and tradesmen were in the way and protection provided by WLC to its finished work was preventing them from getting on. Additionally, there was some dilatoriness on the part of BLDA in its participation in the snagging process; they engaged an independent consultant, Mr Syme, to do this exercise and it is clear that he was seriously overstretched both in terms of time and also because he had not previously been involved significantly in the project; this was highlighted in a letter of Mr Howie to BLDA of 19 September 2007. </p>

He also classified the snags in to categories: “Not a defect” (120), “Not WL - Out of Contract" (104), “Not WL – Damage by A&amp;Ts” (4), “WL but de minimis” (1193), “WL not de minimis” (38), “Info required to complete” (57) and “Already PC (staff areas)” (138). He identifies a total of 1654 snags. Whilst it is possible that this classification is not 100% accurate, I am wholly satisfied that it is broadly accurate. The largest category (the WLC “de minimis” work) was such that I am satisfied that but for the other problems the snagging operation in 2007 did not materially or at all impact upon the overall completion. This is because I have no doubt that if the snagging was the main and critical item of work left to be completed it would all have been resolved in all probability within several weeks at most. In so far as there is any criticism in relation to the other heads, it is not valid for the reasons given by Mr Howie. </p>

This involved a more detailed analysis of the WLC diaries. However, Mr Mackay’s extensive work and many of DMW’s Counsel’s observations were simply not put to Mr Howie. It is generally unacceptable and undesirable, if any significant points are to be made on the evidence in closing, for key elements not to have been put to the relevant witnesses on the other side. It means that Mr Howie did not have the opportunity to react to any such points and it strongly gives the impression that the points only taken in the closing submissions were either not considered at all before the end of the evidence or have simply arisen as afterthoughts on what might have been the case. In this case, DMW’s Counsel accepted that Mr Mackay’s analysis attached to the closing submissions was in part materially based on documents which were not in the Court bundles. This again is very unsatisfactory. It leads me to the view that I should attach very little weight to this analysis. Insofar as DMW is simply making the observation (which it does) that in 2007 and early in 2008 few of the snags were attributable to damage or incompetence on the part of directly employed artists and tradesmen, I have broadly already accepted that and, indeed, Mr Howie’s own analysis shows only 4 of the 1654 snags were attributable to damage by them.</p>

The essence of what both Mr Joyce and Mr Howie say is that there were substantial numbers of workmen engaged by such artists and tradesmen and that they were substantially responsible for many of the further snags listed in 2008, initially by BLDA but after their dismissal later by or on behalf of Navigant. Navigant employed a firm called Hickton to do the snagging exercise. Mr Howie produced a further analysis (JCH2) of the Hickton snagging lists which showed that of the 1696 items listed, 1048 were attributable to directly employed artists and tradesmen, 145 required instructions from Navigant, 67 involved damage by others and only 436 (26%) needed to be addressed by WLC. WLC’s evidence, which I accept, was that matters which were the responsibility of WLC (which were extremely minor) were addressed promptly but their progress was impacted by all the other snagging work which was not its responsibility. There was and is a somewhat sterile debate on the evidence as to how many directly employed artists and tradesmen were on site. It is unnecessary to decide precisely how many but it is absolutely clear that there were a substantial number in 2008 in the period leading up to certified Practical Completion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept Mr Howie’s evidence and analysis in relation to the Hickton exercise. He said under cross-examination that his analysis was based on what was essentially agreed between Mr Gad of WLC and Hickton at the time. This was based on an Excel spreadsheet compiled by Mr Gad from the lists produced by Hickton onto which he put his comments as to who was responsible, these then being sent back to Hickton and Navigant, who agreed them. He said in evidence that it was "absolutely definitively agreed". He was not challenged in any material way about the contents of his second exhibit and he was convincing. The efforts made by Mr Mackay in his extensive A3 analysis (attached to his Counsels’ closing submission) to seek to undermine that are wholly unconvincing because he was not directly involved in the snagging process; DMW decided not to call anyone from Navigant or Hickton as a witness. At most, Mr Mackay has simply tried on some ex post facto and second or third hand basis to try to undermine what Mr Howie has said. That is essentially an exercise to which I can give little weight.</p>

Whilst the Architect prior to the actual Practical Completion can grant a prospective extension of time, which is effectively a best assessment of what the likely future delay will be as a result of the Relevant Events in question, a court or arbitrator has the advantage when reviewing what extensions were due of knowing what actually happened. The Court or arbitrator must decide on a balance of probabilities what delay has actually been caused by such Relevant Events as have been found to exist; that is by analogy to the exercise that the Architect has to do within 12 weeks of Practical Completion under Clause 25.3.3. How the court or arbitrator makes that decision must be based on the evidence, both actual and expert.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Clause 25.3.1, which deals with extensions of time being granted prior to Practical Completion, clearly envisages that the extension must relate to the extent to which "completion of the Works is likely to be delayed" by the Relevant Event or Events. The extension to be granted within 12 weeks after the date of Practical Completion (Clause 25.3.3) is to involve the fixing of a Completion Date which is "fair and reasonable having regard to any of the Relevant Events". Reading the two sub-clauses in context and together, they essentially mean the same thing. If at the latest stage it is clear that the Relevant Event in question has actually delayed the Works by, say, 10 weeks, it would be an extraordinary state of affairs if the extension of time then granted as fair and reasonable was anything other than 10 weeks.</p>

The argument was run that, if towards the end of a period of culpable delay a variation order is issued which delays completion, the Contractor was entitled not simply to an extension for the period of delay actually caused by the variation but (by reason of its timing) to a full extension up until the time that the variation was executed.

What one can not do is to identify the last of a number of events which delayed completion and then say it was that last event at the end which caused the overall delay to the Works. One needs to consider what critically delayed the Works as they went along. For instance in this case, it would be wrong to say that the problem with the Courtyard Sliding Doors delayed the Works until it emerged as a problem in April 2008. Put another way, it did not delay the Works (if at all) until it emerged as a problem which needed to be addressed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There has been a substantial debate between the parties as to how what is called concurrent (or sometimes concurrent and co-effective) causes of delay should be dealt with. This debate is only germane where at least one of the causes of delay is a Relevant Event and the other is not. It relates to where a period of delay is found to have been caused by two factors. Of course, the debate will depend upon the contractual terms in question but most of the debate in cases in this country and elsewhere has revolved around extension of time clauses similar to those contained in Clause 25 where the Architect has to grant an extension which is "fair and reasonable". The two schools of thought, which currently might be described as the English and the Scottish schools, are the English approach that the Contractor is entitled to a full extension of time for the delay caused by the two or more events (provided that one of them is a Relevant Event) and the Scottish approach which is that the Contractor only gets a reasonably apportioned part of the concurrently caused delay.

Thus, to take a simple example, if no work is possible on a site for a week not only because of the exceptionally inclement weather (a relevant event), and if the failure to work during that week is likely to delay the Works beyond the completion date by one week, and then if he considers it fair and reasonable to do so, the architect is required to grant an extension of time of one week.

In the case of the former, this is because the rule where delay is caused by the employer is that not only must the contractor complete within a reasonable time but also the contractor must have a reasonable time within which to complete. It therefore does not matter if the contractor would have been unable to complete by the contractual completion date if there had been no breaches of contract by the employer (or other events which entitled the contractor to an extension of time), because he is entitled to have the time within which to complete which the contract allows or which the employer's conduct has made reasonably necessary.”</p>

Part of the logic of this is that many of the Relevant Events would otherwise amount to acts of prevention and that it would be wrong in principle to construe Clause 25 on the basis that the Contractor should be denied a full extension of time in those circumstances. More importantly however, there is a straight contractual interpretation of Clause 25 which points very strongly in favour of the view that, provided that the Relevant Events can be shown to have delayed the Works, the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time for the whole period of delay caused by the Relevant Events in question. There is nothing in the wording of Clause 25 which expressly suggests that there is any sort of proviso to the effect that an extension should be reduced if the causation criterion is established. The fact that the Architect has to award a "fair and reasonable" extension does not imply that there should be some apportionment in the case of concurrent delays. The test is primarily a causation one.

There is common ground between the experts, and rightly so, that <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> snagging should not be a bar to Practical Completion unless there is so much of it that the building in question cannot be used for its intended purposes. Dr Aldridge however goes further and suggests that Practical Completion requirements can be relaxed in effect by agreement between the parties; he is correct to this extent. In this particular case, DMW through its Architect was entitled to omit items of work and it must follow that once an item of work is omitted it is no longer part of the Works and the fact that it has not been done or completed thereafter should not hold up Practical Completion.</p>

He adopted a much more objective approach than Dr Aldridge and was much more careful in accepting what his client had told him. Dr Aldridge’s approach was, as he put it, to consider this question:<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“what were the most significant matters which, at any given time, were preventing practical completion from being achieved?” This on its face appears to be not an unreasonable question to pose but, in seeking to answer that, he proceeded in what was in many respects a subjective way. Thus, he suggested that the defective plasterwork (which was substantially addressed by WLC within a few weeks and well before numerous other items of work which were always bound to be completed months later) caused substantial delay on no basis other on analysis than it needed to be dealt with before Practical Completion could be certified. Again, he selected the problems with the Lift in 2007 as a major cause of delay in that year but this approach was wholly flawed for the following reasons:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) He tried to assert that the Lift problems were “significant" because by about March 2007 there was a possibility (and no more) that a 6 to 9 month operation of replacement might be required; this was clearly dependent on at the very least the lift shaft being materially out of vertical, which it never was and replacement was never done.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(b) He based his view in part on “significance” in effect on the strength of his clients’ views at the time about how serious a problem it was. The reality is that WLC actually did a significant amount of remedial work and the eventual re-cladding work was in the overall context of the job minor work. The clients’ views, leaving aside the fact that I have found them to be coloured (at least in the case of Mr Mackay), were found by the adjudicator at the time (whose view has not really been departed from in this case) to be grossly exaggerated and there had been a wrongful but substantial retention of money against this item.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(c) His view was also based in part on the physical impact on the upper floors of the work being done particularly in October and November 2007 on the re-cladding. He asserted, without any real factual basis, that this work would effectively have prevented completion of work on the upper floors. This was undermined by the facts that there was little work to be done in those upper floors by WLC at or after that time (the bulk remaining to be completed in the basement) and that directly employed contractors and some workmen were able to and did get access whilst the re-cladding work was being done. Indeed, meeting minutes indicate that those attending the Client Site Walk Around meetings were able with reasonable impunity to get access to all floors throughout September, October and November.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another serious flaw in the approach adopted by Dr Aldridge was his willingness to proceed on the basis that one could ignore a number of the possible causes of delay in so far as they affected work which might have been (but which was not) omitted by DMW or its Architect. By doing this, he felt able to seek to undermine various possible causes of delay as being causative because he could say that, if a particular item of work could or might be omitted, it could not be causing a delay. This was wholly illogical. If both parties were aware that the client was considering omitting an item of work (and as a result the Contractor did nothing on the item of work) and then it was omitted, then that may or may not cause delay depending on whether other items of work were dependent upon the omitted item of work being done. If only the client was aware that it might omit the item, whether it was eventually omitted or not, delay could still be caused if the Contractor’s progress was delayed. If the item is never omitted and the Contractor has to carry it out, the Contractor may still be delayed not only by the need to execute such work but also by the delayed decision as to whether the work should go ahead or not. The reality check should generally be to consider whether or not the actual item of work which is said to cause delay was actually omitted or not. </p>

Thus, Dr Aldridge seemed to suggest that various items of work such as the Leather in the Library could be discounted in whole or in part as a cause of delay because it was possible that DMW might have omitted it altogether from the Works. In that example, of course, the Leather was not omitted. This possibility is and would be completely irrelevant to the exercise considering whether the Leather in the Library delayed the Works; it is not as if WLC was ordered to suspend work on the Leather in the Library. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Robinson had regard to the likely longest sequence of the outstanding work on a monthly basis as being the primary pointer to what was delaying the work at any one time. This was a wholly logical approach and, indeed is the approach used by most delay experts when there is a usable baseline programme from which to work. The logic is simply that if there are, say, two outstanding items of work, A and B, and A is always going to take 20 weeks to complete but B is only going to take 10 weeks, it is A which is delaying the work because B is going to finish earlier; overall completion is therefore dictated by the length of time needed for A. Put another way, it does not matter if B takes 19 weeks, it will be the completion of A which has prevented completion. Thus, if one is seeking to ascertain what is delaying a contractor at any one time, one should generally have regard to the item of work with the longest sequence. There was some sterile debate about whether Mr Robinson was adopting a purely "prospective" approach when he made it clear that "as a reality check" he had regard to what actually happened. There is in my view nothing wrong with such a "reality check". An example might be that, say in February 2007 WLC was saying albeit in good faith that an item of work would take 25 weeks from then onwards. If in reality it only took two weeks, one would need to have regard to the efficacy of the earlier statement that it would take longer. Therefore it is necessary to have regard to how long individual items actually took to perform and not just have regard to what one party or the other at the time was saying it would take.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the assessment of what events caused what overall or critical delay, one needs also to bear in mind that it is not necessarily the last item or area of work which is finished last which causes delay. Thus, often on building projects, the last item of work is the final clean up of the site. That may only take two people one day to do but it is (almost always) the job which must be done on the last day of the job. It is what delays that final operation which in itself takes no longer than it was always going to take which must be assessed. This is of some importance in this case because it is argued that snagging (or an excessive amount of it) itself delayed the project. It is, rightly, common ground that snagging always has to be done because, with the best will in the world, there will be minor deficiencies, blemishes or incomplete items of work which will be required to be completed before hand over. Obviously, if there is an excessive amount of snagging and therefore more time than would otherwise have been reasonably necessary to perform the de-snagging exercise has to be expended, it can potentially be a cause of delay in itself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The debate about the "prospective" or "retrospective” approach to delay analysis was also sterile because both delay experts accepted that, if each approach was done correctly, they should produce the same result. An underlying problem, accepted as such by both experts, was the absence of a contemporaneous critical path programme from February 2007 onwards. If there had been one and its logic was sound, then both experts would in all probability have done the prospective exercise, albeit in the light of the events which happened. When that exercise can be done, the experts take what are called time slices (usually every month) to review against the programming logic the actual progress achieved and likely to be achieved in the future. That may produce, for instance, a delay in Month 1 of three weeks caused by Factor X, which might be adjusted downwards (or indeed upwards) in Month 3, to take into account actual progress in relation to Factor X. That could not readily be done here because there was no such programme. In my judgement, WLC cannot in practice be criticised throughout 2007 for this because completion was perceived by all parties to be not very far away and there were numerous individual items of work which needed to be done, many of which were variations. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, Mr Robinson’s approach was a sensible variant on the conventional approach of delay experts which was to review on a month by month basis what in each month was probably delaying overall completion. He then applied a cross check by reference to what actually happened. However, both delay experts’ approach (albeit to a lesser extent Mr Robinson’s) involved in reality doing the exercise that the Court must do which is essentially a factual analysis as to what probably delayed the Works overall.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, in the delay assessment exercise the Court should be very cautious about giving significant weight to the supposedly contemporaneous views of persons who did not give evidence. Obvious examples are BLDA, Knowles and Navigant all of whom could have given possibly useful evidence if they had been called. Thus, BLDA expressed the view in the summer of 2007 that the problems with the Lift were seriously impacting on overall completion. One can give that little weight because it is unclear whether the relevant person who made that statement had done any analysis or had considered all the matters which have been put in issue in these proceedings or even whether it was an informed view. It is also clear that BLDA was placed under the closest scrutiny and pressure by Mr Mackay who was not only constantly critical of them but also had retained Knowles in effect to keep them under control as he would have seen it. Knowles was effectively often telling the Design Team what it could and could not do and there was undoubtedly contractually improper pressure placed on BLDA and G&amp;T. It is clear that Mr Mackay and Knowles put pressure on BLDA not to grant any further extensions of time; indeed Knowles was asked to review the extensions of time already granted. It is a fair inference that BLDA felt pressurised to withhold signs of accepting complaints or claims made by WLC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court should also be cautious about attaching weight to what Mr and Mrs Mackay thought was important. This is for two reasons, the first being the less than favourable view which I have formed about the reliability of Mr Mackay’s evidence. The second reason is that both Mr and Mrs Mackay did not, obviously or at all and perhaps not surprisingly, analyse what were the contractual risks and responsibilities of DMW and WLC respectively, particularly in relation to design and to some extent procurement. It remains unclear what DMW were advised by the Design Team or Knowles and, of course, the Court can not know what DMW was advised legally was the position. Much of the Mackays’ thinking was predicated upon the basis, at least ultimately, that WLC was responsible for the design of most of the matters in issue, such as the ABW, the Light Wall, the Courtyard Sliding Doors, and the Leather in the Library and their views appear to have been coloured by their incorrect assumption that WLC was responsible.</p>

His views on what were "significant" works were substantially (albeit not entirely) dictated by what he ascertained or assumed was the view of Mr and Mrs Mackay or their Design Team as to significance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another area of caution revolves around how one treats what the parties were saying at the time in relation to issues which later were resolved. An example of this relates to the Lift shaft, which initially was believed by some on DMW’s side to be vertically out of alignment. Within several months however, and certainly by the time of the Adjudicator’s decision on the issue in late July 2007, it was accepted on all sides that this complaint was not justified. In the early stages, there was a limited possibility that all the Lift and Lift shaft work might have to be taken out and replaced and that this could all take 6 to 9 months. In the result, this did not happen. In my view, it is therefore totally irrelevant in any analysis of what caused the delay, because certainly neither the supposed lack of verticality nor any need to replace the Lift was ever agreed upon, established or implemented. In logic also, the fact that one side (wrongly) perceives that a particular problem is more serious than it turns out to be is in itself unlikely to be relevant in ascertaining whether that problem caused delay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is first necessary to review the position as at 16 February 2007 which was the extended date for completion allowed for by BLDA. DMW now accept that the extensions of time until 16 February 2007 are not challengeable or at least they are not challenged. It is worth commenting that all the extensions of time granted in effect reflect delayed instructions or additional work. I said at the beginning of this judgement that this project was a "disaster waiting to happen" and this it proved to be. It is clear that Mr and Mrs Mackay were very unhappy with BLDA and that is a primary reason why Mr Mackay called in Knowles. Whether all the problems which occurred up to mid-February 2007 were the actionable fault of the Design Team can not now be ascertained, largely because this trial has not been concerned with the professional culpability of the Design Team. An example is the Leather in the Library (referred to in detail above) in which Mr Mackay apparently believed that he had approved the leather in about May 2005 but no-one seems to have told WLC about this let alone what the leather was. Either Mr Mackay is mistaken in his evidence or his Design Team let him down because they were telling WLC later that the leather was "to be confirmed”. Either way, that is not the fault of WLC, or indeed Adams. There may well also in mid-2006 have been a realisation on the part of the Design Team that the leather which had not been quoted for by Adams but which their client wanted would be too expensive, possibly compared with the budget. However, it was their decision (with the knowledge or consent of Mr Mackay or not) to seek further quotations for different types of leather. Again, the cause of the lateness of the instruction ultimately in relation to the Leather in the Library falls somewhere within the Design Team/Mackay axis and it matters not for this Court whose fault or responsibility within that axis it was.</p>

External works were running several weeks behind this, albeit much of these works were omitted a few weeks later. However, WLC qualified its views, for instance in its Progress Report on 19 January 2007 which indicated that amongst other things the Light Wall would not be complete by the end of January 2007 along with various other work including work as yet uninstructed.</p>

In its Report dated 16 February 2007, WLC indicated that significant delays continued to be recorded in relation to the pool areas, lifts, doors and frames, courtyards and external works. Although it continued to target completion within February 2007, it highlighted that the Light Wall, the Courtyard works, the library shelving and joinery and the installation of leather work generally (amongst several other items of work) would not be complete. This report was not challenged by anyone at the time as containing any material error, save possibly for the continuing furore emanating from DMW about the plasterwork.

This does not mean that there were not other items of work still to be completed and these included such of the plasterwork as needed repair, the snagging that remained to be done and other items of work which have not featured as relevant to the issues of delay.</p>

It was argued through cross-examination of Mr Robinson that it was artificial to review delay by reference to a monthly analysis, or, as he had done, as at the end of the month. In one sense, it is artificial because one could take any period of time or any time of the month to conduct one's analysis; one could do it on a daily or a quarterly basis. It is however a proportionate and sensible basis to look at delays on a monthly basis and indeed most delay experts proceed on that basis. As a tribunal, let alone a delay expert, one has to get a handle on what was delaying the project as it went along.</p>

It estimated that the bulk of the outstanding work would be completed by about April although it was difficult to be sure about the Pool Hall and three of the WCs. The one item of work which it was clear was not going to be completed by then was the Leather in the Library. It was known by the end of February 2007 that Adams needed 17 to 19 weeks from the time they were given the "green light". No approval had been given in relation to the stitching and there was no prospect of there being an immediate approval. It followed therefore that, as no one suggested at the time or during the trial that this was an unreasonable period, this leather work was not going to be finished until July 2007 at the earliest. As appears from BLDA’s email dated 2 March 2007 to Mr Mackay, even BLDA thought that the leather was on "the immediate critical path". </p>

There clearly was a very substantial exaggeration (which may not have been deliberate) by Knowles and Mr Mackay as to any problem which could be attributed to a default on the part of WLC. In the result, although there were many areas which needed some attention by WLC, the remedial works overall were minor. Often, as one witness described it, all that was required was the brushing of a millimetre or two of plaster onto relatively small areas to make it sufficiently flat or level. The “reality check” in the case of the plastering defects is to consider how long in practice it would have taken if it had been the only thing holding up practical completion. The answer would have been no more than a few days work for several plasterers. It is inconceivable in those circumstances that this work which in the result was substantially completed by late April 2007 in any way materially delayed the works.</p>

In my judgement therefore, looked at as at the end of February 2007, WLC had been delayed by 18 weeks as a result of the delayed instruction and approval in relation to the stitching to the leather.</p>

There was a growing disagreement about what needed to be done but it is clear that Mr Mackay at that stage was disenchanted with the lift which he described as a "monstrosity".

It was in this month that there was a final resolution in relation to the plastering defects and these were substantially put right by the end of April 2007; this demonstrates in the result that they did not materially impact on completion in any event. The position in relation to the Lift continued as before with there being differences between the parties but some remedial work was being continued by WLC. The Light Wall continued to give rise to debate but it was anticipated that following the production by Firman of a full-size sample on or by 25 April 2007 the Light Wall would be completed by 11 June 2007. </p>

Mr Whidborne of G&amp;T said in an e-mail to Mr Mackay on 2 May 2007 that the "works are virtually complete apart from snagging". There were various changes to the Works discussed as the month went on and a number of variation instructions (at least 20 in number) were issued in the month in relation to them. It was however not correct to say that the works were virtually complete except the snagging. Snagging work remained outstanding albeit that a substantial amount of the notified snagging had been put right or completed. It was not however the snagging which was driving completion at this stage. The Light Wall was incomplete and sub-contractors (Gruppo) were just starting to install different stone flooring to the Pool Hall which would take about six weeks to complete. There continued to be some problems relating to the Barrisol ceilings or the lighting above it in the cinema and the pool hall but, all things being equal, it can not have been anticipated that this would take more than a few weeks at most to resolve. The Stingray doors remained an issue as the free issue ironmongery had still not been issued. The lines remained drawn over the Lift with Mr Mackay wanting to have his own survey on verticality.  </p>

Indeed additional relatively minor variations were ordered by BLDA. The Third Generation of the Light Wall was delivered to site and installation began on 22 June 2007, although it was interrupted by BLDA’s instructions suspending work whilst decisions were made about the fibre-optic lighting and the scalloping effect which was emerging. As Mr Joyce said, this was because BLDA wanted both to arrange for DMW to inspect and to experiment with tape and diffusion silk to improve the spread of light. Nonetheless, this state of affairs was not considered so urgent that there would be overall delays. The Barrisol ceilings were again in a state of flux with that in the cinema to be taken down again; the problems were again to do with the lighting design. Although some ironmongery for the Stingray doors was supplied towards the end of June 2007, it was the wrong type.</p>

There remained differences however as to the extent and scope of remedial work and WLC continued with remedial work.

On 19 June 2007, BLDA’s instruction AI471C instructing the leather works to the Lower Hall Lobby was issued. This (amongst other variations) was the subject matter of WLC’s Extension of Time Request No 76 which suggested that an extension of time up to the week commencing 8 October 2007 was called for. A 14 week period was required for this work which, from the date of the order by WLC to Adams would take the completion to about 28 September 2007. It is clear however, and indeed turned out to be the case, that the Leather in the Library was in practice intimately associated by Adams with the Leather in the adjacent lobby area and that this additional work was to delay the overall Leather in the Library. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgement therefore, the Leather in the Library was delayed until about 28 September 2007. It was inevitably however going to be the case that following the completion of the Leather in the Library there would have to be final snagging and completion of the cleaning and other operations which would need to follow that work and the Light Wall. Thus, it is the case that the Works overall were delayed by reason of events in June 2007 and before by a further two weeks until 12 October 2007 and I accept the evidence of Mr Joyce and Mr Robinson in relation to this two week period.</p>

There was little progress but it was broadly being anticipated that the problems could and would be resolved by sometime in September, particularly following the issue by BLDA of AI490C which required, by way of variation, additional work thereto. By the end of July 2007, the Barrisol ceilings, although installed, were appreciated as being unsatisfactory so far as the lighting was concerned and this remained to be dealt with, albeit largely at the expense of Equation. The Stingray doors did not progress because of the late delivery of ironmongery from the free issue suppliers.</p>

However, he did find that there was a justification for withholding some £30,000 and in effect that there were some continuing defects. WLC had done some remedial work earlier in June and July 2007. Mr Mackay and family were away, apparently on holiday, from mid-July until September 2007 but, although the over-cladding solution was considered by the Mackays at a meeting on 11 July 2007 as acceptable, it seems to have been put on a "back-burner" until the adjudicator published his decision and the Mackays returned from holiday. This suggests that it was not considered by anyone in July and August 2007 as likely to impact overall in relation to delay. Accordingly, I do not consider that the Lift issues delayed that Works at this stage.</p>

As Mr Joyce has said and I accept, this would and did affect the installation of the shelving and because the shelving was to be covered with leather, affected the Leather in the Library operation. That this did delay that operation is clear because the shelving could not be fully installed whilst this ducting operation was being completed. It was not to be completed until 6 September 2007 and at least five weeks was required thereafter to complete the installation. The impact of AI481C was to delay the Leather in the Library by just over six weeks (23 July (the date of issue) to 6 September 2007) but allowing for the fact that WLC envisaged that the Leather in the Library would be completed by the end of the first week in October 2007 and allowing again a further two weeks thereafter for the completion of final snagging and clean up, the Leather in the Library again delayed completion in this period up until about 21 October 2007.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a continuing and serious problem in the lighting in the pool ceiling lighting described in the Barrisol ceiling Chapter of this judgement. Equation had essentially made errors and was at its own expense seeking to overcome them, albeit WLC and Norstead were deployed to effect the requisite remedial solutions. A series of Architect’s Instructions began to be issued in August 2007 to overcome these errors and it was inevitable that this would take time to achieve. It is difficult to be certain as to precisely how much delay overall was occasioned by these issues but there certainly was overall and additional delay being caused by these lighting variations and the time being taken to decide upon them. My best assessment on all the evidence is that by the end of August 2007 the Barrisol ceiling delays had caused and made it inevitable that an additional three weeks of delay overall would occur. This is in part at least borne out by the Target Programme for Recently Instructed Works dated 31 August 2007 produced by WLC which identified the works with longer sequences as the leather works in the Lower Hall and the lighting alterations instructed under AI498C, with completion overall indicated as mid to late November 2007. I do not see however that there were particular reasons which led to those leather works being extended, albeit that, as turned out to be the case, the lighting issues in the pool continued to have to be resolved over the next 9 to 10 weeks.</p>

The re-cladding work to the Lift was finally completed in about mid-November 2007 and accepted as satisfactory. The Light Wall screens were being re-constructed under the closer control of BLDA and it was inevitable by the end of November 2007 that these works on site would not be completed significantly before Christmas 2007 (as indeed they were not). The Leather in the Library had been completed but the free issue ironmongery had to be installed. This work and that in the Lower Lobby was completed in November. The Barrisol ceiling lighting in the pool was completed but at the end of November (AI547C) WLC was instructed by way of variation to test and run the lights for 100 hours over a one-week period; this continued until 5 December 2007.</p>

Other relatively minor items of work were discussed but even when the Works did not seem to be far off being practically complete a further six Architect’s Instructions for variations were issued. The Fourth Generation Light Wall was delivered to the site but its installation was not completed by the end of December 2007. There were problems with the Barrisol ceilings which had inevitably been damaged due to them being taken on and off on numerous occasions to enable all the lighting changes to be carried out. BLDA issued AI55C in mid-December 2007 instructing the provision of a new ceiling in the Pool Hall; this was anticipated to be provided and installed by the first week in January 2008.

Although relatively minor items of work remained to be completed, such as snagging, the installation of several taps, the final fixing of the belatedly delivered ironmongery to the Stingray doors and of other ironmongery, the key item of work which remained outstanding was the Light Wall but which was carried out throughout the January (and indeed the February) 2008 period. It had not been completed by the end of January because, although largely fixed in place, there had to be numerous adjustments as called for mostly by Equation to improve light projection into the doors. Mr Mackay expressed concern in early February 2008 about whether there were differences in the light levels between various doors. By 11 February 2008 Equation was indicating that things were somewhat better but by 20 February 2008 Mr Mackay was pointing out that he did not like the stainless steel angles fixed to the side of the glass panels, but some of the panels were bowed and the light was not uniform across all of the panels. These issues metamorphosed into the final argument between the parties as to whether and to what extent if at all WLC was liable for the quality of the final installation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The snagging process, in so far as it involved the Architect, largely went into a state of limbo following the departure of BLDA and it is clear that, when Navigant came on board, it felt unable itself to get involved in the snagging process, which required the Architect to list the snags which needed to be attended to. Therefore, Hicktons were retained by or on behalf of DMW to initiate the process again and the lists were not produced until late May going into June 2008. It is not surprising that neither Hicktons nor Navigant could expect to be fully cognisant of all the issues and as to who was responsible for what. All primarily that they could focus on was that there appeared, say on the face of all a wall or a cupboard, a deficiency which would then be listed to be dealt with. They could not be criticised for finding it at least difficult if not impossible to differentiate initially between deficiencies which were the responsibility of WLC and the directly employed contractors. It is clear that WLC addressed snags extremely promptly and efficiently; this is demonstrated by the fact that of the 436 snags identified in WLC’s works by Hicktons by 10 June 2008, 283 had been attended to by 26 June, and the vast majority, exceeding 1600, had been dealt with by 7 July 2008, when Navigant considered internally that Practical Completion had been achieved (bar the Light Wall and the Courtyard Sliding Doors).</p>

In relation to the ABW, it is, rightly, common ground that the instruction by DMW to Interior Joinery to re-stain the ABW took that work out of the Contract. As the responsibility for the Light Wall and the Courtyard Sliding doors issues was not WLC’s, Navigant had no right to issue instructions to WLC to put right at its own expense the deficiencies; it could have, arguably, instructed WLC to do the further work, largely unspecified, as a variation but since WLC had no design responsibility such instructions would have had to have included directions as to what to do. If that had happened, WLC would have been entitled to an extension of time for as long as it reasonably took to comply with such instructions.</p>

This is an alternative case because the primary case is that the ABW, Light Wall and the Courtyard Sliding doors between them were the main and dominant causes of the delay up to mid August 2008. This is however a factually unjustified suggestion. As indicated in the Snagging chapter of this judgement, the large majority of the snags were effectively caused by the directly employed contractors or by other factors for which WLC was not responsible. A significant part of this delay was caused by the absence of any effective involvement by the newly appointed Architect or Hicktons in the snagging process much before the end of May 2008. In my judgement, the snagging for which WLC actually was contractually responsible would, absent these factors have been dealt with within several weeks at the outside. </p>

A second reason in reality and concurrently with this was the failure of Navigant to provide effective and detailed instructions to WLC as to what to do in relation to the Courtyard Sliding Doors and the Light Wall. There is no issue that the Court does have jurisdiction to fix the appropriate date of Practical Completion.</p>

The only occasions when there were concurrent causes of delay arose where such causes were all the contractual risk of DMW. Most of the actual or alleged major causes of delay (the ABW, the Light Wall, the Courtyard Sliding Doors, the Leather in the Library, the Stingray Doors or the Barrisol ceilings) were positively not the contractual responsibility of WLC. Whilst some of the plasterwork and the Lift complaints raised in 2007 were the responsibility of WLC, they had no impact on the overall delay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Both sides’ Counsel accept that the provision of a timely written application with supporting information and details is a condition precedent to WLC’s entitlement to "direct loss and/or expense" under Clause 26. However, in considering Clause 26, one must bear in mind that most of the matters which entitle the Contractor to such loss and expense are the "fault" or at least the risk of the Employer, such as variations or the late provision of information or instructions by the Architect. One therefore needs to consider with some care precisely what the words mean, without construing them in any way against the Contractor as such. It is clear from the above wording that the application may be made when the Contractor either has incurred or is likely to incur the loss or expense. It can therefore be prospective (before the loss or expense has been incurred) or retrospective (after it has been incurred). Thus, for time related preliminary costs, the Contractor can wait until it is clear that the loss or expense has been incurred; thus, if the delay has not actually happened, the extended preliminary costs will (often) not have been incurred and the Contractor can therefore wait before serving its application until it has actually been incurred. The same sort of wording is used a few lines later in relation to progress having been or being likely to be materially affected by the matters listed in Clause 26.2; therefore the Architect may not have to ascertain the loss or expense until it has been incurred. This is of some importance when one comes to consider the loss of head office overhead and profit related to delay because that will generally not be incurred until the actual delay beyond the original contractual completion date begins to accrue. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also clear from the clause that there are essentially two conditions precedent within it. The first relates to the making of the timely application to the Architect (Clauses 26.1.1 and 26.1.2) and the second to the provision to the Architect or the Quantity Surveyor of details of loss or expense to enable the ascertainment to be made. There has been a substantial debate as to what information must be provided in relation to the first and second conditions. It is difficult and undesirable to lay down any general rule as to what in every case needs to be provided. It is legitimate to bear in mind what knowledge and information the Architect already has. For instance, the Architect (as in this case) attended meetings regularly and frequently throughout the project and was the recipient of scores of applications for extensions of time from WLC; it might legitimately be thought that the Architect already had a very substantial amount of information at its fingertips so that, arguably, less information needed to be provided by the Contractor in its application because all that is required is that the Architect must be reasonably put into a position in which it can form an opinion that "direct loss and/or expense has been incurred or is likely to be incurred…because the regular progress of the Works…has been materially affected" by the given events. This is consistent with the decision of Mr Justice Vinelott in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">London Borough of Merton v Leach</span> (1985) 32 BLR 68 at page 97 and 98. Of course, Clause 26.1 expressly says that the application under Clause 26.1 does not have to be given with a money quantification, because the bracketed wording suggests only that the Contractor "may give his quantification".</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Construing Clause 26.1.3 in its context, an entitlement to various heads of loss and expense will not be lost where for some of the loss details are not provided. Otherwise, one can have the absurd position that where £10 out of a £1 million claim is not adequately detailed but the rest of the claim is, the whole claim would fail to satisfy the condition precedent. That can not have been intended. Again the condition precedent within Clause 26.1.3 only requires the Contractor to submit details which "are reasonably necessary" for the ascertainment of loss and expense. It does not say how the details are to be provided but there is no reason to believe that an offer to the Architect or Quantity Surveyor for them to inspect records at the Contractor’s offices could not be construed as submission of details of loss and expense; this happened in this case as Mr McMorrow said credibly in evidence. One must also bear in mind that what is required is "details" of the loss and expense and that does not necessarily include all the backup accounting information which might support such detail. It would have been possible for the clause to say that the Contractor should provide "details and all necessary supporting documentation" but that is not what the clause says. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that this approach is not a standard one that would apply in every case. Mr Pontin’s approach is almost akin to saying both that every conceivable detail and back up documentation which may or may not be needed must be provided and all evidence required to prove the claim as correct needs to be deployed. Clause 26.1.3 talks about "such details…as are reasonably necessary for such ascertainment". This is all qualified by what is "reasonably necessary". Thus, a very common head of loss and expense (as here) is delay related preliminary costs, such as extended management, site supervision and site facilities provided by the Contractor. If delay has occurred by reason of one of the Clause 26.2 matters (say, variations or late instructions), it will often be obvious to everybody including the Quantity Surveyor and Architect who visit the site regularly that such preliminary heads of cost are being incurred; examples might be the site huts or the senior supervisors working on site. In terms of the costs of such items, there could be fulfilment of the condition precedent if the details of the expense relating to such preliminaries were defined by reference to the prices in the contract between the parties for such items. It is legitimate to bear in mind that the Architect and the Quantity surveyor are not strangers to the project in considering what needs to be provided to them; this is consistent with the judgement of Mr Justice Vinelott in the <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Merton</span> case (see pages 97-8). In the current case, there was a very detailed breakdown of the preliminary activities including site staffing, temporary accommodation, telephones, site labour, temporary services and various sundries with rates or prices individually shown. It would be properly arguable that loss and expense of the preliminaries could be valued by reference to the contract rates or prices for such preliminaries on the basis that those rates or prices represent the loss (if not the expense) to the Contractor of having such staff for or other preliminary activities on the project for longer than anticipated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Clause 26.1 talks of the exercise of ascertainment of loss and expense incurred or to be incurred. The word "ascertain" means to determine or discover definitely or, more archaically, with certainty. It is argued by DMW’s Counsel that the Architect or the Quantity Surveyor can not ascertain unless a massive amount of detail and supporting documentation is provided. This is almost akin to saying that the Contractor must produce all conceivable material evidence such as is necessary to prove its claim beyond reasonable doubt. In my judgement, it is necessary to construe the words in a sensible and commercial way that would resonate with commercial parties in the real world. The Architect or the Quantity Surveyor must be put in the position in which they can be satisfied that all or some of the loss and expense claimed is likely to be or has been incurred. They do not have to be "certain". One has to bear in mind that the ultimate dispute resolution tribunal will decide any litigation or arbitration on a balance of probabilities and at that stage that tribunal will (only) have to be satisfied that the Contractor probably incurred loss or expense as a result of one or more of the events listed in Clause 26.2. Bearing in mind that one of the exercises which the Architect or Quantity Surveyor may do is allow loss and expense, which has not yet been incurred but which is merely “likely to be incurred”; in the absence of crystal ball gazing, they cannot be certain precisely what will happen in the future but they need only to be satisfied that the loss or expense will probably be incurred.</p>

There is on analysis no point taken or maintained that these were not made within time. The real issue is more whether or not an appropriate level of detail was provided within or in connection with the applications. It is undoubtedly the case that the Quantity Surveyors and the Architect did include within interim certificates substantial sums for loss and expense and it is therefore a fair inference that they considered that they had sufficient detail at least to certify what they did. Examples of what WLC did by way of particularisation are in a series of letters dated 24 November 2005, one each relating to the different extension of time claims submitted.

It is therefore necessary to review the law which has grown up over the last 50 years on the topic. In <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Crosby v Portland UDC</span> (1967) 5 BLR 121, Mr Justice Donaldson (as he then was) dealt with a number of issues arising out of a contract incorporating the ICE Conditions, on the old case stated procedure which used to pertain in arbitration. The arbitrator in that case, amongst other things, had awarded delay and disruption related compensation on a lump-sum basis; the Council argued that the arbitrator could not do this but should find amounts due under each of the individual heads of claim upon which the Contractor relied in support of its overall claim for delay and disruption. The judge upheld the arbitrator’s award and approach at pages 135-6:</p>

They say that where you have a series of events which can be categorised as denial of possession of part of the site, suspension of work, and variations, the result is, or may be, that the contractor incurs the extra costs by way of overhead expenses and loss of productivity; these extra costs are all recoverable directly under clause 40 or clause 42 or indirectly under clauses 51 and 52. I say ‘indirectly because any revised rate or price and the scheduled day work rates must include a large cost element even if they go further than this and also cover profit. Since, however, the extent of the extra cost incurred depends upon an extremely complex interaction between the consequences of the various denials, suspensions and variations, it may well be difficult or even impossible to make an accurate apportionment of the total extra cost between the several causative events. An artificial appointment could of course have been made; and why, they ask, should the arbitrator make such an apportionment which has no basis in reality?</p>

One of the issues for consideration was whether contractual terms about the recovery of direct loss/expense permitted the Contractor to recover the same in respect of any alleged event when it is not possible for it to state in respect of that alleged event the amount of loss/expense attributable thereto.

Leave to appeal having been given because it was initially thought that a point of general significance had been raised, their Lordships ultimately thought that there was no question of any general importance. Developers sued the architect in relation to a development, with the statement of claim running to over 400 pages with schedules. The delay of just over two years in completion (broken down in the pleading into six separate periods) was identified along with 15 separate breaches on the part of the architect which was said to have caused the delay. The loss claimed was the loss of rent, some HK$199m. The Privy Council was satisfied that the pleading was insufficient; the Hong Kong Court of Appeal had decided that the action was one in which the real cause of action rested upon the establishment of an essential link between the action or inaction alleged on the part of the architect and the damage which was claimed by way of relief, the key pleading issue then being whether all the material facts had been pleaded. The Privy Council felt unable to follow the Court of Appeal’s view that the case should be struck out on the grounds that no reasonable cause of action had been pleaded:</p>

Nevertheless, the point of logical weakness inherent in such claims, the causal nexus between the wrongful acts or omissions of the defendant and the loss of the plaintiff, must be addressed. I put to one side and straightforward case where each aspect of the nexus is apparent from the nature of the breach and loss as alleged. In such a case the objectives of the pleading may be achieved by a short statement of the facts giving rise to the causal nexus. If it is necessary for the given case that it is to be supported by particulars, this should be done. But, in other cases, each aspect of the nexus must be fully set out in the pleading. Moreover, the court should be assiduous in pressing the plaintiff to set out this nexus with sufficient particularity to enable the defendant to know exactly what is the case it is required to meet and to enable the defendant to direct its discovery and its attention generally to the case. And it should not be overlooked that an important means of achieving the result that, once it starts, the trial should be conducted without undue prejudice, embarrassment and delay, is by ensuring that, when it begins, the issues between the parties including this nexus is defined with sufficient particularity to enable the trial judge to address the issues, to rule on relevance and generally to contain the parties to those issues…And if, in such a case, the plaintiff fails to demonstrate this causal nexus in sufficient detail because it is unable or unwilling to do so, then this may provide the occasion for the court to relieve the defendant of the unreasonable burden which the plaintiff would impose on it: <span style="font-style:italic">Wharf</span>…”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">“35. <span style="color:#000000">Ordinarily, in order to make a relevant claim for contractual loss and expense under a construction contract (or a common law claim for damages) the pursuer must aver (1) the occurrence of an event for which the defender bears legal responsibility, (2) that he has suffered loss or incurred expense, and (3) that the loss or expense was caused by the event. In some circumstances, relatively commonly in the context of construction contracts, a whole series of events occur which individually would form the basis of a claim for loss and expense. These events may inter-react with each other in very complex ways, so that it becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to identify what loss and expense each event has caused. The emergence of such a difficulty does not, however, absolve the pursuer from the need to aver and prove the causal connections between the events and the loss and expense. However, if all the events are events for which the defender is legally responsible, it is unnecessary to insist on proof of which loss has been caused by each event. In such circumstances, it will suffice for the pursuer to aver and prove that he has suffered a global loss to the causation of which each of the events for which the defenders is responsible has contributed. Thus far, provided the pursuer is able to give adequate specification of the events, of the basis of the defender's responsibility for each of them, of the fact of the defender's involvement in causing his global loss, and of the method of computation of that loss, there is no difficulty in principle in permitting a claim to be advanced in that way. </span></p>

	      <span style="color:#000000">36. The logic of a global claim demands, however, that all the events which contribute to causing the global loss be events for which the defender is liable. If the causal events include events for which the defender bears no liability, the effect of upholding the global claim is to impose on the defender a liability which, in part, is not legally his. That is unjustified. A global claim, as such, must therefore fail if any material contribution to the causation of the global loss is made by a factor or factors for which the defender bears no legal liability.

	      <span style="color:#000000">37. Advancing a claim for loss and expense in global form is therefore a risky enterprise. Failure to prove that a particular event for which the defender was liable played a part in causing the global loss will not have any adverse effect on the claim, provided the remaining events for which the defender was liable are proved to have caused the global loss. On the other hand, proof that an event played a material part in causing the global loss, combined with failure to prove that that event was one for which the defender was responsible, will undermine the logic of the global claim. Moreover, the defender may set out to prove that, in addition to the factors for which he is liable founded on by the pursuer, a material contribution to the causation of the global loss has been made by another factor or other factors for which he has no liability. If he succeeds in proving that, again the global claim will be undermined. </span>

The first of these is that while, in the circumstances outlined, the global claim as such will fail, it does not follow that no claim will succeed. The fact that a pursuer has been driven (or chosen) to advance a global claim because of the difficulty of relating each causative event to an individual sum of loss or expense does not mean that after evidence has been led it will remain impossible to attribute individual sums of loss or expense to individual causative events. The point is illustrated in certain of the American cases. The global claim may fail, but there may be in the evidence a sufficient basis to find causal connections between individual losses and individual events, or to make a rational apportionment of part of the global loss to the causative events for which the defender has been held responsible. </span>

In summary, therefore, the judge held in paragraph 48 of his judgment, that, on the proper construction of the Supervision Agreement, the sum due to Petromec under clauses 12.1 and 12.2 cannot be ascertained by calculating the difference in the manner which Petromec proposed. Petromec must specify the instructions, the work required to comply with those instructions (or with the Amended Specification under clause 11), and the cost attributable to that work. The changes and causal nexus must be pleaded. Petromec can contend that the work done and the cost is reasonable. By one means or another, it must plead with sufficient particularity the work done and its cost by reference to the Amended Specification or the instructions given. The judge, however, said, in paragraph 49 of his judgment, that it was not necessary to ascertain separately sums due under clauses 12.1 and 12.2. All that was necessary was to establish the total of the additional costs referred to in clauses 12.1 and 12.2. What mattered was the total reasonable extra cost payable in consequence of complying with Petrobras' instructions under clause 10, as reflected in clauses 11.1 and 12.1 or 12.2…</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">36. Clause 12.2 concerns further alterations or changes instructed by Petrobras, that is changes to the Clause 11 Roncador Specification. Clause 12.2(ii) entitles Petromec to the reasonable extra cost resulting from these changes, that is in concept the cost caused by the changes. That in theory might require a comparison between the work content and cost of the Clause 11 Roncador Specification (or part of it) and the work content of the instructed changes. Conventional particulars of this would require Petromec to identify the change order instructions, and to give sufficient particulars of the work content and reasonable cost of each. The judge in effect so decided in paragraph 48 of his judgment. As a matter of the abstract construction of clause 12.2 alone coupled with an orthodox approach to pleading and case management, I think he was correct. But there are two further considerations. First, Petromec are entitled to assert as their case that the Clause 11 Roncador Specification was not a document which defined work content and that the design only emerged and became buildable as it went along. Second, Petromec's entitlement to "reasonable extra cost" of upgrading in clause 12.1 is the same measure of cost as the "reasonable extra costs" of upgrading in clause 12.2(ii). This means – and Mr Hancock was inclined to accept – that the sum of the reasonable extra costs under clauses 12.1 and 12.2(ii) taken separately ought to be the same as Petromec's reasonable extra costs of upgrading the vessel in accordance with the Roncador Specification as eventually instructed, including the further alterations and changes to be paid for under clause 12.2. For these reasons, I do not consider that the court would strike out a formulation of Petromec's claim which sought to deduct the costs that Petromec might reasonably have incurred in achieving the Original South Marlim Specification (properly particularised) from the reasonable costs (properly particularised) of achieving the eventually instructed Roncador Specification. This is no doubt what the judge had in mind when he held in paragraph 49 of his judgment that it was not necessary for there to be a separate ascertainment of the sums due under clause 12.1 and 12.2. There does not therefore have to be a pointless separate costing of the works notionally required to achieve the Clause 11 Roncador Specification, which was never executed in that form, even if that were possible. That does not, however, let Petromec off the hook of having to give proper particulars.</p>

What is commonly referred to as a global claim is a contractor’s claim which identifies numerous potential or actual causes of delay and/or disruption, a total cost on the job, a net payment from the employer and a claim for the balance between costs and payment which is attributed without more and by inference to the causes of delay and disruption relied on. </p>

There has, properly, been no or no maintained complaint that WLC’s final pleadings did not sufficiently identify a comprehensible case in relation to delay. WLC’s case for extended preliminaries and profit and overhead is related solely to the periods of delay for which it asserted that it was entitled to extensions of time. Thus, it asserted that it was delayed by X weeks for factors (variations and late instructions/information) for which it was entitled not only to an extension of time under Clause 25 but also to loss and/or expense under Clause 26. Those preliminaries costs are set out in the pleadings, and, mostly, comprise the cost to it of engaging staff over all or part of that extended period. As a matter of evidence, it adduces evidence of actual cost in relation to each and every member of staff so deployed during that extended period. In relation to the "thickening" of resources, it adduces evidence which seeks to explain what resources it provided, why it was additional to what had originally been priced by it and why it was related to the events relied upon as entitling it to loss or expense and it adduces evidence of what the additional cost of those resources was. The case on extended overheads and profit is simply based on there being due extensions also on Clause 26 grounds and on evidence to the effect that the preliminary resources could have been applied profitably on other projects during the period of extension. The sub-contractor claims are largely based on the extension delay and to the sums actually paid or, if not yet paid, due to the relevant sub-contractor. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">(a) Ultimately, claims by contractors for delay or disruption related loss and expense must be proved as a matter of fact. Thus, the Contractor has to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that, first, events occurred which entitle it to loss and expense, secondly, that those events caused delay and/or disruption and thirdly that such delay or disruption caused it to incur loss and/or expense (or loss and damage as the case may be). I do not accept that, as a matter of principle, it has to be shown by a claimant contractor that it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">impossible</span> to plead and prove cause and effect in the normal way or that such impossibility is not the fault of the party seeking to advance the global claim. One needs to see of course what the contractual clause relied upon says to see if there are contractual restrictions on global cost or loss claims.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">(c) It is open to contractors to prove these three elements with whatever evidence will satisfy the tribunal and the requisite standard of proof. There is no set way for contractors to prove these three elements. For instance, such a claim may be supported or even established by admission evidence or by detailed factual evidence which precisely links reimbursable events with individual days or weeks of delay or with individual instances of disruption and which then demonstrates with precision to the nearest penny what that delay or disruption actually cost.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">(d) There is nothing in principle "wrong" with a "total" or "global" cost claim. However, there are added evidential difficulties (in many but not necessarily all cases) which a claimant contractor has to overcome. It will generally have to establish (on a balance of probabilities) that the loss which it has incurred (namely the difference between what it has cost the contractor and what it has been paid) would not have been incurred in any event. Thus, it will need to demonstrate that its accepted tender was sufficiently well priced that it would have made some net return. It will need to demonstrate in effect that there are no other matters which actually occurred (other than those relied upon in its pleaded case <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> which it has proved are likely to have caused the loss). It is wrong, as Counsel suggested, that the burden of proof in some way transfers to the defending party. It is of course open to that defending party to raise issues or adduce evidence that suggest or even show that the accepted tender was so low that the loss would have always occurred irrespective of the events relied upon by the claimant contractor or that other events (which are not relied upon by the claimant as causing or contributing to the loss or which are the "fault" or "risk" of the claimant contractor) occurred may have caused or did cause all or part of the loss. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">(e) The fact that one or a series of events or factors (unpleaded or which are the risk or fault of the claimant contractor) caused or contributed (or cannot be proved not to have caused or contributed) to the total or global loss does not necessarily mean that the claimant contractor can recover nothing. It depends on what the impact of those events or factors is. An example would be where, say, a contractor’s global loss is £1 million and it can prove that but for one overlooked and unpriced £50,000 item in its accepted tender it would probably have made a net return; the global loss claim does not fail simply because the tender was underpriced by £50,000; the consequence would simply be that the global loss is reduced by £50,000 because the claimant contractor has not been able to prove that £50,000 of the global loss would not have been incurred in any event. Similarly, taking the same example but there being events during the course of the contract which are the fault or risk of the claimant contractor which caused or cannot be demonstrated not to cause some loss, the overall claim will not be rejected save to the extent that those events caused some loss. An example might be (as in this case) time spent by WLC’s management in dealing with some of the lift problems (in particular the over-cladding); assuming that this time can be quantified either precisely or at least by way of assessment, that amount would be deducted from the global loss. This is not inconsistent with the judge’s reasoning in the <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Merton</span> case that “a rolled up award can only be made in the case where the loss or expense attributable to each head of claim cannot in reality be separated”, because, where the tribunal can take out of the "rolled up award" or "total" or "global" loss elements for which the contractor cannot recover loss in the proceedings, it will generally be left with the loss attributable to the events which the contractor is entitled to recover loss.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">(f) Obviously, there is no need for the Court to go down the global or total cost route if the actual cost attributable to individual loss causing events can be readily or practicably determined. I do not consider that Vinelott J was saying in the <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Merton</span> case (at page 102 last paragraph) that a contractor should be debarred from pursuing what he called a "rolled up award" if it could otherwise seek to prove its loss in another way. It may be that the tribunal will be more sceptical about the global cost claim if the direct linkage approach is readily available but is not deployed. That does not mean that the global cost claim should be rejected out of hand.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">(g) DMW’s Counsel’s argument that a global award should not be allowed where the contractor has himself created the impossibility of disentanglement (relying on <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Merton</span> per Vinelott J at 102, penultimate paragraph and <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">John Holland</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>per Byrne J at page 85) is not on analysis supported by those authorities and is wrong. Vinelott J was referring to unreasonable delay by the contractor in making its loss and/or expense claim; that delay would have led to their being non-compliance with the condition precedent but all that he was saying otherwise was that, if such delay created difficulty, the claim may not be allowed. He certainly was not saying that a global cost claim would be barred necessarily or at all if there was such delay. Byrne J relied on Vinelott J’s observations and he was not saying that a global cost claim would be barred but simply that such a claim "has been held to be permissible in the case where it is impractical to disentangle that part of the loss which is attributable to each head of claim, and this situation has not been brought about by delay or other conduct of the claimant”. In principle, unless the contract dictates that a global cost claim is not permissible if certain hurdles are not overcome, such a claim may be permissible on the facts and subject to proof.</p>

This project was, essentially, a complete mess from the administrative side on the part of DMW and its professional team. The job started with remarkably little design, there were hundreds of variations, there was throughout the project hopelessly late provision of information and instructions to WLC, there was a substantial level of discord between, principally, Mr Mackay and most of his professional team most of the time and there was a strategy evolved by Mr Mackay which involved aggressively supervising the professional team and omitting a substantial amount of work whilst leaving WLC with the work which he thought WLC would have difficulty in dealing with in time. By early 2007 until the end of the project, it was virtually impossible sensibly to programme all the works because it was not known what work and with what detail it would be ordered; this period was also confused by unsubstantiated hints that Mr Mackay might omit yet further work. </p>

An adequate cost record system was operated by WLC which was called the COINS system which recorded all the costs incurred on Units A, B and C. Against these costs which materially identified all the preliminary type costs incurred by WLC amongst other costs, WLC has sought to allocate those preliminary items which were expended or used on Unit C. It is said that, instead of an after the event allocation, WLC could and should have done a contemporary and detailed allocation. An exchange in the oral evidence of Mr Hunter (Day 13 pages 165-7) confirmed that the type of contemporaneous allocation suggested by DMW’s Counsel was unrealistic and one which he had never come across. It becomes immensely artificial where many of the same preliminary costs items being deployed on two or three projects at once (as here) for someone to sit down at the end of each day and say that a precise time for each item had been incurred, particularly where, as here, many of the same sub-contractors were being deployed on more than one Unit at any one time and where many of the same sort of problems were being raised.

All these additional or extended resources were then costed in a document called the Detailed Analysis of Loss &amp; Expense. This comprises about 80 mostly A3 sheets of detailed analysis which pick up on allocations of time for staff and resources at particular times and applies to such allocations costs obtained from WLC’s “COINS” computerised record keeping system.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What WLC has produced is not on analysis any global or total cost claim. It has sought to identify the specific additional or extended resources and to link them to the events upon which they rely as having caused or given rise to their need for additional or extended resources. It has made allocations in respect of such resources to Unit C. DMW suggests that those allocations might be wrong; however, the Court can determine with relative ease from the evidence whether such allocations are reliable or not. In terms of the extended preliminaries, once the overall delay has been established as having been caused by factors which entitle WLC to loss and expense, then it is obvious generally and specifically from the evidence that WLC had to service the Unit C project with staff, labour and other resources during that delay period; that must have cost something. The cost is determinable from the COINS system to the extent that it is established that it was a reasonably accurate and effective system (which it was). One can take an example, say a site supervisor on Unit C who is on site for an additional 45 weeks by reason of Clause 26 factors; if he spent 100% or 50% of his time on Unit C during this period, the loss or expense incurred by WLC is his salary cost for that additional 45 weeks (in full or half of it as the case may be). Even if one considers the "thickening" preliminary costs, this is not "total" or "global". All that WLC’s case and evidence goes to show is that during certain periods as a result of alleged events it had to or did apply a greater level of resource than originally allowed for; again, if the linkage between the relevant event and the need to provide a greater resource is established, the costing of it is established by showing how many man weeks were consequently necessary and how much the salary cost was for those man weeks. </p>

Its tender was reviewed by nationally known Quantity Surveyors, G&amp;T; it is clear that the feeling was that if anything the tendered preliminary costs were higher than anticipated by G&amp;T. It is also clear that, if the preliminaries had been significantly underpriced, G&amp;T would have picked that up at the tender selection stage (and it did not do so). I accept Mr McMorrow’s evidence as to the adequacy of the allowances made for resources in the tender. There was evidence that the allocation of resources was consistent with other projects and possibly somewhat higher in some respects.

Essentially, WLC says that what was reasonably foreseeable were some 23 (or 38) packages, this being set out in its tender procurement programme. However, there was no restriction within the Contract documentation as to how many packages of work there could be. There might conceivably have been one joinery package, but it is equally possible that there might have been five or six packages for joinery items (cupboards, doors, windows, kitchen woodwork, skirtings and the like). Whilst I do not consider that it was at all unreasonable for WLC to assume that there might only be 23 (or 38) packages (and thus 23 or 38 sub-contractors to deal with), it took the risk that there might be more. Indeed, there were substantially more packages and doubtless (and indeed as its evidence shows) WLC had to deploy additional resources to deal with the greater than anticipated number of packages. It follows that the cost of such additional resources is not as such recoverable and it will be the Court’s job to identify as best as possible the resources and a sum by way of deduction which adequately reflects this cost.</p>

There was always going to be an economy of scale and much of the more senior site management was able productively to combine its time on more than one unit; thus, for instance, the same sub-contractors (in many instances) were used on all three units and management could deal with collectively; each Unit was only a few seconds away from the others.

Thus, (save for two weeks only between 2 and 16 February 2007), DMW’s team allocated the preliminary costs one third each as between Units A, B and C when they were all being worked on together; however when Unit A was completed DMW’s team allocated the ongoing preliminary costs 50/50 between the remaining Units B and C. That agreed method of working has been carried through into WLC’s claim.

Alternatively, they argue that an apportionment of a third throughout is appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">WLC relies upon the cost data recorded contemporaneously on its COINS system. However, Mr Pontin raised issues as to the recording of those costs, by comparing (1) the contemporaneous filled in and cross-checked allocation sheets with the site “signing in book” and (2) the allocation sheets and the data on the COINS system and then pointing out discrepancies between them. Mr McMorrow and Mr Corless dealt with this,effectively, in their statements.  Their evidence was that the Preliminary Costs for Units A, B and C as a whole were allocated using staff allocation sheets each month. They were completed by Mr McMorrow up to December 2007 and thereafter by Mr Spiers. They said that the updated data from the allocation sheets would then be inputted by the financial controller onto the system by reference to a specific job number and in so doing he cross-checked the allocation sheets and ensured that any queries arising therefrom were raised and sorted out with Mr McMorrow or Mr Corless: where they resulted in adjustments those adjustments were made directly onto the COINS system.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">No positive case was pleaded or put by DMW/Mr Mackay to the effect that the costs recorded in the COINS system against the Bolton’s Place Project were incorrect, and no notification was made by them that they considered either the contemporaneous allocation sheets or COINS data to be forged or dishonestly recorded. Notwithstanding this, Mr Pontin’s evidence concerns not only remained but he took the view that the best figures to use were those set out on the allocation sheets, with the result that some £110,000 or more should be deducted from the claim. That was unfortunate because it became clear in the course of cross examination that the reason why Mr Pontin had adopted that stance was because he, or perhaps one of his team, had or may have misunderstood WLC’s solicitors’ letter of 7 November 2011 which had been broadly corroborated by WLC’s evidence: whilst he had misunderstood that letter as saying that the correct figures to use were those set out in the allocation sheets. It is clear (and he appeared, finally, to accept) that the letter said exactly the opposite in that it pointed out, and was directly consistent with exactly the same point made by the evidence of Walter Lilly’s witnesses, that those figures had been adjusted contemporaneously by reference to the site staff and the COINS figures were therefore the most accurate. He did effectively accept that if I accepted WLC’s evidence his deduction was wrong. In the result, I accept the evidence of Mr McMorrow and Mr Corless on this matter as eminently believable.</p>

It was a reasonably sophisticated, contemporaneously maintained system (which remained available for inspection during the proceedings), supported by disclosed contemporaneous allocation sheets and contemporaneously cross-checked by a financial controller with people on site. WLC also offered contemporaneously for G&amp;T to come and inspect whatever records they saw fit at WLC’s offices (particularly in relation to sensitive financial information such as staff salaries).  However this offer was never taken up by G&amp;T nor was it ever in reality suggested prior to Valuation 47 that the approach being adopted by WLC was incorrect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Pontin suggested that the allocation sheets and therefore the COINS system were undermined by discrepancies between them and the site signing in books. However, such signing in books are well known as likely to be discrepant because in real life people do not always do as they are told and sign the signing in book and also, as importantly, the site signing in book does not (unsurprisingly) register time spent by people on the project when they are not physically on the site. This was supported by credible evidence from Mr McMorrow and Mr Hunter. Even Mr Pontin accepted eventually in cross-examination that the COINS system was likely to be more "correct" than the signing in books. Notwithstanding this, Mr Pontin relied upon discrepancies between the signing in books and the eventual COINS allocations as his first "step" in reducing the prolongation quantum. This was unjustified in my judgement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next challenge from Mr Pontin was with the allocation, initially one third to each Unit and then adjusted upwards for Unit C to reflect the earlier completions of Units A and B. From the time when the Contract was split into three contracts, one each for Units A, B and C, with very limited exceptions G&amp;T with BLDA’s approval adopted an approach of apportioning the overall preliminary costs being incurred by WLC on the Project between Units A, B and C on a percentage basis, based on which of them had been completed. They never allocated less than 33.3% to Plot C when considering loss and expense. Whilst at times, WLC argued that more resources should be apportioned to B and C than A, DMW’s team allocated 33.3% of Preliminary Costs to Unit C from the start of the Project to November 2006. They allocated at least 33% (and often a higher percentage) of Preliminary Costs to Unit C from December 2006 to February 2007. However, because no further extension of time was granted, they did not allocate any Preliminary Costs to any Plot from the end of February 2007.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">WLC has in its claim in these proceedings reverted to apportioning the preliminary resources equally for the period up to 2 February 2007 whilst all three projects were “live” with 33.3% for Unit C, for the period 2 February 2007, when Practical Completion was achieved on Unit A until 28 September 2007, when Practical Completion was certified on Unit B, with 50% for Unit C (and 50% for Unit B), and after 28 September 2007, when Unit C was the only incomplete project during this period 100% for Unit C. That approach was supported by Mr Hunter who said pragmatically in evidence: “...by definition any apportionment is going to be a process that has swings and roundabouts.  To adjust those one way or the other upsets – as far as I believe – the balance of the original arrangement in terms of apportionment”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This approach is challenged however by Mr Pontin and DMW who challenge the whole approach of apportionment. They argue that as WLC has continued that approach and has not sought to demonstrate which particular aspect of its costs was incurred specifically in relation to Unit C, it cannot recover any of them. In my judgement, there is nothing wrong with an attempt to apportion continuing site or project related costs on a project such as this when three related projects are being done for the same client, at the same site, with the same Design Team and with overlapping resources. There could have been no criticism from DMW if a contemporaneous minute by minute allocation or apportionment had been done at the time. What has happened instead is that that allocation or apportionment was done on a relatively broad brush basis at the time, with the consent and approval of all concerned, and that approach, albeit slightly adjusted, continues to be adopted. The issue should be, not whether apportionment is appropriate (because it clearly is) but, what the right apportionment is.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is naive if not disingenuous to suggest that little or nothing should be allowed in circumstances in which it is patently obvious that substantial preliminary resources were deployed on and for the benefit of Unit C during the periods of delay for which WLC was entitled to extension of time. For instance, Mr Joyce and Mr Howie spent on any account a substantial proportion of their time during the periods of delay on seeking to administer, manage and control this project at Unit C. Some of their time may well have also been spent on Units B or A on matters for which WLC had no entitlement to financial reimbursement. It comes down therefore to assessing how much of their time was spent in helping to service the project during the periods of delay. The parties can of course argue as to whether it should be one third, one half or 100% but that WLC is entitled to substantial reimbursement is absolutely clear. Even Mr Pontin accepts, albeit in the alternative, that WLC should have one third of the relevant continuing resources; even that approach however is somewhat niggardly because again it must be obvious that once Units A and B were completed WLC's resources on the completed Units would and did go down substantially and, subject to any arguments about excessive costs or resources being deployed or allocated to Unit C, the proportion of preliminary resources deployed in relation to Unit C was probably and would be expected to be greater after each of the other Units was completed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in this context, DMW sought to argue that in effect WLC had recovered all or most of its preliminary costs through payments made by DMW in relation to all three Units; this was set out in Paragraphs 230A to C of the Re-Re-Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim and was endorsed by Mr Pontin. The exercise involved identifying the total cost as shown on the COINS system for all three Units, deducting various redacted costs, then adding various accrued liabilities to sub-contractors and the like together with some VAT and then finally deducting payments requested in relation to Units A, B and C. It was a flawed exercise as the actual payments received in respect of the three Units was £2.27 million less than the amounts said to have been applied for. It therefore did not show that the preliminary costs had in fact all been recovered; it actually showed, if anything, that they had not been recovered from DMW. There were other differences between the parties on this set of calculations and I preferred those put forward by WLC and its quantum expert.</p>

The project was hopelessly under-designed and it matters not whether the fault or responsibility was that of Mr and Mrs Mackay or one or more members of their Design Team. This meant that during what should have been the original contract period the Design Team was always on "the back foot" and there were substantial efforts made to re-design to seek to bring costings closer to the budgets which had been set. It is clear from the extensions of time which were granted that BLDA accepted that the substantial delays which occurred during this period not only justified extension of time but also reimbursement of the related loss and expense.

The Voluntary Particulars address this claim at pages A697 to A707. It is, conceptually, a simpler claim than the "thickening" cost claim as it simply identifies the resources (and related costs) which were on or attached to the site for the period of time for which extension was actually granted. There was little or no factual challenge to the contents of the Voluntary Particulars, again which were supported by WLC’s evidence. What is claimed for is the preliminary resources at the level originally contracted for. Thus, 40% of Mr Joyce’s time was originally allowed for and 40% of his time, at least, was applied during this period. To the extent that any additional time or resource was deployed, that is covered by the "thickening" claim (for which see below). </p>

It should be remembered that almost all the work was being sub-contracted and the actual cost of putting right defects or deficiencies would fall to the offending sub-contractor. I am satisfied that no additional management time or preliminary resource was applied to deal with any such minor matters. The period between March 2006 and mid-February 2007 was one in which the administrative confusion continued apace with late instructions and numerous variations and there was no delay causing factor which was the fault, risk or responsibility of WLC.</p>

The project was in serious delay, through no fault on the part of WLC and work was to a significant extent being done on a piecemeal basis and in a highly disruptive fashion. It is therefore wholly understandable that WLC had to deploy substantial additional resources to run and service the Unit C project. The overwhelming picture which emerges is that the project was in crisis and the fault for that lay between the Design Team and Mr Mackay. There was a lack of direction and co-ordination from the Design Team and this became confused still further when Mr Mackay decided to bring in Knowles. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This claim relates to the basic preliminaries extended over the period 16 February 2007 to 6 February 2008 which is the date upon which WLC primarily pleaded that it had achieved Practical Completion. Although I have found that Practical Completion occurred later, for convenience I will retain this end date of 6 February 2008 for this item. It has been found in this judgement that WLC is entitled to an extension of time until the later Practical Completion date. The delays were caused in fact by issues relating to the Light Wall, the Leather in the Library, the Stingray doors and the Barrisol ceilings and related lighting. There were also delays relating to the lighting to two rooms, WC2 and WC3, caused by variations, albeit that they did not cause overall delay. £297,046 is claimed for these extended preliminaries. I am satisfied that all the staff identified (Messrs Joyce, McMorrow, Rough, Spiers, Yems, Fairweather, Pacey, Gad and Zanali) were deployed extensively on Unit C during this period and that this would have been unnecessary but for the factors which cause the overall delay. In addition, a gateman, Mr Shields, was required for part of the period (until April 2007). I am satisfied that all the other heads of claim (local authority charges, temporary accommodation, safety and site specific administration and sundries, cranes and hoist, plant, pumping and drying out, clean and clear operations, the maintenance of hoardings and travel, subsistence, entertaining and other related expenses) were expended .</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For this period of 51 weeks, 50% of the overall resources are allocated by WLC to Unit C up to 28 September 2007 (when Unit B was certified as practically complete) and thereafter 100%. I am satisfied that this allocation is overgenerous to WLC. It is clear from the documentation and other evidence that there continued to be a not insignificant deployment of the resources on Unit A until September 2007 and on Unit B (and to a much lesser extent Unit A) thereafter until early February 2008. For instance, there were meetings in relation to Units A and B to discuss financial matters and to resolve defects, involving staff who have also been allocated to Unit C In my judgement, having considered all the evidence, I consider that overall no more than 10% of the resources were being applied to Unit A in this first period and that a fair and realistic allocation until 28 September 2007 in relation to Unit C is 45%. Thereafter, for the second period up to 6 February 2008, a fair and realistic allocation to Unit C is 80%.</p>

These were for instance addressed by Mr Joyce, Spiers and Fairweather whose extended time has been allocated to this period. The fact that (as was the case) DMW substantially exaggerated the extent and scope of the defects and that extra time had to be deployed to deal with what turned out to be difficult clients whose relationship with their professional team was deteriorating does not detract from the need to make an appropriate allowance off any cost or loss incurred by WLC in relation to these matters. In addition, there were adjudications during this period, in relation to which each party would be expected to pay its own costs and it is clear that not insignificant time was deployed by several of the staff whose time is claimed for under this head; there can be no recovery in respect of that. In my judgment, a maximum deduction of £30,000 can and should be made for these matters.</p>

The same events referred to above for this period applied but there were also substantial additional works relating to the external works, joinery and doors, new plastering work, and additional work emanating from the deployment of DMW’s direct contractors as set out in the Voluntary Particulars. This latter problem essentially involved substantial additional attendance on about 50 directly employed contractors and included work such as opening up completed works, installing and lifting up protection, clearing rubbish and waste materials away, supervision on health and safety matters and the provision of CDM obligation related services There were a substantial number of revised drawings issued in this period (23), architects instructions (134) and 94 confirmations of verbal instructions. There were particular time consuming problems during this period, not least of which were the Light Wall issues, the Adams Joinery matters particularly relating to the Leather in the Library and the almost never-ending problems associated with the lighting above the Barrisol ceilings. The ordinary and the underlying level of preliminary resources would never have been sufficient to accommodate all the problems relating to these issues.</p>

In relation to the first of these two reductions, I apply the same exercise as in relation to Item 4 above.

After 14 August 2008, undoubtedly costs were incurred and resources deployed. However, there would always to have been a deployment of some such resources following Practical Completion, whenever it occurred. This is because there was a Defects Liability Period and during such period there would always likely to have been the application of resources to deal with defects or alleged defects and final accounting and, these would not usually attract any additional payment, and only very unusually pursuant to Clause 26. I am therefore disinclined to find on a balance of probabilities that any liability for costs incurred after 14 August 2008 attracts any entitlement to be paid.</p>

A sum of £33,680 relates to other charges incurred from professional organisations in relation into investigations into the Light Wall, the lift enclosure and the Courtyard Sliding Doors as well as the chimneys and flues.

In <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Alfred McAlpine Homes North Ltd v Property and Land Contractors Ltd </span>(1995) 76 BLR, HHJ Humphrey Lloyd QC, considering an appeal from an arbitrator, addressed the issue of the various formulae in relation to such claims at pages 70-71:</p>

	      <span style="color:#231F20">“…the Emden formula…is one of a number of methods conventionally applied in an attempt to arrive at an approximation of the damages supposedly incurred by a contractor where there has been delay to the progress of the works whereby completion is similarly delayed. The theory is that because the period of delay is uncertain and as the contractor can take no steps to reduce its head office expenditure and other overhead costs and cannot obtain additional work there are no means whereby the contractor can avoid incurring the continuing head office expenditure, notwithstanding the reduction in turnover as a result of the suspension of delay to the progress of the work. The reduced activity no longer therefore pays its share towards the overhead costs. This type of loss (sometimes called a claim for "unabsorbed overheads") is however to be contrasted with the loss that may occur if there is a prolongation of the contract period which results in the contractor allocating more overhead expenditure to the project than was to have been contemplated at the date of the contract. The latter might perhaps be best described as "additional overheads" and will, of course, be subject to prove that additional expenditure was in fact incurred.</span>

HHJ Lloyd QC was not saying that assessment could not be part of the ascertainment process. What one has to do is to be able to be confident that the loss or expense being allowed had actually been incurred as a result of the Clause 26 delay or disruption causing factors. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is therefore necessary to review the evidence of fact in this case, which primarily came from Mr Corless, who I found to be a honest, reasonable and satisfactory witness whose evidence I accept. Mr Corless has given detailed evidence that WLC’s “business model” and mode of operation is and was to use only direct employed (that is not agency) staff in lead roles when carrying out contracts. Its Business Development Department was tasked to identify suitable contracts to tender which would commence on site at a time when the appropriate staff become available, that is following the completion of their current projects or when their expertise is no longer required on a particular project. WLC’s directors assisted in this process by carrying out a review of future tendering opportunities and staff availability on a weekly basis every Monday morning. Thus the strategy was constantly under review and allowed the relevant director to accept or reject tender opportunities depending upon resource availability ahead of their receipt in the office. Between January 2006 and September 2008 WLC’s tender success rate was in the order of 1 in 4 (explained in evidence to be based on tenders submitted). During that period WLC had to and did decline a number of tendering opportunities: that was not said vaguely, or in a vacuum of support: the opportunities received and declined were precisely detailed on a comprehensive schedule attached to Mr Corless’ statement. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Corless stated that one of the primary reasons for declining opportunities was that WLC had a number of employees that were still engaged on Unit C project and until they were released from their duties there they could not be considered available for other contracts.  The levels of time commitment required of management resource for Unit C were clear from the statements of Messrs Joyce, Howie and McMorrow.  It was inevitable, he said, that but for the involvement of management staff in Unit C over a prolonged period other opportunities could have been pursued.  It was clear from the schedule (attached to the statement) that the number of opportunities in the relevant period was significant and the market for the type of projects constructed by Walter Lilly was relatively buoyant in the 2006 to 2008 period. He went on to say: “As a consequence of not being permitted to do so the management team, comprising of those individuals listed above, were on site for additional durations and could not be made available for other projects.  As a result the business was prevented from acquiring more profitable contracts”. He was firm in evidence that he was absolutely confident that, if WLC had had the management team from Unit C available, more tenders would have been submitted and one in four tendered projects would have been secured.I accept that evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A number of points are made by DMW, its Counsel and Mr Pontin, only some of which were put to Mr Corless. It is said first that there was no disruption attributable to Unit C after June 2008. That does not take the discussion anywhere because the delays in this case and the extension and thickening of resources that started within a few weeks of the commencement of the project in 2004. It is wrong and indeed illogical to consider the loss of profit and overhead as being initiated solely in the period from the original date for completion in March 2006 to 14 August 2008. If the project had gone to plan and without delay and disruption, the management team would have been capable of being released in part during the original contract period; put another way, not all the management team needed to be on site or allocated to the project for the whole of the original contract period. The loss of profit and overhead is legitimately calculated by reference to the delay period because profit and overhead from other projects would have been generated in that period. This is a bad point in any event because loss of overhead and profit is not claimed beyond 4 February 2008.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly (and Mr Corless was not asked about this), it is suggested that there was no disruption to WLC’s tendering opportunities in 2007 because Mr Howie said that in that year WLC had been able to recruit additional management staff to fulfil tender opportunities, that being supported by reference to an increase in construction personnel in 2007. That however misses the point because, if the management team from Unit C was available in 2007 to be deployed elsewhere yet more tendering projects could have been embarked upon.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly (and again Mr Corless was not asked about this), it is suggested that because WLC’s construction staff went down slightly (by five) between 2005 and 2006 some of its loss of overhead and profit must have been due "to its own internal staffing issues". I attach no or little weight to this point not only because it was not put to him but also because in logic a small change in the number of construction staff could be attributable to any number of factors. The point is in any event a bad one because the management team from Unit C who were employed by WLC would still have been available to be deployed on other projects.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, there was some cross-examination of Mr Corless about the schedule attached to his statement to the effect that for some of the tenders in 2006 WLC declined to tender for reasons which were not connected with Unit C. Mr Corless accepted a number of these points. However the general point is not a good one because the claim is in truth more analogous to a loss of opportunity claim, namely that because WLC could not deploy its Unit C team elsewhere and  thus it lost the opportunity to tender for any number of projects on the basis of deploying that management team with the probability being that it would have secured sufficient profitable work for that team to produce returns during the period of delay; it has thus lost profit and overhead recovery which it would otherwise probably have secured if the delay had not happened.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifthly, Mr Pontin deployed what DMW’s Counsel has called a "sense check" which involved references to the WLC company accounts which identified overall a 9.6% overhead office overheads and profit recovery in 2006 and comparable returns in 2007 in 2008. He suggests that there were fluctuations and lower percentages in two previous years, a high level of repeat orders, increased turnover and profit in 2007 in 2008 and an increase in employee numbers in 2006 to 2008 which he suggests demonstrates that the current claim is inconsistent with what actually happened. I disagree, noting that none of this was put to WLC witnesses. It was only in 2008 that the banking crisis began to emerge and the economy and in particular the house-building sector (in London and particularly in the high value residential sector in which WLC operated with some success) had been vibrant between 2006 and 2008. There is no real reason to believe other than that, if WLC’s competent and experienced management team deployed on Unit C had been available much earlier than they were, further work would have been secured and the profit and overhead returns would therefore have been greater in the years 2005/2006, 2006/2007 and 2007/2008. </p>

It is true that at tender stage, in the absence of any significant amount of design information, WLC did say that the programme period could be in the region of 80 to 90 weeks. However it committed itself contractually to a 78 week contract period and there is no good reason to believe other than that it would have completed the works within that period but for the facts which this judgement has determined delayed it.</p>

I do not really understand the relevance of this point because it is well known in the construction industry that experienced site management might be deployed partly on one project and partly on another. Mr Fairweather could therefore have been deployed elsewhere in respect of the part of his time which was deployed on Unit C. In any event, Mr Fairweather was allocated 100% to Unit C as he was the specific manager for Unit C.</p>

Where there are slight differences I prefer the calculation of WLC as endorsed by Mr Hunter. Head Office overheads and profit are only claimed up to 4 February 2008 and the weekly loss is identified as £4,588.71 (compared with Mr Pontin’s figure of £4,544.94). This multiplied by 99 weeks for the delay up to 4 February 2008 with credit being given, wholly properly, for the overhead and profit recovered by WLC on the difference between the amount of profit and overheads earned on the works (by way of the 4½% addition to overheads and profit) and the tendered overhead and profit allowance. This produces a net sum of £274,965.12 (as calculated by Mr Hunter, which is, if anything, generous to DMW as the amount of overheads and profit encompassed by the 4½% is less than the pleaded amount.</p>

The sub-contract between WLC and Norstead was evidenced by or contained in WLC’s Sub-Contract Order dated 31 March 2005. Most of the sub-contract works were the subject matter of provisional sums. The anticipated commencement date was 20 June 2005 and the duration was specified as 42 weeks. From its later claim in October 2008, Norstead accepted that commencement was deferred from June 2005 to 5 September 2005; thus, the completion date was to be 42 weeks later, namely 26 June 2006. In the result, Norstead did not substantially complete their works until 6 February 2008, there thus being overall delay beyond the projected completion date of some 99 weeks. It is true to say that the mechanical and electrical work was, apparently, nearing completion in February 2007 but there remained commissioning works and, more importantly in the context of the delays, a persistent flow of variations over the following 11 to 12 months.</p>

It is beyond doubt that it was severely delayed and disrupted, not only by the delays which impacted upon WLC (for which WLC was and is entitled to compensation and extension), but also by factors which impacted particularly upon Norstead. In this latter category fall a vast number of seriously delayed information and instructions. Its claim describes a hand to mouth release of information and instruction to them. A good example of significantly disruptive factors (described earlier in this judgement) are the repeated re-working of the electrics above the Barrisol ceilings in the Pool and the Cinema and the numerous alterations and adjustments to the LED lighting within the Light Wall. The numerous complaints made by it in its claim are reflected, if not entirely, largely in the documentary evidence that supplied to the Court (in the E bundles principally).</p>

In summary, he described how from March 2007 onwards attempts were made to agree measured and varied works with Norstead and how in September 2007 representatives from Norstead’s parent company were expressing frustration about the lack of attention to the other claims which they were making in their interim accounts; adjudication was threatened. That was then followed by the period in which G&amp;T were told not to issue any further valuation recommendations. Thereafter, the appointment by G&amp;T’s of a new M&amp;E surveyor slowed the process down and he was unable to devote sufficient time in any event to the account. A new partner was involved by G&amp;T who took a very hard line with Norstead’s account, the unavoidable inference being that he was under pressure from DMW to do so. Meanwhile, by the end of summer in 2008 there was near agreement on the measured and variation sections of Norstead’s account for all three Units. The claim was presented in its final form by Norstead in October 2008. There followed an exchange of comments.</p>

As a result of that, it needs to demonstrate that it was put in a position in which it faced a substantial and broadly meritorious claim which it was reasonable to settle.

In my judgement the primary position is simply unrealistic. It is beyond doubt that Norstead was and must have been very substantially delayed and disrupted not only by the simple fact that it was on the site working for 99 weeks longer than it had anticipated (a 236% increase on the agreed sub-contract period) but also by the unavoidably disrupted nature of its own and all the other work. Mr Pontin has analysed diary records and the files provided by Norstead in support of its claim and has formed the view that they do not demonstrate or prove in an absolute sense all the claims put forward. His analysis of the loss of productivity or labour disruption claim ignores the overwhelming inference (if nothing else) that there must have been very substantial disruption and loss of productivity for which Norstead is unlikely to have been reimbursed under the measured or variation part of the evaluation. </p>

WLC was faced with a frustrated and increasingly aggressive sub-contractor which, by and large, had right on its side. It had been seriously delayed for reasons which entitled it to a full extension of time and it was and must have been obvious to WLC that there was a probability that Norstead would recover not only the extended preliminary costs for such delay but also some compensation for disruption and escalation in costs. It is likely that this was the best settlement available and in reaching that view I take into account the fact that this settlement was achieved before there had been any recognition by DMW or its advisers that any further extension beyond February 2007 was due; it was in WLC’s interests to keep the settlement as low as it could achieve given that pending the likely future litigation it would have to pay the unpaid element of the settlement to Norstead with no certainty that it would be recovered from DMW. WLC was put in a position in which it faced a substantial and broadly meritorious claim which it was reasonable to settle. The need to settle with those parties was caused by delay and disruption caused by DMW and the settlement fell well within the “reasonable range of settlement”. </p>

In my judgement, it would be safer to allow some amount off the full amount of the settlement and, in seeking to allow an amount which the Court can be confident directly relates to no less than Norstead was entitled in relation to the factors attributable to DMW and for which WLC is entitled to compensation, I fix that sum at £300,000.</p>

Work actually commenced on 16 January 2006 but was not completed until 15 April 2007, albeit that Andrews was required to return to site from time to time thereafter.

At a fairly early stage, Andrews was required by way of variation to carry out extensive additional drywall ceiling and partition work (by Site Instruction 215A on 30 March 2006).

Delays were attributed to a substantial number of variations, out of sequence working, conflicts between drawings requiring substantial revisions, late Mechanical and Electrical design, late release of Architect’s drawings, incorrect alignment of external windows and delays particularly in relation to joinery works. Essentially, the claim is made up in relation to the delays by what are called "additional overheads” for 64 weeks (at a rate of £2,517 per week) and for a supervisor’s time for 20 weeks thereafter at one day a week (at a rate of £216 per week).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This claim has not been settled but WLC personnel (unnamed) have produced a commentary on the claim in relation to Unit C. It notes (and in this it is supported by contemporaneous documentation) that in fact Andrews continued working on the site after 15 April 2007, albeit that no additional allowance for that is claimed other than for the extended supervision thereafter. The commentary refers to the fact that of the 287 site instructions referred to in the claim as giving rise to variations only 63 were specific to Unit C with a further 28 relating to Unit C in part only. The commentary says that all the delays suffered by Andrews were caused by matters for which DMW is liable. Oddly, when turning to the quantum, WLC allowed a higher rate for the overheads (£2,657 per week) but only applies this rate to the first 44 weeks of delay and thereafter for the remaining 20 weeks it only allows £600 a week for a contracts manager to visit and supervise the project. It allows the post-completion supervisor claim in full as reasonable and an additional underplaying demand of £750. This produces a net recoverable sum for all three Units of £87,302. That is then divided by three to reflect the fact that the total sum relates to all three Units, producing a net figure of £29,100.</p>

Mr Pontin has done a very detailed analysis of this claim and produces a figure valuing the Andrews claim between £8,986.56 (if no further extension of time is allowed and £12,447.60 if further time is awarded).

Essentially, the claim fell into three categories, time related preliminary costs (such as site supervision, visiting management, extended travel, extended protection and cleaning), additional time related head office overheads (calculated on a formula basis), and financing costs; there was a claim for additional expert quantity surveying services as well for assistance in relation to the claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Unless and to the extent that Adams Joinery has been paid for its extended preliminaries through payments already received by it, it obviously did incur a seriously extended level of such preliminary resources. There was a very large amount of additional involvement of management, supervision and design teams of Adams, and the documentation certainly supports this, to deal with numerous changes as well as the simple need for it to be on site for over 70 weeks more than it was contracted for. Mr Pontin has done some "reverse engineering" to try to demonstrate in effect that there was a more than sufficient allowance in the first two sets of accepted quotations from Adams Joinery to cover supervision for all or most of the 93 weeks. He was obviously very uncomfortable in the witness box when seeking to defend this. What he had done was to take the sum of £40,027 to be found in various quotations as covering supervision (£32,522 covered by the original sub contract order and £7,505 included in seven later variation instructions). In one of the quotations (AI 258C) he found a rate of £575 per week for supervision. He then said that if one divides £40,027 by £575 there are nearly 70 weeks worth of supervision. That, with respect to him, is at best naive and at worst scraping the barrel. If £32,522 for supervision was incorporated into the quotations covered by the original order, that was simply to cover the supervision for the works covered by the original order; in simple arithmetical terms, supervision was to be charged as a lump sum but if one translates it into a weekly cost spread over the original sub contract period of 20 weeks that becomes £1,626. The only point which can be made is that credit should be given for specific supervision covered by variations, namely £7,505.</p>

That again is a bad point. It is an inevitable consequence of modern contracting that time is always allowed in the programme for consequential snagging which inevitably require some supervision. I am not surprised that up to 8 weeks was spent on the process given all the problems at the site and the presence of numerous directly employed contractors. In any event, the overall delay remains at 73 weeks and additional supervision would have to have been involved in any event. </p>

He also suggests that all or much of the additional visits were covered by quotations. Mr Hunter challenges that this analysis is correct and points out that much of the management time would not necessarily be spent in actually visiting the site above would be working from head office. That is amply borne out by the evidence, for instance particularly in relation to Mr Hawks of Adams Joinery who if anything was spending a large part of his time in handling the variations, the late information and a very substantial amount of liaison with BLDA in relation thereto.

However, he ignores the fact that because the overall sub-contract period was substantially extended the joinery site staff still needed to have materials delivered on a regular basis. Although he allows £1,260 against this sub-claim, in my judgement that this is much too low and a realistic minimum of £10,000 must represent the additional transport costs in question.</p>

He does highlight a mathematical error whereby Adams Joinery claims nominally for £17,751.81 actually adds up to £15,617.64. That seems to be a good point which Mr Hunter cannot and does not try to explain. Again Mr Pontin’s main point does not reflect the fact that the workforce had to be on site for 93 weeks instead of 20 weeks. Whilst he makes a fair point that the quoted additional work and daywork will allow for labour cost including travel allowances, this does not cover the full extended period on site. A realistic minimum of £5,000 should be sufficient to recompense Adams Joinery for travel allowances which are not covered by the accepted prices.</p>

I have made some allowances for Mr Parnham’s time in the preliminaries claims (see above) as it is clear that he was in effect an additional preliminary resource needed to help manage the delay which was occurring and the administrative hiatus which emanated for the Design Team. However, part of his time was spent in putting together extension claims which were not as such pursued in these proceedings and part to address the doubtless aggravating involvement of Knowles; it was unwise and aggressive on the part of Mr Mackay to bring in Knowles but it was not something which as such gives rise to an entitlement to loss and expense.</p>

The settlement agreement was dated 15 July 2011. Whilst of course it was sensible for Mr and Mrs Mackay and DMW to settle, it is in some respects a curious document in that the professionals agreed to pay £1.8 million, of which £875,213.50 related to costs, but it contains no breakdown of which professionals paid what. Appendix 1 is more curious because, whilst all the parties agreed the split between liability and costs and that 67.5% related to defects and 32.5% to loss and expense, there then follows DMW’s own breakdown, prefaced by the following words:</p>

One would therefore expect that parts of the sum received should or would be allocated to those defects. It is therefore revealing that DMW and Mr Mackay have provided literally no evidence at all in this regard to demonstrate that that expectation is incorrect. This was notwithstanding that the point was flagged up by the Claimant’s Counsel in opening. Counsel for DMW and Mr Mackay did address this in closing as to the principles but provided no assistance as to how the Court should go about the exercise in practice, apart from (politely but diffidently) saying that “it is a difficult job, and as Lord Justice Oliver made plain, it's a job that unfortunately it seems the judge does have to shoulder”. Counsel for the Claimant said in closing that the Schedule to the settlement agreement was “self-serving to an amusing extent” in seeking, “to allocate the sums received away from the major defects alleged against both WLC and the professional team and towards lesser defects claimed against the professional team alone.”</p>

On a balance of probabilities the most likely “driver” of the settlement sums paid were the “core” alleged defects which form the heart of the case (about which the Court has heard extensive evidence), and therefore one must allocate the settlement monies to those defects accordingly.</p>

I can accept also an allocation of £300,000 to delay related loss and expense was a reasonable allocation because there was and is clear evidence that some of the delays were attributable to (at least) properly arguable matters of complaint against, particularly, BLDA, JSI and Equation. </p>

For instance, the Settlement Agreement attributes £206,000 to some 10 electrical defects but I have no evidence for instance that Equation or CBP or anyone else were responsible, arguably or at all, for any of these defects. It can be seen that these defects were pursued against one or more of the third parties but one can see no hint or suggestion that any of the third parties accepted that they were or even that might be liable for them. What the Court actually has is a substantial amount of evidence relating to the defects pursued as against WLC. For instance, in relation to ABW, the Court can form a view that there was an arguable case against BLDA or JSI that they should have advised DMW or Mr and Mrs Mackay that the wood which they had selected had a very real propensity to fade and change colour when exposed to light and therefore that the settlement would have made some allowance (albeit without admission of liability) for the potential liability.

They agree following an inspection of the roof over the stained area "that the cause may be related to a fault in the roof covering around a rain water outlet located immediately above the area where the staining first occurred; wetness exists under the roofing membrane for a distance away from the outlet” but there was no "immediately obvious water penetration point". They observed "that numerous diagonal cuts to the surface of the membrane had been made where it dresses up onto the roof light skirtings and perimeter up stands”, going on to say that it was unknown whether any of these cuts penetrated the roof membrane but stating "that these cuts should not have been made". They noted that the single layer polymeric roof finish was not fully bonded to its substrate but could not ascertain the cause. Mr Howie suggested that the cuts could have been made by a contractor directly employed by DMW or Mr Mackay to install ultraviolet light film on the windows and the roof lights in the area after Practical Completion (and before the leak was noticed in 2009). There is some evidence that the roof was completed and signed off by BLDA in December 2006 and there is no evidence of leaking prior to Practical Completion (none being noted in the snagging lists issued before). Over £5,000 is claimed whilst relevant remedial works are costed at just under £2,000 by WLC’s experts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Architectural experts are both uncertain about the cause of the leak and primarily due to cost have not opened up the roof. It is slightly surprising that after three years Mr and Mrs Mackay have not had the defect repaired; if they had done, the area would have been opened up and the cause of leaking could have been ascertained. Mr Josey suggests that because he has seen no design for it and because the failure is confined to a single location the probability is that the roof covering had not been constructed properly in the localised area.</p>

The probabilities being even, DMW has not proved its case. If I had decided that there was bad workmanship, I would have fixed damages at the level put forward by WLC’s experts, namely in the region of £1,800.</p>

However, the source of the water penetration is unknown as "neither expert has had access to the roof" but consider “the matter to be the result of a local aberration in the upstand flashing assembly around the base of the roof light." Mr Josey in his first report suggests that for similar reasons to those advanced in relation to the Entrance Hall roof "it would appear that the leaks are related to localised faults in workmanship". Again, no remedial work has been done. Mr Howie gave unchallenged evidence that the roofing works were signed off in 2006 and it appears that the leakage, such as it is, has occurred well after Practical Completion.</p>

In the Drawing Room doors and frames were linked around a curved bay incorporating a series of pairs of inward opening French windows, with the frame being partially curved or facetted. In the other room there were five pairs of doors set between masonry piers with four opening onto balconies and one providing access to a glass bridge leading to the garden. The problem, simply stated, as the experts agree, is that the "locking mechanisms to the French windows do not easily engage"; these mechanisms were effectively concealed within the vertical timber stiles.  The experts agree that this "is a consequence of the height of the doors". They go on to say in their joint statement that the "windows flex more than windows of a more conventional height would do and this is likely to adversely affect the locking mechanism and also the effectiveness of their draught seals" and to "remedy this, the windows would need to be of a different design, size, appearance and/or operation".</p>

There really can be no criticism of the apportionment of one third each up until 26 August 2007; indeed, there would have been a good arguable case for it being apportioned on a 50/50 basis given that Plot A had been certified as practically complete in early February 2007. An apportionment of 50/50 between Units B and C up to 30 September 2007 is wholly reasonable and sensible and an allocation of 100% to Unit C thereafter reflects the fact that it was the only Unit which was not practically complete. The logic was and is that the Contractor is responsible for security up until practical completion and, thereafter the owner or owners are left with that responsibility.  The fact that coincidentally the owners of Units A and B may have had the advantage of the presence at one end of the overall site (actually on the Unit C part of the site) is neither here nor there. It may be that potential intruders to Units A or B might have been put off by the presence of security guards on Unit C. It needs also to be borne in mind that DMW was the employer in respect of the other two Units. It is argued that after 7 July 2008, the date when the Works to Unit C were practically complete (as I have found), the Static Security should be apportioned equally as between the three Units. I disagree because the reason that the Static Security was maintained was because DMW’s new Architect, Navigant, wrongly withheld the Practical Completion Certificate until 14 August 2008; put another way, it was being maintained only because Unit C was not certified as practically completed and if Practical Completion had been certified on 7 July 2008, the Static Security requirement would have been needed.</p>

The deposit having been paid,  but before Doppler Lifts got into financial troubles, eventually going into liquidation, and before it did any or much work on the project, let alone delivering anything to the site, this work was omitted by Architect’s Instruction and the lift works were placed with a new contract are directly employed by DMW.</p>

That side agreement was recorded in a letter dated 6 June 2006 from DMW’s then solicitor, Manches, and signed by WLC’s then solicitor. The letter itself refers to issues having arisen between DMW and WLC, with DMW believing that WLC and Doppler “are in repudiatory breach of their contracts” and WLC considering that “Doppler is willing and able to perform its sub-contract but has been prevented by a lack of instructions from the Architect".

The instruction from BLDA required WLC to place an order with Doppler on the basis of the tender recommendation. There is no suggestion by DMW or Mr Pontin that the deposit paid to Doppler was paid anything other than pursuant to this instruction. Under the Clause 13.4 provisions for payment for the expenditure of provisional sums (and the instruction did call for the expenditure of a provisional sum item), the sum paid by way of deposit by WLC to Doppler was payable and should have been certified for payment.</p>

This was a working solution which enabled DMW through its Architect with impunity to omit the Doppler work and enable this DMW to employ other lift contractors directly. The "issues" referred to in Clause 6 were those referred to in Clause 4, as to whether or not Doppler had performed its sub-contract. The wording of Clause 6 is not expressed in terms of exclusion or limitation of entitlement and should not be construed as such. No evidence let alone argument has been proffered by DMW that Doppler did not perform its sub-contract or that WLC did not assist "in mitigating any additional costs claimed by Doppler and/or in recovering any over-payments to Doppler”; it has not even been suggested that the payment of the deposit by WLC was an over-payment. In any event, in these proceedings any issues between WLC and DMW have been resolved because it would be for DMW to prove either that WLC had not assisted in “mitigating” or “recovering” or that there was some loss flowing to DMW as a result of any failure to assist all that there was some failure on the part of Doppler to perform its sub-contract. None of these things has been proved or established.</p>

There is no issue that G&amp;T valued this item at £262,286 and, now, DMW and Mr Pontin suggest that it should be reduced by £17,995. The experts put an agreed comment into their first joint statement which was: “G&amp;T to explain reduction v45 and v47”. This is reflected what had actually happened which was that G&amp;T valued the doors and frames at the higher figure in Valuation 45 but then reduced it by £17,995 in their Valuation 47. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This reduction between the two valuations clearly arose because Knowles, for reasons known only to itself, instructed G&amp;T in October 2007 to take out from their previous valuation the sum representing Adams Joinery’s preliminaries in the post-16 February 2007 period. For no good reason and without an obvious, reasoned or justified departure from normal and independent quantity surveying practice and, contrary to their own inclination, G&amp;T did reduce their valuation accordingly. It was in any event simply wrong as a matter of contract for this reduction to have been made because it is inevitable that sub-contractors instructed pursuant to provisional sum items will have their own preliminary costs, irrespective of whether the main contractor is in delay; those preliminary costs are payable to the main contractor (for onward transmission to the sub-contractor) simply because the preliminary costs of the sub-contractor are part of its price for carrying out the sub-contract works in question. The provisional sum payment provisions in this case effectively require DMW to pay and the Architect to certify sums properly due to the sub-contractor in question.</p>

As I have found that extensions are due well into 2008 and because Adams Joinery had concluded their work before then, there is no conceivable justification for a reduction in the value of the fit-out works.  The correct figure for fit out works is therefore £4,594,969.85,  as accepted by Mr Hunter..</p>

One starts from the fact that the total sum in issue was included in valuations carried out by G&amp;T, who seemed to be one of the few professionals retained by DMW who have not been sued by it; indeed Mr Whidbourne and Mr Cane of that firm were called as witnesses by DMW. </p>

It is accepted that, if and to the extent that Mr McMorrow’s evidence is accepted by the Court, this proposed reduction in the account should be rejected. Mr McMorrow’s evidence in relation to the 16 items in question in this category was not seriously or effectively challenged in cross-examination. All that Counsel for DMW says in closing is that his recollection "of detail of events that occurred between six and eight years ago… should be treated with caution". Counsel also properly accepted in closing that Mr McMorrow "gave his evidence in a careful and measured way". I also formed a favourable impression of him.

It is very difficult after many years when issues like this are raised belatedly by a defendant for a contractor to provide detailed evidence to show each and every item was approved and instructed. In any case like this, there is ample general evidence that BLDA, Equation and Janine Stone had a substantial amount of direct contact with sub-contractors and were telling them to do various things, which the subcontractors then did; a good example is the Light Wall. I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that these items of work were instructed, albeit probably informally; there would have been no good reason for G&amp;T honestly to agree them unless they had been satisfied that the work had been instructed and attracted an appropriate level of payment; I bear in mind in this context that G&amp;T was and allowed itself to be put under substantial pressure by Knowles to withhold or limit valuations and it is almost inconceivable that they would have agreed matters as due for payment unless it was clear that they were.</p>

The experts accept in effect that these items were instructed but liability for them is not accepted. All items were agreed by G&amp;T and certified for payment. In relation to the staining, I have already found that this work was instructed by Mr Mackay and that it was essentially extra work because it was seeking to put right a problem (the fading of the veneered wood) which was not the responsibility of WLC; it follows that DMW is liable for this and there is no issue on the quantum. As for the plastering which involved dubbing out, return visits and some making good. Mr McMorrow has given detailed explanations which were not substantially challenged; G&amp;T agreed these items as legitimate variations. In so far as the burden of proof is on WLC, it has established that this work was not only instructed but that it was a variation. The final item relates to external windows and involved a change of specification to allow for extra coats of filler primer and it is evidenced by a letter from WLC to BLDA dated 20 October 2005; as this was clearly agreed to be something for which WLC was entitled to payment, there can be little or no doubt that this was instructed and that it was not necessary as a result of any default on the part of WLC.

WLC does not through its Counsel in closing take any real issue with this sum being taken out of the account. Accordingly, I find that this reduction has been established. In addition, a further £4,209.33 was agreed by the Quantum experts to be deductable for items not instructed. Therefore a total of £33,121,08 falls to be deducted.</p>

In relation to insurance, the parties agreed that in relation to insurances: "The value related rate of 0.81% would remain should the value of the project increase beyond £15,477,000”; a reduction of £17,500 was negotiated in relation to original tender price for such insurance of £125,363.70 (that is, £107,863.70). This was contained in WLC’s fax message dated 23 April 2004 to G&amp;T, expressly incorporated into the Memorandum of Agreements dated 28 May 2004 between the parties. This was at the stage when all three Units were to be dealt with as one overall contract. The Deed of Variation dated 23 December 2004 effectively incorporated this again but by reference to the recalculated Contract Sum (£5,281,974) is for Unit C. There is no suggestion that the substantive meaning, whatever it is, was materially changed by the Deed of Variation; in effect, one would read in the quotation set out above the recalculated Contract Sum for Unit C.</p>

It is common ground that these insurances would necessarily cover contractors all risks and works, amongst others. In my judgement the meaning of the expression is clear: provided that the value of the Contract did not exceed the Contract Sum, a fixed sum would be payable in respect of the insurance, that sum being calculable by reference to the original Contract Sum as adjusted to reflect the fact that the Deed of Variation allocated a much lower Contract Sum to Unit C. However, if the “value” increased beyond this adjusted Contract Sum for Unit C, then WLC was entitled to be paid for the provision of these insurances at the rate of 0.81% of that "value". The word "value" is used as opposed to a word like "cost" or "expenditure. The “value of the project” must be the value due to WLC; these words have emanated from WLC and must be taken to mean the adjusted Contract Sum. The adjusted Contract Sum will include not only the value of the works carried out by sub-contractors pursuant to provisional sum instructions and basic preliminaries but also other adjustments to the Contract Sum such as additional sums due for loss and expense under Clause 26 and other contractual "claim" entitlements. The original Contract Sum for unit C has been substantially exceeded.</p>

The parties therefore accepted the validity of and need for a charge for "Group Safety", it being obvious (and indeed not uncommon) that the holding company will make a charge to its subsidiaries for the provision of appropriate safety measures. It therefore becomes a matter simply of valuation if and when the value of the Works increases to apply this percentage because the Group will make the charge (as here) against the overall value. The percentage charge is against the overall value and, again, as the value includes claim or delay related loss and expense it should be applied to that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The water charge falls into a somewhat different category. There is an item "Temporary Water (Consumption Only)” against which there was a sum of £26,310.90 and it is this sum against which the percentage of 0.17% is extrapolated. It is therefore difficult to see how a value related allocation can be made in effect only on a valuation basis. One can see that there might be a basis of claiming additional cost for the provision of water over an extended period, for instance as part of a loss and expense claim, or even where the variations needed some particular water provision which could be brought into the valuation; however, this approach is eschewed by WLC. Whereas insurance and safety relate to everything which is carried out on site, the provision of water may not be. Additionally, there is no evidence about the cost of additional water to WLC, although I have allowed a very small amount in one of the preliminary allowances. I therefore consider that this part of the claim is not justified.</p>

There is no issue in this case that the statute is applicable, subject to arguments about Sections 8 and 5. I do not have the benefit of any authorities which have been cited to me and I have not of my own initiative been able to find any which are of direct relevance.

I have no doubt that the contract rate provides a "substantial remedy" within the meaning of Section 8 of the statute. Any "substantial remedy" must be one which at least judged at the date of the contract would provide adequate compensation for late payment. Section 8 is obviously considering at least the possibility that the "substantial remedy" will be less than the statutory interest remedy. Whilst the statutory “remedy” is Base Rate plus 8% and that is a "better" remedy for the Contractor than the contractual remedy for late payment, that does not mean that the contractual remedy is not “substantial”. The commercial reality is that commercial lending is, depending on the creditworthiness of and security offered by the Contractor, likely to be in the area of Base Rate plus 1 to 3%. Therefore, on that basis not only is the Contractor likely to be compensated for late payment but also there is an incentive provided on the Employer to pay on time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This claim is essentially in two halves. The first relates to wrongful deductions totalling £854,596 from between February 2007 onwards. These deductions were for liquidated damages for delay (for which WLC was, as I have held, not liable) and for defective works such as the lift, plastering, ABW and the like (a very large part of which WLC was not liable for). WLC and Mr Hunter have put forward doubtless what they consider is a simplified calculation which is all based on Base Rate plus 8%. They have taken a mid point between the start of the deductions (late February 2007) and late August 2008 when the full deduction was being maintained. Although I will hear the parties if they can not agree, the calculation can be on a mid-point basis, depending on what was deducted and when, but the interest should be Base Rate plus 5%. There should also be some allowance (in favour of DMW) to allow for the fact that some of the deductions for defective work were from time to time justifiable, although, unless persuaded otherwise, I can not see that this would exceed £60,000 for any period in 2007.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second half of the claim is more complex and relates to the various delay and disruption claims; thus for the preliminary thickening claim between March 2006 and February 2007, the net claimed figures are taken from a midpoint and, as they all gradually accumulate in time, they are taken from June 2005 through to March 2010. In relation to sub-contractor claims, nothing is claimed for Adams Joinery and Andrews whose claims have not yet been paid and interest is claimed on what was paid to Norstead in January 2009. Interest is claimed on additional overheads and profit recovery from a midpoint (16 March 2007 to March 2010). Other claims including additional static security guarding costs and disputed valuation are also claimed. I have to say that I have not been assisted by the evidence or the argument how this half of the claim should be addressed. DMW’s Counsel make the general point that there can be no entitlement to interest unless the debt has accrued and the debt can not accrue until either it is claimed or in the case of loss and expense adequate particulars and supporting information had been provided. Whilst I am satisfied that the conditions precedent in Clause 26 have been complied with, what I can not yet ascertain on the available evidence and argument is whether and when each and every one of these specific and claims and sub-claims in the final form in which they were presented in these proceedings (a) was first intimated and (b) was first adequately particularised. I am confident however that substantial further sums would, should and could have been certified over and above those which were certified or included in valuations; a good example of this is the loss and expense attributable to the delays beyond the date up to which BLDA granted extensions. I am also confident that other sums such as the static security guard costs could, should and would have been certified as 2007 and 2008 went along. I have invited the parties to seek to agree what should be allowed up until March 2010, failing which I may have to do the best that I can and may proceed to consider discretionary interest thereafter until judgement. However, although WLC’s Counsel and expert have provided detailed and later amended calculations, these have not been agreed and therefore I will defer to a later judgment the fixing of what contractual and discretionary interest should be allowed or awarded.</p>

That provided an opportunity to submit before the handing down any typographical, grammatical, arithmetical or other obvious errors which may have crept in to the document. This judgement is over 200 pages long and it was at least possible that I may have overlooked several issues which the parties would have liked me to deal with over and above the hundreds which I have addressed; they were invited to inform me of this before the handing down. Similarly, if the parties felt that I had provided insufficient reasoning on any given topic, they were invited to inform me appropriately beforehand. Although the parties’ Counsel helpfully provided me with lists of corrections and identified a number of areas which I had not addressed fully, those matters have now been addressed.</p>
