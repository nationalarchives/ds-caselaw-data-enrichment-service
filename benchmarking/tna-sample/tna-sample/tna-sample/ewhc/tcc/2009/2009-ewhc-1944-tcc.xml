	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This claim relates to birth defects said to have been caused to a group of children born between 1986 and 1999 as a result of negligence, breach of statutory duty and public nuisance on the part of Corby Borough Council and its statutory predecessor Corby District Council (collectively “CBC”) in connection with the reclamation of the extensive British Steel (“BSC”) site to the east of the town of Corby. The birth defects are shortened or missing arms, legs and fingers in the main and are said to have been caused as a the result of ingestion or inhalation of harmful substances generated by the reclamation works and spread in various ways through many parts of Corby.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It must be borne in mind that this trial has not as such been an open-ended inquiry in which the Court in an inquisitorial manner seeks to determine unilaterally what happened and what caused the birth defects. The Claimants have pleaded what their case is and it is that case which they have to establish broadly upon a balance of probabilities and which CBC has to meet. Thus, the Court is restricted to the evidence put before it. For instance, neither party has provided evidence to demonstrate whether there was statistically an increase in miscarriages or stillbirths during the period over which the Claimants were conceived and there has been no comparison with what had occurred over the previous years in Corby or since so far as the incidence of birth defects, miscarriages and still births were concerned; that might have been of assistance to support either side’s position. I suggested at an earlier procedural meeting that the parties might consider whether such evidence might be adduced. Further examples are Messrs Cropley and Palmer who were senior engineers and who were dismissed by CBC in early 1997; they were heavily involved in many of the projects about which criticism is made in these proceedings; neither party saw fit to call either of these people. Furthermore, although many thousands of pages of contemporary documents have been produced, many documents have not been; for instance, CBC has had a large number of documents destroyed accidentally; consequently, there are large gaps in the documentation. It would be wrong to speculate as to evidence which was not put before the Court. I must decide this case based on the evidence adduced by the parties.  </p>

The Group Litigation Order requires this Court to consider and address specific issues which are generic and common to the Claimants. The Court is not required at this stage to find that CBC is liable for damages to any individual Claimant but the issues which are now decided are to a large extent pre-requisite issues in any determination of liability. There are five specific issues which are expressly the subject of the Group Litigation Order which largely by agreement have been amplified by the addition of a further 25 sub-issues.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Corby was a small Northamptonshire village until it grew as a result of steelmaking. The area was known for a long time, indeed from Roman times, as one which contained ironstone deposits; indeed, the Domesday Book records the “manor of Corbei” as an iron producing centre. By 1910, Corby had its own ironstone works which were taken over by Stewarts and Lloyds. By the 1930s, a large integrated steelworks was in place on the east and north-east of what was now becoming a town. There was a large influx of steelworkers, particularly from Scotland. The town prospered and it was designated a new town in 1950. The population grew to some 50,000. Other industries and businesses were attracted to the area, such as Golden Wonder Crisps, Sealed Beam and Weetabix, and were also located on the east side and north sides of Corby. </p>

However, by late 1979, it had been decided that BSC would shut down which it did shortly thereafter, although the tube making facility was retained (now operated by Corus/Tata). Some thousands of people were made redundant from BSC and associated businesses from 1980 onwards. The BSC site as a whole extended historically to the south and north as well as the east of the town. Thus, ironstone quarries had been excavated at what is now the Earlstrees Industrial site to the north north east of the old town centre and at Cowthwick to the south east. </p>

That area appears to have represented about 50-60% of what had been historically owned by BSC and its predecessors. Broadly the sites acquired represented on plan a parallelogram shape of about 2.6 by 2 kilometres, bounded on the South by the Weldon Road, to the East by Bransgrave and Gretton Roads, to the North by Gretton Park Road and to the West by the (north-south railway line). Over the years which followed the reclamation, a large number of businesses relocated to Corby so that employment levels are high.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) There was an extensive railway network on the site which connected to the national railway line.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(b) The Blast Furnace building was a massive agglomeration with a number of multi-storey vessels stretching above it; it was on the west side of the site broadly where new Asda and Matalan stores were to be built in the 1980s. The Blast Furnace superstructure was dismantled by BSC after CBC purchased the site.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(c) Immediately to the east of the Blast Furnace was the Ore Preparation Plant and to the east of that the Glebe Coke Ovens over which some four very tall chimneys stretched. These were fired by gas and a coal mixture kept in a massive concrete bunker. To the north of the Blast Furnace were the Lime Kilns, lime being part of the steel making process. To the north east of the Blast Furnace was the Sinter Plant, which was also topped by a tall chimney. The Sinter Plant and the Blast Furnace area was known as the “Heavy End”, although sometimes this expression extended to other operations to the east.</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(d) Along the south side of the site broadly along the Weldon Road was, and indeed remains the Tube Works which was a series of massive industrial sheds; this was not acquired by CBC and was retained by BSC.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(e) To the north of the Tube Works and the east of the Ore Preparation Plant were the various Rolling and Strip Mills, the BOS Plant and the Deene Coke Oven, together with an asssociated By-Products Plant. The Mills were sometimes included in the expression “the Heavy Rolling Mills” There was a galvanising plant. This area encompassed Willowbrook North and South.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(f) The northern part of the site was by 1980 not particularly built upon albeit it can best be described as being waste land in all senses of the expression. There were sludge beds and 6 or 7 of what were called “Toxic Ponds” in the northern part of the site. To the east and south of the Toxic Ponds were the Candy Filter ponds. At the north east boundary there was a pond which came to be called the “Valley of the Drums” because some thousands of oil or other chemical drums had been dumped there. There were also a number of other dumps for a variety of other waste products. Part of this site to the south of the Toxic Ponds was retained by BSC.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(g) The whole area to the north and north east was or became known as the Deene Quarry. Over many years, it had been mined primarily for iron ore. Topographically, this had produced a hill and dale formation and appearance. Some of the quarry excavations had been filled either with the previously excavated overburden which could not be used in the iron making process or with wastes from the iron and steel making process. The vast bulk of it was contaminated to a greater or lesser degree. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The iron making process involved the admixture into pellet form in a sinter plant of ironstone, coke and limestone which was then transferred and fed through hoppers into a blast furnace; the furnace contents were heated up to an extremely high temperature with air blasted through jets near the bottom of the furnace. The exhaust gases were taken away in piping from the top of the furnace. The coke was made on the site in the two coke ovens from coal which was brought to the site by train. At the height of iron and steelmaking, some 1.3m tonnes of iron and steel were made annually. Although estimates vary, for every tonne of iron and steel produced, well over 2 tonnes of base material (iron ore, limestone and coke) was needed. There were necessarily substantial quantities of waste.</p>

He was removed from Toxic Ponds 5 and 6 when he stated to complain about what was happening. He was conscientious and a straightforward witness, albeit subpoenaed, who had a reasonably good recollection of what happened. He reported initially anonymously to Mr Hagen in 1996 about some unacceptable practices on the Willowbrook and Soothills contracts which led to Messrs Palmer and Cropley being dismissed and the police being called in.

He was a CBC Councillor from 1995 to 2003. His material involvement was as the Councillor to whom Mr Bosence went with his complaints in about March 1996; he then passed them on and in effect campaigned to have the matters investigated. Much of what he addressed at the time and in evidence was not directly relevant to the issues in the case. For instance, he was concerned about possible corruption between CBC Councillors and Officers and contractors in the early 1990s but in the result there was no prosecution and no evidence was put before the Court as to whether there was corruption; I can make no findings about this aspect of the history. I found him to be a wholly honest and principled person as far as his evidence went.</p>

His background beforehand was as a Planning Officer; he was not an engineer. He chaired the LRCG and was the superior to Messrs Palmer and Cropley. His witness statements were unhelpful and sometimes incorrect recitations of letters sent and received. He was defensive perhaps not surprisingly. He was inappropriately flippant on occasions e.g. Day 11/111-2, Day 12/53/16-18 when he said he was not joking about children not swimming in the Toxic Ponds but laughed as he said it. He said that he was reliant upon others. He accepted that it was a misjudgement on his part to rely upon Mr Cropley. He seemed to think that a desk study should be done after the site investigation; he did not know that a desk study is usually the first step in determining what investigation needs to be done on site and involves a detailed consideration of what is already known about a site. He was more concerned about financial matters than the need for proper investigation. His direct recollection was poor. He gave the strong impression that Corby’s main criterion was to provide land quickly to get businesses on to it (Day 12/ is 45). He said, surprisingly, that he would not have read the waste deposit licences (Day 12/64). He tended to speculate. He did not seem to know much about how to deal with contaminated sites. It was accepted by CBC’s Counsel that he was not an attractive witness in the witness box; his manner was not commended by Counsel. He was an unsatisfactory witness, in my view. I formed the clear view that, whatever his perceived merits as a planner, he was not qualified to head up the reclamation team. He seemed to have no idea until the time that Mr Cropley and Mr Palmer were being disciplined in late 1996 and 1997 that the two key men he had working under him on the engineering and technical aspects of the reclamation were not qualified, sufficiently or at all, to be involved in the reclamation. He seemed to have no real understanding of the need to protect the public.</p>

It is doubtful if he had much relevant experience of reclamation and contaminated site work before 1981, although he obviously learnt as he went along. He was bright and alert in giving evidence.

That, of course, was not Dr Smith's fault. His main involvement other than looking after site investigations was with the design of the containment tip facility (which accommodated some of the slurry from some of the Toxic Ponds) and his own firm investigated the Soothills reclamation site in 1996. He was engaged in monitoring the after effects (gas and water) of the containment tip facility. I have very much formed the view that his was an optimistic approach to reclamation and he tended to see the bright side; sub-consciously at least he tended to underestimate problems for instance at Willowbrook North and Soothills.</p>

He was effectively unqualified but had experience. His recollection of events was very hazy indeed. His detailed statement was clearly largely prepared by solicitors and contained errors such as placing him at meetings which he did not attend. Paras 205-6 are good examples of inaccuracies in his statement: he had not controlled the Deene Quarry since 1985. Similarly, he does not qualify what he is recorded as saying, such as Paragraph 217 of his statement and F36/5/44.  Much of his work, such as it was, was to provide the documentation for derelict land grant funding for the works. His involvement was not full time and he was working for other employers at the time. He seemed honest and had some broad recollection. Clearly from time to time, he became concerned if not exasperated with CBC; for instance, in his letter of 9 March 1993 he complained about a number of deficiencies in the working practices on the Toxic Ponds 5 &amp; 6 reclamation; he received no response to that letter. I did not find much of his witness statement helpful and, after cross examination, nor did he. He made it clear in evidence that, left to his own devices, he would have prepared a witness statement of some 10 pages and not the very long witness statement prepared for him by CBC’s solicitors. </p>

He gave some second hand evidence. He gave evidence to a large extent as a representative of the Environment Agency. His organisations’ remits were somewhat limited, primarily to do with licensing of Deene Quarry and seeing by inspection that, so far as obvious, the licenses were complied with. He had a limited personal involvement in the site. There was an element of “see no evil” about the WRA’s involvement; if the inspectors actually saw something which did not seem right, they would record it but they would not be pro-active in looking for non-compliance with the licences or the legislation. For instance they would not sample material going into the contaminated tip facility or elsewhere unless they had reason to believe that non compliant material was being deposited. There were clearly matters of which he knew nothing which if he had known about would have led to action against CBC.

He went to meetings such as on 14 April 1999 with CBC at which there was for instance an agreement to put out a press statement. Although his case identification was not challenged, it was very surprising that he did not focus on the possible cause and location of the alleged birth defects; if he was concerned to see what risk there was to the people of Corby, it would have been better if he had focussed on the possibility that the reclamation and/or landfill sites were a cause. </p>

He was part time as he had various other jobs elsewhere. His suggestion that he worked and walked over the entire site was not borne out by other witnesses. His statement (page 5) that no large scale tipping was carried on at Deene Quarry from outside the CBC site was contradicted by his police statement at page 6. His assertion that the Toxic Pond works were carried out “meticulously” is gainsaid by almost all the other evidence and in particular the contemporaneous evidence. He said in a statement to police in November 1997 that neither he nor Mr Ibbotson was responsible for the control of Deene Quarry; that remained with CBC.  Mr Bosence believed with some justification that he was not qualified to manage that tip. He also said that Mr Buckland had a nervous breakdown during the operation of Deene Quarry.</p>

There is nothing wrong in practice for solicitors to prepare witness statements in this way, particularly where a substantial period of time has gone by between the events to which the witnesses attest before the preparation of those statements. However, there were numerous examples, particularly in relation to Mr Ibbotson and Mr Webster, where they were unable directly to support what the witness statements had been drafted to say. That said, those witnesses had been prepared not only to sign those statements but also confirm on oath that the statements were true. There were several witness statements from witnesses who had either died or who were otherwise unable to attend. Save in so far as those statements were corroborated by contemporaneous and reliable documentation, I attach little weight to them.</p>

Apart from material moved off site, I assess that some 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 cubic metres of contaminated material was excavated and transported to parts of the old BSC site acquired by CBC, much of it by and across public roads and the large bulk of it in un-sheeted lorries.

In 1978, BSC’s Works Chemist and others carried out an apparently comprehensive survey of "Tanker Services for Effluent Disposal within the Corby Works”. This related primarily to a number of effluent and settling ponds into which toxic materials had been pumped or deposited. The Western Effluent Ponds became known as the Toxic Ponds, seven in number, and various other Ponds such as the North, South and Central Settling Ponds and the East Effluent Ponds are also described. BSC had a drainage system by which waste materials in water or slurry form were eventually taken off site. The Toxic Ponds were also filled with liquid and slurry wastes brought by road tankers from various parts of the BSC site. I will return to consider the detailed history relating to some of these Ponds later in this judgement. These Ponds were said to have a capacity of 20,000,000 gallons or some 91,000m³. The contents were described as having very high toxicity ranging from “acid with no oil to alkaline with much oil”. There were also what was described separately as the 5 Northern Settling Ponds and an Eastern Effluent Pond. From this and other evidence, it is clear that the area north of the northern arm of the Willow Brook, which later is referred to as Deene Quarry, was a dumping ground for industrial effluents and by-products of the iron, steel and coke making process, many of which were toxic.</p>

This related to some 800 acres. Mr Ibbotson did these studies in September 1980 pursuant to an appointment from CBC; the terms of reference are recorded in a letter dated the 23 September 1980 from the Council on behalf of itself and the Commission for New Towns:</p>

BSC employed at least two contractors, Ward and Bird, to carry out this demolition work in 1981 and 1982. This work was done pursuant to four main demolition contracts which apparently incorporated a draft specification (F61/1).

The letter clearly is intended to address funding and grants. It confirms that the Blast Furnace and BOS sites had been purchased for £495,000 and £190,000 respectively. It shows that substantial demolition and other works were about to commence at the Iron Making Plant, the Deene Coke Ovens. the By-products and Glebe Ovens areas with tender prices being set out. It also indicated substantial infrastructure works including what was then termed the Weldon-Earlstrees Link Road Phases 1 and 2.</p>

The expressed object of that investigation was "to establish the ground conditions on the site and the geotechnical properties of the soils in relation to the design of different types of foundations”. It was also asking that an indication be given as to "the existence of any hazardous or toxic chemicals". 28 boreholes were done which revealed, mostly "made ground [which] consisted largely of backfilled ironstone workings with ash, furnace slag, brick, metal and timber”. Flue dusts were also found. The report gave advice about the installation of sewers and roads design, together with the consideration of potential earthworks.</p>

Some accommodation was reached following a meeting between Mr Ibbotson and a BSC representative shortly thereafter and it appears that CBC was to provide a site access gate from Phoenix Parkway and to provide access roads to the Deene Quarry tips with CBC to re-grade them and provide additional slag on such roads wherever required.</p>

The material will be transported to the tip in on-site dump trucks utilising existing internal haul roads. Material on the tip will be spread into position by a D8 or D6 dozer.

By the time of the investigation, the superstructure has been demolished and the site comprised “a flat expanse with mounds of rubble, in situ concrete footings and floor slabs associated with the original furnace buildings”. 34 boreholes were done and a number of trial pits. These revealed a substantial quantity and depth of "made ground" as opposed to undisturbed natural material. There was ash, slag and various chemicals, including petrochemicals, within the made ground. This was not untypical of large parts of the site purchased by CBC. It is not surprising that this is the case given that iron and steel had been intensively produced at the site for 60 years or more. The primary purpose of this investigation, again not untypically, was to determine what type of foundations would be suitable for buildings, pavements and the like. The materials found were not tested for many of the types of material referred to in Mr Sharnock’s memorandum of 8 March 1982.</p>

He wanted to see if there were any potential phytoxicity implications. He was concerned that some of the results were well above the ICRCL “trigger values”. Analysis was done on the cadmium, nickel, chromium and toluene extractable material, amongst others. Notwithstanding the deposit of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of material on the Deene tip by CBC or its contractors, this was the first time any such sampling had been done. Little if any was done in the future. WS Atkins replied on 7 July 1989 indicating that the arsenic and lead content was at a potentially toxic level but it would not pose a real toxic hazard given the proposed end use. It was recommended that at least a further 10 samples were taken of surface materials, so as to equate to a 50 m grid spacing.</p>

Haiste’s report, updated in December, confirmed that the sludges excavated from Ponds 3 and 4 were "still exposed on the surface" in the eastern part of the Deene Quarry. The report concluded that the tip containment facility was technically viable and the cost for it was reasonable.

It was based on the conviction that unless the town set about helping itself, it was extremely unlikely that anyone else would. That meant an unconventional approach to local decision-making and need to cut through red tape, a willingness to push open doors in the corridors of power, to argue a case with those who control the purse strings, regardless of their political complexion and that it was a town with its back to the wall and the right to expect from its elected local representatives.</p>

Several unlabelled, empty drums were evident on the surface of the pond. Some of the samples had to be obtained from a boat using a sediment grab. Total plan area was found to be some 2707 m² and the water volume estimated at 2815 m³. The volume of sludge was calculated to be 5415 m³, albeit only on a best estimate basis. The waters were found to be highly contaminated by organic material as determined by the cyclohexane extract. Heavy metals concentrations did not indicate any significant contamination by those elements. PAHs were found as were other hydrocarbons.

He confirmed that the new waste tip had been designed and lined to the complete satisfaction of the NRA and WDA. The volume of the facility was at least 120,000 m³ and plans had been approved extending it in the future. Five monitoring boreholes and piezometers had been installed together with a pre-existing hole. He referred to the hazards from the sludges including coal tars as arising from ingestion, vapour release and soil contamination around the haul road (amongst others). He assumed that any problems of odour or dust arising from the earthworks at Corby Power or from the haul road were the responsibility of Balfour Beattie, the contractors employed by Corby Power. He said that, if the haul road was pinpointed as a source of problems, the contractors should be stopped from using it until the problem was solved. He referred to the fact that Mr Buckland was CBC's resident engineer at the facility. He said there was no requirement on CBC to analyse the materials or to provide a detailed report on the materials tipped about it was obliged to ensure that each load was checked visually for its suitability. Should any waste fall outside the permitted descriptions it should be returned.</p>

Site meeting No 1 took place on 4 November 1992 attended by Mr Palmer, Mr Bosence and Mr Bird for CBC. Mr Bosence was to be the resident engineer for the project until he was removed in about March 1993 and re-assigned elsewhere. On the same day CBC signed a contract with Weldon Plant Ltd for the execution of general earthworks at the site of the tip containment facility. This was to enable the expansion of that facility to take place. Those earthworks must have involved the moving of contaminated materials. Some concern was raised at the second site meeting as to whether the contaminated tip facility would be ready to receive sludge from Toxic Ponds 5 and 6 in time.</p>

The traditional method of extraction of the ironstone was to excavate the overburden using a walking dragline, the limestone first requiring blasting. The underlying ironstone was then dug out with a face shovel and the extracted overburden dumped directly into that part of the mine from which the ironstone has already been removed. The resulting ground surface is left as a hill and dale formation.</p>

A chemical analysis of the slurries carried out by the British Steel Corporation described it as a "non-toxic inert fine dust made up of ore/sinter, coke, lime/limestone particles and blast furnace volatilisation product such as zinc and lead". These slurries were contained along the eastern part of the site by a bund and allowed to find their own level over the backfilled opencast waste.</p>

Part of the site was later used for the Deene coke ovens and a slurry pond was constructed to hold waste from the blast furnaces. Slurry was discharged into the site until 1979. Following closure of the steelworks in 1980, the Deene coke ovens were demolished and some of the more contaminated surface clay fill has since been removed and replaced with clean fill.</p>

His observations were that the sludge material went into the lorries “50% water/50% sludge”, the sludge was excavated without proper prior full dewatering of the ponds, wet sludges were being spilt all over the haul road, wet sludges were being placed in the contaminated tip, there was no effective wheelwash and what there was was simply full of contaminated material and lorries were leaving the site and going on to the public roads contaminated with mud   He was aware that Mr Palmer was permitting clinical waste from a site in Northampton to be deposited at the Deene Quarry at the time. The wheel wash arrangement, such as it was, was a ditch dug in the ground with some sort of grillage on it which had water in it. As Mr Bosence said in evidence which I accept, it was not used in fact as the contractor thought that the water would damage the disc brakes of its lorries; it was by-passed. Mr Bosence raised this with Mr Palmer who simply ignored his concerns. </p>

With the exception of a small amount of cyanide the water is relatively unpolluted. The levels of phenols, ammonia, oil and toxic metals are all very low and pose no significant pollution risk. The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level at 8.3mg/l is below the limit normally set for industrial discharges to river (20mg/l approx) and is similar to that found in many "general amenity" surface water streams and water courses. The slightly high pH is probably the result of contamination of the wheel wash water by lime or slag materials while the high conductivity and chloride contents are almost certainly due to contamination by road salt used for de-icing the public roads. Semi-quantitative analysis of the solids recovered from the sample shows these to consist of a mixture of clay, sand and iron oxides with no significant levels of toxic metals present.”</p>

If the cap is placed on the tip without the necessary blending being undertaken, then the contents will remain as a liquid, which once again may give rise for concern in the future. If more money is required for this work then the necessary application should be made to the DOE to fund the blending operation as it is essential to deal with the problem now and not in the future when grant would not be available to the Borough Council…</p>

Smaller capacity cells will ensure that the filling operation becomes more manageable.

Such a report does not seem to have been provided for any other part of CBC's site. Its purpose seems to have been to demonstrate that a full and effective reclamation and de-contamination had taken place. It contains a material inaccuracy in that it says that it was "following the recommendations of Contest Melbourne Weeks" that the over site fill was removed. That fill had been removed before that firm’s reports were received. The report excludes references to contaminants found in that fill.</p>

He effectively put forward Mr Buckland as the "deemed person” and attached an outline of the "Management Structure". He identified himself as being at the top of that structure with Mr Cropley as the head of Engineering Services "directly responsible for all Engineering works, including use and restoration of tip facilities at Deene Quarry for five years". Under them was Mr Palmer, the "Principal Engineer" said to have been "responsible for restoration works at Deene Quarry, reporting to H. E. S. Has undertaken these work since 1980." Mr Ibbotson was, wrongly, described as having the qualification M.I.C.E (Member of the Institute of Civil Engineers); he was said to be a "Consulting Engineer responsible for design, construction and use of Contaminated Tip Facility at Deene Quarry. Employed by Corby Council on these works since 1982”. Under Mr Ibbotson, Mr Buckland appears as "responsible for day-to-day management of the facility including tipping.

Because Mr Cropley and Mr Palmer were implicated in this and in the earlier matters investigated, their union, Unison, raised their concerns with the Chief Executive of CBC. Mr Hagen’s activities, justified or not, gave rise to some political turmoil within the controlling Labour group at CBC with complaints being made about him.</p>

They reveal that the first time that the Shelton Road entrance was used was probably 16 August 1996. It is unclear when the contractually required wheel wash facility was installed and effective. He recorded on 6 August 1996 that it was not complete and usable. There is no entry as to when it was completed or used. Mr Bosence recalled that one was eventually installed at the Gretton Brook Road entrance and used but that must have been after 6 August 1996; he said that it did not have water in when he saw it. He also said that hand fixed sheeting was used for the lorries but I am satisfied that this did not happen for several months after commencement. He gave evidence that only an inadequate sweeper was used by the contractor on the road; it was a JCB with a brush on the front. There clearly was a serious dust problem at the Soothills site. Drivers and other workers were offered respirators but most declined them. Numerous complaints were made about the dust. Mr Bosence talked about “plumes of dust”, “you used to get covered in the stuff”, that “you were black at the end of the day” and that the dust was going over the adjacent Exeter Estate to the west of the Soothills site. The use of bowsers and sweepers were used as a “token effort to try and suppress the dust”, as Mr Bosence said in evidence. A significant part of the dust problem arose from the breaking up with mechanical plant of large amounts of fused contaminated material. Limited dust sampling was arranged in September 1996.</p>

Dust monitoring equipment was used to carry out sampling initially over five days, 19, 20, 23, 24 and 25 September 1996. Dust was certainly being generated on this site.

This is the process whereby large ingots are reheated, prior to rolling, in very large pits (the "soaking pits"), lined with refractories and heated by burning waste gas - probably blast furnace gas. Once the ingots had attained the required temperature, they would be lifted out by massive cranes onto the rolls. The soaking pits were associated with underground flues that carried the hot blast from gas burners, and there was also a substantial chimney to carry off the exhaust. The northern part of our site, outside the mill building, was occupied by rail sidings.</p>

Similarly, the removal and break-up of the mill machinery from inside the buildings resulted in the release of large amounts of oil, adding to the already widespread oil contamination that had resulted from some 45 years of continuous heavy engineering.”</p>

Experience from reclamation of the remainder of the mills indicated the likelihood of some asbestos contamination within this backfill. The council has reclaimed a huge area of the former steelworks over the last 15 years. Based upon the experience gained from that programme, and on the requirements of the various regulators, and of potential developers, it was agreed that the most appropriate strategy was - as recommended in the s.i. reports-to remove the contaminated oversite fill; then excavate the contaminated backfilled debris and sludges from the various pits; break out any voids etc; and remove the contaminated materials to the Council's own licensed landfill at Deene Quarry; then to backfill the site with clean imported fill to an appropriate geotechnical specification.”</p>

Worse still, that higher rate went unchallenged and has in fact been ticked. That tick apparently was made by the Head of Engineering and Construction Services, however MP acknowledged that he was in agreement. He explained that, in going through the draft final account  with the Head of Engineering Services he was not examining the validity of the rates used, but was really only verifying the nature of the item and the arithmetical correctness.</p>

There were also failures to observe English Partnership requirements. Pressure of work and the need for speed are doubtless relevant considerations. However, I cannot see how they can excuse such fundamental deficiencies as those identified in this case.

I am unable to draw a clear conclusion on this although having regard to the fact that the work to the 2 acres had already been paid for within contract B, the evidence suggests that the Director's view of matters is to be preferred.</span>

He described the haul road from the Shelton Road as having lots of dust everywhere, so much so that he would stay in his Landrover when visiting. As the wheel wash had been placed at the Gretton Brook Road entrance to Deene Quarry, and as the large bulk of the Soothills material had entered Deene Quarry by the Shelton Road entrance, it is clear that for the large amount of lorries carrying contaminated material from Soothills were not subject to effective wheelwashing and thus contaminated material from Soothills will have found itself deposited on to public roads.</p>

Its conclusions are contained in Paragraph 13:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(1) The proposals to provide an encapsulated site, together with stabilisation of the existing bank Willowbrook, have been effective in providing the intended area suitable for use as a car storage compound by Eurofleet Ltd. The adequacy of the contract documentation in defining the actual work to be carried out is however questionable and the lack of site records limit any assessment of the long-term suitability of the site.</p>
	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(2) The reasons and justification for inclusion of an additional 2 acre site within the Area B/C Encapsulation Contract remain unclear and it is recommended that CBC instigates further discussion with Eurofleet Ltd. In the absence of any information to the contrary it can only be assumed that Weldon Plant acted on the instructions of CBC to carry out work in this area.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(3) The ground investigations carried out at Area A between 1984 and 1992 were inadequate to assess the nature, spatial extent and depth of any ground and groundwater contamination prevalent at the site and thus provide the information necessary to address the question of whether remedial action was required, and if it was the design parameters necessary.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(4) The apparent absence of a comprehensive desk study, produced by either the Council’s Engineers or their advisers, and the inadequate specification of the ground investigation has been identified. This appears to have resulted in an inadequate knowledge of the site conditions and the extent of contamination within Area A time that tender documents were prepared. In these circumstances there is a significant possibility that the methods of decontamination carried out were inappropriate to provide a site fit for the proposed end-use at an economic cost.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(5) The Contract documents were generally inadequate to define the extent of work to be carried out and specify the quality of workmanship and materials used.</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(6) The limited availability of site instructions and total lack of variation orders is indicative of an almost total breakdown of adequate site supervision and management. The lack of site instructions and variations… to define the changes in the scope and extent of the work carried out, and the total absence of records to verify the contractor’s measurement documents, makes it almost impossible to carry out an adequate audit of the measured quantities claimed the payment in the final account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(7) There is no evidence of a Tender Evaluation Report for the tenders submitted for the three contracts. The extensive, and often inappropriate use of ‘included’ rates in the tender submitted by Weldon Plant should have been questioned and clarified prior to award of the contract.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(8) With regard to Area A it is clearly evident that the decontamination proposals were not based on adequate ground information and consideration of the long-term suitability of the site of the proposed end use. This has resulted in a considerable overspend (£120,000) without completion to the required standard. Furthermore, it is estimated that additional work, to the value of £175,000-£240,000 is required to complete the site required by Eurofleet for a proposed office development.

None of the engineering staff had professional experience in toxic waste disposal. The Council commissioned reports from specialist consultants to identify the nature of the contaminants at particular sites. The Council also employed a consultant engineer on a contract basis.

The Norwest Holst report dated 8 November 1982 was primarily related to determining the suitability of the sites for development.</p>

This was in effect the first part of the connection between the village of Weldon and the Earlstrees area and comprised eventually Steel Road and Phoenix Parkway. No site investigation was done by CBC. There can be no doubt that this will have involved excavation and removal of material from sites which must have been contaminated generally by BSC and its predecessors over the years. Phase 1 appears from a letter dated 28 February 1983 to CBC from the Departments of the Environment and Transport to have involved some £500,000-600,000. Phase 2 involved some £200,000 and this was the subject of a contract between CBC and Braithwaite Contracting Ltd on 23 March 1983. The same letter identifies demolition tenders in the Iron Making Plant, Deene Coke Ovens and Coke Ovens and By-product areas totalling some £1.45m. The letter indicated also that the material from the demolition would be taken to Deene Quarry with the haulage, haul road and tip maintenance estimated to cost some of £150,000. The tendered cost of the proposed Glebe Coke Ovens and By-products plant area was £1.159m, and most of which was demolition and earthworks.</p>

Boreholes revealed ground consisting largely of backfilled ironstone workings, furnace slag, brick, metal and timber. Sub- grades were said in the May 1983 report to be likely to comprise extensive areas of this material which would include flue dusts. Limited chemical tests were done and the primary purpose was to consider the suitability of the ground for foundations and the like. This report, which was the first commissioned by CBC, was produced after reclamation works had started at the Heavy End.</p>

This involved the demolition of the Mills buildings and structures. These works were started by 12 September 1985 when Mr Downey reported that the contractor was setting up the site office for “muck” shifting operations in the Deene Quarry area. Works were still proceeding on the BOS Plant Outfall Sewer Phase 2 works. On 18 September 1985, CBC entered into another contract with Shanks and McEwan for the "Reclamation Vehicle Crossing" works to take place at the southern end of Phoenix Parkway. In early October 1985 Mr Downey recorded Ward as "putting muckshifters onto heavy end and Poclain 300’s prior to muck shifting operations”. Earthmoving and other works continue to take place during October 1985 with the Phase 2 BOS sewer work proceeding throughout. Shanks and McEwan spent time also doing work at what was described as the "wet tipping area" in Deene Quarry. Mr Downey in his report for 15 November 1985 describes that contractor as "illegally tipping in Deene from BOS plant site, working wet tipping area" whilst on 19 November 1985 he records Ward as tipping in the eastern extremity of Deene Quarry.</p>

This also involved moving to elsewhere in Deene Quarry over 50,000 m³ of contaminated material. This proceeded through late 1985 until well into 1986 and involved a substantial earthmoving operation on the Deene Quarry site. No site investigation was done in this area.

In February 1994, contractors engaged by CBC were working on a sewer contract at the Heavy Rolling Mills site; these were reported as complete by the end of July. In about March 1994, the Sunday market project on the old Sinter Plant area started and was finished in about July 1994.

This is the process whereby large ingots are reheated, prior to rolling, in very large pits (the "soaking pits"), lined with refractories and heated by burning waste gas - probably blast furnace gas. Once the ingots had attained the required temperature, they would be lifted out by massive cranes onto the rolls. The soaking pits were associated with underground flues that carried the hot blast from gas burners, and there was also a substantial chimney to carry off the exhaust The northern part of our site, outside the mill building, was occupied by rail sidings.</p>

The council has reclaimed a huge area of the former steelworks over the last 15 years. Based upon the experience gained from that programme, and on the requirements of the various regulators, and of potential developers, it was agreed that the most appropriate strategy was - as recommended in the s.i. reports - to remove the contaminated oversite fill; then excavate the contaminated backfilled debris and sludges from the various pits; break out any voids etc; and remove the contaminated materials to the Council's own licensed landfill at Deene Quarry; then to backfill the site with clean imported fill to an appropriate geotechnical specification.”</p>

They generally contain a low grade waste from the Rolling Mills and have not been used since 1979. The waste was treated in the Patterson Candy plant which removed the majority of mill scale and suspended solids, with the remaining waste waters going to the Candy Ponds and the cleaned water going back to the plant as cooling water. Oils from leaks or spills were collected in the ponds and were later removed. On the north pond there remains a layer of oil confined to a small area (depending on wind direction). On the south pond, however, a thick (estimated at 80-l00mm) layer of oil emulsion has collected, forming a light brown 'mousse' on the water surface (see photographs).The carcasses of several unidentified birds can be found in the oil. There is also an odour of hydrocarbons from the ponds.”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">Oil in small amounts is lethal to birds as it destroys the water repellent and insulant properties of feathers and causes birds to freeze or drown. This undoubtedly was the cause of death for those birds found in the oil. The oily layer will also hamper or smother plant growth or cause injury to animal life. However, the oil is probably of such an age that its innate toxicity is low. BSC have carried out analyses for waters under the oily layers, and these are shown in Appendix 1. These suggest that the water quality is poor, but not toxic. Parameters measured are within the water authority consent conditions and so difficult or expensive disposal or treatment is not necessary for these waters. However, these tests may require further verification before water discharge is permitted particularly if fly tipping is likely to have occurred.</p>

Since the ponds are on private land, the public cannot be considered to be at risk if access is difficult and suitable notices are displayed. On the basis that Corby District Council wish to utilise the ponds for spoil disposal, the initial questions that must be addressed are a) can the oil be left in position (having removed the underlying water) b) can it be disposed of in another 'hole' on the Council's land, or c) must it be taken off site for disposal at a suitable landfill for example. Leaving aside the question of cost, it should be reasonably practical to remove the underlying water and thus allow the oil to lay on the base of the pond.</p>

However, it is most likely that because of factors such as construction quality, ground settlement and physical interference with the barrier layer, this option might at best be described as a 'time bomb'. It is fair to say, however, that a suitably robust and durable solution could be designed but, obviously, at considerable cost. Moreover, improvements to the basic solution would most likely reduce the net volume available for tipping, thus partly defeating one of the objects of the exercise.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">This option is similar in principle to Option A but has the following principal differences: i) the oil would have to be 'cleaned' off the existing site and transported to the proposed disposal location. This has obvious cost penalties and could only be carried out by an experienced operator ii) the oil is not likely to be contained underneath or laterally and so the implications of water ingress are different. The oil, which would have to be encapsulated in a manner similar to Option A, could escape laterally through the movement of groundwater and/or merely by moving along the 'surface' of the groundwater. Indeed the groundwater level would determine the depth at which the oil should be buried. In essence this option cannot be considered at all desirable notwithstanding that it would almost certainly be in contravention of the Control of Pollution Act. Therefore, we recommend that no further consideration be given this option.</p>

The nearest void available would be in former BSC workings, and involve road transport to move the material. Apart from increasing the cost of the operation, estimated at approximately £1,400,000, there is also a danger of haulage traffic passing through the town. The slurry material is not the most suitable material to be transported by road lorries and undoubtedly the conditions imposed by BSC on any tipping area would be similar to those for Deene Quarry.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“The stabilisation of a particularly difficult waste has recently been demonstrated by GFS using one of their solidification processes for sewage sludges modified so as to contain acid tars. These arise, for example, from the distillation of crude benzole where sulphur compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons are removed by a concentrated sulphuric acid wash. In this assessment, 25 kg samples of an oil refinery acid tar waste were mixed with 50 kg of dried, powdery red mud whose high cation exchange capacity and metal oxide content react so as to stabilise the polluting components of the waste. Subsequently, 75 kg of fly ash from a coal-burning power station and 90 kg of a special hydraulic binder were incorporated in addition to 15 kg of hydrated lime and 375 kg of centrifuged sewage sludge (70-80% water). The process yielded a reddish-brown material of a clay-type consistency which lost its aromatic' odour over a few days and showed a crumbly soil like structure upon lengthy exposure to air…</p>

The principal physical factor that emerged was the scale of water volumes involved, while the principal chemical factor was in respect of the degree to which these water bodies were contaminated. By far the greatest single issue encountered was the 'Valley of Drums' and its surrounds. The scale of the problem is very great and will require considerable additional resources before the full extent of the problem is defined and an appropriate solution designed. Ironically, the problem is unrelated to the visually bad situation of thousands of drums floating upon the pond surface.”</p>

Although it might be argued that, with a carefully selected backfill material, the sludge would not rise greatly (e.g. 150mm of sludge could rise to about 1 metre with a material with 17% voids) any oils for example could be raised subsequently by groundwater contained by the pond. This situation could have undesirable effects although some provision could be made to prevent it happening, e.g. by introducing low permeability layers in the backfill. Overall, for the quantities that might be left in place, the savings would be very small, if any. Thus, total removal is the most sensible option.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">The valley to the east of the Drum Pond has been filled with miscellaneous wastes, including sludges, asbestos, oils, scrap metal, building materials, and some degradable materials. To the west, the gulley has been filled mainly with soda slags, refractory spoil and flue dusts. These wastes generally appear to be highly permeable. The 'waste' to the south of the gulley consists of the overburden from the mined area. This latter material appears from preliminary borehole work adjacent the pond, to be of low permeability. The area immediately to the north of the gulley is virgin ground and, if the general pattern of geological features applies, the ironstone is overlain by Lower Estuarine Series, Lincolnshire Limestone and Boulder Clay.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">During mining, water was pumped from the ironstone aquifer at the eastern end of the quarry. After cessation of pumping the water in the gulley has returned to a level slightly higher than the original pre-pumping level.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">The sources of water in the gulley are likely to be the underlying ironstone (confined) aquifer, the adjacent limestone (local) aquifer, and surface water. The existing water along the gulley is, based on data acquired to date, extensively contaminated, e.g. it is highly alkaline, and high in sodium and in sulphate in particular. The AWA have already detected the high sodium and sulphate concentrations in waters external to the site.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">I t is our view that the existing water level in the pond is a manifestation of the ground water along the full length of the gulley that was left after completion of BSC's ironstone mining. That mining operation, according to BSC, extended to a depth generally corresponding to half way into the Ironstone aquifer. This aquifer was fissured by blasting operations and this greatly facilitated surface water control.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">We consider that the effects of backfilling the pond will primarily result in a lateral displacement along the gulley, at a rate corresponding to the permeability of the ground mass. This permeability is considered to be very much higher than that of the adjacent or underlying ground. Therefore, the water level along the valley is likely to rise generally corresponding to the water displacement in the pond. As the hydrostatic head rises there will, by definition, be a greater net downward movement of contaminated water into the aquifer.</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">If this hydrostatic head is built up in a relatively short time scale, then the volume of contaminated plume entering the aquifer might be undesirably high. At worst, an 'extra' 50,000cu.m. of contaminated water will have entered the aquifer, possibly at a<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>greatly accelerated rate due to the increased hydrostatic head. By carefully controlling the rate and location of backfilling, the water table in the valley could be allowed to rise in the region of 3 metres without creating any long-term engineering problems, i.e. the ultimate finished ground level could be some 4m higher than the pond water level.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">Currently, the amount of contaminated water entering the aquifer could be a simple function of the net water volume entering the gulley, mainly through surface water ingress. If this is so, the net surface water volume, based on 85% of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>635-765mm rainfall per annum, is 0.85 x 0.7m x catchment area. This area is likely to be at least 1600m (i.e. length of gulley) X 50m (width of gulley at top). Thus, some 0.85 x 0.7 x 1600 x 50 = 47,600 cu.m., may be entering the underlying aquifer annually. Thus, at worst, the displacement of the pond water in one year could double the contamination loading during that period.”</p>

The result was that the water was inevitably displaced by the material which was being deposited in the water and it spilt over the sides. On 12 March 1986 BSC wrote complaining:</p>

The sludges vary considerably in chemical composition but the major common factor is their coal tar and general oil content, apart from one pond (TWPl) which has a very high ammoniacal content. The aggregate volume of sludges has been estimated at around 15,000m³ and four different strategies have been examined for their effective disposal, (Also included in the review was a provisional estimate of 1,000 m³ of cyanide rich and organic<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>wastes near<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the Toxic Waste and Oil Ponds.). The four options to be considered seriously have been a) off- site landfill, b) a chemical fixation process (GFS), c) a lime stabilisation process (OCR) and d) on-site landfill using a combination of the above techniques. Biological treatment and incineration were also considered initially. A further factor included in the assessment has been the need to improve the effectiveness of the ground cover to the disposed Glebe wastes, i.e., the area south east of the Candy Filter Ponds.”</p>

Geotechnics Ltd, instructed by WS Atkins produced a geotechnical report in July 1987 on the Toxic Ponds (called by them “Chemical Waste Slurry Lagoons”). </p>

The requisite pumps were in place by about January 1988 and had started working by late January. Pumping was started before all the joints to the associated pipework had been caulked and there were established complaints of water escaping.</p>

Certainly, the sludges could not be described as dry or inert materials and it is probable therefore that this dumping of the substantial quantities of the sludges from Toxic Ponds 3 and 4 was a clear breach by CBC of the Waste licence. As Haiste &amp; Partners later reported in November 1989, although the sludges had been transported by then, CBC had not capped them and they remained exposed; they said in their report (see below) about the work on Toxic Ponds 3 and 4:</p>

That material was then left uncapped and open to the elements for well over year or more. CBC had the idea of using a contaminated tip facility on Deene Quarry and this was driven by cost primarily. The cost of removing the worst wastes to another site would have been enormous. </p>

The scope of the works was described as “the removal of sludges from the ponds and disposal to a tipping facility within the site, approximate length of one way haul is 1.9 km”.

However, depending on these data, particularly the available fractions of zinc and boron, it is possible that reclamation could be limited to the application of a suitable depth of topsoil ie. additional cover or barrier layers may not be required. Benson mentioned the possibility of windblow of contaminated dust onto neighbouring farmland. The application of topsoil and grassing of the site should reduce any windblow of contaminants to an insignificant level. It is possible that use of the site for motorcross during dry weather could cause release of relatively small quantities of contaminated dusts but I would not expect these to pose any real hazard either to site users or neighbouring properties.”</p>

Mud on Gretton Brook Road was again reported. Although on 6 June 1995, the County Council reported the facility as full, it also recorded that Willowbrook material was still being brought in. The tipping continued nonetheless. Although at least Mr Palmer was aware of this concern, it is not minuted as being discussed or raised at the next LRCG meeting on 22 June 1995.</p>

Fly tipping continued largely unabated throughout much of 1996 and 1997 and there seems often to have been unauthorised access through the Gretton Brook Road entrance. There are a number of complaints by the NCC inspector about loads, such as tarmac and wet loads, being deposited at Deene Quarry, which were unacceptable. An example is on 13 June 1996 when an unacceptable wet load with tyres was deposited. Work had started on Soothills and material was by then being transferred to Deene Quarry. This history suggests that such controls as CBC had were inadequate and that CBC was and was kept aware of these inadequacies. </p>

My understanding was that the Deene Quarry site work was to be overseen by a Consultant Engineer who would arrange to tidy up the existing toxic pond site, dispose of the special waste materials into a waste cell, cap and close and maintain the tip.</p>

I also understand that the site although in control of the CBC Agent Consulting Engineer was open and uncontrolled for a considerable period during which time it is alleged unspecified unauthorised tipping may have taken place. I was concerned to see that a proposal was made to the DODS [Director of Development Services] by the Consulting Engineer for more (special) waste to be placed on the Deene Quarry tip site as late as February 1997…</p>

The quantity is unclear but I infer that it was not insignificant as its relocation continued over some four months. The relocated material was capped.

The Soothills and Sootbanks doubtless colloquially described what had broadly been deposited at the site in question. Materials were deposited by BSC and its predecessors over many years on low land alongside Willow Brook South in the relatively early years of operation of Corby Iron &amp; Steelworks. The materials predominantly comprised waste slags and flue dusts. The proportion of coarse flue dust, locally known as blast furnace “soot”, gave rise to the name of Soot Banks (or Soot Hills). Over the years the heaps were weathered and vegetated naturally with moss, grass and birch scrub. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An investigation was carried out by Norwest Hoist Soil Engineering Limited, in 1986 and 1987, to try to establish the nature of the wastes and also to investigate an area of old quarry land to the south. The reclamation strategy at that time had been to excavate a large void in the boulder clay to the south, bury the wastes and cap them, then transport the boulder clay arisings to Willowbrook South, and form the base for an extension of St James' Industrial Estate. Although the in-situ boulder clay proved very suitable for creation of a containment repository, the strategy was not put into action. Parts of the Soot Banks, which contained particularly high proportions of 'soot', were then excavated by a local contractor who removed the screened fines for various uses including colourant for cement and bricks. These excavations and screening operations continued until early 1996 when the reclamation potential was again recognized as part of the redevelopment of the increasingly rundown industrial estate. The strategy developed by CBC's Special Projects Team (as opposed to independent consultants) entailed removal of the Soothills to a dedicated repository at Deene Quarry. The cell was to be created from old ironstone quarry backfill (consisting of sandy clay), and the wastes would be capped by an impermeable layer. Any material considered unsuitable for this treatment, eg. as a result of particularly elevated metal content, would need to be taken to another nearby commercial tip. Correspondence with the WRA (now the Environment Agency), formalized into the revised Waste Management Licence for Deene Quarry, indicated that any material with heavy metal values similar to, or in excess of, those recorded in a 'hot spot' at pit 5 (in 1986) would not be permitted to go to Deene Quarry. Much of this was set out in Dr Smith’s report of June 1996, entitled of Pre-Contract Investigation of Soot Banks Remnants.</p>

There was no specification or quality control either of the construction of the access road or “the removal of the soot”. Later documents indicate that access roads were constructed with slag which would have spread contaminants around. At some stage between this time and early 1996, the toxic material from the area of Trial Pit 5 was removed by the organisation which was permitted to do so by CBC without any warning being given to them either not to do so or to take any relevant precautions.

He reported on his findings in his June 1996 report. He noticed that the site had obviously changed topographically in the light of the workings by the soot contractor. He reported low Cadmium (up to 2 mg/kg), low Nickel (said to be up to 750 mg/kg) and low Chromium (said to be up to 1500mg/kg). The two latter maximums are well over the ICRCL trigger values and are possibly transposition errors for the chemical results tables in the Appendix to the report; if so, it does not give great reassurance as to the care with which this report was put together.</p>

The site was acquired by CBC from BSC in about December 1983, subject to terms that BSC could remove for sale piles of slag present. Perhaps given its location, it attracted interest fairly shortly thereafter. In April 1984, CBC engaged Soils Engineering Ltd to carry out a ground investigation to establish the ground conditions and geotechnical properties of the soils in relation to the design of suitable foundations for a proposed factory building 95 m wide and 220 m long. The total site was larger than that, comprising some 22.5 acres, as referred to in BSC’s letter to CBC of 2 March 1983.</p>

It referred to the fact that this site had been used by BSC and its predecessors “as a tip for slag and other iron works waste including flue dust from the primary catchers of the blast furnaces”. Much of the slag was said to have been “transported by rail and tipped onto quarry backfill whilst still molten” but that “much of this slag has since been re-processed by crushing and large quantities have been removed from site for use elsewhere”. Norwest Holst recommended vibro-compaction or dynamic consolidation of the site if it was to be developed. Some 19 chemical samples were taken (Cadmium up to 3.5mg/kg but no tests for Nickel or Chromium and two toluene extract tests). As to the limited chemical test results obtained, they reported that “metals were elevated, but still within ADAS recommended limits for agricultural soils and would certainly, therefore, present no problems from landscaping, or dust ingestion”. They referred to their “reconnaissance analyses, covering the whole range of materials observed on site, [as having detected] no significant chemical contamination”.</p>

Additional tests were carried out on selected samples in order to assess the organic content of the material so that a decision could be made as to the need for more specific organic analyses. These tests showed organic contents ranging from 0.24% to 1.42%, suggesting that the conclusions reached by British Steel with regard to heavy metal contamination would also apply to organic pollutants. Nevertheless, there are likely to be specific areas where high concentrations of pollutants are present which would require special treatment when encountered.”</p>

In simple terms the 'slurry' material is not particularly offensive and the principal precautions would be in respect of personal hygiene and avoiding the inhalation of any dusts arising from operations. However, there can be no guarantee that other wastes were not deposited amid the slurry and which could be of a more sinister nature. Accordingly, alertness to such a possibility should be foremost in any removal operation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">There is, however, a further critical factor to be examined and that relates to the material overlying the 'slurry' and which would have to be removed first. This material has not yet been the subject of any effective chemical investigation and taking the nature of the most recent use of part of the area (viz. the Deene coke oven and by-products) it is very probable that high levels of contamination are present. These are most likely to have resulted from the plant demolition rather than from the process operations themselves. It is essential, therefore, before any further consideration is given to the safety, vis a vis the slurry removal, that an appropriate chemical investigation is carried out to determine the nature of the oversite material both from the safety and the disposal points of view.”</p>

A very limited amount of chemical testing was carried out during those investigations and on only a few samples. Resulting from those investigations a decision was made by the Council to remove the extensive slurry deposits (see Fig. 2) and replace with a suitable engineering material. The slurry removal contract, which is due to commence, in early 1985, is very relevant to this investigation and the recommendations arising therefrom. Since the slurry deposits are overlain with apparently suitable engineering materials, there would be considerable cost benefits if these could be deposited in the slurry excavation and so reduce the need for imported material. Moreover, the slurry excavation could also act as a 'dump' for material elsewhere on the site which was not greatly contaminated and had suitable engineering properties.</p>

A later log indicates that the ground conditions necessitated additional cut and fill operations. At Site Meeting No 7 sewer work was still progressing and large areas of “black slurry” were noted on one sewer line. Almost all the LRCG meetings were, surprisingly, told that Contract 40 was progressing “well” albeit after this report in the LRCG meeting of 29 June 1989, it was said that, although a great deal of slurry in drainage trenches had had to be dealt with, the scheme should now be completed in early August; the additional excavation and backfilling would<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>result in considerable additional cost<span style="font-size:11pt">.</span></p>

In the absence of any contractual or final accounting documentation, it is difficult to assess the quantities of contaminated material which was removed and transported on the public roads; it must have been a very substantial amount in six figures. The contract price had been over £1m; a balancing lake would necessarily have involved at least 60,000 to 70,000m³, judging by the balancing lake at Longhills; there was a substantial amount of sewer excavation required and some additional excavation work. Clearly there were substantial quantities of recognisable slurry involved.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">a) The motor cycle/go cart racing track has disturbed the surface capping quite significantly in places, digging up mounds of slurry. When these dry they will generate a lot of dust. As far as we know the slurry comprises fine grained coke, iron ore and limestone - but also has high levels of some other metals, particularly lead and zinc. We've not averaged all the data, but guess around 0.2% lead and 0.3% zinc. There is also ca. 0.05% coal tars and a few ppm cyanide. It is not acutely toxic. Given the use of the track, though, conditions could get very dusty and drivers and spectators may get high exposures. We are not occupational hygienists and you would need someone experienced to calculate out the "risk" - which I expect is low and cumulative in effect. It is, however, clearly not a good idea to allow them to plough up more slurry.</p>

Wet contamination will be removed completely but further reclamation will go down to a depth of 2.5m. To summarise the site will be capped with a minimum of 2.5m of clean, cohesive material."

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(i) from a very early stage, there was a growing realisation that the bulk of the Willowbrook North site was heavily contaminated with the slurry lagoon and the areas in and around the Deene Coke Oven and By-Products Plant being overall the worst; by the late 1980s, there was a growing understanding that the cost of fully remediating the site would be prohibitively expensive.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(ii) over the years from 1994 to 1996, a substantial quantity of contaminated material was removed for the Willowbrook North site and transported unsheeted on the public roads to Deene Quarry where it was initially deposited at the eastern and north eastern end and only in 1995 was it placed generally in the contaminate tip facility as extended.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(iii) There was little if any control of the Willowbrook North site from 1983 until 1998; it was largely unfenced; the public had uncontrolled access and CBC even permitted go-carting and scrambling for some years on the site. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(iv) Substantial quantities of dust are likely to have been generated throughout the period of operations and by the other activities on the site; substantial quantities of mud and dust are likely to have been generated from the transport of the materials on the public roads. There was no wheelwashing facility for most of the period. Even if there was some wheelwashing facility at some stage in 1995, it was ineffective or was not used. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(a) From 1983 onwards, CBC’s approach was to “dig and dump”; put another way, CBC decided in practice that all the waste and more or less contaminated materials from the sites it acquired (from BSC), occupied, reclaimed or used would be disposed of on the self same sites. Almost invariably, this material was taken to Deene Quarry at the north eastern part of the site. As Mr Braithwaite said in his second report and I accept:</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in">“1.22 One key aspect of the case is that it seems that it was seen by those responsible as, a relatively simple, 'engineering', operation involving unknown quantities of often unknown materials, rather than the highly complex reclamation and remediation process it should have been. In my view it was decided relatively early on that the area of the steel works was contaminated land, and to the north of that was a large dumping ground. If all the contamination could be relocated to the dumping ground, then the site of the steel works could then be redeveloped to re-vitalise Corby. It really was that simple.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(b) Between 1,500,000m³ and 2,000,000m³ of more or less contaminated material was so disposed between 1983 and 1997.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(d) Very large quantities of more or less contaminated material were carried to CBC’s knowledge on public roads, in particular, Gretton, Gretton Brook, Weldon, Bransgrove, Steel and Geddington Roads and Phoenix Parkway.</p>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(f) Very substantial quantities of dust were created by the reclamation and associated operations from 1984 to 1997. That dust came from operations and materials actually on the site as well as from materials dropped or blown onto the road by or from lorries. So far as this and the previous finding are concerned, I attach weight to the evidence of the parents of the Claimants whose evidence that there were substantial amounts of mud on roads and dust in the air was eminently credible and was not seriously challenged by CBC’s Counsel.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(g) It is more than possible that some of the mud on the road and dust in the air was from time to time from sources other than the old BSC sites being reclaimed by CBC; for instance, there was a substantial amount of other development going in Corby over the period, some of this at least being on green field sites. However, I am satisfied that the bulk of the mud and dust on the road was from the CBC former BSC sites and operations. There has been no evidence before the Court that there were any other sources of relevant contaminated materials. </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(h) There were no effective wheel washing facilities for vehicles leaving the sites owned and being reclaimed by CBC at any time; CBC was aware of that.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(i) The many thousands of lorries which left the CBC sites with contaminated materials on them were not sheeted until the final reclamation job at Soothills and then only after August 1996; the sheeting was then manual and not particularly effective.</p>
	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(j) CBC at no material time employed as employees any person at senior or middle management levels who had any relevant experience or training in running or managing or supervising reclamation operations involving contaminated sites.</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">(k) CBC’s retention of Mr Ibbotson in the role for which he was retained was not inappropriate as far as it went, that is to provide the services set out in the original retainer agreement; however, he was not retained to advise about risk assessment and he was not qualified as a specialist in dealing with seriously contaminated sites; he was in effect an administrator with some experience of administering reclamations. His and CBC’s approach was to treat the reclamation operations purely as civil engineering operations.</p>

He became increasingly left out of the reclamation overall and visited the site infrequently. It would have been sensible for CBC to have retained Dr Smith or more specialist reclamation engineers on a much more extensive basis than they did, in particular in relation to the design and supervision of the actual reclamation works.</p>

It is enough that it was reasonably foreseeable that harm or damage might be caused to embryos or foetuses being carried out by mothers at the material time. It was argued by CBC initially that it had to be established that it was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that its wrongful act would be likely to cause injury of the types sustained by the Claimant concerned. However, it was accepted in argument, properly, that the formulation referred to above was sufficient.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is generally the case, in negligence, that, provided that the defendant in question has selected independent contractors with reasonable care and skill, that defendant will not be liable for the negligence of those independent contractors save to the extent that it had been negligent itself in supervising and monitoring the work of those contractors. The exception to that, as has been accepted properly by CBC, is that if an employer has engaged or contracted others to carry out work, which by its very nature, involved in the eyes of the law special danger to another, the employer will be liable for the negligence of its contractor. Support for that proposition is contained in Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence 11th edition at Paragraph 2-388. The issue of delegation does not arise in this case for two reasons. The first is that the negligence as found in this judgement primarily lies in CBC’s own negligence and breach of statutory duty. Secondly, the excavation, transporting and depositing of seriously contaminated wastes was essentially and specially dangerous to workers and the public at large.</p>

The issue as to whether or not there was a cause of action open to the Claimants in this case was specifically addressed by the Court of Appeal in this litigation, the case citation reference being [2008] EWCA Civ 463 (also been reported at [2009] 2 WLR 609). CBC had applied to strike out the Claimants’ case for damages for personal injuries for public nuisance on the basis that such claims were not available in public nuisance. The Court of Appeal decided that it was barred by previous decisions of the courts in which damages claims for personal injuries in public nuisance had been accepted. Necessarily, CBC accepts that that this court is bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal but reserves its position to argue, ultimately, in the House of Lords to the contrary.</p>

The purpose of the law which makes it a crime and a tort to do an unlawful act which endangers the life, safety or health of the public is surely to protect the public against the consequences of acts or omissions which do endanger their lives, safety or health. One obvious consequence of such an act or omission is personal injury. The purpose of this law is not to protect the property interests of the public.

In a sense it matters not given the findings of fact which are made in this judgment. The essence of a case in public nuisance in the context of this case is, as set out on Dyson LJ’s judgement, that a person commits a public nuisance if by his unlawful act he endangers the life, health or safety of the public. The pleaded case relates to the escape of toxic material and the spread of such materials onto public highways thereby endangering the health of the public. Strictly speaking, negligence or breach of a statutory duty is not essential in public nuisance although, if there is negligence or a breach of statutory duty which causes life or health to be endangered, there will be a public nuisance.</p>

That sub-section however is related to the criminal offence and is comparable with the Health and Safety legislation which reverses the burden of proof for some offences in that way. I do not consider that one can transfer the shifting of the statutory burden in criminal cases to the civil proceedings envisaged by the Act: the Act would and should have so legislated if that had been the intention. It is comprehensible that for the civil proceedings a balance of probabilities standard is to be achieved by the claimant. Section 73(6) provides some additional defences to a defendant in the civil proceedings but it does not reverse the burden of proof.</p>

It would not be unfair to describe this pleading as somewhat prolix and to some extent at least involving a "scattergun" approach. Reference was made to some 75 contracts in connection with which it was said that causative breaches of duty had occurred. At Paragraph 83 they pleaded that "contaminated vapours and/or small particles escaped from the land reclamation sites”; at Paragraph 84, it was pleaded that there was a cluster of upper limb reduction defects to children born in Corby between 1989 and 1999; at Paragraphs 86 to 97, reference was made to PAHs, Heavy Metals, Sodium Sulphate, Cyanide, Phenols, Dioxins and Furans as being the material contaminants. There is reference in Paragraphs 100 to 103 to various medical papers, ICRCL guidance notes and consultation papers, statutes and DoE and HSE circulars of which it is said CBC should have been aware. Paragraphs 104 to 106 pleaded, in summary, failures on the part of CDC including failure to provide full and proper environmental assessments, detailed development control and full and proper analysis as well as complaints about inadequate supervision and leaving contracts unfinished with the result that contaminated waste was left exposed and open to the atmosphere for lengthy periods of time. At Paragraphs 108 to 115 there were extensive individual allegations of negligence, many of which are no longer pursued.</p>

They accept, as does the Court, that the Kettering statistics for 1989-1998 are reliable as far as they go but they do not and can not address the position in relation to the years 1985-8 which affects two of the Claimants. It is pointless to speculate what the position would be if information for those years was also available.</p>

Because of the consistency in these findings, Professor Parker considered that causes other than chance should be given precedence when interpreting these differences. Mr. Hurley however thought that the cluster relates to the small number of cases in 1996, or possibly in 1994-96, which led to concerns and media stories about upper limb defects in children in and around Corby; such events were to be expected, from time to time and from place to place, so that the upper limb birth defects in Corby in 1996 could easily be due to chance; evidence from other years provided no strong support for the idea of a sustained excess of upper limb defects among children born to mothers resident in Corby.

His argument, and I use the word advisedly, was that 1996 was the year to which the first wave of publicity about birth defects in Corby applied. This argument was wholly illogical in my view. Once it is established that the statistics for births in Corby exhibiting the requisite birth defects are robust and true, there can be no arguable basis for excluding two of the children born with the requisite defects. To do that would skew the statistics and render any conclusion false.</p>

EUROCAT collects statistics from a number of regional centres in Europe and provides a web-based assessment tool to determine the statistical significance of apparent clusters of birth defects. It is generally regarded as robust and reliable. Based on a comparison with the EUROCAT statistics, one would have expected 2.2 birth defects in Corby over the period 1989-1998 as opposed to the six cases recorded in the O&amp;M study. EUROCAT statistics would suggest 1.5 birth defects in Corby for 1994-1998 compared with the five actually recorded. The same statistics however do not show a statistically significant difference in the period 1989-1993. I find that by reference to the EUROCAT statistics for the same period as the O&amp;M study the Corby rates for birth defects are unusually high.</p>

The period in question in the trial is not covered by the EMSYCAR statistics save for 1998-9. The EMSYCAR statistics do not provide information about local patterns in the rate of upper limb defects. They were not constructed in the same way as that done by O&amp;M. Furthermore, there is an unexplained trend in the EMSYCAR figures for the later years which shows significant increases in upper limb defects which, although not inaccurate as such, tends to skew the figures to suggest a higher rate of birth defects per 10,000 births. Without some explanation (which was not forthcoming) as to why this had occurred, any comparisons based on the EMSYCAR figures would be unreliable.</p>

Other helpful definitions of “toxicologist” include: "one who studies the nature and effects of poisons and their treatment"(Princeton) and "a scientist trained to examine the nature of the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms and assess the probability of their occurrence".

She accepted in evidence (Day 23) that she was not a toxicologist at all. Her expert evidence was largely based on a review (albeit an intelligent one) of the literature relating to teratogenic effects. Her views were dictated to a large extent by risk assessments provided by regulatory bodies. She had not considered the issue of limb reduction defects before this case.

He was immeasurably better qualified as a toxicologist; his experience as a pathologist gave him a most useful insight of the effects of toxic substances on the human body. Dr Searle was not and did not profess to be a toxicologist. I strongly felt that her approach was almost entirely dictated by her examination of published papers; she did not and could not effectively approach the opinions, research and regulatory approach set out in those papers from a toxicological viewpoint and background. She attached too much importance to the regulatory approach of DEFRA as set out in a set of papers which addressed “Contaminants in Soil”. She felt that the regulatory papers provided a point from which to start because, if one did not have regard to them, the chemical industry would be entirely unregulated. That provides a justification for organisations such as DEFRA to recommend maximum or tolerable allowances but in logic they provide no, and are not intended to, provide support for or proof of the level of contaminants which might or would cause birth defects general or limb reductions in particular in embryos or foetuses.</p>

It is important to note that the limbs are forming during the 4th to 8th weeks of development and that the upper limb develops in advance of the lower limb. The four main phases in limb development are (1) initiation of limb buds; (2) outgrowth of limb buds during which time the limb plan is established; (3) tissue formation and limb shaping; (4) growth of the miniature limb to adult size. The principles that underlie vertebrate limb development have been derived from studies of mouse and chick embryos and these seem to have been conserved. Although there is only a little direct evidence that the same mechanisms operate in human limb development (Fallon &amp; Crosby, 1977), it seems reasonable to assume that conclusions drawn from animal studies will be relevant to humans.” (Congenital Limb Reduction Defects; Brown, Lumley, Tickle and Keene 1996 HMSO)</p>

In addition, different adverse effects have different thresholds, and there may be a concern that exposures at a level less than those that induce structural malformation might cause covert functional abnormalities. Finally, there are pronounced inter-individual differences in teratogenic response, in which genetic and environmental factors both play a part. Therefore, estimating human risk from animal data requires extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information which is available for only a tiny fraction of chemicals. Without that information, effective exposure levels in animals are uninformative. Thus, the interpretation of CLRD induction in animals is that the chemical should be considered potentially hazardous to humans, but the probability that it could cause CLRD following real-life exposure is unknown<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt">.” (</span>Congenital Limb Reduction Defects-page 2)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Flaks, correctly in my judgement, identified PAHs, dioxins and heavy metals as the likely teratogens. The former were present at the BSC site largely as a consequence of the coke making processes used on the site over many years whilst the latter were the by products of the iron and steel making process. Also, dioxins and furans (PCCDs and PCDDs) were produced in the electric arc furnace process as well as in the sintering process. Dioxins and furans accumulate in the body and are only very slowly eliminated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as dioxins are concerned, Dr Flaks commented, based on papers and research, that it should have been obvious that the BSC site would be contaminated with dioxins when it closed, it being inevitable that dioxins would have been produced during the steel works operation (in particular the sintering plant); dioxins were and are known to be extremely stable in the soil. Decommissioning should have taken this into account so that any patches of heavily contaminated soil could have been identified and disposed of by incineration. The toxic characteristics of dioxins had been widely published since the 1970s and the technology for analysis and disposal was readily available in the early 1980s when remediation work at Corby was proposed. The toxic characteristics of dioxins include damage to human health (and potential damage to the embryo). I accept this evidence; it is logical and backed up by numerous papers and research.</p>

At this stage, the embryo is able to repair itself by multiplication of its undifferentiated cells. The embryonic period, from 18 to 54-60 days after conception, is the period when the organs are developing and is the period of maximum sensitivity to teratogenesis, since tissue damage becomes irreparable. The foetal phase, from the end of the embryonic stage to birth is the period when growth and maturation of previously formed organs takes place, and exposure to teratogens is likely to affect foetal growth, or the size or function of a specific organ, rather than to cause gross structural defects. Human teratogenicity is indicated by a recognizable pattern of anomalies, a statistically higher prevalence of a particular anomaly in patients exposed to an agent (which is an epidemiological facet), the presence of the agent during the stage of development of the affected organ, a lower incidence of the defect in the population prior to the introduction of the agent, and production of birth defects in experimental animals by the agent.</p>

The critical period of organogenesis in humans is 20-55 days (or 35-70 days after the last menstrual period). The nature and incidence of effects are dependent on the particular developmental stage when exposure occurs. During embryonic differentiation or organogenesis, the embryo is highly susceptible to teratogenic insult. Following differentiation, the foetus becomes progressively less susceptible to teratogenic stimuli, although increasing the dosage may or extend the period of susceptibility.</p>

A report (Ngo) concluded that parental exposure to Agent Orange appeared to be associated with an increased risk of birth defects.

He had seen no analyses which had been carried out, prior to disturbance of the site, to assess the degree of contamination with PAHs or by dioxins, which would have persisted on the site. From a human health standpoint he had no doubt that, in the light of knowledge that existed at the time, it would have been prudent to carry out such investigations. The implications of dioxin exposure for human health (cancer and immunodeficiency, as well as potential teratogenesis) were well known at the time of remediation of the area and should have been taken into consideration. The technology for the sampling and analysis of dioxin-contaminated sites, as well as the safe disposal of contaminated waste, was readily available in the early 1980s when the remediation work was planned.

Dr Searl’s evidence on this was broadly to the effect that, since animal experiments involved relatively substantial doses to cause birth defects, very high doses or exposures to large quantities of the relevant contaminants would be required in humans and human foetuses. Dr Flaks rejected that on the basis that one can not correlate the level of dosage to one species with another. What the animal experiments show, he said, is the true potential of certain substances to induce birth defects which is likely to be true in relation to the human species. I accept what he said in this regard. It is not necessary for there to be high levels of exposure to these substances adversely to affect an unborn child.</p>

Fifthly, the great majority of the investigations were concerned with the post reclamation usage, namely for industrial or commercial buildings; thus, CBC was interested to know what types of foundations, roads, sewers and drainage would be required and at what cost.

Mr Sharnock’s memorandum circulated on 8 March 1982 specifically referred to teratogenic (amongst) other compounds, Cadmium, Chrome, Nickel, mineral oils and hydrocarbons. Put another way, he was warning CBC to beware of these compounds and let him know what was found. Coal tar and PAHS were well known at least as carcinogenic at that time and likely to be present on sites similar to or comparable with the BSC site (see ICRCL 18/79 Redevelopment of Contaminated Land: Gas Works Sites (3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Draft) and Problems arising from the Redevelopment of Gas Works and Similar Sites-Wilson and Stephens-Harwell 1981).</p>

For instance in ICRCL 16/78 issued in October 1979 which addresses "Redevelopment of Contaminated Land: Acceptable Levels of Contaminants in Soils (Consultation Paper), dust was one of the concerns raised about the possible adverse effects on public health and in particular reference to the inhalation of cadmium compounds in dust. Promotional data sent to local authorities in 1981 or shortly before by Harwell’s Hazardous Materials Service refers to "the toxic potential of heavy metals and industrial chemicals used in some manufacturing processes”, to the release of such materials causing a serious hazard and where “conventional demolition methods would have exposed downwind populations to considerable risks”. There are numerous references to the exposure of workers to the inhalation or ingestion of contaminated dust; an example is the paper of November 1981 "Problems arising from the Redevelopment of Gas Works and Similar Sites” by Wilson and Stevens.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is therefore clear that any competent local authority operating at the latest from 1985 onwards should have been aware of the potential harm to members of the public from dust generated at a site such as the site at Corby and should have taken active steps to ensure that dust was not generated either on site or by or during the transport of materials from the site. As a matter of common sense, this necessarily needed to be applied even more rigorously where, as here, it was contaminated material which could give rise to dust. It has been suggested that the competent local authority would not necessarily know that dust generated on a site such as this would reach members of the public as opposed to workers. That however is a false point for a number of reasons. First, it was known in the 1980s that dust could be spread by the operation of wind. Secondly, it must have been known that, if uncovered lorries carry dusty materials, the operation of moving them will cause the dissemination of dust; if those lorries carry such materials on public roads, the public would be directly exposed to the dusts. Certainly, by 1991, sheeting of lorries carrying contaminated or otherwise dusty materials was commonplace. In the Health and Safety Executive Guidance Note HS(G) 66 "Protection of Workers and the General Public during the Development of Contaminated Land", there is express reference to the need to sheet lorries in service to prevent either the deposition of those materials or the dispersal of dust whilst those lorries are on the move. Mr Braithwaite said, and I accept, that the requirement for sheeting of lorries had been in place in practice for a number of years before then. </p>

Without that information, a competent local authority would be proceeding to a large extent in the dark. In the ICRCL paper 3/78 “Redevelopment of Contaminated Land: General Notes” (revised October 1979), it was stated that local authorities should as a matter of "accepted practice" even before purchase "make an assessment of the site…to identify the nature and extent of any contamination and the likely impact on the development plans for the site." It was stated that "the first step should be the acquisition of as much information as possible about the history of the site…followed by a survey involving boreholes, trial pits and the collection of soil samples for analysis.” In the 1981 Wilson Stevens paper referred to above, there is reference to it being a prerequisite to any development on contaminated land that "an adequate chemical site investigation” is carried out. That talks about sampling on a grid of about 25 metres and sampling in any areas of known contamination.</p>

The reason is that such investigations are invariably based on boreholes or trial pits or trenches (apart from visual observations); those will reveal whatever they do reveal but will not as such reveal all the prevailing conditions between the geographical location of the boreholes pits or trenches. Whilst competent engineers who carry out these investigations may well be able as a matter of judgement to extrapolate in relation to the conditions between the locations of their boreholes pits or trenches, there can be no certainty. </p>

If, after a thorough investigation, the samples from the site show values below the lower trigger concentrations, it is reasonable to regard the site as uncontaminated and proceed with the development accordingly. If, however, the results exceeded the upper trigger concentrations, it follows that some remedial action is required if the chosen form of development is to proceed. Alternatively, a different use should be considered. Trigger concentrations do not apply the site is already in use, and they may have to be modified where development has already begun before contamination was discovered.” </p>

The paper goes on to consider what may be considered to be acceptable values for allotments, domestic gardens, amenity and recreational areas, public open spaces and industrial and commercial buildings. The paper is not concerned in itself with the methods by which contaminated materials are to be exposed, excavated and removed. It does give some guidance on the type of site investigation that should be done. Apart from site investigations for ground engineering and geotechnical purposes being "common practice" (Paragraph 26), it makes it clear that where site history and inspections show that there is likely to be contamination present (as here), a "detailed chemical investigation is also needed". Paragraph 27 identifies that "the number of sampling points needs to be sufficient both to identify the presence of contaminants and to determine their distribution with sufficient certainty for the intended use.”</p>

The SGVs are "trigger" values above which there may be concern for human health for populations living or working for long periods on land containing residues of chemical contamination. Three land uses are considered, referred to above. However, none of these land uses would result in the scale of unearthing and disturbance of the contaminants that would have been associated with the land reclamation activities in the Corby steelworks area. These land uses would, at most, only lead to human exposure through direct contact with the surface layer of the soil, or by uptake of contaminants into food grown on that soil. By contrast, the land reclamation would have involved deep excavation, transport, dispersion and large-scale tipping operations, which by their nature would lead to far greater emissions of materials. Current advice from the Environment Agency states that SGVs should not be used if they are not representative of the site being assessed, and not for short-term or acute exposures. In my judgment, the SGVs are not directly applicable to the type of environmental pathway that is under consideration here.</p>

Although the first site investigation carried out, by Norwest Holst (report November 1982), related to the Glebe and Deene Coke Ovens area which had been cleared, its purpose was not to determine the extent and location of contaminants but to determine whether the site could be developed for industrial building. Its purpose was not carry out a detailed chemical investigation. Norwest Holst themselves unequivocally made it clear that the sites of the Coke Oven Plants were "heavily contaminated". Notwithstanding this, the Glebe area was cleared and the heavily contaminated materials removed to Deene Quarry. Little was done on the Deene Coke Oven area which was on Willowbrook North.</p>

There was to be a requirement for investigating the chemical contamination of the ground. WS Atkins were asked to give recommendations for chemical investigation of those areas. This is the first time that CBC had consciously to apply its minds to this albeit that substantial excavation and transporting of contaminated materials was well under way already.

WS Atkins were critical of the trial pits exercise and stated that there was a very poor recording of samples taken. They were concerned that the trial pits omitted from the central area of the site should be assumed to be potentially contaminated to a similar degree of those around. The primary concentration in the report however was the geotechnical evaluation so far as design of structures and sewers was concerned. The clear recommendation, so far as chemical contamination was concerned, was that the main problem would be dust and fumes and therefore adequate dust control measures "must be taken". Although the highest level of Cadmium was 2.03 kg/mg, it was strongly recommended dust control measures were taken to prevent excessive dust arising. The same was repeated in relation to Nickel.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">CBC’s performance in relation to the reclamation of the Toxic and Candy Filter Ponds and the Valley of the Drums was very poor. No effective wheel washes were provided and substantial amounts of contaminated mud were tracked out onto the public roads by lorries and other vehicles from the Deene Quarry site in circumstances where CBC expressly knew that the internal haul roads had been seriously contaminated by major spillages from open topped lorries carrying very substantial quantities of contaminated material. The filling of the Valley of the Drums was unsupervised in consequence of which amongst other things a large amount of contaminated material was spread by the overfilled Valley overflowing. The material used to fill the Valley of the Drum was itself contaminated. In relation to Toxic Ponds, much of the highly contaminated material was double handled, for instance by placing it first in the Candy Filter Ponds. Ignoring the advice of WS Atkins, and without the advice of any independent consultants, CBC engaged contractors to remove the sludges from Toxic 3 and 4 and deposit them at the eastern end of the Quarry. The work was done in breach of CBC’s waste licence; the sludges appear to have been mixed with other contaminated material, the work was inadequately supervised by CBC and, contrary to its own approach, the deposited sludges were not covered or capped at the very least for several years. </p>

The reclamation of Toxic Ponds 5 and 6 was effected by CBC in house personnel who were not qualified or experienced enough to deal with such reclamation. The work was poorly supervised and controlled and contaminated sludges were deposited on haul roads and tracked out onto the public roads. Again the sludge was mixed with contaminated material to make it easier to handle. Even so, the material deposited in the contaminated tip was wet and was therefore itself in breach of the waste licence.</p>

As to these points, as was and should have been known to CBC, no effective wheelwashing was provided; no effective road sweeping or clearing was provided; no effective damping down of dust was provided; there was no sheeting of lorries until mid-1996 and even then it was ineffective; to begin with material was hauled on internal roads but by 1985, the lorries were crossing what was then public roads and increasingly from 1985 at least  the bulk of the material was being transported on public roads for the bulk of its transportation; until the tip containment facility was capped initially, there was little or no capping of wastes which were simply deposited and spread on to Deene Quarry.</p>

Ms Heasman prepared an appendix to her reports (ultimately as Appendix A to her Second Supplementary Report of March 2009) which set out what the various site investigations carried out over the years showed. This shows the maximum and minimum findings of the contaminants which are relevant to this case, albeit that the number of the investigations did not produce chemical testing of some of those contaminants. The Appendix also shows the number of samples which were tested for any given contaminants. A number of the site investigations to which he refers were prepared for clients other than CBC. Some of the investigations were done on areas which had already been partly reclaimed and had presumably had a quantity of the contaminants already removed.</p>

Save possibly for two of those investigations, such chemical testing as was carried out was based on inadequate sampling. On numerous occasions (for instance Willowbrook North and Soothills), worse material was encountered than might conceivably have been gleaned from the earlier site investigation reports. The history of contamination of this site suggests very strongly that it was widely and seriously contaminated overall.

The boreholes reveal made ground to substantial depths; this includes ash and cinder type materials. The report appears to record the slurry lagoons which were present at depth but which were obviously not chemically sampled. Ms Heasman lists 42 samples said to have been done for Cadmium and apparently low readings.

Chromium and Nickel were not tested for. Ash and slag among other fill materials were recorded in the trial pits and trenches. Cadmium up to 23 mg/kg was recorded and Toluene extract at 1.04%. This is interesting because it demonstrates that when a thorough investigation was done high levels of contamination were located, which given the history of the site is not surprising.</p>

Nickel and Chromium were not tested for but a maximum Cadmium reading of 5mg/kg was recorded. The reason however that this is a Validation Report is that it relates to a period after there has been substantial removal of contaminated material. Accordingly it does not give any representative picture as to what was present before. No proper investigation was done of the Rolling Mills area before the excavation and removal part of the reclamation was done although part of the area (the Electric Furnace Plant) had been investigated in the early part of May 1987 (see above), when relatively high Cadmium had been found.</p>

That was based on 38 samples. Toluene extract was recorded at a maximum of 0.184%. By this stage it had already been decided that over 150,000 m³ of material was to be removed from the site and, indeed, a contract had been let to that effect. 16 trial pits were dug and 38 samples taken. Given the size of the site (over 60 acres) and given the fact that it was likely that there had been random dumping of materials historically by BSC, it was always unlikely that the trial pits exercise was going to be representative. Indeed Dr Smith in the report recognised that further trial pitting would be necessary as the heaps were reduced in height. The later investigation by his firm identified two new trial pits in which seriously contaminated material not picked up on the earlier investigation were found. One of the problems encountered however was that substantial quantities of material were in a seriously solidified state so that they would have to be broken up (as proved to be the case) by heavy machinery. Dr Smith recognised that there had been effectively been random excavations by the contractors permitted by CBC onto the site to remove soot and slags. Although he formed the view that the site could be regarded as relatively uniform based on the site investigation which he had done, later events proved that to be wrong. However the intention was that the material was sufficiently contaminated as to be required to be placed in a contained cell on Deene Quarry.</p>

Broadly the results show low Cadmium and, where tested, low Chromium and Nickel. There has been no and certainly no reliable evidence as to how carefully this sampling exercise was done. It was certainly not done with any view to protect the public from dust because by the time that the results of samples were known the material had already been deposited at Deene Quarry. It was in some ways a pointless exercise in any event for this reason. No instructions were given as to how the samples were to be taken from the backs of lorries or whether the samples should be taken in a way which might be representative. Only some 125 samples were taken over a period of 6 to 7 months and indeed none were taken after February 1997, although the operation continued some months thereafter (some of the documents about this are not in the Court papers albeit referred to by Ms Heasman). As it is known that 200,000 m³ of material was moved from Soothills to Deene Quarry, assuming lorries with a capacity of 10 or 20 m³ were used, there would have been 10,000 or 20,000 lorry loads of which 1 in 60 were supposed to be sampled. On either basis, insufficient lorries were sampled to be representative let alone to comply with the Environment Agency’s requirements of 1 in 60 lorry loads being sampled. I therefore consider that the lorry load sampling exercise does not assist in determining what levels of contaminants were being disturbed.</p>

The history of the operations of BSC and its pre-nationalisation predecessors points very strongly to a largely unregulated, extensive and indiscriminate operation of waste disposal on the site. The Deene Quarry area is the prime example: numerous waste ponds whose highly contaminated sludge and slurry contents were spread from time to time over the rest of that site along with wastes from other operations elsewhere. Other slurry and tar lagoons were placed by them in the Willowbrook North area. There was indiscriminate dumping on the Soothills area. The sites of the remainder had the accumulated wastes of over 50 years, or more, of iron and steelmaking on around and under them.</p>

At least one witness from CBC, Mr Webster, indicated that it was unnecessary to carry out extensive site or chemical investigations because CBC knew what was there, which must have been extensive contamination. In these circumstances, one is drawn to the inference that the relevant CBC officers believed that, because BSC had operated in the same way on its own land, it, CBC, could shift large quantities of contaminated material and deposit it on Deene Quarry. However, differences between what BSC had done and what CBC did are that BSC had never moved such large quantities of contaminated material in as short a space of time as CBC did and there is no evidence that BSC ever shifted as much material on open lorries on public roads.</p>

This was, she ultimately explained, based on her experience and a Local Authority screening paper. She tended to underestimate the impacts of dust and contaminants. I considered that she was trying too hard to reduce the figures to a level from which one would conclude that insufficient quantities of contaminants would have got through to the mothers of the claimants.

In my judgement, there was a virtually constant generation of contaminated mud and dust from and including 1985 onwards to at least June 1997. There was almost constant work over this period by CBC and its contractors, but, even when there were slacker periods, dust would still have been released from the CBC sites or some of them, particularly Deene Quarry. Substantial quantities of contaminated material were carried on and on to the public roads mostly with unsheeted lorries. The main roads on which they were carried were Gretton Road, Gretton Brook Road, Phoenix Parkway, Steel Road, Shelton Road, Geddington Road and Weldon Road. It is clear and I find that the sweeping of the roads was inadequate and often not done to all. Once deposited on the roads, the mud and dust would inevitably be spread even further around the roads and the town by other vehicles passing over it. There is every reason to conclude in addition that dust was generated in drying and drier weather off the sites during demolition, excavation, transporting, depositing and grading and levelling operations involving the substantial quantities of contaminated materials. In similar conditions, where slurries had been exposed to the air (as on Willowbrook North A) or spread and deposited on the surface (as when Toxic Ponds 3and 4 were deposited in the north-east corner of Deene Quarry) there would be contaminated dust generated from those sites. It would be facile to believe or expect as a matter of fact that at any one material time during this overall period there was only one precise point source of contaminated dust being generated.</p>

Thus, by way of example, a substantial amount of dust was generated on the Soothills site in any event but particularly as the result of the necessary breaking up of over 13,000 m³ of solidified waste by heavy breaking machinery used by the contractors. I accept the evidence put forward by those witnesses who visited the Exeter estate just to the west of the Soothills site and described substantial quantities of dust during that period.</p>

He said, correctly in my view, also that by the time that the land reclamation works were undertaken, awareness of the potential environmental impacts of a large operation of the kind embarked upon by CBC was commonplace and that appropriate studies would have shown what safeguards were necessary to control potential exposures of the local population to the harmful substances that were present on the site.

The extent to which mothers were exposed to airborne dust, they agreed, would have depended on the extent of dust release from the works, the weather and maternal behaviour during the relevant stage of pregnancy.</p>

Whether the dust released during the steelworks redevelopment gave rise to a relevant maternal exposure would have depended on the nature of the material being handled, the handling process, the effectiveness of dust suppression measures, the weather and whether the mother’s location and activities gave rise to an abnormally high intake of dust. Dr Searl said that this related to "soil-derived dust”. It is clear however that not all the dusts were soil derived; an example is the Soothills material which seemed to have no natural soil being pure wastes; the same can be said about substantial quantity of the Willowbrook North and Toxic Ponds material.</p>

His view was that this diverse airborne route would probably have involved time lags and therefore directional variation as the weather and wind direction would change from day to day; the dispersion of the pollutants would have been widespread and complex so much so that any attempt at precise mathematical modelling would be likely to fail or to mislead. </p>

Her starting point in this analysis seems to be to identify what works were going on during the first few weeks of each relevant pregnancy, to apply the highest level of the relevant contaminants recorded in any relevant site, ground or chemical investigation, to take into account material wind and weather over each relevant period, to bear in mind where the relevant mother was either living or visiting during the period in question and then to apply different maximum exposure allowances depending on the location of the particular sites being worked on by CBC in comparison with where the relevant mother was likely to be. She has assumed a single point source; that is at any one time that the contaminants were travelling from one geographical point. She makes additional allowances for visits to Corby and visiting the Sunday markets of those involved in car washing or handling dusty clothing. She then makes a detailed assessment of each mother what is the estimated extreme worst case daily intake of the relevant contaminants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst Dr Cox did not challenge the framework of the analysis adopted by Dr Searl, his view was that it was wholly inappropriate in this case. I wholly agree with Dr Cox in this regard. Dr Searl's assumption that the level of contaminants from any given source was effectively the worst identified in the various site, ground or chemical investigation reports for that source is simply wrong, given the findings which I have made. Secondly, her assumption of a single point source for the contaminants at any particular time is wrong also. There can be no doubt that the contaminants were being circulated around the eastern side of Corby and beyond and at times a number of different operations were taking place at different locations. Thus, as Dr Cox says, a single point source approach does not reflect the much more complex and diverse routing to the local population which was likely to have been present throughout the period 1985 to 1997; there is also the added complication of the reactivation of the material which has earlier been deposited. Thirdly, her assumptions about a single point source (sometimes also called a source term) assumed relatively the same level of dispersal, whereas, as Dr Cox says, depending on the activities at the place or places where the dust is being generated one is likely to have peaks which may well lead to high concentrations of dispersal. Good examples on the facts of that would be where explosives were used to break up foundations and other underground obstructions in contaminated ground and  the breaking up by heavy machinery of large quantities of contaminated material at Soothills. An aspect of her calculations involved the use of 24 hour averages whereas in practice, given that there would be less activity on and around the CBC sites at night, it might well have been much more appropriate to relate the exposure over a shorter daily period, such as 12 to 14 hours.</p>

That is why the main Group Litigation Order issue on causation is formulated in terms as to whether any relevant breach of duty "had the ability to cause upper and/or lower limb defects of the type complained of”. It appears, notwithstanding this, that Dr Searl's assessment on individual mothers was at least in some respects flawed. For instance she did not factor in the fact that Lisa Atkinson was an active security guard during her pregnancy at various sites immediately around the CBC sites. Dr Searl proceeded on the basis that her first two months of pregnancy occurred at the time that no works were in progress, whereas the work on Toxic Ponds 3 and 4 were taking place at that time. She assumes that Mrs Mallin was simply not exposed at all to contaminants as she was not resident in Corby although there was clear unchallenged evidence that she was regularly visiting Corby. She wrongly assumed that Mrs McGrath lived 1 to 3 km away from the CBC site when in fact she lived less than that. She ignored the fact that Mrs Taylor, the mother of George, worked in a public house which was frequented by workers from the CBC sites. I give these by way of examples. In my view the factual assumptions that she has made in this analysis with regard to the individual mothers are often flawed and sufficiently so as to undermine the reliability of her approach.</p>

As Mr Penman says, each teratogen has a threshold dose (which even may be zero or very close to zero), below which there is no risk of teratogenesis; that is supported by a paper by Brent in 2004. He says, obviously correctly, that the risk of birth defects being caused by a teratogen will depend upon a large number of factors including the dose, duration of exposure, gestation at time of exposure, mode of ingestion and the peculiar or specific susceptibility of the mother and embryo to it at the relevant time. He also says (and I accept) that the combination of two or more substances may increase the teratogenic risk by either lowering the threshold dose or even increasing the severity of the damage; he relies upon a paper by Nava-Ocampo in March 2007.</p>

Mr Penman considered however that one could expect unilateral birth defects and he pointed to the fact that a number of thalidomide victims had unilateral defects; it was his view that the blood supply to the right and left upper limb is not identical due to the arching of the aorta as it rises up from the heart and he points to the studies on live born and stillborn infants in a paper by Harmon in 1995 and a paper by Makhoul in 2003. I prefer the view of Mr Penman in broad terms in this context: the fact that the number of the Claimants have unilateral, as opposed to bilateral, defects does not significantly or at all militate against teratogens being feasible causes of most of the types of birth defects with which this case is concerned.</p>

Dr Emmerson slightly back tracked on that concession by saying that, unless literature demonstrated that such defects had been caused in humans by Cadmium, he could not accept it. Mr Penman referred to what are known as “Koch’s Postulates” after the German physician who in the 19th century isolated the micro organisms responsible for causing anthrax, TB and cholera. His postulates laid down that to establish that an organism is the cause of the disease it must be (a) found in all cases of the disease examined, (b) prepared and maintained in pure culture, (c) capable of producing the original infection, even after several generations in culture, and (d) retrievable from an inoculated animal and cultured again. Since teratogenesis is wholly different from the sort of diseases and conditions which Koch was considering, these postulates have been modified to assist in the definition and identification of teratogenic agents so that (a) the agent must be present during the critical periods of embryonic or foetal development, (b) the agent should produce congenital defects in an experimental animal; the defect rate should be statistically higher in the treated group rather than in the control animals receiving the same vehicle or sham procedure and (c) proof should be obtained that the agent in an unaltered state acts on the embryo or foetus either directly or indirectly through the placenta; in this area, biochemistry and in vitro culture are most often used instead of bacteriology.</p>

I am wholly satisfied that Mr Penman's evidence on this is to be preferred; since animal experimentation has discovered that the introduction of Cadmium into laboratory animals can cause limb defects, there is no good reason why its introduction into humans at the foetal or embryonic stage can not cause similar defects in humans. The first two conditions are also met in relation to Chromium VI which was present on the CBC sites; animal experimentation has shown that micromelia and club foot can be caused by that compound.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Emmerson was less convincing on the issue as to whether there could be a peak in the blood of mothers of Cadmium which would or could have an effect on the foetus; his thesis was that there would be a background of Cadmium retained over the years in the mother’s body and, although there would be a slight relative rise in the Cadmium as a result of the inhalation from the potentially harmful source, that would not be likely to be causative of the birth defects. Mr Penman disagreed. In logic, if there is a relatively large inhalation of Cadmium, there is no dispute that a significant part can transpose into the recipient’s blood; it stands to reason that, until the Cadmium begins to be retained in the kidney and liver, it will circulate in the blood in significantly greater quantities than the background Cadmium which was always there; if circulating in the blood, it can get through to the foetus or impact upon the supply of nutrients to the foetus. It must have, or have the potential for producing, a greater effect for the period in which the level of the Cadmium was higher as a result of the inhalation. Mr Penman’s views are more logical particularly when coupled with Dr Cox’s views, which I have accepted, that there can be peak rises in the availability of the contaminants which would have the tendency to introduce enhanced levels of the teratogenic substances into the blood streams of the pregnant mothers. I see no reason to differentiate in this context  between the different types of contaminant with which this case is primarily concerned. There is a background level of contaminants in the systems of the mothers with which the body copes and which the body retains but not necessarily in the bloodstream (they could be retained in the liver or kidney, for instance); in time, they may be discharged from the body albeit that may take some considerable period of time. If however there are rises and in particular peak rises, in the air or otherwise, of these contaminants in the first three months of pregnancy, it is this which will primarily have the potential to cause birth defects in the given mother.</p>

I do not consider that the epidemiological evidence supports the view that a long build up of contaminants in the mothers over some years before the particular pregnancy is material.

There is no reason to think, other than the lack of literature, that birth defects could not be caused in human embryos or foetuses by the introduction of such substances during the early stages of pregnancy. There is of course no certainty that animal experiments will replicate exactly the human experience; for instance, thalidomide was tested on animals before it was made generally available but it was established later that it was on the wrong type of animals (wrong in the sense that the young of the particular type of animals experimented upon did not exhibit birth defects), albeit that when retested on different animals comparable birth defects were demonstrated. Although there is no certainty that animal experiments, which do or do not demonstrate that particular types of birth defect may happen following the introduction of given substances in the early stages of pregnancy, will be replicated in the human condition, it stands to reason and is supported by the evidence of Mr Penman which I accept that the introduction of any of these substances either on their own or together with other substances could realistically cause birth defects of the types complained of.</p>

The second exception is the reported condition of the last born Claimant with two fingers on one hand swollen and exceptionally large; this seems very different from the others identified and the mechanism, whatever it was, which produced this very unfortunate condition, was in all probability something wholly different from the introduction of the relevant teratogens in this case; put another way, I am not satisfied that this condition could realistically have been caused by the teratogens with which this case is ultimately concerned.</p>

Toxicologically there were present on and from the CBC sites over the whole period from 1985 (and possibly before) until 1997 the types of contaminants which could cause the birth defects complained of by the Claimants. There was an extended period between 1983 and August 1997 in which CBC was extensively negligent in its control and management of the sites which they acquired from BSC and otherwise used. That negligence and, as from 1 April 1992, breach of statutory duty on the part of CBC permitted and led to the extensive dispersal of contaminated mud and dust over public areas of Corby and into and over private homes with the result that the contaminants could realistically have caused the types of birth defects of which complaint has been made by the Claimants (save in limited respects). It can not however be demonstrated that after August 1997 the birth defects in children conceived thereafter could be caused by any breaches of duty or public nuisance occurring before that time; there can have been no significant emissions of the relevant contaminants after that time which could have caused birth defects of the types with which this case is concerned. CBC is liable in public nuisance, negligence and breach of statutory duty, obviously subject to it being established in later proceedings by individual Claimants that their particular conditions were actually caused by the defaults identified in this judgement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is very much a combination of findings which have led me to these overall findings. The epidemiological evidence showed that there was an unexplained cluster of birth defects to the children of mothers living in Corby during much of the relevant period. The toxicological evidence demonstrated that there were from the reclamation sites being worked on by CBC contaminants which could realistically cause the birth defects in question. The foetal medicine evidence showed that it was feasible for those contaminants to cause most of the birth defects in question. The actual facts supported by the waste management evidence proved that there had been continuing breaches of the duty of care owed to the Claimants, public nuisance and breaches of statutory duty on the part of CBC covering the whole period; those defaults had led to the extensive dispersal over the period from 1985 (and indeed before) until 1997 of such contaminated materials.</p>

I do not consider that there was a “systemic” breakdown as such within CBC: what happened was that it bit off more than it could chew and did not really appreciate the enormity, ramifications and difficulty of what it was setting out to achieve in terms of removing and depositing very substantial quantities of contaminated material.</p>

They have were invited to submit a list of any typing or other obvious factual errors in the draft and indeed whether there are any crucial findings of fact which in this very long and detailed judgement are thought to have been omitted. Both sides submitted lists of typing errors and, in particular CBC suggested a number of further findings which could be made; I have addressed those suggestions as appropriate. I will also on handing down the judgement consider the extent to which the draft answers to the  Issues are sufficient for the purposes of any further hearings which may be necessary between the parties.</p>

The Corby reclamation was, however, in some senses at least, a “one-off” reclamation involving a very large contaminated steel work site which was very close to a town centre. Whilst there will remain “brown-field” sites in the UK which are contaminated, there will be very few which are so large or so extensively contaminated as the Corby site. </p>
