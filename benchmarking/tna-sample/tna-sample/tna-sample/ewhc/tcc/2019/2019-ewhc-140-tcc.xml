      <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">(“ZBG”), which issued building warranties known as “Standard 10 Year New Home Structural Defects Insurance Policies” to cover structural and other major defects in the development, the claimants seek their assessment of the cost of remedying these defects, pleaded at £10.9M plus VAT, together with awards to cover the cost of alternative accommodation whilst the remedial works are undertaken.  As against the second defendant, Zurich Building Control Services Ltd (“ZBC”), which inspected and certified approval of the development under the Building Regulations (“Bldg Regs”), they seek damages representing the diminution of their respective interests in the development.   </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.3 Although ZIP and ZBC are separate limited companies that separation was solely for regulatory compliance reasons and did not reflect any substantive separation between the two businesses.  The building warranty and building control teams worked closely together in one department under the </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">ZBG name, the employees of both businesses were employed by ZIP and the administrative and other support functions were also provided by ZIP.  Throughout this judgment I refer to them collectively as ZBG save where necessary or appropriate to refer to them under their separate legal identities.    </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.4 In July 2018 ZIP amended its defence so as to plead that pursuant to a transfer scheme sanctioned by order of the High Court of the Republic of Ireland dated 16 March 2018 it has transferred its business to the third defendant, East West Insurance Company Limited (“EWIC”).  It contends that as a result of the transfer any of the claims made in this action, whether brought under the building warranties or otherwise, fall to be dealt with by EWIC.  The claimants accept that EWIC is the appropriate defendant for the claim under the building warranties, although there remains a question as to whether or not the claim brought by Zagora under what is referred to as “the agreement to rectify” is also subject to the transfer.  Sensibly, the parties have agreed that any outstanding issue in that respect can be determined once I have given judgment on the substantive claims. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.5 There are 27 claimants making claims against ZIP.  Of these 26<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
	  <p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:-0.59in"> In fact there are more than 26 claimants, since for convenience where flats are owned by more than one person they are nonetheless treated as being, effectively, the one claimant.  A small number of claimants purchased more than one flat, which is why there are more flats than claimants. </p>
	</authorialNote> are the owners of long leasehold interests in a total of 30 individual flats.  These are referred to as the individual leaseholder claimants.  Of these individual leaseholder claimants only two purchased the flats for their own or a family member’s occupation; the remainder purchased as buy-to-let investments.  Some live overseas, although the majority are UK residents.  </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.6 The other claimant, Zagora, is the freehold owner of New Lawrence House.  It pursues a claim against ZIP under what has been referred to as the agreement to rectify.  In short, Zagora contends that an agreement was reached between itself and ZIP on a commercial basis under which ZIP agreed to fund works to resolve certain agreed defects regardless of the strict position under the building warranties.  Further or in the alternative it pursues a claim against ZIP on the basis that it is – or is to be treated as – an insured under a building warranty.  ZIP vigorously disputes both of these claims.   </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.7 Whilst ZIP accepts that the individual leaseholders are insured under individual Standard 10 building warranty policies they dispute their claims on a number of grounds. In short, ZIP’s position is that this is a complex insurance claim in respect of which the individual defects require separate and careful consideration in the light of the conflicting factual and expert evidence and the applicable policy coverage and exclusions.   </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.8 One complicating feature in relation to all of these claims is that a significant number of the total flats in the development, 66 out of a total of 104, were acquired by a limited liability partnership known as CJS Investments LLP (“CJS”), the individual partners in which were connected with the company, JCS Homes Ltd (“JCS”), which built the development.  Of the remaining 8, 7 were acquired by individuals connected with JCS.  Neither CJS nor the connected individual leaseholders nor the remaining one unconnected individual leaseholder has played any active part in this case.  </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">However, the role played by the financer of both JCS and CJS, the Bank of Ireland (“the Bank”) has been the subject of considerable debate.  JCS went into liquidation in December 2012 and CJS went into administration in November 2014.  CJS was originally a party to the claim but discontinued its claim once it became apparent that the connection between CJS and JCS would prevent it from successfully making a claim under the building warranties as a result of a clause in the policies which effectively excluded persons or companies connected with the developer from claiming under any building warranty. The consequences of this in terms of the claimants’ ability to recover in full the cost of remedial works to the common parts under the policies requires careful consideration, as does the inter-relationship between the respective rights and obligations of: (a) the individual leaseholder claimants; (b) Zagora as the freehold owner; and (c) the management company which was established to manage the development, Lawrence House Management Company (City Road) Limited (“LHM”) – which is not an insured and which makes no claim of its own against ZIP.   </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.9 The Bank has funded and continued to fund the claim until very recently, when a third party funder known as 123 Pay Limited (“123 Pay”) took over the funding, under arrangements which have been the subject of some controversy and which may require careful consideration, given the arguments raised by ZIP as to the impact of those funding agreements upon the claimants’ right to recover.  These arrangements and arguments extend to the position of Walker Morris as the claimants’ solicitors.      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.10 From any sensible perspective it is regrettable that in 2013, at a time when – to put it neutrally – Zagora and ZIP were engaged in a productive dialogue as to a way forward in terms of agreeing and undertaking remedial works to resolve the undoubted problems with the development, a dispute arose between Zagora and CJS as to whether Zagora or LHM – which CJS claimed to control – was entitled to manage the development.  This dispute led to LHM obtaining an interim injunction in the County Court restraining Zagora from seeking to manage the development.  This injunction had the unfortunate effect of preventing the dialogue between Zagora and ZIP from proceeding to what both parties hoped would be a satisfactory conclusion.  The litigation between Zagora and LHM was transferred to the Manchester TCC (“the TCC action”) where it proceeded to a trial before HHJ Raynor QC.  Separately, a further action was brought in the Manchester Chancery Division (“the Chancery action”) to establish who controlled LHM.  The Chancery action also proceeded to a trial before HHJ Raynor QC.   </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.11 Although HHJ Raynor QC found in favour of LHM in the TCC action and CJS in the Chancery action his decision in the Chancery action was overturned on appeal, the Court of Appeal concluding that on their true construction the – undoubtedly poorly drafted - voting provisions of LHM had the perhaps surprising effect that the individual leaseholders, as the owners of the minority of the flats, rather than CJS as the owners of the majority of the flats, were entitled to control LHM.  It followed that CJS had instigated and prosecuted the TCC action by LHM without authority from those who were entitled to control LHM and that the judgment obtained by LHM against Zagora in the TCC action was a nullity.  The ultimate outcome was that Zagora and the individual leaseholder claimants in this action, who had all sided with Zagora, succeeded in the litigation and CJS failed, the adverse financial consequences of which led to its administration.  </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.12 Turning to the claim against ZBC, thirteen of the claimants including Zagora (“the ZBC claimants”) make claims against ZBC which undertook the role of building inspector at the development and which issued final certificates under the Building Regulations (“the Bldg Regs final certificates”).  The claim is pleaded in deceit on the basis that the relevant inspector – Mr David Mather – knew that the statements made in the Bldg Regs final certificates were not true or knew that there were no reasonable grounds for believing the truth of the statements or was reckless as to their truth.  The ZBC claimants contend that they would not have acquired the individual flats (or freehold interest in Zagora’s case) had they known the true position and that the flats and the freehold interest are at best worth much less than what was paid and at worst worthless.  The ZBC claimants seek a refund of all amounts paid out on the purchase and subsequently less (where applicable) their true value and any income received, together with an indemnity against any liability they may have under the leases for repair costs.   </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.13 It will be appreciated that the claim against ZBC has to be pursued on the basis of deceit since under the existing law negligence alone will not suffice.  ZBC vigorously denies that Mr Mather was deceitful and also contends that in any event none of the ZBC claimants relied on the Bldg Regs final certificates, in circumstances where they were not issued to the ZBC claimants directly by ZBC.  The issues of deceit and of the ZBC claimants’ knowledge of and reliance upon the Bldg Regs final certificates, whether prior to exchange or completion, have thus been the subject of considerable investigation and debate at trial.  Furthermore, because the original claim issued in 2015 pleaded the claim against ZBC in negligence rather than deceit and because I refused the ZBC claimants permission to amend that claim (save in relation to Zagora, where no arguable limitation issue arose), the individual leaseholder ZBC claimants were forced to issue a separate action in 2017 and to plead reliance on s.32 of the Limitation Act 1980 in order to enable them to defeat ZBC’s accrued limitation defence. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.14 Finally, the quantification of the claims against ZBC is disputed.  In particular, issues arise as to whether or not the value of the insurance policies issued by ZIP and/or the value of any recovery against ZIP must be brought into account and, if so, how and in what way.  </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.15 These factors, individually and collectively, explain why the case has been so vigorously contested, both throughout the interlocutory stages and at trial. As well as numerous witnesses of fact there were expert witnesses in 8 separate disciplines.  After pre-reading the written opening submissions and a day of oral openings the evidence was heard over 16 days.  There was then a pause for written closing submissions to be produced and a further 2 days allowed for oral closing submissions after which I received some short supplemental written submissions.  I have taken all of this material into account when producing this judgment.  Having produced my judgment in draft and after some time had elapsed both ZIP and ZBC invited me to clarify and supplement my judgment in certain respects.  I allowed the claimants to respond and, where indicated in this judgment, have either accepted those invitations to the limited extent it appeared to me to be appropriate or explained why I have declined to do so. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in">1.16 I would like to express my appreciation for the immaculately prepared trial bundles produced by Walker Morris, both in hard copy with a copy also being made available for me in electronic format, and my gratitude to the legal representatives for all of the parties who co-operated to enable the trial to be concluded within the time allocated notwithstanding the volume of material in the </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">case.  The case was skilfully and vigorously presented by leading and junior counsel for the claimants and for ZIP and by junior counsel for ZBC, to all of whom I am greatly indebted. </p>

They would have secured a very substantial judgment in their favour but, due to the application of the maximum liability limitations in the building warranties, their claim is limited to the total of the purchase prices of their flats as declared to ZIP which, subject to final clarification, is £3,634,074, significantly less than they would otherwise have been entitled to. </p>

I shall then turn to address issues as to the terms and the construction of the leases and the insurance policies.  I can then proceed to consider in order: (a) the claim by Zagora against ZIP under the alleged agreement to rectify; (b) the claim by Zagora against ZIP under the alleged building warranty; (c) the claims by the leaseholder claimants against ZIP under the building warranties; (d) the claims by the ZBC claimants against ZBC.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.2 Mr Andrew Broadhurst and Mr Russell Robinson are both directors of and were the two primary witnesses for Zagora.  Mr Broadhurst is also an important witness for the claimants as a whole, given his particular involvement in relation to the alleged agreement to rectify.  The defendants contend that they were unreliable and, in particular, they invite me to reject their evidence as to the extent of their knowledge of the existence of defects in the development prior to their purchase of the freehold.  In his previous judgment in the TCC action HHJ Raynor QC found both of them to be truthful and generally reliable witnesses.  That evaluation was subject to one caveat, which was that he noted a discrepancy between their first and their second witness statements as to their motives when acquiring the freehold of the development.  Having heard both men cross-examined I share Judge Raynor’s assessment, shrewd as always, as to their truthfulness and general reliability.  In general, I consider them truthful and reliable historians.  Whilst there were undoubtedly times in the cross examination of both men when they sought to argue the case or to avoid answering difficult questions, when compelled to give a direct answer or a direct question they generally answered honestly and reliably in my view.  However, the discrepancy identified by Judge Raynor also illustrates that both men were susceptible to giving evidence, both in their witness statements and in cross-examination, which was partisan and which made me doubt the reliability of their recollection on certain key issues where unsupported by contemporaneous documentation or other reliable evidence.  That is perhaps not surprising in circumstances where they have been involved in dispute and costly litigation ever since they acquired the freehold in 2013.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.3 As regards the individual leaseholder claimants, all were honest people in my view.  However, many of them were partisan witnesses who, whilst not setting out to lie, sought both in their witness statements and under cross-examination to argue their case and to make assertions which were clearly contrary to the contemporaneous documentation. Their witness statements in my view suffered from the vice of having been drafted so as to advance their case by reference to what they now believed to be their understanding of events, making selective reference to the contemporaneous documentation which supported their case, rather than by setting out their genuine and unadorned recollection in 2018 of what they had done, said and thought many years earlier.  To take an important example, many claimed to have read and formed a certain understanding of the terms of the sale contracts under which they agreed to acquire their flats from JCS which supported their claim against ZBC when, in my view, most of them had no such genuine recollection and had not done so.  Many of them sought to maintain this evidence to support their case under cross-examination even when demonstrated to be inconsistent with the contemporaneous documentation or when it became apparent that in truth they had no real independent recollection of events after the lapse of time.  They all struggled at times to provide a clear and detailed recollection of events, not surprisingly given the lapse of time.  I give their evidence due weight but make my decision largely by reference to the contemporaneous documentation which, fortunately, is voluminous as well as my assessment of the inherent probabilities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.4 As regards the witnesses called by ZIP Mr Parvin was the most senior witness called.  At the time he was the team leader for major loss claims in the UK, with a background in structural engineering and loss adjusting.  He came across as honest and generally reliable.  However, his view of what he </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">believed he had agreed to some extent affected his recollection of events which, I am satisfied, was relatively poor save where aided by contemporaneous documents.  That is not surprising since the events in question are now 5 years old and I did not gain the impression that these events had particularly stuck in his mind, not surprisingly given that he had dealt with many similar claims during his time with ZIP and has since moved to a new and equally if not more demanding role.   </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.5 Without advancing any explanation ZIP chose not to offer a witness statement from or to call Mr David Robinson, a loss adjuster with Cunningham Lindsey, who had worked closely with Mr Parvin in relation to the events relevant to the alleged agreement to rectify and who had written a key letter to record ZIP’s position following the meeting at which Zagora say the agreement to rectify was reached.  I am satisfied that when making findings as to what happened I should bear in mind that ZIP failed to call David Robinson as a witness who it must have known had material evidence to give.  The significance of this however is much reduced in the particular facts of this case because there is little disagreement between those witnesses who were called as to what happened at the meeting and by the fact that his subsequent letter essentially speaks for itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.6 ZIP also successfully asserted litigation privilege in relation to its internal documents – as well as those of Cunningham Lindsey and its engineering consultant adviser Mr Brown of Thomasons - relating to the alleged agreement to rectify.  It was perfectly entitled to do so and I have reminded myself that I must not speculate about what those documents might have said.  However, I bear in mind that whilst Zagora’s case and evidence has been tested against its contemporaneous internal documents as well as the external documents, ZIP’s case and evidence has not been tested in the same way. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.7 As regards the witnesses called by ZBC, I should begin by noting that they all had the disadvantage of being unable to refer to the full complement of contemporaneous documents for two reasons.  The first is because at some stage after 2013 the box which contained ZBG’s files relating to New Lawrence House (known as box 54) had been lost and cannot now be found.  The reason, it appears, is that after Mr Parvin retrieved it from storage in 2013 it was left in a filing cabinet from where it has disappeared.  It cannot be found in the archive maintained by ZIP and there is no evidence or explanation as to whether it was ever sent to archive and has become lost there or whether it remained in the filing cabinet and at some unknown point disappeared from there.  In any event it appears from Mr Parvin’s evidence that when he inspected box 54 there was only a limited amount of paperwork within it, principally the approved drawings, and no documents of the kind which he would have expected to see, such as a plan check or copies of electrical and other test certificates, let alone copies of any internal or external correspondence.  It appears that there would also have been a site folder kept on site at the development which would have contained relevant documents or copy documents, either those produced by JCS to satisfy the ZBG surveyors that the construction accorded with the Bldg Regs and/or the Zurich technical manual, or those produced by ZBG such as requests for information or cover notes.  ZBC’s witnesses accepted that there was no proper system for ensuring that the site folder was retrieved from site at the end of a job and that it often went missing when the contractor or developer demobilised from site at that stage.   </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.9 Given that a claim was first intimated against ZBC in April 2013 and that ZIP involved both a dedicated financial claims team and in-house lawyers to consider the specific claim against ZBC at that stage it is extremely unimpressive, to say the least, that relevant documents, both hard copy and electronic, were not obtained, copied and secured for later use, especially since on any view matters were not finally resolved at that point in time.   </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.10 However, in the absence of grounds for concluding either that the box and its contents or the site folder were disposed of deliberately, recklessly or carelessly in the full knowledge that it ought to have been preserved for anticipated litigation, or that any relevant electronic material was lost or rendered unreadable in similar circumstances, I do not consider that it would be proper for me to draw any adverse inferences against ZBC as a defendant to a claim in deceit arising from the absence of such documents.  Still less would it be appropriate to draw any adverse inferences against Mr Mather who, on any view, bears no responsibility for the loss of these files.  The only caveat is that in the absence of positive evidence from ZBC as a defendant or from Mr Mather or Mr Nicholls or Mr Eadsforth personally that there was a much larger quantity of email traffic generated between the three of them in relation to their inspections or general communications as regards the development and its state of completion which cannot now be produced  I consider that I am bound to conclude that the email traffic which actually passed between them relating to such matters was in fact extremely limited.  That does not of course, I should add, mean that there were no oral conversations between them concerning the same subject matter.  </p>

Mr Cairns was the most senior former employee called to give evidence.  He had no direct involvement with New Lawrence House.  He was a reliable and convincing witness.  Mr Nicholls was a senior surveyor employed in the building warranty side of the ZBG business and had been involved in inspections at New Lawrence House.  He was clearly somewhat reluctant to be involved in giving evidence in this case and, not surprisingly, willing to be led to agree with the thrust of Mr Selby’s cross-examination which, happily for him, had the effect of allowing him to minimise any personal responsibility which might otherwise attach for the inadequate way in which ZBG performed its functions in relation to this development and to throw it onto Mr Mather. Mr Eadsforth joined ZBG as a trainee site surveyor in December 2008 and worked under the supervision of Mr Nicholls on building warranty inspections until he was made redundant in December 2009.  He was also willing to accept Mr Selby’s invitation to minimise any personal responsibility on his part for the failures.   </p>

It also has to accept that by issuing the Bldg Regs final certificates Mr Mather represented that reasonable steps had been taken by ZBC to satisfy itself that the Bldg Regs had been complied with and that this representation was untrue.  The key issue which I have to decide is whether or not that was an innocent misrepresentation or whether Mr Mather either knew that reasonable steps had not been taken or was reckless as to whether or not they had been taken. The answer to that question requires me to reconstruct the state of Mr Mather’s mind in December 2009 and again in November 2010. That involves an assessment of his witness evidence when considered in the context of the evidence overall, including the contemporaneous documentary evidence and the likely realities.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.15 This is not a case where Mr Mather was cross-examined on the basis, or there was otherwise evidence, that he was acting in a deliberately dishonest way, with a view to financial or other personal gain.  There is no evidence or basis for any suggestion that he was being bribed by JCS to issue Bldg Regs final certificates which he knew full well he ought not to have issued.  Moreover, the Bldg Regs final certificates in themselves were of no use to JCS without ZBG also issuing building warranty certificates.  It followed, as Mr Asquith submitted, that if bribery was the motive it would have to have involved Mr Nicholls at the very least, and probably Mr Eadsforth as well, as the building warranty surveyors who signed off the individual flats as complete so that the building warranty certificates could be issued.  Yet the claimants have not pleaded or set out to prove that these witnesses were also dishonest. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.16 It follows, in my view, that the crucial question is whether or not Mr Mather was genuinely unaware that ZBG as a whole had not taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the Bldg Regs had been complied with at the time he issued the Bldg Regs final certificates. I have to be satisfied that he positively knew that reasonable steps had not been taken or, alternatively, suspected that reasonable steps had not been taken but consciously chose not to investigate further. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.17 Mr Mather disclaimed any knowledge of any inadequacy on the part of the ZBG warranty surveyors in the performance of their role. His evidence was that he relied upon their having properly discharged their role when issuing the Bldg Regs final certificates. His evidence was also that he relied upon the accuracy of what he was told by the representatives of JCS with whom he had dealings. In so far as it was put to him that he was also personally at fault his overall approach tended to be to deny any personal blame. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">refusal to accept personal responsibility rather than an ability to put forward positive explanations or a present acceptance that he had been at fault but an assertion that at the time he had not appreciated his errors. As the claimants submitted, it was a little surprising that he had failed to take positive steps to engage in the defence of the claim beyond the bare minimum. Whilst I appreciate that he is now retired and that these events are some distance away, nonetheless I would have expected him to have made more effort to involve himself in the defence and to familiarise himself with the issues. In my view that is because he is still in denial as to the true extent of his role in and responsibility for the plainly wrongful issue of Bldg Regs final certificates in the circumstances which obtained in 2009 and 2010. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.19 Moreover, it was clear that he was not always completely candid, whether in his contemporaneous actions or in his evidence in this case. His explanations to Mr Cairns in relation to his involvement with flat 126 in January 2010 and his letter to Manchester Building Control in the same month seemed to me to be less than candid. His evidence as to his never issuing cover notes manually was in my view untrue. His evidence as to whether or not he had physically inspected the development in September 2010 varied. Whilst I am not suggesting for a moment that he was a thoroughly dishonest witness I do not consider that I can rely upon him as a convincing or reliable witness in relation to key issues in the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.20 I heard from all of the experts who had produced joint and separate reports with the exception of ZIP’s fire expert, Mr Pagan, who ZIP elected not to call, and both the ZBC claimants’ and ZBC’s building control experts, Mr Conlon for the claimants and Mr Easton for ZBC. The ZBC claimants decided that they did not need to call Mr Conlon or to cross-examine Mr Easton on matters of remaining disagreement because they did not consider it necessary for me to make findings in their favour on those disputed issues, relying instead upon the large measure of agreement reached between the experts in their joint statement and upon what Mr Easton said in his report. That was a sensible approach which Mr Asquith rightly did not criticise in any way. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">2.21 I accept the claimants’ submission that it is not necessary or appropriate for me to make findings in relation to the remaining expert witnesses as to whose evidence I prefer in general, as opposed to in relation to whose evidence I prefer on the specific items in dispute.  That is because, as Mr Selby submitted, it was apparent that all experts who gave evidence had genuine expertise, were genuinely independent and generally were doing their best to assist the court.  As is always the case, some of the experts were more familiar than others with the whole process of acting as an independent witness including giving oral evidence and, as a result, were more polished both in their written expositions and in oral evidence.  However, it would be wrong to conclude that as a result their expert evidence on the substantive issues was to be preferred, rather than engaging with the merits of the evidence which they gave.  Some of the experts were also more argumentative than others and, at times, needed to be reminded to answer the question and to refrain from unnecessary comment or advocacy.  That is always more concerning, but I did not think that any of the experts crossed the line in a serious or persistent way into arguing their client’s case or forgetting their overriding duty to the court.  Whilst I have taken that where appropriate into account when considering their evidence on the individual issues it is not in my view a reason for preferring the evidence of one over the other wholesale. </p>

In particular both the parties and I owe a debt of gratitude to the quantity surveying experts, who put in a huge amount of time and effort in the run-up to trial and at trial itself in order to reach a large measure of agreement on figures as figures, without which it would have been very difficult to see clearly the financial wood from the trees.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">3.1 JCS was a company which undertook a number of residential developments in the Greater Manchester area.  Its active shareholder was a Mr Jason Alexander and its two funding shareholders were Mr Chandravadan Mehta and Mr Sunil Mehta. In December 2003 it obtained outline planning permission for the development to be known as New Lawrence House.  In summary, the plan was to build around 150 separate flats in 5 four-storey blocks on a site fronting City Road, in a location approximately a mile from the Manchester city centre on the borders of Hulme in Manchester and Stretford in Trafford.   Although the area was less immediately attractive than other development areas closer in to the city centre, particularly given its relative distance from the city centre and its immediate location, which estate agents might somewhat optimistically have described as “up and coming”, nonetheless it was sufficiently close to further education facilities to attract students looking for flats to rent and the cheaper land values in the area permitted two bedroomed flats to be constructed and marketed for sale, with the benefit of car parking facilities in an undercroft type semi-basement area and some associated green space, at similar prices to one bedroomed flats with fewer facilities in more desirable areas. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">3.3 JCS assembled a team of professionals to design and manage the development.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">3.4 JCS also needed to secure an insurance company which would provide building warranty type insurance policies without which no mortgage company would lend on the security of the flats.  At this stage ZBG was still offering its Standard 10 product to developers and builders such as JCS and was also still offering an approved building inspector service.  JCS decided to use ZBG both to provide building warranty insurance policies and also building inspection services for Bldg Regs approval purposes. ZBG was only prepared to issue policies in respect of developments constructed by approved builders and so JCS applied for and successfully achieved membership status with ZBC as an approved builder in June 2007.  ZBC was also duly appointed the approved inspector for the development, giving an initial notice to Manchester Building Control in September 2007.  I refer further to the activities of ZBG below and in more detail in section 4.  JCS marketed the flats on the basis that on completion it would provide a new home warranty from ZBG and this was written into the sale contracts, which provided by clause 14 that: “the property is covered by Zurich Municipal New Build Building Guarantee Scheme. The seller undertakes to deliver to the buyer’s solicitor relevant Zurich documentation on or as soon as practicable after the date hereof”. </p>

One such was an agency known as Assetz which introduced a number of the individual leaseholders to the development.  As was common, JCS planned to sell individual flats off-plan well before the development was completed. The agencies explained that the flats would come with a letting agent in place, being an associated company of JCS, and also with a tenant already found and, as a result, would achieve a guaranteed rental from the outset.  Assetz was also in the habit of recommending a Manchester firm of solicitors known as Birchall Blackburn to undertake the conveyancing for their clients and many, although not all, did so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">3.7 In preparation for achieving off-plan sales JCS used the services of a firm of solicitors known as Ramsdens, based in Huddersfield, to undertake the conveyancing process.  As early as October 2006 they produced a general information sheet which was intended to answer the standard enquiries before contract without the need for a specific request.  It included a copy of the draft sale contract and a copy of the draft 125 year lease to be entered into on completion.  It stated that JCS had applied for registration with ZBG and explained that the draft sale contract made provision for the production of the cover note and certification. It did not however make express reference to Bldg Regs approval or to the appointment of ZBC in that respect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">There has been some debate in the context of the claim against ZBC as to the proper interpretation of these provisions of the sale contracts. What is clear on any view is that as regards the earlier sale contracts it is the service of the cover note rather than the issue or provision of either the final insurance certificate or a Bldg Regs final certificate which triggers the completion obligation. Moreover, clause 4.2, which circumscribes the ability of the buyer to resist completion by contending that the property had not been physically completed, says nothing about any linkage between the obligation to complete and the issue of a Bldg Regs final certificate.  Whilst clause 11.1.2 does specifically refer to inspection and approval by the building control inspector, the only relevance of that approval in that clause is that it deems the seller to have complied with its obligation to construct the development in accordance with the initial Bldg Regs approval. Whilst there is also an obligation in clause 11.2.3 upon the seller to complete the flat in accordance with the terms of the Bldg Regs consent, that is not in any way linked to the obligation to complete. </p>

Perhaps more pertinently, it is evident that the presence or absence of a Bldg Regs final certificate would be of some evidential relevance if and insofar as there was a dispute as to whether or not the buyer was obliged to complete the lease on the basis of a dispute as to whether or not the seller had complied with its obligation as qualified by clause 4.2 to complete the flat. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Returning to the chronology, as early as April 2007 individual claimants such as Ms Goldman were reserving individual flats with the agency through whom they were dealing, paying a reservation fee to JCS.  Using Ms Goldman as an example, of course there was nothing physically in terms of a development for her to see had she travelled to view the site, other than the general location and the existing buildings prior to demolition.  As early as May 2007, again taking Ms Goldman as an example, her solicitors wrote to her enclosing a draft contract and reporting on various matters relevant to the proposed transaction.  Putting the matter in general terms at this stage, whilst many of the purchasers’ conveyancing solicitors made reference to the fact that ZBG was providing a building warranty, none referred specifically to the building control function which ZBC was also to provide, perhaps not surprisingly because they would not have known from the information provided by Ramsdens that such was the intention.  As early as June 2007 Mrs Goldman’s solicitors had exchanged contracts on her behalf, so that she was buying off-plan.      </p>

That is because Mainstay did indeed instruct a practice known as BWP Surveyors to produce a Fire Risk Assessment and a General Risk Assessment.  The fire risk assessment, issued on 7 August 2012, identified a number of concerns with the development including matters of fire safety, such as a lack of intumescent strips to fire doors, inadequate compartmentation to prevent the spread of smoke and fire, a lack of fire resistant sealing of service pipes and a lack of emergency lighting in the car park and a lack of smoke ventilation. There was no explicit reference to a lack of protection of structural steelwork, although there was a recommendation under the heading “building compartmentation” that “intumescent materials be used within the voids to reduce the risk of smoke or flames spreading to other parts of the property”.  </p>

It would then ensure that ground rents were collected promptly and efficiently.  Where possible, it would also take over the wider management of the building and generate additional income in various ways from performing that management role.  Its strategy was then, having demonstrated that the development was a sound investment, proceed to re-finance the bridging finance with a primary lender at a much reduced interest rate and either retain the property as a profit generating asset or seek to sell it on at a profit.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Zagora undoubtedly believed that it was entitled to manage the development in this case given that this is what Freehold Managers said that they had already done.  It is Zagora’s case that it acquired the freehold without a survey on the basis that it was unnecessary to do so, given that it was acquiring the freehold on the basis that the freeholder had no repair or maintenance obligations and relying on the Bldg Regs final certificates as evidence that the development had been properly constructed. The question of reliance is hotly disputed by ZBC and has led to close examination at trial on this point, including reference to the conveyancing file of the solicitors instructed by Zagora, Robert Meaton and Co, who acted by their senior partner, Mr Andrew Davies. It is an unusual feature of this case that Mr Davies, who continued to advise Zagora and to represent it initially in the subsequent litigation, was subsequently discovered to have forged a number of documents in connection with this case and, as I understand it, was later convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment as a result. In his judgment in the previous TCC action Judge Raynor expressly acquitted Mr Broadhurst and Mr Robinson of participation in or knowledge of those forgeries and the contrary suggestion has not been advanced before me. </p>

The extent of Zagora’s knowledge pre-purchase is disputed by the defendants. In short, it is suggested  that Zagora acquired the freehold in the knowledge that there were significant unfinished and defective works and that there was a potential claim against ZBG, whether under the policy or as a negligence claim in relation to the building control function, which had the potential of generating significant income for Zagora or associated companies in managing the conduct of any insurance claim and/or claim against ZBG and in procuring, managing and undertaking any remedial works.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">What is, on any view, regrettable is that the further steps which it is common ground had been agreed should be taken by Zagora and ZBG to investigate the issues at New Lawrence House could not be undertaken as planned due to the intervention of what became the bitter and protracted dispute between Zagora and CJS.  As I have said it is Zagora’s case that it believed that it was entitled to perform the management company functions for the development because there was no management company exercising that role.  However, as early as 19 April 2013 Zagora and CJS had fallen out, solicitors were involved and correspondence ensued and by June 2013 Mr Broadhurst had become aware that LHM had been restored to the Register of Companies by CJS, which was contending that LHM, acting under its control, was entitled to manage the development. Both Zagora and CJS through LHM were communicating with the individual leaseholders to assert that each was responsible for managing New Lawrence House. However, the triggering event occurred on 10 July 2013 when CJS caused LHM to apply for and obtain an interim injunction on a without notice application restraining Zagora from managing New Lawrence House until the dispute was finally resolved. That interim injunction was continued on the return date on 19 July 2013 (by me, as it happens) and the action then transferred to the TCC with directions later being given with a view to a trial taking place the following year. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In 2014 the question of entitlement to control LHM came into sharp focus in the context of a notice of meeting purportedly convened by CJS on its behalf.  The essential dispute was as to whether CJS was entitled to one vote per flat and thus to 66 votes in total or to only one vote in respect of the 66 flats.  This dispute turned on a proper interpretation of the articles of association of LHM which, due to deficiencies in drafting, was not at all straightforward.  The majority of the individual leaseholders, allying themselves with Zagora, contended that since CJS only had one vote it was not entitled either to control LHM or to authorise or continue the proceedings against Zagora. That dispute became the subject of the Chancery action, which Zagora funded on behalf of the individual leaseholders and which was determined in favour of CJS by Judge Raynor in May 2014.  Subsequently Judge Raynor gave judgment in August 2014 against Zagora in the TCC action on the basis that CJS was entitled to 64 votes and, hence, to control LHM and that Zagora had no basis for contending that it was entitled to undertake the management function once LHM was reinstated. However, there was then a successful appeal to the Court of Appeal against his earlier ruling in the Chancery action so that in September 2014 the Court decided – <span style="font-style:italic">Sugarman &amp; others v CJS &amp; others</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 1239 - that CJS only enjoyed one vote and, hence, was not as it had claimed entitled to control LHM. The end result was that LHM’s success in August 2014 was rendered pyrrhic and the judgment obtained by it against Zagora set aside as a nullity on the basis that the action had not been validly authorised by those validly entitled to authorise it in LHM’s name.  Moreover, control of LHM passed to the individual leaseholders who had appointed 3 of their number as directors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Nonetheless there was a separation as between the building warranty function and the building control function, both organisationally and functionally.  Organisationally, as an organogram to which I was referred illustrates, ZBC sat alongside and apart from the key ZBG building warranty function.  ZBC had its own national manager, a Mr Van Schalkwyk, who reported directly to the overall head of ZBC, Mr Horsler. Reporting to Mr Van Schalkwyk were the two building control surveyors, Mr Mather and a Ms Allery.  Separately reporting to Mr Horsler on the building warranty side were Mr Cairns as the ZBG regional manager for the southern area and Ms Armstrong as the ZBG regional manager for the northern area.  Reporting to the regional managers were regional surveyors and reporting to the regional surveyors were senior surveyors including Mr Nicholls and, finally, reporting to them were site surveyors including, from 2009 onwards, Mr Eadsforth.  Functionally, only building control qualified surveyors were authorised to undertake the specific building control function which was the subject of prescription under the Building Act 1984, the Building Regulations 2000 and 2010, the Building (Approved Inspectors etc.) Regulations 2000 and the Approved Documents – to which I shall refer in more detail later.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">However, it was also recognised that in reality there was a close connection between the building warranty functions and the building control functions.  That is because  the cover provided by the building warranty policies was very substantially aligned with the requirements of the Bldg Regs, both because: (a) the cover in respect of present or imminent danger to health and safety applied where the danger resulted from the developer’s failure to comply with the Bldg Regs; (b) the major physical damage cover applied where the damage resulted from the developer’s failure to comply with ZBG’s requirements as contained within its technical manual (“the technical requirements”) which itself was in many respects closely aligned with the requirements contained in the Approved Documents issued under the Bldg Regs.  It followed that the inspections undertaken by the building warranty inspectors were either identical to or at least very similar in terms of their purpose, scope and performance as the inspections which would be undertaken by a building control inspector for building control purposes.  It also followed, particularly after the organisational changes which occurred in late 2008, that a building warranty inspector was able to undertake much of the work which a building control inspector might otherwise have to do, and vice versa, thus allowing time and cost savings to be made.           </p>

The only available inspectors to take his place were Mr Nicholls, who had a significantly increased workload, and Mr Eadsforth as an incoming untrained inspector who required to be accompanied and supervised by Mr Nicholls on all but the most basic inspections. In January 2009 Mr Nicholls, having taken over responsibility for New Lawrence House, emailed his regional manager expressing his concern that the departures had led to having to employ a “fire-fighting” strategy which, he was concerned, was not “fully accommodating ZBG’s commitment to its building control status”.  There is no evidence which indicates that his regional manager or anyone else disagreed with this assessment or that any steps were taken to address the concerns raised other than for him to rely more on Mr Eadsforth for site inspections.  Indeed, a rather brusque email from Mr Horsler made it clear that the building control function would have to make do with the resource it had.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">It appears that ZBG always envisaged that the primary building control inspection function would not be performed by the building control inspectors such as Mr Mather but would instead be undertaken by the building warranty inspectors such as Mr Nicholls. This it appears was on the basis that liaison between the building warranty surveyors and the building control inspector would ensure that any potential issues were picked up by the former and reported to the latter, who would then take such action as was appropriate.  It is apparent from ZBG’s surveying internal procedures as effective from March 2008 that even in relation to the final completion stage the building control inspector would not necessarily inspect site before issuing a Bldg Regs final certificate, although the procedure required liaison as between the building warranty surveyor and the building control inspector to ensure that all appropriate steps had been taken in terms of the inspections and information provided relating to the issue of a Bldg Regs final certificate.  Mr Nicholls’ evidence was that if he was inspecting for both building warranty and building control purposes he would liaise with Mr Mather and keep him up to date.  Mr Mather’s evidence was that he would not normally undertake site inspections as a matter of course, not even a final inspection, nor would he access the ZBG “Live 27” system in order to check on progress, because he would rely upon his contact with the building warranty surveyors, his contact with the developer and his ongoing knowledge of the site through being contacted by both and through undertaking site visits as and when necessary.   </p>

So, for example, if a surveyor visited site and raised a query which the site agent could not immediately answer the surveyor might enter on the site folder that he had asked the developer to provide the required information and subsequently the site agent might then record that he had done so and, if that information was in the form of a document such as a certificate of suitability of a particular product being used in the construction process, leave a copy of the certificate in the site folder.  It appears from Mr Mather’s evidence that there was no system in place to ensure that the site folder did not simply disappear at the end of a project and that it often tended to disappear at the same time as the developer demobilised and the site cabin was removed.  Even if it had been retained on this project it would presumably have been placed into the project box which as I have said has since disappeared.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In relation to flat 1 there is no evidence of a cover note being issued.  It is not clear whether this is because no cover note was issued or because for some reason it cannot now be located.  There is no obvious reason why not.  Exchange took place in 2007 and completion took place in May 2009.  It appears from the correspondence in relation to flat 1 that in January 2009 JCS was stating that completion was expected to take place on 13 March 2009 and that, following some exchanges about the buyers’ financial difficulties, an accommodation was reached and completion rescheduled for May 2009.  Since Mr Nicholls issued cover notes for the adjacent flats 2 and 3 on 9 March 2009 the conclusion I draw is that ZBG was informed by JCS that there was no need to issue a cover note for this property since a specific completion date had already been agreed.  I accept that this is inference but it is supported by the fact that there is evidence that there was close liaison between JCS and ZBG about issuing cover notes and completion certificates because until this happened it would not be possible for JCS to market the flat as certified complete and insured or to require or enforce the completion obligation.  </p>

Since there would appear to have been no obvious need for cover notes to be issued in relation to CJS flats the most likely explanation I infer is that since he was already issuing cover notes for flats in that area anyway he was asked by JCS to issue cover notes for others on the basis that there may have been purchasers – actual or anticipated – for those flats at that time.  What is rather surprising about all this is that, as is common ground, Live 27 does not record any stage 08 inspection being undertaken on any of the flats on or by 13 February 2009, so that it is not entirely clear why Mr Nicholls was issuing cover notes in relation to these flats at this time anyway.         </p>

Mr Cairns said that he was aware of this practice and did not encourage it, although it is clear that no active steps were taken by ZBG management to prevent it from happening.  Mr Mather said that he had never issued cover notes in such circumstances.

ZBG’s internal procedure required a plan checking form to be used and maintained but no record of it remains.

Some criticism is made of Mr Mather as regards the adequacy of his plan check.  In his report Mr Easton said that: “there were a number of rather basic breaches of Fire Regulations noted by the experts that should have been identified at design stage i.e. plan check”. In their joint statement the building control experts agreed that the failure to carry out a proper plan check significantly contributed to the production of an inadequate building.

Some criticism is made by Mr Conlon of Mr Mather’s failure to ask the Fire Service to address certain specific items and failure to make contact or at least chase up a response before issuing the Bldg Regs final certificates.  I do not consider that I am in a position to conclude on the evidence that Mr Mather was consciously aware that he had failed to comply with his duties as a building inspector in relation to his contact with the Fire Service.  When he was asked about this he said that he only ever gave one notice, unless there had been a material change, on all of the projects on which he had been involved, and did not regard it as his obligation to chase a reply.  He did add: “in fairness, I might be digging a hole for myself here”, which seemed to me to indicate a willingness to accept that he might have been wrong in adopting that practice. That willingness notwithstanding, it is clear to me that under the Regulations there is no express obligation to chase a response; the only express obligation is not to issue a final certificate until 15 working days have elapsed from the date on which the inspector consulted with the Fire Service. </p>

In cross-examination his evidence was that towards the end of the project he recalled that ZBG were not being informed by JCS of inspections that needed to be carried out so that things did slip away by that stage. He was asked precisely when this started to happen. He was unable to give a clear answer, not surprisingly given his generally poor recollection of the development, but in my view he was referring principally to events from late 2009 and in 2010 rather than in mid 2009 or earlier. Indeed, one of the surprising features of the evidence is that Mr Mather appears to have continued to accept at face value what he was being told by JCS even at these later stages and even in circumstances where he must have been aware that they were not providing him with accurate information. My assessment of Mr Mather is that he chose to continue to believe JCS’ assurances because, frankly, it was easier and simpler to do so than for him to spend time which he did not have in seeking to chase things up. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">I reach the same conclusions in relation to the other criticisms of the construction of the external walls on which he was cross-examined.  Nonetheless it is apparent from the nature and extent of the defects to the external walls that neither Mr Nicholls nor Mr Eadsforth nor Mr Mather can have undertaken a careful or detailed inspection of the building exterior.  This is particularly evident in relation to an area where the external render layer had simply not been applied and where Mr Mather accepted in cross-examination that he ought to have seen this and, had he done so, would have refused to issue a Bldg Regs final certificate in relation to the affected flats.  The same is true in relation to the balustrades, where Mr Mather accepted that he would have tested them for their strength had he undertaken a final inspection of a flat with an accessible balustrade.  Mr Easton as ZBC’s building control expert is of the view that Mr Mather did not act with reasonable competence in missing these defects.  However in my view it has not been demonstrated that the </p>

As Mr Asquith submits, such a conclusion would be inconsistent with the evidence in Live 27 that the surveyors were aware of and did note a number of relevant defects.  If they did fulfil their duties in relation to those defects it is not credible that they would have seen but consciously chosen not to raise these equally serious defects in the external walls.  It seems to me that the picture is more consistent with negligence by Mr Nicholls or Mr Eadsforth and Mr Mather.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Issues also arise in relation to the absence of some items.  In particular, Mr Mather was crossexamined about the failure to take any action as regards the absence of lifts, in circumstances where the original design had clearly included provision for lifts and where lift shafts had been constructed but no lifts installed.  Mr Mather accepted that he was aware of this, saying that Steve Jordan of JCS had told him that JCS was not going to install the lifts until later on because it would cost JCS £35,000 to do so and JCS had left lifts uninstalled on a previous block inspected by Manchester Building Control without problem.  Mr Mather said that he accepted this because there was no requirement in the Bldg Regs to provide a lift to a block of flats and, thus, no way for an approved inspector to force a developer to put in a lift or to change the entrance to a more wheelchair friendly design.  He was cross-examined about this and accepted that in relation to Block C the entrance was plainly not accessible to disabled persons.  However, he maintained that there was nonetheless no breach of Bldg Regs.  Whilst it would no doubt be possible to reach a conclusion as to whether that view is correct the position is not altogether straightforward nor clear on the evidence before me.  Thus although ZBC admitted that a failure to provide adequate lifting devices for wheelchair users and disabled residents would be contrary to the recommendations of the relevant paragraphs of the relevant Approved Document, compliance with the specific requirements of the Approved Documents is not mandatory.  Moreover, the relevant experts have not opined on the issue, since the claimants have not pursued a substantive claim against ZIP as regards the absence of lifts given that they are the subject of an express exclusion in the policies.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">The real question for me is whether I can be satisfied that Mr Mather knew that the lack of lifts meant that the Bldg Regs were not satisfied and, therefore, that Bldg Regs final certificates ought not to be issued in relation to flats affected by the lack of a lift.  I am unable to be satisfied that this was the case.  It is inconceivable in my view that Mr Mather would have issued the Bldg Regs final certificates had he known or believed that the lack of lifts constituted a flagrant breach of the Bldg Regs, in circumstances where he knew that JCS was not intending to install the lifts at least in the short term.  If it was such an obvious non-compliance then one would have expected Mr Nicholls or Mr Eadsforth to have picked it up as well, yet there is no suggestion that it prevented them from issuing cover notes or final insurance certificates. There is no evidence that Watts were sufficiently concerned to raise it in their reports as a serious contravention which, if true, would doubtless impact on the value of the Bank’s security. </p>

In his witness statement he said that he had raised this with JCS who had agreed with his alternative suggestion of treating the timber with a non-combustible paint treatment.  He accepted that he had relied upon JCS’ assurance that it had done so, in circumstances where it was his evidence that it would not necessarily have been easy to identify from a visual inspection whether or not it had been </p>

It was suggested to him that he ought not to have accepted an assurance from JCS in circumstances where there was evidence that it could not be trusted to do what it said it would.  However, there is no requirement under the Bldg Regs or otherwise which prohibits a building inspector from proceeding on the basis of information provided by the developer, and it is obvious that in many cases that will be the only way to proceed in the absence of the inspector being present at every stage or there being some independent certification.  Whilst there will be room for argument in an individual case whether or not the building inspector acted reasonably competently in accepting an assurance in a particular case, in my view it cannot be said on the facts of this case that accepting an assurance as to the application of the timber treatment is evidence of Mr Mather consciously signing off Bldg Regs final certificates in the knowledge either that no timber treatment had been applied or that he had not taken the steps which he ought to have taken in order to satisfy himself on the point.          </p>

In February 2009 Mr Nicholls had issued cover notes relating to 4 flats in circumstances where it is clear that no balconies had been installed and therefore in circumstances where there was clearly a risk of injury through someone exiting the French doors without appreciating the risk of falling.  The cover notes recorded that this was a final inspection and that the contractor was “on with snagging works”.  Mr Nicholls agreed that the absence of balconies went beyond mere snagging works and he was at a loss as to how he had come to issue these cover notes in such circumstances, especially since there was no record on Live 27 as to his having undertaken a final inspection at this time.

As I have said stage 06, the pre-plaster stage, was obviously an important stage, particularly in relation to fire safety related matters.  It is a matter of record from the Live 27 notes that as regards stage 06: (a) there had been no stage 06 inspections at all in blocks C and E; (b) only 36% of the flats in block D had been inspected; (c) only 61% of the flats in blocks A and B had been inspected.  Mr Nicholls agreed that this was unacceptable, both because of the lack of flats inspected and because of the presence of recurring fire safety related issues such as a lack of beam fill insulation.  He did not say that he was conscious of this at the time and, as Mr Asquith submitted, it is more likely than not that he was unaware of just how few stage 06 inspections he was undertaking and that the lack of inspection was due to oversight due to pressure of work. When asked by Mr Selby, he said that he believed that he must have commented on this to Mr Mather.

In my judgment it is unlikely that Mr Nicholls did tell Mr Mather about the poor inspection rates or, other than in the most general of terms, about the time pressures upon him.  It did not seem to me from hearing the two men give evidence that they had a particularly close working relationship: since they were both home and site based rather than being based at the same office and since they did not know each other particularly well on a personal level they did not have the sort of working relationship whereby they would have regularly had general discussions about the way things were going in relation to particular developments or within ZBG more generally. Nor did Mr Nicholls have any clear or specific recollection of telling Mr Mather about these events. Although the evidence shows that Mr Nicholls attended New Lawrence House for the first time on 20 January 2009 and picked up various items, including fire safety matters, there is no evidence to indicate that Mr Mather was present at the same time, and no particular reason to believe that he would have been.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Looking at matters more widely, it is clear in my view that the only reason why Mr Nicholls inspected an unacceptably low number of flats in these blocks was due to pressure of time.  He had already expressed his concerns about time pressures in January 2009 and received no constructive response. There is no evidence that he raised his inability to inspect a sufficient number of flats in this development to his superiors.  There is no obvious reason, therefore, why he should have shared it with Mr Mather since there is no suggestion, for example, that he asked Mr Mather to undertake inspections for him in order to compensate for the lack of his own inspections.  Nor is there any evidence that Mr Nicholls would simply have wanted to confide in Mr Mather for the sake of confiding with someone.  It seems more likely to me that Mr Nicholls would have just kept quiet about it. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that Mr Mather would have become aware of the situation other than through being informed by Mr Nicholls. I accept his evidence that he was not in the habit of interrogating Live 27.  His reaction at being informed of the low number of inspections under cross-examination seemed to me to be plausibly surprised and consistent with his not being previously aware of the fact.   </p>

He agreed that these were serious matters and believed that he would have notified Mr Mather of these issues.

It is clear that Mr Timperley was extremely concerned that the building was being occupied in such circumstances.  Mr Van Schalkwyk replied on 17 November 2009 to say that ZBG would investigate fully and revert.  Mr Cairns was clear in his evidence that he would not have expected an experienced building control inspector such as Mr Mather to have issued a Bldg Regs final certificate in relation to specific flats if such matters were present on inspection and had not been addressed, since they were plainly material to the safety of the means of escape from such flats.   </p>

Mr Mather said that he thought it was “more likely” that he attended with Mr Eadsforth on that occasion and inspected with him to satisfy himself that, for example, the steelwork was fire protected.  The Live 27 records also show that Mr Eadsforth attended again on 27 November 2009 and recorded that the smoke ventilation to the corridors was inadequate.

Indeed, if Mr Nicholls was still undertaking inspections of New Lawrence House with Mr Eadsforth it would make no sense for Mr Mather to be there as well, given the former practice whereby he would rely on Mr Nicholls to provide the necessary confirmation before issuing the Bldg Regs final certificates.  In my view it was assumed that Mr Eadsforth would be able to complete the building warranty surveying function, with access to advice from Mr Mather if required.  However, at this time Mr Mather was undoubtedly busy himself. As appears from an internal email of 11 November 2009 the plan was that Mr Mather would take on all building control jobs once Mr Van Schalkwyk left ZBG on 9 December 2009.  There is no doubt that this substantially increased the pressure on Mr Mather as the sole remaining building control inspector.  He accepted in cross-examination that it was a “busy time”.   </p>

The impact of this was that the initial notice would cease to be in force unless a Bldg Regs final certificate was issued within 8 weeks of the date of occupation, with the consequence that ZBC would be unable to act as approved inspector or thus issue any Bldg Regs final certificate subsequently.  There is no evidence that Mr Van Schalkwyk conducted any investigation into the concerns raised by Mr Timperley before he left ZBG and it is clear that the matter was left to Mr Mather to deal with.  Under cross-examination Mr Mather said that this did not matter in practice since the initial notice was not in fact cancelled and ZBC just carried on.  In my view Mr Mather was probably right in thinking that whatever the Regulations might provide in practice this would not be a problem unless or until Manchester Building Control took positive steps to take back the building control role.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">I am satisfied however that Mr Mather, as a vastly experienced building control inspector, knew enough about the procedures to be concerned that unless action was taken by him to resolve matters sooner rather than later the problem would not go away because Mr Timperley was unlikely just to give up.  I am also satisfied that of the two options, the first being to undertake a full investigation, with all the potential time and effort and negative consequences that might entail, and the second being to press on to issue Bldg Regs final certificates as soon as possible so as to get the job completed and off his desk, the second option would have been far more attractive to him.  Although under cross-examination Mr Mather rather downplayed the seriousness of the letter he did agree that a number of the matters raised in it were relevant to Bldg Regs compliance and that he would have wanted to investigate.  He said that he recalled visiting site and discussing matters with JCS, although he was unable to recall any details. This is consistent with the internal email which he sent on 7 December 2009 where he recorded that he had visited site that day and that he was planning to visit again on 11 December 2009.   He said that “we have had a couple of problems, all now being resolved”.  The clear implication, I am satisfied, is that he had been reassured that JCS would be taking sufficient steps in a short time period to enable him to sign off the development.  Equally clearly, in my view, it would not have been possible for Mr Mather to have relied upon those assurances when signing off the Bldg Regs final certificates later that month, as he did, without having satisfied himself, either from his own inspections or from information provided by the building warranty surveyors, that the Bldg Regs were complied with in all substantive respects in relation to the individual flats and the means of escape from those flats by that point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">On 11 December 2009 Mr Mather issued an unqualified cover note with the comment “final” for flat 131. This was the subject of some investigation in his cross-examination.  He accepted that in order to issue this cover note he would have had to be satisfied as to the safety of the means of escape from this flat.  However, it would have been apparent from Live 27 and indeed from a visual inspection that there were unremedied issues relating to the fire safety of the common areas, which in Live 27 were recorded as dating from the inspection of 13 November 2009 and which were not marked as remedied as at 11 December 2009.  Mr Mather accepted that he would have checked the Live 27 system in order to issue the cover note, not just in relation to the particular flat but also in relation to the common parts in 99C to ensure that there was a safe means of escape.  He suggested that the defects might have been remedied in December 2009 but not entered in Live 27 as remedied until September 2010.  There was no evidential basis for this suggestion, which is wholly inconsistent with all of the other evidence. The fact that Mr Mather was prepared to make that suggestion, albeit under the pressure of cross examination late in the day, was concerning, especially because the explanation he gave appeared to be that a surveyor would have been prepared to accept the assurance of Mr Jordan of JCS alone that one of the defects identified, that the intumescent paint to steelwork was incomplete and needed rectifying, had been rectified without inspection or the provision of sufficient documentary evidence (such as the provision of invoices for the supply and/or application of intumescent paint). </p>

In relation to flat 131 there were no unremedied defects registered against the flat and, it follows, no impediment to the system being used to issue a cover note.  However, Mr Mather could not explain why the cover note had been issued in his name if the entry had been made by Mr Eadsforth.  The only sensible explanation in my view is that which was put to Mr Mather, which is that he had created the cover note manually, using the Word format version to which he would have had access.  That is consistent with the fact that the cover note in relation to flat 139, issued on the same date, has content which differs from the content generated by Mr Eadsforth on Live 27 when the system records him as having inspected that day.   </p>

I reach this conclusion because it is apparent that Mr Mather must have attended site on this date, even though he had not recorded this attendance in the Live 27 system.  Since he was undertaking a building warranty function and not a building control function, he must have needed to access Live 27 to see what defects were marked as unremedied.  Moreover, he could not simply have missed the absent render unless he was aware that he had not done anything like a proper inspection.   </p>

He replied that he would have if it had been brought to his attention.  It plainly had been brought to his attention by the letter from Manchester Building Control.  As I have said the Live 27 records an entry for the common parts for 23 June 2009 which states: “Repaint all steelwork exposed as discussed”.  There is no evidence that this had been attended to prior to 11 December 2009 and, as I have said, the defect was not marked as rectified until September 2010.  </p>

As to the render Mr Mather would have had to visit Block E had he inspected flats 131 and 139 along with Mr Eadsforth, which I am satisfied he would have done.  In such circumstances the missing render would have been obvious to him, as he agreed in cross-examination.  The conclusion I am driven to reach is that Mr Mather was prepared to issue cover notes in circumstances where he must have known that he had not undertaken a proper check to see if these items, significant in relation to Bldg Regs and – as regards fire safety - for the safety of those occupying these flats, had been satisfactorily completed. </p>

Apart from anything else it is clear from his email of 29 January 2010, referred to below, that he was aware of the inadequate fire safety provision by that stage yet, as I am satisfied, did nothing about that other than to repeat an assurance given to him by JCS.  In my view the position is that Mr Mather was aware by this stage of the inadequate fire safety provision and that this represented non-compliance with the Bldg Regs but that a number of the flats were being occupied anyway. Despite this knowledge I am satisfied that Mr Mather yielded to pressure from JCS to issue the Bldg Regs final certificates, in circumstances where he was willing to accept their assurances that adequate fire safety provision would be made, probably using the services of a specialist fire consultancy and subject to liaison with and approval from the Fire Service, which is of course precisely what JCS was saying and doing in January 2010. It must have seemed to Mr Mather at the time as the least worst option in a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">That conclusion is reinforced by the evidence in relation to flat 126, which is a flat included in the Bldg Regs final certificate issued on 15 December 2009 where the evidence is that both at that date and as at the date of the cover note on 29 January 2010 no balcony had been fitted notwithstanding that there was a drop down from the opening French window to the ground below.  Mr Mather had given evidence that he had been prepared to sign off the flat because JCS had agreed that the door was to remain locked until the balcony was fitted.  When the prospective purchaser’s solicitor wrote to ZBG to protest about the cover note being issued in such circumstances it is clear that Mr Mather informed Mr Cairns that he had agreed to issue a cover note on the basis that JCS would retain ownership of the flat and the French doors would be locked until the balcony was fitted.  By this stage Mr Mather was, as he admitted, aware that JCS had lied to him about their intentions in relation to the flat.  Nonetheless the evidence indicates that even after this Mr Mather was prepared to support the position by referring to JCS’ assurance that a screw would be placed into the door mechanism to prevent it from being opened wide enough to allow anyone to pass through it.  It was plain from Mr Cairns’ evidence that he would not have been prepared to issue a Bldg Regs final certificate on that basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Returning to the chronology, on 15 December 2009 Mr Mather issued the first final certificate under the Bldg Regs.  Mr Mather confirmed that the Bldg Regs final certificates could not simply be printed out through Live 27 and had to be created by him in Microsoft Word format, albeit in a standard format which complied with the relevant Regulations.  This first certificate related to 115 flats.  The flats included flats 13 and 91 to 125 whereas it is common ground that in fact there were no such flats in existence.  In reality, therefore, the certificate related to only 79 flats.  Mr Mather explained that this was a simple mistake, because JCS never intended to number a flat 13 (the reason being that many prospective purchasers would not wish to buy a property numbered 13 for superstitious reasons) and because flats 91 to 125 were the intended numbers for the flats to be included within a separate block which had not at that point been constructed (and in fact never was).  I readily accept that this was a simple error which was later corrected by Mr Mather when the point was picked up by Manchester Building Control in October 2010.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">However, it is still relevant to consider how this basic and fundamental error could have been made.  By this point in time Mr Mather had inspected the development on a number of occasions within the last days and weeks, as had Mr Eadsforth.  Mr Nicholls was no longer involved and Mr Eadsforth was effectively therefore working without supervision.  If the system had been working as previously and as intended, with Mr Mather as the building control inspector relying on confirmation from an experienced building warranty surveyor that the surveyor had conducted a satisfactory stage 08 final inspection of specified flats and issued final insurance certificates in respect of those flats, then it is inconceivable that this mistake could have been made.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">I have no doubt that Mr Eadsforth, however inexperienced, would never have communicated to Mr Mather that these particular flats had been inspected and passed and final insurance certificates issued when they plainly had not.  Indeed, it is apparent that a large number of the flats included within the certificate issued on 15 December 2009 were the subject of stage 08 inspections and building warranty final certificates issued on 23 November 2009 and 11 December 2009. It follows, in my view, that if Mr Eadsforth was conducting stage 08 inspections and arranging for building warranty final certificates to be issued in relation to these particular flats at this stage it is simply not credible to consider that he could or would have done likewise in relation to what were plainly non-existent flats. Thus I have no doubt that Mr Mather could not simply have relied on information passed to him by Mr Eadsforth that specifically referred to these non-existent flats as having been inspected and certified complete for building warranty purposes.  I am also satisfied that it was not possible for Mr Mather to believe with confidence in relation to the flats covered in the December 2009 certificates that they had all been inspected by Mr Nicholls as an experienced building warranty surveyor in the run-up to 15 and 21 December 2009 who had satisfied himself that all works had been completed in accordance with ZBG’s technical manual and all defects remedied so that a final building warranty certificate had properly been issued in relation to each one. </p>

Mr Asquith relies upon this fact as showing that Mr Mather must have been looking at each flat separately before issuing the Bldg Regs final certificates, otherwise these would have been included in the 15 December 2009 certificate. This is a fair point. In my view the most likely explanation, which I accept is an inference but which accommodates the error in relation to the non-existent flats as well as this point, is that Mr Mather and Mr Eadsforth must, prior to 15 December 2009, have identified those flats which had not been signed off as complete, and Mr Mather then proceeded to issue the final certificate on 15 December 2009 in relation to all of the rest, including the non-existent flats, and was subsequently notified by Mr Eadsforth of the further specific flats which had been signed off between 15 December and 21 December (or previously signed off but, probably, just missed). </p>

By reference to the Live 27 entries for these particular flats there is nothing obvious about them recorded which indicates why they were not signed off in December 2009, when flats in the same areas in the same blocks were being signed off at that time. It cannot be said by ZBC that there was some substantive reason, such as a particular problem with the means of access which affected only these individual flats, which justified their not being signed off until later.

In his email of 29 January 2010, referred to below, Mr Mather informed Mr Timperley that he had informed JCS that it was his “intention not to issue any further completion certificates to individual apartments, both Building Regulations and Zurich Warranty, until such time that all works to the common areas, external fabric et cetera have been completed”. This statement may explain why nothing more was done until September 2010, when Mr Mather made entries in the Live 27 notes recording that the outstanding unremedied defects had been remedied, so that building warranty final certificates for these remaining flats were issued as well as common parts certificates for all of the flats, even though he did not issue the final Bldg Regs final certificate until November 2010, and then only after having “carried out a detailed audit” after having being reminded of the discrepancies in the number of flats covered by the Bldg Regs final certificates by Manchester Building Control in its letter of 22 October 2010. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">On 9 January 2010 Mr Timperley chased Mr Mather for a response to his previous email to Mr Van Schalkwyk.  He also queried whether the final certificates issued so far related only to the flats themselves or also to the associated common areas and repeated his threat to treat the building control function for the development as reverting back to Manchester Building Control in the event of not receiving a satisfactory reply. Mr Mather replied later that month on 29 January 2010, recording that he had met with JCS and the Fire Service to discuss the fire safety implications of the development and had also attended site again on that day. He stated that: “A fire risk assessment </p>

This appears to me to be an implicit acknowledgement by Mr Mather that the fire safety provision within the common areas was not acceptable. In fact, it is clear from the later evidence that no fire risk assessment had been obtained by this stage. It is clear that Mr Mather could not, therefore, have seen a fire safety assessment but was still prepared to believe what he was being told by JCS without obtaining any independent confirmation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Mr Mather also said that: “All service risers have now been inspected and remedial works completed to fire stopping etc”.  This clearly infers that either he or one of the building warranty surveyors had inspected the service risers and observed that the remedial works had been completed. That statement is not supported by any entry in the common parts section of Live 27 and is wholly inconsistent with the view of the building control experts. Nonetheless Mr Mather insisted when asked that he could only have written it if he had inspected the service risers himself or had been informed by a colleague that they had done so. I am satisfied that this cannot be true. They could not have been inspected by Mr Eadsforth, who had left ZBG by then.  There is no evidence or reason to believe that Mr Nicholls, who as I have already said I consider had effectively divested himself of responsibility for the development by this stage, would have attended on the same day as Mr Mather and, if he had, one would assume he would have entered up his inspection on Live 27.  If Mr Mather had personally inspected the service risers then he would have seen that what he was reporting was not true.  If he had negligently inspected and genuinely believed that the work had been done there would have been no reason for him not to have updated Live 27 </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Furthermore, in his letter Mr Mather said: “all final certificates issued to date relate solely to the individual flats and none of the common areas are considered to be fully complete at this stage”. However he accepted that when he had issued the previous final certificates he had done so on the basis that in his view he was satisfied that the means of escape through the common parts serving the individual flats complied with Bldg Regs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In July 2010 Mr Timperley pressed Mr Mather once again for an update in relation to the remaining flats in respect of which there was no final certificate and in relation to the common parts.  (I should observe at this point that Mr Timperley is plainly to be congratulated for his diligence and perseverance and would ask that the claimants’ solicitors convey my opinion in this respect to him if they still have his contact details from when they took witness statements from him.)  He attached a complaint which raised concerns in relation to the safety of the means of access.  Mr Mather appears to have done nothing until 10 September 2010 when entries were made in the Live 27 notes recording that the outstanding unremedied defects had been remedied and when Mr Mather issued building warranty certificates for the common parts.  However, Mr Mather’s evidence was inconsistent as to whether or not he physically attended site to satisfy himself that all outstanding matters, including the defects remaining in Live 27 and the matters raised in the July 2010 correspondence, had been remedied.  In paragraph 36 of his second witness statement he said that he did not re-inspect and relied on JCS’ assurances that all identified defects in the common areas had been rectified, whereas in evidence he suggested either that he or another surveyor had inspected and had referred to the site folder.  Given that the outstanding defects in Live 27 related </p>

I am satisfied that by this stage Mr Mather had effectively washed his hands of the development and simply wanted the problem to go away.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">It is also the case that Mr Mather signed off flats 126 -127 at a time when they still had no balcony.  Even though I accept that he may genuinely have believed that the safeguards introduced by JCS pending balcony installation meant that it was appropriate to sign off the flats, nonetheless the abject failure by JCS to provide balconies over 6 months after the problem was raised must surely have caused him concern. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In October 2010 Manchester Building Control wrote to JCS and to ZBG asking for an explanation why the final certificates referred to 132 flats when only 104 flats had been constructed. Mr Mather responded on 8 November 2010, saying that it was due to incorrect information provided to him by an unspecified “site surveyor” and enclosing an amended final certificate stating the correct number together with the further final certificate for flats 11, 23, 25, 26, 57, 58, 126 and 127.  Again, I am satisfied that he did not undertake any further inspection before issuing these certificates and, insofar as relevant, I am also satisfied that there was no basis for him to seek to blame any site surveyor for this error, which was his alone.  Again, I am satisfied that by this stage he simply wanted to do what was necessary to make the problem go away.    </p>

I am prepared to accept that he is a careful man and would have looked at the documents supplied by his solicitors.  However, I am quite satisfied that nothing about clause 11 or the reference in it to the Bldg Regs final certificate would have had any particular significance to him as a layman.  As I have already said it does not even say that a Bldg Regs final certificate has already been issued.  Nor does it say that it will be provided at any time, whether before or after exchange or completion.

If he had indeed relied on the existence of the Bldg Regs final certificate when exchanging and completing it would have been natural for him to have done so.  The most that Mr Selby could do in re-examination was to draw attention to the fact that when, in September 2012, it was (wrongly) suggested to him by Mainstay that there was no Bldg Regs final certificate he clearly regarded its absence as of importance.  But that does not assist him, given that he knew nothing about and hence could not and did not rely upon the existence of such a certificate when he did exchange and complete. </p>

Nonetheless I accept, as he said, that he still did not know the full extent of the fire safety or structural issues which are the subject of this case at this point.

Although it may be said that it is now apparent to all involved that neither the freeholder nor the management company would have been entitled to make a group claim on his behalf without his consent there is no reason to attribute that knowledge to him as at that time. Although he consulted a firm of solicitors also instructed by Ms Bedi, a firm known as Bhogal and Partners, to advise him in relation to his possible claims, it does not appear from the correspondence that he provided copies of the risk assessment reports to those solicitors, again I am satisfied on the basis that Mainstay had requested him not to pass them on. It was not until November 2012 that the solicitors wrote to “Zurich Commercial Claims” on his behalf to enquire whether or not the building warranty covered claims in relation to the unfinished state of the communal area, the insecure car park and the building not being finished to a reasonable standard. </p>

It did not, however, make any reference to the possibility that the Bldg Regs final certificate ought never to have been issued.  In February 2013, having decided to pursue an insurance claim without the further involvement of solicitors, he made a claim against ZBG under the policy, submitting a formal claim form in March 2013. This [G8/101] referred to the building as never completed to a proper manner or standard, and included fire and health and safety issues such as a lack of compartmentation.  It was dealt with by Mr Scott, who was employed by ZBG within its claims department and who instructed Cunningham Lindsey loss adjusters to investigate on its behalf and who inspected the development in April 2013.  Thereafter, Mr Tarasov’s claim appears to have proceeded in concert with the discussions involving Zagora and ZIP and Cunningham Lindsey, to which I shall refer in more detail when dealing with the alleged agreement to rectify.  For present purposes, it suffices to say that there was never any substantive response to his claim prior to the issue of the current proceedings in 2015. </p>

However, those solicitors had previously written to Ramsdens on 26 January 2009 saying that they were not instructed. Thus, on 3 March 2009 Ramsdens sent a formal notice to complete to the claimant direct, which he says led him to visit the development in April 2009, when he noticed the general lack of completion, including the lack of a lift and any electricity connection.  Having notified JCS that he was unwilling to complete in such circumstances JCS issued proceedings against him to force him to complete.  The Particulars of Claim made reference to the cover note, but not to any Bldg Regs final certificate.  In their letter to the claimant of 22 April 2009 Ramsdens asserted that he was obliged to complete because of the issue of the cover note and not because of the issue of any Bldg Regs final certificate.  The claimant then instructed new solicitors, who corresponded with Ramsdens from July 2009 onwards. No reference was made in that correspondence to any Bldg Regs final certificate. The argument which they raised appeared to be a denial that he had signed the sale contract or that he had authorised his then solicitors to do so on his behalf. The only other matters raised was a complaint about delay and a complaint that the flat had only one as opposed to two bathrooms. Ultimately, the claimant accepted advice that he had no defence and completed on flat 60 on 24 August 2009 and entered into a Tomlin order on 20 November 2009 and completed on flat 66 on 22 December 2009 without further inspection and assuming, so he said, that the development had been completed in the meantime.   </p>

Given the evidence referred to above, I am unable to accept that argument. Although passing reference was made to the fact that a Bldg Regs final certificate would be issued in the letter of January 2009, there is no evidence that this operated on the mind of anyone, not least because it was received by his former solicitors who were no longer acting for him, and there is no evidence that the claimant himself received a copy or that his litigation solicitors did so either. Moreover, there is no evidence that a copy of the Bldg Regs final certificate was ever provided to him or to his solicitors prior to completion or that he was ever advised that the issue of the Bldg Regs final certificate precluded him from defending the claim on the basis that the flat was not completed. Of course this is not surprising, since the chronology as referred to above showed that everything other than formal completion of flat 66 occurred prior to the issue of the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate anyway. As Mr Asquith said in closing, if his litigation solicitors had believed that the absence of a Bldg Regs final certificate afforded a ground for refusing to complete they would have included that as a defence to the specific performance claim, but they did not. </p>

I regret to say that Mr Gledhill, rather than admit under cross-examination that this was plainly wrong, attempted to argue his case up hill and down dale so as to seek to maintain his case against ZBC.  In particular, he appeared to suggest at times in his written and oral evidence that he had spoken to the solicitors before exchange and completion and that reference had been made to a final certificate as being outstanding but, insofar as he sought to suggest that this was a reference to a Bldg Regs final certificate or even that he had subsequently been shown or told about documents which included the Bldg Regs final certificate, I am unable to accept that evidence. In my view it is retrospective reconstruction which is not supported by any convincing contemporaneous documentary evidence or by any reliable oral evidence or, indeed, by the inherent probabilities.

Mr Syed works in the residential lettings sector and gave evidence.  The picture I must say is thoroughly confused and confusing as to why and on what basis Mr Hussain agreed to purchase the flat. It does not appear to have been his idea. One explanation has been that it was to assist his brother in law, Mr Zaidi, who is Mr Syed’s brother and who was the initial contracting party.  Another explanation has been that it was intended to provide accommodation for Mr Syed.

On 17 February 2010 Ramsdens as JCS’ solicitors sent the claimant a notice to complete.  By March 2010 Mr Syed was aware that there were unfinished works within the flat from his visits between exchange and completion.  One particularly serious problem was that there was no balcony and it was apparently possible to open the french doors and step out and fall to the external ground below, which was an obvious source of danger.  Mr Syed complained both to Manchester Building Control in what must have been February 2010.  They responded on 1 March 2010, explaining that ZBC had certified the flat and suggested he obtain a copy of the Bldg Regs certificate to confirm that it related to the same flat. They also suggested that he should consider obtaining a survey and seeking legal advice in relation to the obligation to complete.  Mr Syed said in cross-examination that he was not in a financial position to obtain a survey and JCS re-assured him that alternative fixed frame windows with opening frames would be provided to assuage his concerns.   </p>

All correspondence from Zurich tells us that the certificate was issued on the basis that your clients were going to retain ownership. Obviously we need to be certain that the certificate has been properly issued and not under some misinterpretation of your client’s intentions”. This statement, at first blush puzzling, appears to relate to the fact that as I have said in section 4 above Mr Mather said that he had initially been reassured by JCS that they were not going to sell this flat until the balcony issue had been resolved.

On 5 May 2010 their conveyancing solicitors Birchall Blackburn asked JCS’s solicitors for the buildings insurance policy and cover note but did not at this time request or obtain any Bldg Regs final certificate. There is no evidence that they were asked to or did sign the sale agreement and Mr Spadaro was clearly wrong in his witness statement when he said that he had done so. There is no evidence that they were shown or read the sale agreement prior to exchange or completion and again Mr Spadaro was clearly wrong in his witness statement insofar as it gave the impression that he had done so or that he had acquired any knowledge or opinion as to the significance of Bldg Regs approval at that time. There is no evidence whatsoever that he received a copy of the Bldg Regs final certificate prior to exchange or completion and his witness statement was particularly unhelpfully drafted insofar as it appeared to me to be equivocal as to whether he was saying that he had or had not done so. I am quite satisfied that he did not. Whilst he says, and I accept, that he relied on his conveyancing solicitors to protect his interests in relation to the acquisition of the flats, in reality that is as much as he can say.  </p>

Ideally, all the external work should be complete before the sale completion. Please give your thoughts on this based on your experience”.  Birchall Blackburn responded the following day as follows: “I was under the impression that the apartment was build complete but am yet to receive any details. As a matter of practice legal completion cannot take place until the apartment is structurally complete and fit for human habitation – a completion certificate from Zurich would be handed to me prior to completion to this effect (and this is a requirement of your mortgage lender that this is in place before completion can take place)”. </p>

I am unable to accept this argument. There is no direct evidence from the solicitors to this effect. The general information sheet dated November 2009, which Birchall Blackburn had received, did not make express reference to a Bldg Regs final certificate being provided. The sale contract was explicit that only a cover note would be provided prior to completion and made no linkage between Bldg Regs approval and completion. The claimants have been unable to demonstrate, whether by documentation from the mortgage lender or evidence from the conveyancing solicitors, that the mortgage lender required sight of a Bldg Regs final certificate before completion can take place. It appears to me to be far more likely that they were referring to the cover note as being the equivalent of confirmation of completion and that a building warranty final insurance certificate would be issued. </p>

The explanation given referred to JCS’ obligation to construct the building in accordance with the relevant planning consents and Bldg Regs, but made no reference to the impact of obtaining Bldg Regs approval upon JCS’ obligation under that clause. Although Mr Manchikalapati suggested in cross examination that he understood this to mean that a Bldg Regs certificate would be provided on completion, I am unable to accept that evidence. That is not what the sale agreement says, nor what the solicitors explained it said and, since he wrote to his solicitors asking for an explanation of clause 11, it is inherently implausible in my view that he could have reached this understanding from his own reading of it. It seems plain to me that whilst this is his belief now it was not his belief at the time and, in reality, he had no particular understanding or belief one way or another.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.59in">Whilst I accept that he did, through his previous construction of a home extension, have a general understanding of Bldg Regs and Bldg Regs approval, that is very different from his having an understanding, prior to exchange and completion, that a Bldg Regs final certificate had already been issued in relation to this development. There is no evidence from the conveyancing file that his solicitors obtained a copy of the Bldg Regs certificate before exchange or completion. Furthermore, on 18 June 2010 his solicitors wrote to him, addressing various discussions in relation to the terms of the sale agreement, to say that JCS’s solicitors had “advised that the apartment is complete and we have the Zurich cover note confirming this”. It is clear, in my view, that if Mr Manchikalapati was relying on anything at the time, it was the cover note and not any Bldg Regs certificate.   </p>

By September 2010 he was aware from discussions with his letting agents that there were continuing problems, both with the flat itself, which was suffering from various problems including external leaks from gutters, and the continuing lack of completion of the common parts. He arranged for an inspection to identify the necessary works to his flat to be carried out.  On 13 October 2010 he notified initial claims to ZIP in respect of unfinished items and to what he referred to in correspondence as “structural leaks”.  He was also concerned that the absence of lighting in the corridors and car park contravened health and safety regulations.  He says that ZIP did not accept the claim as JCS had said that it would address his complaints.  I accept that there is no evidence of his being aware more generally of structural or fire safety defects until the involvement of Zagora. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.59in">As well as pursuing a claim against ZIP they also pursue a claim against ZBC but in respect of flat 139 only. As Mr Asquith observed, the fact that they only make a claim against ZBC in respect of flat 139 is explained by the fact that they completed on flat 84 before any Bldg Regs final certificates had been issued. However, at a more fundamental level, the fact that, advised by their conveyancing solicitors, Shoosmiths, they were perfectly willing to complete on flat 84 without any such final certificate having being issued is itself wholly inconsistent with their case and Mr Creber’s evidence that he relied upon the Bldg Regs final certificate in relation to flat 139. It was quite clear to me from reading his witness statement and listening to his cross-examination, when compared with what was revealed by the contemporaneous conveyancing file, that he had no real recollection of what he was shown or what he believed at the time contracts were exchanged or when they completed. It is also clear, I am satisfied, that he was never provided with a copy of any Bldg Regs certificate prior to exchange or completion and that he had no understanding at any such time of the relevance or significance of any such certificate. He was content to leave all matters to his conveyancing solicitors. He had no knowledge as to what, if any steps, they took in relation to any such certificate. I was unable to accept his suggestion in cross-examination that he had been told by Shoosmiths that a Bldg Regs final certificate had been issued before he completed on flat 139. When he was pressed he admitted that he could not specifically recall this conversation and such suggestion has no support from the conveyancing documents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.59in">Mr Husain is an accountant and businessman who purchased flat 52 together with his wife, exchanging contracts in July 2007 and completing in August 2009. They pursue a claim only against ZIP.  In the same way as with Mr Hussain he left matters largely to Mr Syed, who is his cousin. Initially he had contracted to purchase flat 53 as well, however by 2009 was unable to finance the funds to complete on both. He introduced his business partner, a Mr Sagerwala, who agreed to purchase flat 53 for cash.  However, Mr Sagerwala was unable to make all the payments due to JCS under a loan agreement for the cash balance, so that JCS forfeited the lease and took back flat 53.  This is only relevant insofar as Mr Husain contends that as part of the settlement agreement with Mr Sagerwala JCS wrote off the loan agreement with him as well.  There is no supporting evidence of this and I reject his account on this point. </p>

She makes a claim both against ZIP and against ZBC. She is a company director and obviously intelligent and financially astute.  Not surprisingly, given her place of residence, she did not visit the development and appointed agents to deal with lettings and other matters on her behalf.

The issue of the cover note will accordingly provide confirmation of compliance with these regulations”. Her evidence that she had read and noted this at the time was inconsistent with her evidence later in her witness statement that in March 2010, when she received a report on lease and a report on contract from her conveyancing solicitors, it made reference to the insurance policy issued by Zurich, who she said she had not heard of at that time. In my judgment she is mistaken when she now claims that she can specifically remember the statement in the information sheet or that she relied upon it when deciding to purchase the property. The same is true, in my judgment, of her evidence that she read the sale agreement before exchange, since her basis for saying so initially was founded upon her assumption that she had signed the contract before exchange when, as the conveyancing file makes clear, in fact she had not done so. There is no confirmation in the conveyancing file that the sale agreement was forwarded to her by her conveyancing solicitors and no indication that any advice as to its terms, specifically any reference to the issue of any Bldg Regs final certificate, was provided </p>

I accept, however, his evidence that he regarded the issues as either issues of completion or snagging, rather than anything more serious which might justify him making a claim under the building warranty insurance policy. As with the other individual leaseholders, he became aware of the acquisition of the freehold by Freehold Managers and their subsequent appointment of Mainstay as managing agents, but I accept his evidence that he had no particular knowledge of any more serious fire safety or structural defects than was communicated to him by them. </p>

Because of this she was not willing to pay the monthly payments which she had agreed to make to JCS, who had agreed at the time of completion to a 12 month interest-free loan of £14,186 due to difficulties she was experiencing in obtaining sufficient mortgage finance. This dispute led to JCS serving a statutory demand in March 2011.  That then led to Ms Bedi bringing an action in July 2011 in which she claimed against JCS and also against Assetz and her conveyancing solicitors in relation to the incomplete state of her flat and the common areas. Ms Bedi pleaded the existence of certain defects noted in April 2011 none of which forms part of the defects in these proceedings (with the exception of the missing render).

	    <p style="margin-left:1.59in">By late 2010 Mr Dickie was in communications with JCS about his concerns in relation to the lack of completion of the development and of issues in relation to the flat itself including a broken double glazed French door. In December 2010 he gave notice to ZIP of a claim under section 2 of the policy due to the outstanding issues with the communal areas. ZIP responded, rejecting the claim, and in February 2011 Mr Dickie wrote again, contesting its response, suggesting that in some respects the Bldg Regs had not been complied with.  I accept that this assertion was made in the context of Mr Dickie seeking to advance his claim against ZIP under the insurance policy, rather than because he positively believed that the relevant building control inspector had failed to identify non-compliances with the building regulations. Nonetheless, it is apparent that if Mr Dickie had given the matter any thought at that time he would have appreciated that the effect of what he was asserting was that the development had been signed off by the building control inspector when it ought not to have been. </p>

I also accept that Mr Robinson regarded the agreed purchase price as competitive, compared to comparable prices being paid for properties with a similar ground rent income, but was also aware - as was stated in the heads of terms - that there was a dispute with CJS as the majority flat owner in relation to payment of ground rent, which would clearly have affected the value of the freehold. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.59in">It was pointed out by ZBC in closing submissions that both of these reasons only required that there be a Bldg Regs final certificate in existence, not that it gave comfort that the building control inspector had done a proper job.   I accept this argument.  However, Mr Broadhurst said that he also wanted to have the assurance that the development had received Bldg Regs approval for reassurance that it was soundly constructed and safe.  I accept this evidence.  I am also satisfied that he wanted the reassurance that the development had been constructed in accordance with Bldg Regs and thus that it was, effectively, structurally sound.  It is safe to infer that RBS would have wanted to see the certificates for this same reason as well.  Even knowing that the leases obliged the tenants to pay for any necessary repairs, and even believing that it might be profitable to undertake and manage such repairs, a prospective freeholder would not want to take the risk of having to deal with a very seriously structurally defective or unsafe building which might – as has happened in this case – represent a real risk and a time and money consuming distraction in the real world.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.59in">It is common ground that Mr Robinson visited New Lawrence House before exchange. His evidence is that this was not because he wanted to physically inspect the development before Zagora committed itself to acquiring the freehold, but because the representative of the vendor wanted to meet him there to discuss this and other opportunities. Mr Broadhurst and Mr Robinson emphasised that since they were interested in acquiring the freehold solely in order to obtain an income stream from the ground rent and since they were confident that the management company and through it the leaseholders would be responsible for any repair and maintenance works the physical condition of the buildings was of little interest to them, so that there was no need for Zagora to commission a survey nor to conduct a thorough physical inspection.  I accept this evidence, in circumstances where it is clear that Zagora did not commission a survey and nor did it ask for inspection facilities.  If Zagora had considered it essential to conduct a thorough physical inspection before committing itself to a purchase I have no doubt that Mr Broadhurst, as the more experienced surveyor, would have attended instead of or as well as Mr Robinson.  However, I also have no doubt that Mr Robinson, as an experienced property investor, would have seen the poor state of the development even from the relatively cursory inspection which I am satisfied that he did carry out.  Indeed, he accepted that he saw that the lift was not installed in the block he visited and that he saw the missing external render. </p>

I accept this evidence and reject any suggestion that Mr Robinson could have reached this conclusion solely from his inspection.  Mr Broadhurst accepted that he knew that the absence of lifts and render might well amount to a breach of the Bldg Regs, although as he said I accept that whether or not this was the case would depend on the particular circumstances, of which he was unaware until he inspected on 11 April 2013.   </p>

However, I am satisfied that they envisaged that further items of unfinished or defective work might emerge on further inspection which would increase the value of any claim there might be against ZBG and, hence, the potential revenue which that might represent to Zagora and its associated companies.  Zagora’s thinking in this respect emerges clearly from an email on 11 April 2013 from Mr Robinson to Mr Broadhurst where he referred to the claim against ZBG as potentially “huge” on the basis that “there are no doubt other things that could be deemed to be unfinished” and “if we can win a lump sum settlement with us doing the works there will be a sizeable chunk left”. What he meant, I am satisfied, was that there was the scope for Zagora or its associated companies to earn income in a number of ways, whether by Premier as the managing agents adding a percentage onto the service charge, Cobe charging a percentage for project managing the remedial works and/or the remedial works being awarded to Mr Broadhurst’s construction company. </p>

His email to the Bank of Ireland of 12 April 2013 shows that he had already identified a number of building works issues, including fire protection issues and issues with the existing roof and elevations which required further investigation which, he expected, would exceed the figure of £200,000 previously </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">There is no longer any need to refer to copious authority on the interpretation of contracts, since the relevant principles are summarised by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Wood v Capita Insurance Services Limited</span> [2017] UKSC 24 at paragraphs 8 – 15, which are already well-known and do not require citation in this judgment.  The court looks primarily at the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used.  It will have regard, to the extent which is necessary and appropriate insofar as there is any room for argument, to the context and purpose of the particular clause and the contract as a whole and to the relevant factual circumstances as known to the parties at the time (but disregarding their private intentions and their previous negotiations).  Where there remains genuine uncertainty the court will test the competing interpretations by considering their consistency with and consequences for the contract as a whole.  In conducting this exercise the court will have regard, to the extent appropriate, to its assessment of commercial common sense but should not allow its own assessment of what it thinks the parties would have intended, had they foreseen the dispute which is currently before the court, to dictate the result in cases where the meaning of the words used is clear.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In this case the process of interpretation must take into account the fact that the leases were obviously drafted by lawyers and were intended to be used for every separate lease and to regulate the position not only as between landlord and tenant but also (at least to some extent) as between each of the tenants and also (and most importantly) as between the landlord, the tenants and the management company.  In such circumstances it may be assumed as a starting point that the words used will have been carefully chosen, although it should also be accepted that the courts have wide experience of errors or contradictions in even the most sophisticated of contracts.  The process of interpretation should also take into account the fact that the freehold and the leasehold interests were also intended to be freely transferable by the landlord and the individual tenants respectively.  In such cases the need for certainty of meaning is obviously heightened.        </p>

The general principles of contract construction apply to such provisions: <span style="font-style:italic">Woodfall </span>7.163.1.  The question of what work is included within particular service charge provisions is also a question of construction although, as is well known, there is established authority as to the general approach in relation to the construction of such terms as “repair” “renewal” and “improvement” – to some of which I was referred by the claimants in their written opening submissions at [222]-[229] - and as to the limits upon the discretion of a landlord or management company to choose as between different options: <span style="font-style:italic">Woodfall </span>7.164.  The approach to the construction of clauses conferring general or sweeping-up powers will depend upon the particular terms of the lease and circumstances: <span style="font-style:italic">Woodfall </span>7.174.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In my view the most important question is whether or not LHM is obliged to undertake the works claimed for by the claimants.  For present purposes, and since these construction issues only arise if and insofar as the claimants otherwise succeed as against ZIP, the assumption must be that these are works which ought to have been undertaken by JCS to the standard necessary prior to completion of the leases in order to comply with their obligations under the Bldg Regs and/or the ZBG technical requirements, but which were not in fact undertaken to that standard.  I am not concerned with works which are required to remedy subsequently occurring disrepair, other than disrepair caused by a failure to construct to that standard from the outset – for example corrosion of unprotected steelwork or present or imminent failure of the roof due to water penetration or condensation.   </p>

Even if one has to consider that qualification it cannot be disputed that if there is a defect which is so serious as to amount to a breach of Bldg Regs and/or the ZBG technical requirements it would be appropriate to undertake the work.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Insofar as it is relevant to take into account wider considerations, there is nothing at all surprising about this conclusion.  Under the lease the tenants are only responsible for internal parts and the landlord has no obligation at all for any of the parts.  If the management company had no responsibility for the common or structural or services installations or retained parts then no-one could be compelled to ensure that they were and remained in a fit standard.  That is a result which could scarcely have been intended in the context of a 125 year lease where in the absence of such an obligation no-one could be compelled to undertake what might be the most serious and urgent of works.  The cost to the management company in such a scenario is divided equitably as between all of the tenants.  The only objection to this consequence is that on this hypothesis the landlord does not have any obligation to contribute.  However, there is nothing objectionable about this as such, since the landlord only collects a modest ground rent each year from the tenant which could scarcely be supposed to furnish it with enough to fund substantial works.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In closing submissions Mr Selby argued that a conclusion which required the management company to undertake, and thus the tenants to pay for the cost of undertaking, works to remedy the developer’s own failure to build to a proper standard could not have been intended.  However, as noted above, the landlord may or may not at any time during the 125 year duration of the lease be the original developer, so that it would be wrong to construe the lease as if the landlord was necessarily also the developer.  Moreover, even if the developer is still the landlord then it would be possible for tenants who have had to pay service charge to remedy defects for which it is legally responsible to make a claim against it for breach of the obligations assumed by the developer under the sale contract.  Whilst it is true that this would only provide a remedy within the limitation period that is unlikely to be a problem in the majority of cases in relation to initial construction defects and there is of course always the limitation extension afforded in cases of fraudulent concealment.  If, as may be the case given the particular terms of the sale contract used in this case, any such claim is barred because of the issue of the Bldg Regs final certificates, then whilst that would obviously be unfortunate it is nonetheless merely the consequence of the commercial bargain the parties have made.  In any event, in such a hypothesis if the sale contract is relevant then so is the fact that under the sale contract the developer ensures that the tenant has the benefit of building warranty insurance against structural and other serious defects.  The tenant is therefore able to make a claim under the insurance policy for his or her share of the cost.  The tenants are not left to bear the whole cost themselves.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Furthermore, it appears from a careful reading of clauses 8.2 and 8.3 that if one or more tenants do not pay their proper share of the service charge and if the management company is unable to obtain payment from the defaulting tenant(s) that the amount certified by the accountant under clause 8.3 will have to take into account any expected shortfall in recovery from other tenants with the result that the paying tenants’ obligation will be proportionately increased.  It may be assumed that the potential unfairness of this will be ameliorated by the ability either of the management company to obtain a judgment against any defaulting tenant which may be enforced by sale of the flat or of the landlord, if so required, to take enforcement action including forfeiture under clause 9.3.  Insofar as the defaulting tenant is, like CJS, in some form of insolvency procedure, that would of course normally be subject to the agreement of the insolvency officeholder or the permission of the court being obtained.   </p>

On any view such works would be “improvements” or “other works” which the management company could reasonably exercise its discretion to consider to be for the general benefit of the flats in the building.  In such circumstances the management company would plainly be entitled to recover the cost from the tenants under the service charge provisions of the lease.  In my view neither the other tenants or the landlord could <span style="text-decoration:underline">compel</span> the management company to exercise its discretion to undertake the works in such circumstances.  However, the position would be that the management company, controlled as it is by a majority of the tenants, would be entitled to decide to do so.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">It follows in my view that the management company could be compelled to perform its obligations under the leases, either by the tenant or by the landlord, and that the tenant is entitled to require the landlord to do so in default, subject always to the rights of the management company and/or the landlord to be covered against such costs.  There is also a series of perfectly workable interlocking arrangements whereby the costs can be recovered against defaulting tenants.  Of course there is always the commercial risk of one or more of the tenants being unable or unwilling to pay but: (a) the assumption must always be that tenants who have the benefit of a valuable asset are unlikely to persist in such refusal if the consequence is that the lease will either be subject to execution or to forfeiture; (b) the enforcing party can always ask the court to permit execution or forfeiture where otherwise the other tenants would be out of pocket due to the insolvent tenant’s failure to pay his or her or its own fair share of the service charge; (c) in the worst case scenario any shortfall is borne by the remaining tenants in equal shares.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.2 As I also said in section 3 at [3.4] above, once JCS successfully achieved membership status with ZBG as an approved builder in June 2007 ZBG was willing to issue building warranty policies to individual purchasers of homes within JCS’ developments.  The detail of the contractual arrangements as between JCS and ZBG have not been referred to during the course of trial.  For present purposes it suffices to say that ZBG agreed to issue policy documentation to individual purchasers as notified to it by JCS once its building warranty surveyor had inspected and confirmed that the home was completed in accordance with the requirements to be found in the ZBG technical manual.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.3 There was no pre-existing contractual relationship between ZBG and the individual purchasers thus the first document which the latter would be likely to receive was the cover note, in those cases where one was necessary, transmitted by ZBG to JCS and then sent on by Ramsdens as JCS’ </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">solicitor to the individual leaseholder’s conveyancing solicitors.  The cover notes were in standard form and identified the developer as JCS, identified the ZBG site surveyor by name, identified the development by its ZBC reference number, identified the address by reference to the individual flat number and stated the date of its issue.  There was also a space for the inspector to issue an inspection comment.    </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.4 Below these details the cover note stated: “This is confirmation that our surveyor has carried out a final inspection on the above plot and that Zurich agrees to issue the insurance certificate, provided the developer is on the Zurich directory as at the date of exchange of contracts with the first owner and full payment has been received.  This will be sent direct to the developer and to the purchaser’s solicitor / conveyancer where notified.  The cover commences from the date shown on the insurance certificate.”  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.5 The cover note did not, therefore, purport to be the insurance policy, nor did it identify the insured by name.  This of course is not surprising since completion of the individual flat would not have occurred until after the cover note had been issued.  Payment was made by JCS rather than the individual leaseholder.  Presumably it was paid by JCS from the proceeds of sale on completion, which is why the sale contracts provided and the case was that the formal insurance certificates were only sent on by Ramsdens to the individual leaseholder’s conveyancing solicitors after completion.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.6 On this development two insurance certificates were issued in respect of each flat.  The first in time for the majority of flats was headed “for new home excluding common parts” and the second was headed “for common parts only”.  The initial certificate had a note at the foot stating: “If your new home is a flat and this certificate excludes common parts, a separate certificate will be issued for the common parts. The certificate will not necessarily be issued at the same time”.  Other than these differences the two certificates were in identical terms.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.7 All of the certificates identified JCS as the developer and identified what was referred to as the “new home” by flat number and stated the name of the “buyer” of that new home.  They each had a separate unique certificate number and specified their effective date.  They also each stated: “see schedule and endorsements overleaf”.  The sample versions produced are headed “buyer copy” so that, presumably, further copies were issued to JCS as the developer.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.8 The evidence is that a certificate was issued to each of the individual leaseholders and also in relation to each of the flats where JCS subsequently granted a lease to CJS (although the latter have not been placed in evidence).  There is no suggestion or evidence that separate certificates were issued addressed to JCS in its capacity as original freeholder or to Freehold Managers when they took over the freehold or subsequently to Zagora. </p>

Part 1 was entitled “building period insurance” and is not relied upon or relevant to this case.  Part 2 was entitled “developer’s warranty” and referred to section 2 of the policy, stating the applicable excess as being “£100 indexed for each and every item of claim or £500 indexed in total”.  Part 4 was entitled “insurance cover and our responsibilities” and referred to section 3 of the policy, stating the applicable excess as being “£1,000 indexed for each and every item of claim”.  It also included a specified endorsement which stated: “New home excludes basements /semi basements unless shown for residing / sleeping purposes in plans deposited with the local planning authority before the building period certificate date”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.11 The schedule also stated that no cover applied in respect of Parts 4 (“manufacturer’s warranty”), 5 (“environmental impairment insurance”) or 6 (“additional insurance cover”) and I need make no further reference to those sections.  Part 7 was entitled “conditions” and referred to the conditions section of the standard 10 policy.  Finally, Part 8 was entitled “exclusions” and referred to the sections of the standard 10 policy identifying “what we will not pay” and to the endorsements below, of which only one is relevant which was a specific exclusion for “balcony decking”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.12 It is common ground that the “Standard 10 policy” was a reference to the document produced by ZBG and entitled “ZBG standard 10 new home structural defects insurance policy”.  This would have been sent to the individual leaseholders along with the insurance certificate in the pack sent to their conveyancing solicitors after completion.  It extended over 15 pages, beginning with an introductory page (also headed “ZBG standard 10 new home structural defects insurance policy”) and continuing with a definitions section before proceeding to set out the cover provided under sections 1 to 4, of which as I have already noted above only sections 2 and 3 are relied on and relevant to this case, before finally concluding with the conditions section.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.13 The introductory page stated that the full details of cover were to be found in the policy wording, the definitions and conditions, the certificates and any endorsements printed upon them.   It stated that the policy was an insurance contract between the buyer and ZBG, entered into by the developer on behalf of the buyer, and that the policy was not valid unless accompanied by an insurance certificate.  The introductory page also stated that the insured could only claim under the policy whilst it was the current buyer and could not make or continue a claim once it had sold or otherwise disposed of its interest in the new home.   The buyer was defined as “the person having a freehold, commonhold, leasehold or tenancy interest in the new home for the time being or any mortgagee in possession excluding the developer, builder, directors, partners, and their relatives and associated companies, and all those involved with or having an interest in the construction or sale of the new home”.  The developer was defined as “the person or company named in the certificates from whom the first buyer acquires the new home or who undertakes the work of building the new home for the buyer”.  The insurance certificate was defined as “the certificate issued by ZBG to signify acceptance of the new home for insurance under the policy [which] may be endorsed to include or exclude specified items from cover”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.14 It is clear in my view from the terms of this introductory section when read with the certificates that: (a) ZIP was issuing cover to individual buyers of individual flats pursuant to a prior agreement with and at the direction of JCS as the developer; (b) the insured was the original buyer; (c) the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">benefit of the policy would be automatically transferred to any successor in title; (d) the original buyer or any subsequent transferee would lose the benefit of the insurance or the right to make or continue a claim upon sale of the flat.  In short, only the owner of the flat for the time being was entitled to be the insured and to make or continue a claim, but there was no need for a successor in title to have a new insurance certificate. </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.1.15 It is also clear, as I have already said, that the original developer and those associated with the original developer were excluded from cover.  This would apply, as is common ground, to CJS.  There is no evidence that JCS was entitled to call for an insurance certificate to be issued to it in its capacity as freeholder.  Nor is there any evidence that ZIP would have been required to have issued an insurance certificate to a third party unconnected purchaser of the freehold interest from JCS in respect of that freehold interest. </p>

The difference, as is made clear in the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">Colinvaux </span>at paragraphs 5-057 to 5-061, is that in the former case the claimant can recover whereas in the latter case the claimant cannot: see <span style="font-style:italic">Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd v Employers Liability Assurance Corp</span> [1974] QB 57. (This point, it should be observed, is a separate and logically subsequent question to the question as to whether or not there was only one or more than one proximate cause, since if there is only one proximate cause the simple question is whether that is an insured cause or an uninsured or excluded cause: see the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance 11</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> edition</span> at 5-039 to 5-056.)   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.2.1 It is common ground that the claimants cannot recover under the policy for claims which relate solely to new homes owned by CJS or others and which do not relate to the common parts. In its written closing at [20] ZIP identifies one example, being service installations solely serving the flat in question.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.2.2 However, it also identifies the doors to the flats as another example. That seems to me to be wrong because although the external doors to the flats are not expressly identified as being within or without the demise, in contrast to the internal doors which are expressly identified as being within the demise, the walls which enclose the flat are specifically excluded and the repairing covenant in clause 7.5.1 prohibits the tenant from decorating any part of the exterior of the flat “including the exterior of the external doors of the flat”. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.2.3 Furthermore, ZIP contends that the claim for work to the compartment walls dividing the common parts from the individual flats cannot include any work to the internal sections of those walls. Again, however, that seems to me to be wrong.  As I have said the walls which enclose the flat are specifically excluded from the demise and the only items expressly included within the demise are the “linings and surface finishes including lath plaster and board of the interior of all walls”.  It appears from the information available in the Edwards reports, helpfully summarised for me by the parties after closing submissions, that between the flats and the common corridors the mode of construction (running from inside the flat outside) is a single stud wall comprising: (a) 2 layers of plasterboard; (b) wall cavity with mineral fibre quilt; (c) single timber stud with OSB, whereas between adjacent flats the mode of construction is a double stud wall comprising: (a) 2 layers of plasterboard; (b) timber studs with mineral quilt fibre between studs; (c) OSB; (d) wall cavity; (e) wall cavity.  Whilst I agree that it would appear to follow that the inner layer of plasterboard would fall within the demise, there is nothing to prevent the necessary remedial work being undertaken to the external layer of plasterboard and/or to the OSB on the common corridor.  If, as ZIP contend, the remedial works have been built up and costed on the basis that the works will be undertaken to the inner linings, there is no basis for thinking: (a) that the works cannot be done leaving the inner layer unaffected and, if so: (b) that the cost will be any less.  Given that these works are undoubtedly necessary in order to ensure that the present or imminent danger to occupants of all flats (not just CJS flats) is maintained so that occupants can safely exit via the common corridors forming the means of escape, there is no reason to proceed on the assumption that CJS could effectively frustrate these remedial works or that ZIP could avoid liability to pay for them.      </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.2.4 ZIP also appears to contend that in any event it would not be required to make good the internal sections of those walls, insofar as they relate to CJS flats.  I am satisfied that this argument is unsustainable. It seems to me to be necessarily implicit in the cover provided by the policy that making good is included unless specifically excluded. That is particularly so where the lease requires making good where access is required to other flats to undertake remedial works.  The only specific exclusion which ZIP might otherwise rely upon is that excluding “reinstatement of any areas not directly affected by physical damage or major physical damage”.  However, I am satisfied that this cannot apply to making good works to areas which are directly affected in that they have to be removed to allow remedial works to be undertaken.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.2.5 It follows, I am satisfied, that the premise to the contention at [22] of ZIP’s written closing that the claimants can recover nothing in respect of work to the compartment walls, because the work claimed for includes work which they are not entitled to recover, is not made out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.2.6 In its opening submissions ZIP also appeared to argue that the works relating to the ceilings and floors, such as the provision of missing insulation above the fourth floor flats and the provision of effective fire stopping of the services installations passing through from CJS flats down to the basements was not covered.  However it is plain that the floors and ceilings other than the surface finishes do not form part of the demise and, for the same reasons as given above in relation to the compartment walls, I reject these arguments. </p>

The first element seems to me to be a straightforward question of fact in each case and does not present any difficulty of interpretation.  The second is more contentious.  For forensic reasons both the claimants and ZIP have advanced arguments which may at first blush appear adverse to their respective cases.  However both agree, rightly in my judgment, that joint responsibility includes indirect financial responsibility under the service charge provisions of the lease.  Whilst it is true that the policy does not refer expressly to such provisions, it is inconceivable in my view that a policy such as this, specifically intended to include blocks of flats (see for example the definition of “continuous structures”), would not have been drafted bearing in mind that individual flat-owners are more likely to have indirect financial responsibility for common parts under such service charge provisions than direct responsibility.  That is obviously consistent with the exclusion of any sum above the proportionate share of the reasonable cost of repairing major physical damage to common parts.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.3.2 Thus the debate has turned more upon the application of this provision to the particular terms of the lease, to which I have already referred above.  Given my conclusions above as to the width of the management company’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">obligations</span> and given also (and separately) my conclusions as to the width of the management company’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">discretion</span> in relation to undertaking works to address the defects complained of in this case, even if they do not fall within the scope of its obligations, in my view it is plain that all of the relevant parts of the development which are not within the individual flats in respect of which claims are made in this action fall within the definition of common parts under the insurance policy.  For the avoidance of doubt, this applies not only to the common parts as defined under the leases but also to the structural parts and the retained parts insofar as on a proper construction of the leases some or all of them are outside the lease definition of common parts – that being because there is no reason to treat the definition of common parts under the policy as necessarily equating to what may be a more restrictive definition of common parts under a particular lease of a particular block of flats. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.4.1 There is a debate between the parties as to the meaning of the phrase “load bearing element”.  A number of possibilities have been advanced.  The most restrictive definition is that it only applies where the element bears the load of another element of the new home.  The intermediate position is that it is sufficient if it bears any load, including loads imposed by the elements or by the occupants.  The most expansive definition is that it is sufficient if it merely bears its own load.  I am satisfied that the intermediate position is the correct one, so that in principle a load bearing element is an element which bears the load of another element of the new home or a load imposed by the elements or by the occupants but not one which bears solely its own load.  As a matter of language, an element bears a load if it bears a load imposed from another element but also if it bears a load which may be transient, caused by the elements such as wind, water or snow, or by occupants of the building, so long as it is designed to bear such loads.  In contrast, the most expansive definition would deprive the words in question of any real significance, in circumstances where it is plain from a comparison of the definition of major physical damage and the definition of physical damage that they were intended to have effect.  It is a matter of fact and degree whether or not the </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.4.2 In its written closing submissions ZIP also contends at [65] that an element which simply transfers load from one element to another element is not a load bearing element.  I disagree.  It is important to construe the words in their context. As I have said, the definition of major physical damage: is “a material difference in the physical condition of <span style="font-style:italic">a load bearing element</span> of the new home from its intended physical condition <span style="font-style:italic">which adversely affects its structural stability or resistance to damp and water penetration</span>” (emphasis added). In contrast, the definition of physical damage is “a material difference in the physical condition of the new home from its intended physical condition”. It follows in my view that if the effect of structural instability or lack of resistance to damp and water penetration of the element in question has no impact on anything other than the element itself it is unlikely that the element could be regarded as load-bearing. By contrast, if the effect of structural instability or lack of resistance to damp and water penetration of the element in question does impact on the structure of the new home, then the element is likely to be regarded as loadbearing. Analysed in this way, structural instability of or damp or water penetration to an element which transfers load is just as serious as structural instability of or damp or water penetration to an element which bears load, since if it cannot safely transfer the load then the element imposing the load which it is intended to transfer is at risk.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.4.3 I derive some support for this construction from the Zurich technical requirements, which is clearly a relevant constructional tool because it is referred to in clause 3.1 which provides the cover for major physical damage, and which states, in the context of steel frames at p.204, that: “load bearing walls should be designed to support and transfer loads to foundations safely and without undue movement” and that “suspended floors should be designed to support and transmit loads safely to the supporting structure without undue deflection”. The transfer and transmission of loads are clearly regarded as important functions for load bearing walls and suspended floors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.4.4 Moreover, as the claimants submit, it is also important not to seek to subdivide individual parts of one composite element in an artificial and strained manner in order to seek to deny cover on the basis that the particular part is not, viewed in isolation, a load bearing element. This issue arises in particular in relation to the roof and I shall discuss the application of the definition to the particular parts of the structure at the appropriate part of the judgment, since it is a fact specific question which can only be determined on the particular facts of the particular question where it arises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.5.1 There is a debate between the parties as to whether the definition applies to what may colloquially be described as design defects.  This debate is of particular significance to the cold roof construction of the blocks, where ZIP contends that the roof was designed to have a cold roof construction even though its own experts agree that it was wholly inappropriate to do so in the way in which it has been designed and/or constructed in this case, namely as an unventilated cold deck.  The question is whether there is cover where the element is in its intended physical condition, even though that intended condition arises from defective design or a defective construction process which is contrary to the ZBG requirements and which adversely affects its structural ability or resistance to damp or water penetration.  ZIP argues that there is no cover in such circumstances whereas the claimants argue that there is cover.   </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.5.2 In my judgment the claimants are right on this point.  If the scope of the cover under section 3 is read as a whole it applies where there is a material difference in the physical condition of a load bearing element of the new home from its intended physical condition, which adversely affects its structural stability or resistance to damp and water penetration <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> which is caused by the developer’s failure to comply with ZBG’s requirements in the construction of the new home.  A failure to comply with ZBG’s requirements due to design errors is not excluded.  It can be seen from a cursory reading of the ZBG technical manual that it includes design obligations as much as it does construction obligations.  One sees, for example, page 268 dealing with flat roofs which makes it clear that flat roofs should be designed as either warm deck roofs or ventilated cold deck roofs.  ZIP cannot sensibly argue in my judgment that on an objective interpretation of the policy there would be no cover if that specific design obligation was not complied with.  It seems to me that the intended physical condition is the condition which, considered objectively, complies with the ZBG requirements.  It is the material difference between that intended physical condition and the actual condition which has been caused by the failure to comply with the requirements which triggers the cover.  I do not accept that there is no cover where there is the intentional adoption of a defective design mode or a defective construction mode which, judged objectively, would produce a physical condition which was contrary to the ZBG requirements.  In my view the intended physical condition must be the physical condition which was intended to result from compliance with the ZBG requirements.   </p>

On ZIP’s construction there would be no cover if a developer built, deliberately, to a design which he knew would breach the ZBG technical requirements and would make the building structurally unsafe.  I am surprised, frankly, that ZIP felt it appropriate to argue for such a construction.  I very much doubt that it would have done so had it still been offering these policies to the market.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.6.2 In my view this is a classic case where the ordinary and natural meaning of the language used directs the result.  A present danger is one which is actually occurring at the time in question, even if it is not known about.  An example would be if the supports of a tread in a fire escape staircase had so decayed that the tread was liable to collapse if used by occupants evacuating the building.  An imminent danger is one which is not present but which requires something else to happen which can properly be said to be imminently about to happen.  An example would be if the supports of the tread in the above example had almost but not quite decayed so that at some stage in the near future the tread was liable to collapse.   In contrast, if the supports of the tread were liable to decay due to, for example, damp conditions within the staircase, but had not actually decayed to the point where it could be said that there was any imminent danger of collapse, that would not fall within the scope of the cover.  </p>

The claimants can only succeed if they can show that during the lifetime of the cover provided by section 3, i.e. within years 3 to 10 inclusive of the effective date, there is a present or imminent danger which entitles them to make a claim.  </p>

In my judgment those words are present in the clause to make it clear, as I have said, that dangers which may be present or imminent at some time in the future but which are neither present nor imminent as at the current time are not covered. Once, however, a danger is present or imminent then it is the reasonable cost of rectifying that danger which is covered, rather than the reasonable cost of temporary measures so that the danger is, whilst those temporary measures continue, neither present nor imminent. Whilst of course it will be a question of fact in any individual case whether or not the measures proposed satisfy the requirements of the section, in my view the starting point is that the measures proposed ought to be measures which ensure that the relevant part or parts of the building comply with the applicable Bldg Regs. </p>

In section 2 - the measure of indemnity, a distinction is drawn between valued and unvalued policies. This is of course an unvalued policy.  In relation to such policies, the overriding principle of indemnity is stated at [11-025] to be that the insured is entitled to be indemnified for his loss and no more. However, at [11-026] it is said that “unless an option to reinstate has been exercised, the insurers are required to make a money payment to the assured and the assured is entitled to use the monies as he thinks fit even though he has been indemnified on a reinstatement basis”. It is noted at [11-027] that there are frequently clear words in an insurance policy which identify the measure of indemnity, such as by reference to reinstatement or repair costs. In an Australian case there cited, an argument by the insurers that there was an overarching rule that the assured was to be held to the difference between the market value of the property before the casualty and its market value after the casualty was rejected. It is said at [11-028] that in the absence of any policy terms which fix the measure of indemnity, the guiding indemnity principle is to be satisfied by reference to the nature of the loss in the value of the damaged property to the assured immediately before the loss.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">“… the assured may be entitled to recover an indemnity based on the cost of reinstatement even though reinstatement is never actually effected. That will be the case where the policy provides that the assured or the insurer, as the case may be, opts for indemnity on a reinstatement measure or where reinstatement is not possible.  If the policy merely provides for reinstatement without any alternative, it is difficult to see why impossibility should affect the insurers’ obligation to indemnify the assured on a reinstatement basis: the loss is assessed by reference to the position immediately before the occurrence of the insured peril, the obligation to pay is divorced from what actually happens to the insurance monies and the obligation on the insurers to pay the insurance proceeds cannot be regarded as frustrated in any way. The point arose in <span style="font-style:italic">Anderson v Commercial Union Assurance Co</span> (1885) 55 LJQB 146, the problem in that case being planning restrictions on reinstatement. The Court of Appeal held that, given the impossibility of reinstatement, the proper approach was to construe the contract between the parties to determine whether the insurer was discharged from all liability or whether its liability reverted to payment. The court had little hesitation in holding that the latter was the proper construction. Thus, subject to the terms of the policy, the insurer will be liable on a cost of reinstatement basis even where actual reinstatement is no longer possible, as for instance where the damaged premises have been sold, or where town planning restrictions prevent rebuilding, in which case the cost is assessed on a notional reinstatement basis.” </p>

In that case, which concerned a claim made by an insured against the NHBC under a previous settlement agreement (under which, according to the claimant, the NHBC had agreed to deal with a claim brought against it under the NHBC insurance policy on its merits), she had to address a submission  by the NHBC that the claim should be struck out on its Part 24 summary judgment application because, after the settlement agreement had been entered into, the claimant had sold the property and, hence, could not now undertake any remedial works.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.8.3 The second issue which arises is how this exclusion applies in the case of physical damage or major physical damage claims. The definitions of physical damage and of major physical damage necessarily involve that either some element of the new home in the former case or some loadbearing element of the new home in the latter case are materially different from their intended physical condition and that the insured is entitled to the reasonable cost of rectifying or repairing that element. In the absence of this exclusion it is clear, for the same reason as given above, that the reasonable cost would include the cost of making good to areas disturbed in order to gain access to the element which needs to be worked upon. The question is whether this exclusion is properly to be construed as meaning that the insurer is not liable for such making good. In my view it cannot credibly be contended that it should be construed as having such effect. In my view an area is directly affected if it has to be removed to allow access to the element in order to rectify or repair that element and, therefore, the exclusion does not operate to permit the insurer to require the insured to pay for the cost of making good. </p>

It makes obvious sense that an individual flat-owner should be entitled to have a present or imminent danger to the physical health and safety of the occupants of the flat rectified where it relates to the common parts without running the risk that s/he will be unable to fund those works because not all of the affected flat-owners are also insured or ready, able or willing to make a claim. </p>

I was provided with a schedule showing that the total purchase price paid for all of the flats was only £10,846,076.65 so that, if the claimants are right, this would be the maximum liability on any one of their claims.

The purpose of the proviso, therefore, must be to limit the total value of all claims made in relation to any one continuous structure to £25 million, even if the combined value of all of the new homes within that continuous structure exceeded £25 million and therefore, on a straightforward application of (b), the total claim could exceed £25 million.   </p>

Their argument is that where a new home is part of a continuous structure there is a clear separation in the policy as between the new home itself and the common parts. Their argument is that the proviso, by referring separately to claims in relation to the new homes and claims in relation to the continuous structure, expressly acknowledges that claims in relation to the continuous structure, which they say can only be claims in relation to the common parts, are separate and distinct from claims in relation to the new homes themselves.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.11.10 This is an ingenious argument, but in response, ZIP reminds me that the definition of the new home specifically includes the common parts. In other words, the common parts are not treated separately in the policy from the new home.  They say that in the face of this clear definition it cannot credibly be argued that a separate approach should be adopted in relation to the construction of sub-clause (b) simply through a side-wind in the proviso.  This is a powerful argument which, in my judgment, must prevail unless it can be said to be plain and obvious that clause (b) when construed with the proviso can only have the effect for which the claimant contends.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.11.11 It cannot be said, in my view, that clause (b) when construed with the proviso does have that clear and unambiguous meaning.  Indeed if one considers the definition of a continuous structure it is obviously not the same as the common parts.  It is either a single building containing more than one new home (where the definition of each new home includes the common parts) or a single building containing a new home and other parts of the building used for other purposes.  On either analysis the reference to continuous structures in the provision cannot be read as if it meant common parts.  It seems to me that the more likely reason why the proviso makes express reference to continuous structure is to make it clear that it covers any other parts of a building not falling within the definition of new home. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.11.12 I am aware that it may be said that – depending on my findings in relation to the insurance claim below –this limitation will operate harshly upon the claimants.  If the actual cost of remedial works is say £10 million but they can only recover say one third of that then that is a real problem for them.  That of course is a matter of concern.  However, it must be borne in mind that the principal reason for the problem in this case, namely the fact that some two thirds of the flats were sold to and have been retained by an entity and by individuals connected with the developer who are, therefore, unable to make their own claim under a policy, is not one which would have been foreseen as particularly likely nor of course is it the fault of ZIP in any way.  To the contrary, it does not seem to me to be obviously unreasonable for ZIP to wish to limit its cover for what was a 10 year policy for a one-off premium to the original purchase price, even if it did include cover for the common parts.  That is so even though, as Mr Selby reminded me in closing submissions, condition 10(c) provides that the policy terminates automatically once the maximum liability has been paid.       </p>

In relation to the leases it contends that the claimants (both the individual leaseholders and Zagora) have the right under the leases to require LHM to undertake the necessary works, that the individual leaseholders have the right under the leases to require Zagora to do so, and that all have the right to seek a contribution from CJS and the other non-claimant leaseholders.

I agree.  In my view the words must be construed by reference to the whole of the clause, which provides that ZIP does not have to pay “any claim or contribution to a claim where cover is available under another insurance policy or where some other form of compensation or damages is available to you”.  This must mean a claim to compensation or damages which is substantially the same as the cover available under the policy.  It cannot extend to a claim to enforce a right to contribution under the provisions of the lease, which is neither “compensation” nor “damages” nor is it some other form of compensation or damage of the same character as cover under another insurance policy.   </p>

In my view it is proper to interpret this provision narrowly, since it operates not simply to reduce the claim against ZIP by reference to what the insured has in fact already recovered from the other source or, for example, to require the insured to take reasonable steps to obtain monies from that other source and to give credit for any recoveries secured, but to prevent the insured from bringing any claim at all where that other source is available. </p>

Leaving aside the prior point that in my view the proper interpretation of the clause would not cover such a claim, in my view it could in any event only apply in circumstances where it can be said that it would be reasonable for someone in the position of the claimants to make such a claim instead of claiming under the insurance policy. That is because if I am wrong in my prior analysis the word “available” must connote that a reasonable assured ought, on an objective analysis, to make such a claim on the basis that it would succeed and that he or she would recover compensation or damages.  That is particularly so since of course not only is there no provision for ZIP to fund any such claim but nor would the costs be covered under the policy if the claim was made but proved unsuccessful for any reason. In contrast, condition 3 of the policy entitles ZIP to “take proceedings at our own expense but in your name to secure compensation from any third party in respect of any claim accepted by us under this policy”.  </p>

It follows that it would be necessary for an individual tenant or for LHM or for Zagora to seek and obtain the agreement of the administrators to make a claim, failing which the permission of the court to bring proceedings against CJS would have to be obtained. ZIP contends that there is no good reason why an administrator should not agree or why any court should not give permission, in circumstances where the administrators have the benefit of these flats and ought to pay their fair share of the liabilities to which all flat-owners are subject. ZIP also contends that there is every reason to believe that the administrators would meet CJS’ liability, in circumstances where if they did not do so it would be open to the claimants to enforce the liability by obtaining charging orders on the flats and selling them. As against this the claimants contend that given the hurdles which they would have to surmount and the risks they would have to take, all at their expense, any claim to compensation against CJS is not, in all of the circumstances, something which is reasonably available to them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.12.7 These points made by the claimants are compelling and I accept and prefer them.  What ZIP would effectively be requiring the claimants to do is either to fund two thirds of the cost of undertaking works to remedy a present or imminent danger and then to seek by litigation to compel the administrators to pay their share or to defer undertaking such works until it has obtained the funds from the administrators up front.  Unless the Bank was prepared to put the administrators in funds, which can by no means be guaranteed, the only way in which the funds could be provided would be by voluntary sale of the flats or the claimants also being permitted to enforce by forfeiture or possession and sale.  There can be no guarantee that the court would sanction this.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.12.8 In my view where, as I accept, there is reasonable doubt as to the availability of a realistic remedy against CJS, the tenants ought to be entitled to recover under the insurance policy in full on the basis that ZIP has its own express subrogation rights against CJS in any event.  Mr Baatz invited me to clarify whether or not these findings also apply to the rights which the individual leaseholders have under the lease as against LHM (as management company) and/or Zagora (as landlord).  I can confirm that they do on the basis that on my analysis of the leases the fundamental problem from a commercial perspective is that there is no basis for enforcing these liabilities unless or until either it could be said that LHM or Zagora could or should have obtained a recovery from CJS of its proportionate share or that the individual leaseholders should have advance funded that proportionate share in the hope or expectation that LHM or Zagora could then have recovered from CJS and refunded them.  For the same reasons I reject any argument that the individual leaseholders have failed to act reasonably to mitigate their loss.  I am not satisfied that ZIP has identified or put a case to each of the individual leaseholders and to Zagora which I am able to accept that, on a true analysis of the terms of the leases and by reference to the financial and other positions of those parties as well as LHM and CJS at the relevant times, either that it would realistically have been possible for CJS’ share of the costs of the<span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span>works to have been recovered from CJS or from LHM or Zagora in default or that the individual leaseholders acted unreasonably in not following these routes to recovery instead of pursuing their claims against ZIP.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">proper to conclude that any claim under the present or imminent danger section ought to be reduced on the basis of this clause.  Furthermore, and even if I was wrong about that,  there is an exclusion under the policy for any reduction in value of the new home and it is difficult to see, therefore, how a claim against ZBC for precisely that relief could be “some other form of compensation or damage” in respect of a claim against ZIP under the insurance policy for the reasonable cost of rectifying a present or imminent danger to the physical health and safety to the occupants.  Finally, the outcome of the claim against ZBC in this case provides a good reminder of the dangers of construing this clause as ZIP contend.  On ZIP’s analysis the claim against it should fail by reference to this exclusion or limitation, even though in fact the claim against ZBC has failed.  That would appear to be an extremely harsh and unreasonable outcome. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.13.1 The definition of the new home makes it clear that it does not include basements and semibasements.  Whilst the car park is not a fully enclosed basement, and is open sided on one side at least, described by one of the valuers as an undercroft, it is plainly a semi-basement.  Although the claimants say that it also falls within the definition of an attached or integral garage, it does not seem to me that the car parking spaces in the basement could possibly fall within that definition.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.13.2 It follows that the real question is what happens where, as here, the basement, which is expressly included, forms part of the common parts, which are expressly included: does the inclusion or the exclusion apply?  The general rule is that where an event is within the general cover but also within the exclusion from cover it is not covered.  However, that general rule is inapplicable here where, as a matter of construction, the common parts fall within a list of positive inclusions rather than a statement of general cover.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.13.3 In my view the inclusion prevails over the exclusion.  That is because if it had been intended that, in a common parts case, basements should nonetheless be excluded it should have been expressly so provided.  The two are not mutually exclusive and it cannot be said from the wording that it is plain and obvious that the basement exclusion prevails over the common parts exclusion.  Apart from anything else it would be wholly unsatisfactory if there was no cover for major physical damage or present or imminent danger where a defect in a basement was a real danger not just to those using the basement for common purposes but also to the safety of occupants of the flats above.       </p>

The same is true in relation to the exclusion for wear and tear, neglect, lack of maintenance scratching, chipping, staining, fading, efflorescence, changes in colour, opacity or texture. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.1 It is common ground that the balconies themselves are not excluded from cover whereas, as provided in the endorsements to the insurance certificates, the balcony decking is specifically excluded. However, there is a dispute as to whether, as ZIP contends, the balconies form part of the demise of the flats and do not fall within the common parts or whether, as the claimants contend, they do not form part of the demise and fall within the common parts. The dispute is material in that if ZIP is right then it is clear that the individual leaseholders can only recover in relation to the cost of rectifying the balconies which form part of their flats and, accordingly, cannot recover in relation to the cost of rectifying the balconies which form part of the CJS or other non-claimant flats. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.2 The starting point is the terms of the leases. The flats are defined “as described in part 1 of the first schedule and shown edged red on plan 2”.  As the claimants submit, plan 2 clearly does not include the balconies as being within the property edged red. Nor does the balcony feature in the list of items specifically included in part 1 of schedule 1.  Moreover, as the claimants submit, the definition of the structural parts includes the exterior of the building and the exterior glazing and exterior doors, door frames and window frames, so that it would be anomalous if the balconies fell outside of that definition. This is also consistent with the repairing obligations imposed upon the tenant under clause 7.5.1, which specifically prevents the tenant from decorating “any part of the exterior of the flat including the exterior of the external doors of the flat”.   </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.3 However the question arises that if the balcony is not included in the demise of the lease then how does the tenant have the right to use the balcony.  The answer it seems to me appears from part two of the first schedule to the lease, in which the tenant is granted the right, subject to and conditional upon paying the service charge, of “(5) all other rights easements quasi rights and quasi easements as are now enjoyed by the flat in respect of any other part of the development”.  Given that the individual balconies can only be accessed through the individual flats to which they relate it appears to me that they fall within this wide clause.  </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.4 It also follows, in my view, that the balconies are included within the repairing obligation imposed upon the management company in respect of the retained parts under clause 8.6 of the lease, as well as the repairing obligation in respect of the services under clause 8.1 of and the second schedule to the lease. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.5 However ZIP submits that even though on this analysis the balconies fall within the definition of the common parts under the leases they do not fall within the definition of the common parts under the insurance policy.  Mr Baatz submits that to fall within the definition they must fall within the first part of the definition, namely “those parts of a multi-ownership building for a common or general use”, as well as the second part, namely “for which the buyer has joint responsibility together with other buyers or lessors”.  Mr Selby submits that it is sufficient if they are for a common use or for a general use.  He submits that where, as here, the balconies are not within the demise of the flats and where: (a) the other tenants have rights under part 2 of schedule 1 of way and entry in relation to the balconies of the other flats for the specific purposes stated therein; (b) the landlord also has a right of way for all reasonable purposes in relation to the balconies of the other flats; (c) the management company has an obligation to undertake repairs etc in relation to the balconies and the right under clause 7.8 to access the balconies through the flat to do so, those rights are sufficient to bring the balconies within the common or general use requirement.   </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.6 I agree with Mr Selby.  It is clear from the express exclusion in relation to balcony decking that it was envisaged that balconies were intended to be covered.  It is also clear that the policy does not expressly provide the answer to the question – what if there are parts of a multi-ownership building which are intended to be used for the enjoyment of the individual flat-owner but which are outside the demise and within the common parts under the lease and in respect of which the other tenants and through them the management company have repairing obligations and rights?  In my view it cannot, objectively, have been intended that these parts would fall outside the policy as being neither part of the new flat as a demise or part of the common parts.  The words “common or general use” are wide words which do not require that the use must be for the purposes of sole occupation or enjoyment and in my view use as being part of the structure and common parts in respect of which there are common or general repairing and ancillary access obligations is sufficient.      </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.14.7 On that basis, it seems to me that insofar as the claimants are able to make a claim in relation to the balconies under the present or imminent danger cover provided by the policy, they are able to recover the full cost of rectifying that danger without the proportional share limitation applying. It also follows, however, that insofar as the claimants are only able to make a claim in relation to the balconies under the physical damage or major physical damage cover provided by the policy, the proportional share limitation will apply to that claim, which effectively produces the same result in relation to such claims as ZIP contended for, albeit for different reasons. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.15.1 In relation to some items of claim, in particular the roof and walls, the claimants’ complaint is that the primary consequence of the unventilated cold roof design and construction is that condensation has formed within the structure which has led to deterioration of and damage to the structure.  ZIP contends that such claims are excluded by the condensation exception.  In their opening submissions at paragraphs [158] – [165] the claimants advanced a number of reasons why this exclusion would not apply in a case where otherwise the claim would fall within the major physical damage or the present or imminent danger cover afforded by the policy. In summary, the argument is that if the presence of condensation is itself the cause of physical damage, major physical damage or present or imminent danger, and is itself the consequence of the developer’s failure to comply with the ZBG requirements or the Bldg Regs, then the presence of condensation in itself is not the proximate cause of the damage and, hence, the condensation exclusion does not apply. It is said that the condensation exception only applies to condensation which occurs other than due to the developer’s failure to comply with the ZBG requirements or the Bldg Regs and, thus, either to naturally occurring condensation or to condensation due to the occupant’s lifestyle.   </p>

The result of this combination of circumstances was that the fracture opened up a significant period of time before the end of the natural life of this ship.

The loss could not, in such a case, have been proximately caused by ordinary wear and tear. It is not like a case where a ship's plating simply wastes away through rust, or a ship sinks through general debility.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.15.3 In this case, therefore, the claimants say that by parity of reasoning the proximate cause of the loss is not the mere presence of condensation, rather the effect that the condensation has upon the physical condition of the roof, itself caused by a breach of the requirements or regulations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.15.4 In contrast, ZIP contends that even if the claim would otherwise fall within the scope of the cover, any such claim is clearly excluded where it falls within the scope of the condensation exception. In support of its argument ZIP referred at [70] of its written closing submissions to its internal claims handling document, but it seems to me that this is plainly irrelevant to the proper construction of the insurance policy. In contrast, the ZBG technical requirements, being referred to specifically in the policy, clearly fall within the factual matrix and thus at least of potential relevance to the proper construction of the policy. They make a number of references to the need to design and construct the building in order to address the risks of condensation.  It would, therefore, be surprising if a failure to comply with the ZBG requirements in such a way as to lead to condensation and to the major physical damage or present or imminent danger cover being triggered should then be excepted, but of course if the policy on its proper construction leads inexorably to that result then that result must follow, however surprising. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.15.5 I prefer and accept the claimants’ case in this respect and am satisfied that in such cases the condensation exclusion does not apply. In my view this is because whether one considers this case as being one of proximate cause or concurrent causes the position is that the failure by the developer to construct the building in accordance with the ZBG requirements or the Bldg Regs is either the proximate cause or at the very least a concurrent cause of the loss.  It is the proximate cause because without the failure by the developer it would not have happened.  It is the concurrent cause because even if one takes the view that the condensation itself is also a proximate cause, again without the failure by the developer the loss would not have happened.  Furthermore, upon a proper construction of the policy the condensation exception is not an exclusion, but simply an uninsured cause, whereas the major physical damage and present or imminent danger items are insured causes.  Therefore, the loss is covered.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.16.2 It follows, contends ZIP, that in relation to every separate “item of claim” under section 3 the £1,000 indexed excess applies.  There is no separate definition in the policy either of “claim” or “item of claim”. ZIP’s primary position is that each separate item of each of the Scott schedules is a separate item of claim to which a separate excess applies. ZIP also contends that the excess must be applied to each of the separate claimants in respect of each separate item of the Scott schedules.  It follows, as can readily be seen, that if these arguments succeed the effect is very substantially to reduce the amount which it is liable to pay.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.16.3 In contrast, the claimants submit in their written closing submissions at [384] that since each claimant is entitled to claim the entire cost of rectifying each defect, each claimant is jointly and severally entitled to judgment for the full remedial works cost claimed, with the result that each defect should be the subject of a single excess and not to multiple excesses by reference to the number of claimants. They make clear that this applies only to the common parts claims and accept - see [384.7] - that individual claims relating to individual flats are subject to a single excess per flat. They also submit that a more global view should be taken as to what are individual items of claim, so that the claim in Scott Schedule A, relating to the defective roof, is one item of claim, rather than a series of separate items of claim. On this analysis, they contend that there are only 13 separate items of claim relating to the common parts. They go on to submit that even in relation to these 13 items, if one claim is subsumed by another claim, or falls away as a result of the findings made in relation to another claim, then no excess applies in relation to those claims. Their case, if successful in relation to the key defects for which they contend, is that only 9 excesses would be applicable. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">7.16.4 In my view there is a difficulty with the claimants’ analysis in relation to the application of excess to the common parts claims insofar as they are major physical damage claims, where there is a proportionate share reduction. Since each claimant is entitled to recover no more than his or her proportionate share of such claims it must follow that each claimant has a separate claim from the others. Since each policy is a separate contract between ZIP and the individual claimant it does not seem to me to be possible to say that there is a joint and several liability in relation to the proportionate share claims. It follows that the excess must apply to each claimant separately.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">17.16.5 So far as the present or imminent danger claims are concerned I have already decided that the proportionate share reduction does not apply. On the face of it, therefore, each individual claimant is entitled to recover the reasonable cost of rectifying those dangers in full against ZIP. Strictly speaking, it seems to me that ZIP has a several, as opposed to a joint and several, liability to each claimant for the full cost of each claim item but, of course, ZIP cannot be liable for more than the full cost. It follows, it seems to me, that if ZIP is able to limit its overall liability to the amount of any one individual claimant’s claim, it cannot be entitled to claim to have the benefit of more than one excess.  In relation to present or imminent danger claims, therefore, I accept the claimants’ argument. </p>

Where for example the element is the continuous roof or the continuous external walls then that is one item of claim even where it could be said that separate areas of the roof or the walls are affected by the same failure.

Given that this is a contractual claim under an insurance policy where, as I have held, the insured is contractually entitled to the cost of reasonable reinstatement there is no basis for bringing in by analogy the principles developed in claims in tort or insurance claims where the insured was not contractually entitled to indemnity based on rectification.   </p>

Moreover, I do not consider that it would be safe to make any critical finding of fact based on the evidence either of Mr Broadhurst or Mr Parvin, since I do not consider that either were convincingly reliable as to the detail of what was said or agreed at the various meetings, specifically that of 27 June 2013.  Neither Mr Troth of Arup nor Mr Brown of Thomasons were able to give relevant evidence, since it is common ground that nothing of importance was said at the second part of the meeting of 27 June 2013 at which they were present, as is revealed by Mr Troth’s contemporary note.  The key contemporaneous document is the letter from David Robinson written on 2 July 2013 after the 27 June meeting.  In the circumstances I can make the relevant factual findings of fact relatively shortly and without needing to refer to and record each and every exchange which took place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.3 In that letter Cobe introduced itself as writing on behalf of the “freeholder and individual tenants” of the building. In cross-examination Mr Broadhurst explained that he believed that Zagora had authority to make claims on behalf of all of the individual leaseholders given his belief that it was acting as the management company.  He rightly accepted that he did not have express authorisation from all of the individual leaseholders to advance claims on their behalf under their policies with ZIP. The most that he could say was that he subsequently updated all of the individual leaseholders as to what he was doing and none expressly objected. He also said that as the claim developed it altered from one being made on behalf of the freeholder and the individual leaseholders to one being made solely by Zagora. This point is well made.  It is clear that by the time David Robinson came to write the letter dated 2 July 2013 neither he nor Mr Parvin believed that any agreement which might have been reached involved a settlement of any claims which the individual leaseholders might have against ZIP or ZBC and that they were dealing and seeking to reach agreement with Zagora alone.  In the circumstances it is unnecessary for me to consider whether any agreement which was reached was invalidated by any lack of authority from all of the individual leaseholders. </p>

That notice was duly prepared and issued on 30 May 2013. It required Zagora, as the freeholder, to undertake remedial works as specified in the notice to remedy the hazards also specified.  Zagora was required to begin remedial works on 1 July 2013, which included undertaking works to ensure that the structure to the common areas obtained a minimum of one hour’s fire separation, and to complete them within a further 90 days. The principal hazard specified was that of fire, the deficiency being an “indication of the common area structure not compliant to one hour fire separation (exposed steelwork not protected …)”, although further hazards were specified in relation to defects in the staircases and roof leaks.  The principal action specified was to “undertake works to ensure that the structure to the common areas attains a minimum of one [hour] fire separation”.  Failure to comply was a criminal offence and there was also the power for Manchester City Council to undertake the work and recover the cost from Zagora. </p>

On 29 May 2013 Mr Alcock wrote to Mr Broadhurst, making the point that legal proceedings would be precipitate without Zagora first submitting a pre-action protocol letter of claim.  Mr Broadhurst responded on 31 May 2013, making it explicit that Zagora was advancing the claim on a twin basis, namely: (1) a claim under the building warranty; (2) a claim in negligence against ZBC. </p>

Mr Troth regarded the fire protection to the stairs and corridors to be inadequate to meet reasonable standards to safeguard persons in and around the building in the event of a fire and considered that in its current form the development should not be occupied until sufficient remedial works were undertaken or sufficient temporary emergency procedures were initiated. He also suggested that the Fire Service should be contacted immediately to draw his views to their attention.

He brought the drawings retrieved from archive with him and the four men walked around the development, comparing the layout with the drawings and the deficiencies in the buildings about which Mr Broadhurst, now supported by two consultants and Manchester City Council housing department, was so concerned. It is quite clear, in my view, that it was a detailed inspection and that Mr Parvin as an engineer by qualification with extensive experience in dealing with building warranty claims, was quite clearly aware by the end of the visit that the failings in the buildings were both evident and serious. I accept Mr Broadhurst’s evidence that in the course of this meeting there was a suggestion for the first time from David Robinson and Mr Parvin that ZIP might be willing to accept a single policy claim in relation to the common parts if made by Zagora in its capacity as the freeholder undertaking the management company’s role. Mr Broadhurst addressed that requirement in his email to Cunningham Lindsey of 19 June 2013, enclosing a copy of one of the leases, and stating that the “management company was dissolved in 2011 and therefore the duties of the management company have been assumed by the freeholder”.  I shall return to the potential significance of this statement later.  I also accept Mr Broadhurst’s evidence that at the meeting Mr Parvin would have said something along the lines that a claim under the policy ought to include addressing all of the immediate fire safety risks. </p>

It was obviously in Mr Parvin’s interests to put this proposal over the phone, rather than commit himself to writing and I am satisfied that the impetus to do so was that, having visited the site for the first time, he had become fully aware of the problems which ZBC would face in defending any Bldg Regs claim. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.23 It is common ground that the first part of the meeting was attended by Mr Broadhurst, Mr Parvin and David Robinson. No notes are available of this part of the meeting, because Mr Broadhurst did not take any and because if and insofar as Mr Parvin or David Robinson did take notes ZIP has asserted privilege in that respect. Fortunately, however, David Robinson produced a letter to confirm what had been discussed and agreed within a week of the meeting, which Mr Parvin accepted he had seen and approved before it was sent, which provides a good contemporaneous record and which also indicates ZIP’s intentions going forwards.  The content of that letter insofar as it recorded what had been discussed and agreed at the meeting was not contradicted by Mr Broadhurst at the time and, indeed, it is positively relied upon by Zagora in support of its case in relation to the agreement to rectify. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In his witness statement at [102] Mr Broadhurst had said that Mr Parvin made it clear that ZIP wanted to reach an agreement with Zagora in relation to the works to the common parts, on the understanding that no claim was made against ZBC.  Mr Parvin’s evidence was that he held no brief for ZBC, whether at the meeting or otherwise, and there was never any discussion or agreement in relation to any claim there might be in relation to Bldg Regs certification.  Under cross-examination Mr Broadhurst accepted that no agreement had been reached in relation to that claim and the discussion had been along the lines that any claims there might be outside the policy might well be resolved simply because the scope of remedial works agreed pursuant to the agreement reached at the meeting would include any works the subject of those claims anyway.  An example of this, by reference to what David Robinson stated in the subsequent letter, was that the overall scheme to deal with fire compartmentation might well address any issues in relation to sound transmission due to penetration of the party walls.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">Parvin’s denials I do accept that he was keen to resolve matters in a way which would obviate the need for any claim to be made against ZBG for negligent certification.  I have no doubt that Zurich would not have wanted the reputational damage associated with such a claim and that Mr Parvin was genuinely appalled at the absence of documentation to support the Bldg Regs final certificates issued by ZBC and the clear evidence of serious non-compliance with the Bldg Regs which the inspections had revealed. It is known that the department based in London which was dealing with the ZBC claim was involved and, notwithstanding Mr Parvin’s inability to recollect the details of its involvement, I have no doubt that there would have been pressure on Mr Parvin to avoid any claim and adverse publicity against ZBC if that was possible. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In his witness statement at [103] Mr Broadhurst had said that neither the policy terms nor the exclusion clauses were discussed at the meeting. He said that this was because Mr Parvin wanted to try and resolve everything through ZIP so that he did not believe there was any reason to refer any more to the policy terms.  He was cross-examined on the basis that the absence of reference to the policy terms was just as consistent with ZIP’s rights under the policy being reserved.  That seems to me to depend on the context of what was agreed, and I address this point below when considering the terms of the subsequent letter.  It was suggested by ZIP that Mr Parvin’s authority was limited to £5M and that he would never have been prepared to agree an open-ended liability.  The force of the former point was rather undermined by Mr Parvin’s ready acceptance that he had never referred to any limit on his authority.  The force of the latter point was diminished – although perhaps not completely negated – by the absence of any suggestion by Mr Parvin that he considered that the potential cost of the works discussed at the meeting could have exceeded that limit. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Mr Broadhurst’s evidence was that Mr Parvin did not maintain ZIP’s argument that the cost of any remedial works should be discounted to reflect CJS’ ownership of the 66 flats.  His evidence was that this issue had been resolved on the basis of ZIP accepting that Zagora was entitled to make a claim under the policy as freeholder in relation to the common parts subject only to one excess.  He accepted that ZIP still refused to meet any cost of any internal works to CJS’ flats or for any loss of rent incurred by CJS.  Mr Parvin’s evidence was that ZIP’s position that any claim would have to be discounted to reflect CJS’ flat ownership was very much maintained.  However, he also accepted that Zagora was entitled to be treated as a policyholder despite having no insurance certificate in its capacity as buyer of the freehold.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Mr Broadhurst accepted that there was no agreement in relation to the individual leaseholders’ claims in relation to any works to their apartments save insofar as part and parcel of the works which were agreed (for example in relation to fire compartmentation between flats and common parts) and also that there was no agreement in relation to any alternative accommodation costs or claims which the individual leaseholders might have.           </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">The second stage of the meeting brought in Mr Troth of Arup and Mr Brown of Thomasons.  Mr Troth took a contemporaneous handwritten note which, happily, is still available and which he was able to decipher in his oral evidence.  It is common ground that the second stage of the meeting was, as envisaged, a practical discussion as to the extent of the problems and how they were to be addressed.  There was no discussion at this stage of the meeting in relation to legal or policy issues or the like.  It is apparent from the note that this part of the meeting focussed on the way forward in terms of investigations and remedial works.   In particular, the two stage strategy of an immediate solution in terms of fire safety, in particular the provision of a suitable fire alarm system (temporary or permanent) and bringing in fire wardens, followed by a permanent solution, was discussed, as was the inspection strategy which involved beginning by opening up the common areas for inspection.      </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.32 The day after the meeting Mr Parvin sent a brief email to Mr Broadhurst and David Robinson as well as Mr Troth, Mr Brown and Mr Reed and Mr Johnson at ZIP, confirming their contact details and stating: “I think it was a very constructive meeting yesterday”.  Mr Broadhurst responded, agreeing that it was a very constructive meeting, and attaching a schedule of owner details for each unit and stating that he was in the process of obtaining a budget cost for the fire alarm works.  It seems clear to me, therefore, that neither man was suggesting that everything had been agreed and, as I have said, that is not Zagora’s case.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.33 It is also clear from the opening words of David Robinson’s letter of 2 July 2013 that it had been agreed at the meeting that a letter would be sent by him which would set out ZIP’s position following the meeting.   The email sent to Mr Broadhurst on 4 July 2013 which attached the letter read: “As promised a letter is attached setting out Zurich’s position on matters at this point in time”.  The letter was copied to Mr Parvin who, as I have said, had read and approved it before it was sent.  He does not suggest that in any way it inaccurately recorded what was said at the meeting.  Indeed, it plainly reflected the position taken by ZIP after the discussions at the meeting had been the subject of further reflection and discussion both internally and with David Robinson.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.34 Mr Broadhurst does not suggest that he expressed any disagreement at the time with the content of the letter, either as an accurate record of what had been discussed at the meeting or as to the way forward.  In its reply to ZIP’s request for further information Zagora stated that Mr Broadhurst believed that the letter was a true and accurate record of his discussion with Mr Parvin and David Robinson and accurately recorded the agreement that was reached.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.35 Nonetheless it would be wrong to read it as if it was a carefully drafted legal document.  That is not how it was intended or how it reads.  There are clearly some linguistic infelicities.  For example, in the opening sentence David Robinson began by stating the purpose of the letter, which was said to be to “confirm in principle what was agreed during the meeting”.  ZIP argues that the words “in principle” should be read as appearing after “agreed” because they make no sense in the position where they actually appear and, therefore, it follows that David Robinson was clearly intending to convey that what was agreed was agreed only in principle and that it was not intended to be a final or legally binding agreement.  The claimants on the other hand emphasise the word “agreed” and also submit that it is extremely significant that in this letter David Robinson did not, as he had in previous correspondence, refer to ZIP’s position as being “without prejudice” to liability or subject to a reservation of rights. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.36 A similar point may be made in relation to the following sentence, which read: “In broad terms I would confirm that Zurich will accept the following items under the terms of the warranty subject to a single excess of £1,211”. ZIP emphasises the words “in broad terms” which, it submits, reinforces its case that this was not intended to be a final or legally binding agreement. The claimants on the other hand observe that this is an unqualified acceptance by ZIP of a claim made by Zagora under the terms of the insurance policy, subject only to the application of a single excess, in circumstances where in previous correspondence Mr Robinson had always qualified ZIP’s position as above and also by reference to the policy terms, importantly including the arguments that any liability would be subject to a proportionate reduction for the CJS flats and also to the application of an excess for each individual leaseholder claimant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">“This is subject to further investigation and agreement as to scope of works, however at this point in time I can confirm that the works to the common corridors and stairs are accepted.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.39 Again, both parties emphasise different aspects of this section. Thus, the claimants draw attention to the fact that works to the common corridors and stairs were accepted by ZIP, subject only to further investigation and agreement as to the scope of works, whereas ZIP emphasise that any agreement was expressly made subject to further investigation and agreement and, moreover, that no commitment was given in relation to compartmentation between flats or fire stopping in the external walls. </p>

The final sentence does not immediately make sense unless it is read on the basis that the word “not” has been omitted, which would be consistent with ZIP relying on the exclusion of the basement from the policy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">Parvin’s evidence to the contrary.  The approach in the letter is consistent in my judgment with Mr Broadhurst’s evidence that Mr Parvin was keen to find a way in which what appeared to be justified claims under the warranty could be accepted as a claim made by Zagora so as to achieve the objective of making the developments safe for occupation in terms of fire safety and structurally and without the impediment which would be caused by a strict application of the policy terms in relation to multiple excesses and the CJS flats, which would leave ZIP vulnerable to separate litigation and the risk of reputational damage to ZBC. In cross-examination Mr Parvin suggested that the acceptance that only one excess would be deducted did not represent a concession so much as an alternative approach based on an alternative interpretation of the policy.  Whilst I accept that this is the correct interpretation of the present or imminent danger section of the policy, nonetheless it clearly did reflect ZIP taking a commercial approach to seek to resolve the claim on a pragmatic basis.  The question, of course, is whether this apparent unqualified acceptance of liability on this basis formed part of a legally enforceable agreement or, as ZIP would contend, part of what was at best only an agreement in principle where all rights were reserved pending a final agreement. </p>

It is apparent in my view from this section that two separate activities were being proposed, the first being to undertake the steps necessary to install a fire alarm system in the development which would enable it to continue to be occupied in the short-term, and the second being to undertake further investigations before agreeing further remedial works and producing a schedule of those works.  Against each activity David Robinson had identified who was responsible for taking action to implement the activity.  After the temporary works had been undertaken and further investigations had been undertaken and assessed the next activity was to “agree extent of remedial works”, to be actioned by “Arup, Zurich Risks and Thomasons”.   </p>

Mr Parvin disagreed.  However I agree that the wording used is not apt to encompass a further stage at which Mr Broadhurst as the decision maker on behalf of Zagora and Mr Parvin as the decision maker on behalf of ZIP would then be required to confirm their respective agreement to the proposals which had been discussed and agreed between the experts including Mr Johnson as the Zurich Risks engineer.  That point is not however, in my view, determinative as to the question as to what had been agreed and what, overall, the letter recorded as having been agreed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.49 In cross-examination Mr Parvin accepted that ZIP had agreed to fund the cost of the temporary works to allow the immediate fire safety concerns to be assuaged and thus to ensure that the development could continue to be occupied and insured.  It is right to say, as Mr Selby submitted, that this does not expressly appear in David Robinson’s letter of 2 July 2013.  Mr Selby submits that this shows that not everything which was agreed at the meeting was included within David Robinson’s letter.  He also submits that since ZIP was willing to agree to fund these works there was no reason why it should not also have been willing to fund the works which were accepted in relation to the common corridors and stairs and the other works which Zagora says were agreed at the meeting.  I accept the force of this point.  Indeed, one can see from the wording used in David Robinson’s letter that the opening section (“we will accept the following items under the terms of the warranty”) when read with the closing summary of activities amounts to an implicit acknowledgement that ZIP would fund the costs of those activities.  However, that does not in my judgment answer the crucial question, which is whether or not there was a contractually binding commitment and, if so, what were its terms.     </p>

Whilst this is a clear indication that Mr Robinson believed that Zurich had agreed to fund the fire alarm system and other steps to allow the development to continue to be occupied it does not in my view take matters any further than that. On 9 July 2013 David Robinson wrote to Mr Tarasov, stating that “Zurich are engaged, with the freeholder, in rectifying the issues”. On 11 July 2013 he wrote a memorable email to Mr Broadhurst in which he stated: “it’s bad enough they [JCS] build it badly, rob the residents and then leave you to fix it and for us [ZIP] to pay for it!”.  Whilst it reflects an understanding that at the time ZIP would end up paying for some or all of the necessary remedial works, it does not seem to me to go further and reflect an understanding that ZIP had entered into a binding contractual commitment to do so. </p>

That email simply reflected his belief as to what had already happened and what would happen going forwards. It was not copied to Zurich or to Cunningham Lindsey and has no particular relevance to the issue which I have to decide. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.53 It is important to emphasise that this is not a case where Zagora is contending that a full, final and complete agreement was reached at the meeting of 27 June 2013.  Zagora does not suggest that this was a final concluded agreement in relation to each and every claim it and/or the individual leaseholders had against ZIP under the policy and against ZBC under the Bldg Regs claim.  It does however submit that it represented a final concluded agreement in relation to <span style="text-decoration:underline">some</span> of the matters referred to at the meeting of 27 June 2013 and in the letter dated 2 July 2013.  In contrast, ZIP submits that it simply represented a step along the road to a potential agreement which was not, objectively, intended to amount to a legally enforceable agreement in the event that no final agreement was concluded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.54 It is also important to emphasise that this is not a case where Zagora is contending that an agreement was reached at the meeting of 27 June 2013 which went beyond or was not qualified by what was contained in David Robinson’s letter of 2 July 2013. In other words, Zagora is not contending that even if, on a proper construction of the letter of 2 July 2013, no legally binding agreement was reached nonetheless a legally binding agreement had already been reached at the meeting of 27 June 2013 from which David Robinson wrongfully and ineffectively sought to row back in his letter of 2 July 2013. Zagora’s case is that what was agreed at the meeting of 27 June 2013 is accurately stated and recorded in the letter of 2 July 2013.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.55 In my judgment this is a proper and a realistic approach to take. If Mr Broadhurst had suggested in his oral evidence that a full and binding agreement was reached at the meeting which did not require any written confirmation of its precise terms from ZIP following the meeting to become legally binding, and from which ZIP attempted to resile in some key respects in the letter of 2 July 2013, then I would have had no hesitation in rejecting that evidence.  That is because that has not been his position or Zagora’s case or his evidence in the proceedings at any time. Furthermore, in my view it is inherently implausible that any reasonable person in his position could have believed that a full and binding agreement in relation to matters of such obvious significance had been reached in the course of this two stage meeting, without the detailed terms of the agreement as proposed by ZIP subsequently being set out in a subsequent formal written communication for his consideration. It was not Zagora’s case or his evidence that after the meeting involving the experts there had been a further separate meeting involving only Mr Broadhurst, Mr Parvin and David Robinson at which a written record of the agreement had been drawn up and agreed to by all three men.  If that had happened then I can see that there would have been no need for a further written communication. However, that was not what happened in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.56 In determining this question it is, rightly, common ground that what matters is how the parties expressed themselves to each other, whether in words, writing or conduct.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.57 In a case where the parties have no pre-existing relationship the court applies well-established principles in deciding whether or not they have concluded a legally binding contract.  It is necessary to show that they have agreed on all matters essential to the formation of a contract or, insofar as they have not, that it can be demonstrated that the law will imply an agreement in relation to a particular matter.  So, for example, in some cases where no price is agreed the circumstances may be such as to justify the court implying a term that a reasonable price will be paid, whereas in other cases the circumstances are such that the court will conclude that in the absence of agreement on a price no legally binding contract can come into effect.  In such cases it is necessary to show agreement on all matters because save in the limited circumstances where the court can imply a term the court cannot retrospectively fix the essential terms of a contract which the parties have not agreed at the time and without agreement on such essential terms the contract is too uncertain in its terms to be enforced. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.58 However, in cases where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties the need for agreement on all matters is not so acute.  That is because if there is a pre-existing contractual relationship it is possible for the parties to agree on some, but not all, issues which have arisen as to the respective entitlements under that contract, and to leave the remaining issues to be resolved either by subsequent agreement or, failing agreement, by the court.  It is possible for the court to determine the remaining issues because there is an existing contractual relationship which provides the legal structure by which those issues can be resolved.  The question in such cases will be whether the circumstances are such that it can be concluded that the parties intended to and did reach a partial settlement and to leave other matters unresolved or whether they only intended to reach agreement if everything which was in issue could be agreed. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.59 The present case does not fall neatly into either category.  That is because the pre-existing relationship between the parties was not entirely clear or free from dispute.  Thus Zagora was asserting a warranty claim against ZIP which could be advanced on any one or more of three separate grounds, none of which were entirely clear nor free from doubt, namely: (a) a claim as a policyholder as subsequent purchaser of the freehold, in circumstances where the original freeholder was the developer who would not have been entitled to make a warranty claim; (b) a claim on the basis that it was, effectively, the management company, in circumstances where there was some uncertainty as to its right to do so and where it was not immediately obvious in any event that the original management company would have been entitled to make a warranty claim save, perhaps, as agent for the individual leaseholders; (c) a claim on behalf of the individual leaseholders, in circumstances where there was also some uncertainty as to its authority to do so and where on any view it had no express authority to claim on behalf of CJS, the owner of the majority of the flats.  Moreover, the terms of the warranty were neither entirely clear nor free from doubt as to who could make claims or make full recoveries and on what basis.  Finally, Zagora was asserting a separate claim against ZBC where, to succeed, it would have to establish that there was a legal duty (the claim then being advanced as a duty of care in tort, as the parties had not applied their minds as to whether or not it would be necessary to go further and establish deceit) either between itself and ZBC or between someone else on whose behalf it was entitled to act and ZBC.       </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.60 Nonetheless, these complications should not be over-stated.  In relation to the warranty claim, it is perfectly possible for it to be agreed between a claimant and an insurer that the insurer will recognise the claimant as an insured and will accept liability to that claimant for one or more specified claims, either on the basis of a full agreement as to what remedial works were required or the amount to which the claimant was entitled or on the basis that if full and final agreement on remedial works or cost cannot be reached any outstanding disputes can be determined by the court in accordance with the terms of the contract of insurance.   However, it must be recognised that in many, probably the vast majority, of cases it will be in the interests of both parties – and certainly the insurer – to reach a full and final settlement on all matters, so that it is unlikely that a partial agreement of the nature postulated would be attractive compared with a full and final agreement on all matters.  What is crucial to the validity of such an agreement is clarity as to what issues have been agreed and on what basis and what issues are left outstanding because, in the absence of such clarity, any agreement is too uncertain to be legally enforceable. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.61 In this case, the evidence shows that some of these potential complications were indeed resolved.  I am satisfied that it was accepted that Zagora would be treated as an insured freeholder which was entitled to make claims under the policy in relation to the common parts on its own behalf and on the twin basis that: (a) no CJS discount would be applied to these common parts claims; (b) only one excess would be applied to these common parts claims.  This was a perfectly sensible pragmatic solution to a serious and pressing problem.   </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.62 I am also satisfied that it was agreed that the claim against ZBC would be left on the back burner, as were all claims which the individual leaseholders might have, including claims in relation to the individual flats and for alternative accommodation costs.  Whilst it might be objected that this would not achieve an insurer’s usual objective of securing full and final settlement, again it was a sensible pragmatic solution to a serious and pressing problem, in circumstances where it was clearly appreciated that agreement on the common parts would address the most substantial, most complex and most pressing of the issues with the development.       </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.63 However, in my judgment the real difficulties arise when one considers the detail of what was agreed.  Thus, in relation to what was perhaps the most important and pressing issue of fire safety the position seems to me to be at best complex and at worst hopelessly uncertain.  Everything was said to be subject to further investigation and agreement, even the works to the common corridors and stairs which were accepted although, importantly, not further specified at that stage.  Nothing was specifically agreed in relation to compartmentation between the flats and the common parts or between flats or in relation to fire stopping to the external walls pending further investigation.  Nor was the position in relation to any untreated structural steelwork specifically addressed.  Assuming that it was agreed that any such steelwork in the corridors and stairs would be treated it is not clear whether or not that would also apply to steelwork in individual flats. Nothing was said about structural steelwork or other fire safety issues in relation to the roof.   </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.64 Furthermore, even in relation to the corridors and stair fire safety works nothing specific was agreed.  Zagora’s case is that the agreement was sufficiently certain, because there was no reason to believe that the works could not be agreed between the experts.  However, that could not of course be guaranteed.  The parties had clearly not considered what would happen if the experts were unable to agree or, indeed, even if the experts agreed but either Zagora or ZIP or both were not happy to abide by their agreement.  It would follow that in such a case there could be no final agreement so that this part of the agreement could only work if a term was to be implied that the </p>

However it is not clear whether that would be on the basis that all that the court was required to do was to determine the reasonable scope of the works or whether it would be open to ZIP to contend that it should be treated as a claim under the insurance policy so that all policy arguments other than those specifically conceded might be raised.  One can see a real prospect of a disagreement between experts as to whether or not what was required was: (a) to resolve the matters identified by the Manchester City Council housing department improvement notice or; (b) the Fire Service enforcement notice or; (c) the matters specifically identified in Mr Broadhurst’s email of 20 June 2013 and, in either case, what was reasonably necessary.  One can also see for example a real prospect of a disagreement as to whether or not what was required was: (a) to ensure that the corridors and stairs complied in all respects with Part B of the Approved Document or; (b) merely to ensure that the reasonable cost of rectifying or remedying major physical damage or a present or imminent danger to physical health and safety of occupants (i.e. the policy claims) and again, in either case, what was reasonably necessary. </p>

I am not at all convinced that the case referred to is authority for that proposition.  In that case, which concerned the question as to whether or not a provision for a 10 year contract duration was insufficiently certain where the price to be paid after year 3 had not been agreed, Rix LJ referred at [53] onwards to what he described as well-known authorities for the principles which could be extracted from them.  Having done so, he set out at [69] what he described as a list of the principles relevant to that case which, he stressed, was not intended to be exhaustive.  Nothing specific was said in relation to the role of experts, although reference was made to the possibility of the court being prepared to imply obligations in terms of what is reasonable or, in the context of there being an arbitration clause, to find that there is a “commercial and contractual mechanism which can be operated with the assistance of experts in the field”. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.66 The difficulty here, in my view, is that there was insufficient certainty as to the basis on which the experts were to proceed.  It follows in my view that if the experts were unable to agree the court could not proceed to determine what works were reasonably required under the agreement to rectify.  It follows in my judgment that there is no mechanism by which the implication of the term contended for by the claimants could render the contract sufficiently certain.   Mr Selby protested that there was no reason to think that the experts would not have been able to agree on the scope of works.  I accept that the court should not be too negative about the prospect of agreement.  However, it must not be forgotten that further investigation was undoubtedly required.  The experts might reasonably disagree both as to the seriousness of any non-compliance and as to what remedial works were required.  They might ask for input from their respective principals, who might – given the uncertainty – reasonably disagree about the correct approach.  At the time, I fully accept, the principals and the experts might have confidently expected that as reasonable men they would be able to agree.  However, in the end the fact remained that the interests of Zagora and the interests of ZIP did not necessarily coincide.  In short it remained in an important respect an agreement to agree which, as is common ground, is not enforceable as a legally binding contract.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.67 Similar objections in my view apply in relation to resistance to moisture (and indeed all of the remaining sections).  With the modest exception of completing two entrance lobby roofs nothing at all was agreed.  In relation to the roof, which of course was a particularly significant item, all that was said was that “we agree that there are issues with the roof and that in all probability this will need replacement”.  That is very far from a clear and unqualified acceptance of responsibility for the complete replacement of the roof.  The same is true in relation to the external walls.  The proposal in relation to external render was completely unenforceable.  Here, the parties were even further away from any consensus on how any subsequent disagreement about what was required could be determined.    </p>

Referring to an agreement in principle and in broad terms clearly move the claim further forwards than under previous letters, where ZIP’s rights were expressly reserved.  However, the question is whether they go sufficiently far to demonstrate an immediate and unqualified acceptance of a liability to undertake whatever repairs the experts might agree or, alternatively, whatever repairs might be reasonable to undertake on the basis that no points of defence under the policy would be taken subject to the specific points expressly raised in the letter.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.69 The reality, in my view, is that what was agreed at the meeting and set out in the letter represented a step along the road to what the parties at the time would have hoped and expected would have been a pragmatic resolution of a serious and urgent problem, even if not resolving all of the claims which all of the parties might have had either as against ZIP or as against ZBC.  Had it not been for the unfortunate intervention of CJS and the subsequent litigation it may well have been that matters could have been resolved.  However, that did not happen and the question which the court must resolve is whether the consequence is that the parties are brought back to their strict legal positions prior to 27 June 2013 or whether that step along the way can now be given effect as a binding legal contract.  In my judgment it was not, on any objective analysis, ever intended that what was agreed at the meeting and set out in the letter could represent a binding immediately enforceable contract between Zagora and ZIP and, it follows, the parties are thrown back to their strict legal positions. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.70 I have considered whether or not it could be said that leaving aside anything else the effect of what was said and written was that ZIP had agreed to accept Zagora as if it was an insured under a Standard 10 policy of the common parts on the same terms as issued to the individual leaseholders and on the basis that ZIP would accept a claim made by Zagora under that policy without any deduction for the CJS and associated owner flats and subject only to one excess.  I am unable to accept that this was the case.  I am satisfied that there was no contractual intention to do so.  To do so would again in my view have the effect of seeking to carve out some immediately binding partial agreement from what was, on an objective analysis, always intended only to be a step along the road to a complete agreement.  What was said by Mr Parvin and written by David Robinson amounted to no more, in my view, than that as and when (and, importantly, if) full agreement could be reached in relation to the remedial works which ZIP was prepared to fund then ZIP would accept a claim by Zagora on the basis stated above.  In the absence of subsequent agreement in relation to the remedial works that cannot retrospectively be hived off as amounting to a separate independently enforceable agreement.  This is not a case such as those sometimes encountered where there is a claim under an insurance policy where there are disputes about liability but where following a meeting the insurer agrees to accept liability on an agreed basis but leaves all matters in </p>

It is a great shame that the discussions, which might otherwise have proceeded to a successful outcome, were brought to an abrupt halt by the intervention of CJS and the subsequent litigation and were not resurrected thereafter.  Whether the parties would have reached a final agreement I simply do not know; Mr Broadhurst was after all seeking to drive a hard bargain and achieve an advantageous result for Zagora and its associated business interests rather than just securing a satisfactory result for the individual leaseholders and there can be no guarantee that Mr Parvin would have been prepared to accept his demands. </p>

However if I had found that there was an agreement I would have been satisfied that there was consideration, in that the agreement as contended for by Zagora would have afforded ZIP the legal and practical benefit of avoiding facing imminent litigation by Zagora and in avoiding any potential additional liability resulting from the development having to be decanted if the works required by the improvement notice and enforcement notice could not be undertaken and/or if the buildings insurers went off cover as a result. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.74 I do not accept ZIP’s case based on a mistake as to the identity of the contracting parties. ZIP had contended that the agreement to rectify, if made, had involved Mr Broadhurst or the companies who he represented purporting to act on behalf of all of the individual leaseholders, in circumstances where he did not have their authority to bind them. However, on a proper analysis of the evidence it is clear that by 27 June 2013 neither Mr Broadhurst nor Mr Parvin believed that any agreement involved the individual leaseholders. Instead they proceeded on the basis that any agreement would simply have involved ZIP accepting that Zagora was entitled to make a claim under an insurance policy in relation to the common parts in its capacity as freeholder, with any claims by the individual leaseholders being left on the backburner. It follows, in my view, that no question of authority or mistake arose. Nor did Mr Parvin suggest in his evidence that it did.   </p>

ZIP’s case is that before the meeting on 27 June 2013 Mr Broadhurst had become aware that LHM had been restored to the register of companies and that it was contending through solicitors that it was entitled to manage the development and that Zagora was not and should not be doing so.  ZIP contends that Mr Broadhurst was therefore obliged to inform ZIP of these facts but </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">that he failed to do so.  ZIP argues that this is important because the underlying basis of any agreement was a pragmatic acceptance by ZIP to treat Zagora as an insured so that ZIP could fund the necessary remedial works on the basis that Zagora was in a position to do so as the freeholder undertaking the management function.   ZIP argues that if this underlying basis, which had been represented to be the position by Zagora, was known by Zagora not to be the case prior to the 27 June 2013 meeting then Zagora was obliged to notify ZIP.  Having failed to do so, it is said that ZIP was induced to enter into the agreement to rectify by reason of a material misrepresentation and is and was entitled to avoid the agreement to rectify as a result.   </p>

The position is that LHM had indeed been dissolved and Freehold Managers as the then freeholder had indeed taken over the management role.  Although there had been non-cooperation and indeed objection from those associated with CJS there had been no active challenge.  Mr Broadhurst and Mr Robinson had decided to proceed with the acquisition by Zagora of the freehold on the basis of a statement in the sales particulars that this was the position and the absence of any suggestion that it was not the case.  It is true that after the acquisition there had again been non-cooperation and indeed objection from those associated with CJS, which had led to Mr Broadhurst becoming aware that CJS had taken steps to restore LHM to the Register of Companies, but there is no evidence that as a result of this Mr Broadhurst no longer believed that Zagora was not still entitled to manage New Lawrence House as at the end of June or early July 2013.  He was obviously aware that there was a dispute about the matter but that is different from his knowing that Zagora did not have the entitlement.  I do not accept that in such circumstances he had a duty to disclose the existence of that dispute.  In the circumstances, I would not have accepted this defence either. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">8.78 ZIP advanced a connected defence based on illegality.  The argument is that by reason of the interim injunction granted by the court on 10 July 2013 and continued thereafter it was illegal for the agreement to rectify to be performed. I reject this argument.  Performance of the agreement to rectify was never rendered illegal.  It was simply the case that the investigations and remedial works could not be implemented whilst the interim injunction remained in force unless varied.  However, it is a statement of the obvious that an interim injunction is very different from the final permanent injunction.  It was always known to ZIP that Zagora was contesting the claim advanced by CJS through LHM and that at some stage the court would rule on the dispute.  Eventually on appeal the court ruled that CJS had no right to bring litigation against Zagora through LHM and that LHM was controlled by the individual leaseholders who supported Zagora.  From that time there was no legal impediment to the agreement to rectify being performed.  ZIP contend that in fact the injunction was never formally lifted.  This was not investigated at trial but, even if that is so, that is a pure technicality because it is clear that the individual leaseholders who have controlled LHM since 2014 would agree to the injunction being lifted if that would enable the agreement to rectify to be performed.        </p>

Indeed since it is not Zagora’s case that the agreement to rectify compromised all claims under the insurance policies or against ZBG I do not accept that there is an obvious and irreconcilable inconsistency between the correspondence relied upon and the agreement to rectify as advanced by Zagora.     </p>

I would also have needed to make clear findings as to whether my decision should be made solely on the basis of what is required under the Approved Documents or also by reference to policy terms and, if so, which.  I should also have needed to make clear findings as to the outcome in relation to individual items where there might reasonably have been disagreement between experts – as indeed there has been – about the nature and extent of the necessary remedial works, including the necessary access and reinstatement works.

The clear commercial purpose of the agreement to rectify, had it been made, was that Zagora should be entitled to be put in funds to undertake the necessary remedial works for the benefit of the individual leaseholders as well as its own benefit.  In the circumstances it would not be open to ZIP to contend that Zagora’s claim should be valued on the basis only of the diminution in value of its own interest.   </p>

However and again other than in the eventuality of a successful appeal with clear direction being given as to the correct approach it would be pointless to speculate further let alone make findings based on the possible permutations.  </p>

That is on the basis that the clear commercial purpose of the agreement to rectify, if concluded, was to allow Zagora to undertake the necessary works without deduction for the CJS flats.  It could not therefore be argued by ZIP that Zagora was obliged to mitigate its loss by seeking to proceed against CJS rather than pursuing ZIP to enforce the obligation which on this hypothesis it accepted but then failed to honour.   </p>

It might I suppose also have been asked to and issued an insurance certificate in favour of LHM as the intended management company.  However since JCS retained the freehold it makes complete sense that it did not ask ZIP to issue it with an insurance certificate and there was of course no reason for it to do so anyway, since JCS as developer fell outside the definition of a buyer in the insurance policy anyway and accordingly could never have derived any benefit from the policy. It follows that whilst a policy issued to the freeholder would have been capable of automatic transfer to a successor, this never happened here because neither JCS (nor, for that matter, Freehold Managers as the successor freeholder from JCS) was ever issued with an insurance certificate by ZIP. In those circumstances ZIP contends, and I agree, that it is simply not possible for Zagora to contend that it has the benefit of any insurance policy with ZIP. </p>

Moreover at 10.10 Mr Pagan states in terms that neither the red oxide paint with which the steel is generally coated, or the white emulsion found in some areas, were intumescent or would provide any level of fire protection. No explanation was given by ZIP for not calling Mr Pagan and the claimants are, of course, perfectly entitled to rely upon the contents of his report: see CPR 35.11. </p>

This evidence was not undermined in cross-examination.  Although Mr Lavender was shown photographs of steelwork painted in other colours (in addition to the red oxide), none of that steelwork was fire protected.”  In their closing submissions ZIP vigorously criticised Mr Lavender’s approach to the selection of flats and other areas for testing and his evidence. I disagree with that criticism. Mr Lavender made clear that the initial investigations were undertaken in flats where access was available. There can be no possible criticism of that. Further investigations were subsequently undertaken with a view to providing as varied a sample as possible and in my view both the approach to sampling and the overall percentage of flats inspected was entirely sufficient. </p>

At this stage I should record that during the course of the trial ZIP had submitted that the evidence failed to take into account the possibility that there was a difference between the flats which had been completed early and sold to the individual leaseholders and the CJS flats which had been completed late and not sold.  The suggestion was that it was possible that the standard of workmanship deteriorated as the development staggered on and JCS’ financial and other difficulties worsened.  However: (a) there was no good positive evidence to this effect, it was solely surmise; (b) there was no obvious correlation established on the evidence either between the stages of construction and the allocation of flats or the nature and extent of the defects found in the claimants’ flats and the other flats<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

He said that this splicing would mean that no support from the roof bracing was required. He accepted that this was not the design intent but “it would, as a matter of fact, I think, do it - provide it”. In cross-examination he accepted that this was something he had not considered in his report. He agreed that he should not be taken to be expressing an opinion about whether or not any particular item of roof steelwork needs fire protection.

Mr Allen had been given no opportunity to consider the issue in advance or to formulate a measured response. In the absence of a measured and convincing analysis by Mr Hambly or a clear acceptance by Mr Allen I prefer the initial emphatic response of Mr Allen to the rather more cautiously expressed view, based on a single photograph, of Mr Hambly. </p>

A number of issues arise, the first being ZIPs contention that those works are unnecessary because other less disruptive and expensive measures would suffice.  Specifically, ZIP contend that the provision of sprinklers throughout the development would suffice and would obviate the need for fireproofing the steelwork. </p>

I observed however that the question as to whether the rectification of the present or imminent danger could be achieved by temporary measures was a  question of fact in the individual case but that in my view the starting point should be that the claimants are entitled to be indemnified against the cost of measures which ensure that the relevant part or parts of the building comply with the applicable Bldg Regs. </p>

In particular Mr Pagan considered that even if a fire alarm and sprinkler system was adopted it would still be necessary to have at least one member of staff on duty 24/7 to manage and assist any evacuation due to fire and that this would not be a long term solution; his opinion was that it would be a short term solution to allow the building to be occupied whilst the longer term remedial measures are carried out.

The fire safety experts have agreed that, in short, the relevant walls and ceilings need to be stripped back to allow appropriate fire protection (fire-boarding preferably, and application of intumescent paint where not practicable) to be applied to the structural steelwork.  Where the structural steelwork is located within the floor voids and the roof, the ceilings to the flats and common parts need to be removed to allow access to the structural steelwork.  Given the amount of structural steelwork located in the external walls, the experts are agreed that the external walls need to be removed as well. </p>

As the claimants explain in their closing submissions, the cost difference between the two solutions is around £98,000 if Stotherm is applied only to the rendered elevation and around £274,000 more if applied to the timber clad elevations, and there is also a further saving of around £215,000 because it would in such circumstances not be necessary to cut back the plasterboard by 1 metre to access the structural steelwork.  However it is also the case, I am satisfied, that since the Stotherm solution will require some assessment of the condition of the OSB, with a possibility of localised repair or replacement, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">10.2.22 In summary, however, it is common ground that the external wall as installed was defective in that it did not have a vapour control layer (VCL) affixed to the external face of the internal plasterboard which would prevent moisture in the warm air from inside the flat from passing through the loosely insulated void and then condensing on and, over time, damaging the OSB to which the existing render system was attached.  Whether or not that caused a problem in practice was a matter of debate but, for present purposes, the question is which of the following two options to choose once the render and cladding is removed to allow access to fire proof the structural steelwork.  The first, as propounded by Mr Troughton, is to start from scratch and install the textbook approach solution, involving replacing the internal plasterboard (and thus disturbing the internal finishes of the flat) and then applying a VCL to the external face of that inner plasterboard, before installing the necessary insulation and OSB and then the new render and cladding.  The second, as propounded by Mr Huband, is to leave the existing plasterboard, insulation and OSB in place and then, having applied a VCL to the external face of the OSB, install the proprietary Stotherm system involving mineral fibre insulation backed by a render finish.  This is not the textbook solution but has the advantage of avoiding having to interfere with the existing OSB and plasterboard and, thus, avoiding needing to disturb the internal finishes of the flat and saving considerable cost.   </p>

It seemed to me that his approach was unduly dogmatic and inflexible and I found his opinions unconvincing.  The real question, in my judgment, was whether or not Mr Huband’s optimism that the Stotherm solution would work and thus avoid the risk of condensation, was justified by reference to the enquiries he had made of Stotherm and the information they had provided and by reference to his confidence as an engineer that the solution would work in the real world. </p>

Mr Huband had not really thought through the position in terms of ventilation.  His suggestion in evidence that a parapet detail could be incorporated to allow ventilation notwithstanding the remedial works required to the parapets was an example of his having to think on the hoof.

Taking Mr Tarasov as the best contender, so far as ZIP is concerned, I have already held that it was not until August 2012 that he had any knowledge of problems with fire safety.  Even though he had sight of the fire risk assessment, it made no specific reference to a lack of fire protection of the structural steelwork. Moreover, he was instructed not to, and did not, share the report with anyone else. Throughout the period up to and beyond 10 September 2010 he was, perfectly reasonably, communicating with Mainstay and Freehold Managers to see whether or not they were intending to deal with Zurich on behalf of all of the individual leaseholders before making direct contact. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that it cannot be said that he ought reasonably to have reported this claim in writing either to JCS or to Zurich by 10 September 2012.   As I have already said, I am satisfied that he did not begin to know the full extent of the fire safety or structural issues, which did not fully emerge until after Zagora became involved in April 2013.   </p>

What will be immediately apparent is that if I am right in my interpretation of the maximum liability limitation and if the total purchase price of all of the claimants’ flats is £3.634 million, then the claimants will not even recover the full amount of the cost of fire-proofing the structural steelwork.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">10.3.5 As to issue (1), Mr Troughton’s evidence is that the roof gives rise to a present or imminent danger because the damp in the roof void will cause water ingress, mould, fungus and damp within the flats and the ceilings of the flats to collapse.  I do not accept that this is anything other than an isolated and historic leak related problem and I have no doubt that this is not due to condensation.  Mr Troughton’s opinion is that there is a present or imminent danger due to the risk of a workman falling through a deteriorated section of the ply deck when working on the roof, potentially onto the occupants of the flats or common parts beneath.  Mr Hambly’s opinion is that the ply decking has not collapsed and there is no evidence that its collapse is evident and that in any event the roof membrane above the ply deck will act as a catenary and will prevent the person on the roof from falling through.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">10.3.6 Mr Hambly points out that there have been a number of site visits to the development and that various people (including me, as it happens) have walked on top of the flat roof without mishap or suggestion that it was too dangerous to do so.  However in cross-examination he accepted that: “It [the deck] is giving way. I do not know if it is in danger of collapse yet. It will do so at some point. It is on its way, but that does not lead to it being a present or imminent danger, in my view”.  In my view the evidence of the presence and extent and degree of deterioration is sufficient for me to conclude that there is an imminent danger, subject to Mr Hambly’s point about the catenary effect of the membrane.  However as to that I am satisfied that this was simply speculation on Mr Hambly’s part.  The membrane was not designed to act as a catenary and Mr Hambly has not either conducted an assessment of its ability to withstand load from people walking on the roof, possibly in conditions of other load (snow, for example) or carrying equipment, nor has he inspected the membrane to assess the strength and condition of its seams.  I am therefore satisfied that the present or imminent danger condition is met. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">10.3.7 As to (2), I am satisfied that the ply deck is a load bearing element. It is common ground that loads will be applied to the ply deck, for example from ponding water, snow and workmen on the roof, and it is also common ground that those loads will be transferred by the ply deck to the firrings and joists upon which it is laid. If it was not structurally stable, which I am satisfied it is not, then it would be unable to transfer those loads. In the circumstances, and adopting the interpretation of this clause as stated above, it falls within the definition of a load bearing element in my view. Moreover, and regardless of the fact that it appears at least at the point of construction to have been designed not to have a VCL or adequate ventilation, I am satisfied that such was not its intended physical condition, in circumstances where -a s I have said - it is clear that a proper design and construction in accordance with the Bldg Regs and the Zurich technical requirements would have required a VCL and adequate ventilation.  </p>

In particular, they addressed the need for a temporary roof, which Mr Hambly now agreed, but also - and more significantly - whether or not it would be necessary to take down and reinstate the ceilings of the top floor flats in order to provide a crash deck and, if so, whether it would be necessary to strip out and reinstate the top floor flats for that purpose. It is common ground that if, as I have found, it is necessary to fire protect the roof steelwork it would be necessary to take down and reinstate the top floor flat ceilings anyway, so that this point is moot unless I am found wrong in relation to the roof steelwork. In that scenario, I am not convinced that it would be necessary to remove the top floor flat ceilings and prefer Mr Hambly’s opinion that it would be unnecessary to do so. The crash deck is only a failsafe safety precaution and I do not accept that the ceilings or installation immediately above need to be removed for any reasons for which ZIP could be held responsible. However I do accept that if it is necessary to strip out and reinstate the top floor flats it makes economic sense to remove the kitchen units on the basis that it would be quicker and cheaper to do so rather than to protect in situ. For similar reasons of economy and practicality I agree with the claimants that the remedial scheme ought to involve replacing the roof structure with steel purlins; the alternative of having to programme to inspect and remedy as necessary the existing joists, with the risk that all might have to be replaced anyway if they are discovered not to be sufficiently strong to take the new roof load, does not make as much sense as replacing with steel purlins. Finally, I agree that it will be necessary to budget for a Mansafe and that this is a cost for which ZIP would be liable under the policies. </p>

ZIP contend however that these defects are neither major physical damage nor present or imminent dangers and there are also issues as to the scope of remedial works.  Based on previous reports ZIP also suggested that any debonding was due to poor or no maintenance but I am satisfied that there is no good evidence that this is the sole or substantial cause of the problem when compared with the admitted problem of inadequate installation. </p>

Mr Hambly realistically agreed that if a holistic view was taken, i.e. that the parapet is one composite element, then it should properly be characterised as a load bearing element. I agree, and am satisfied that it should be viewed as a composite element and, hence, loadbearing with the result that clause 3.1 does apply. </p>

Whilst Mr Hambly’s analysis appeared impressive in examination in chief, based on his diagram attached to his supplementary report, on closer analysis it seemed to me to suffer from the following weaknesses: (1) it assumed that water was entering the ply deck through membrane tears or other unintentional openings where water was </p>

I do not accept, however, that a complete scaffold around the entire building and a crash deck would be necessary and prefer Mr Hambly’s analysis that the only requirement would be for scaffolding where the parapets are 1m high or less, with the figures being £90,000 for the remedial works and £133,613.74 for the scaffolding, as explained in paragraph 273 of the claimants’ closing submissions. As regards the scaffolding, although ZIP submitted that this cost was irrecoverable because, as Mr Troughton accepted, in the real world no one would remedy the parapets without also remedying the flat roof, that is not a point open to them to take in my view, since in this counterfactual hypothesis where ZIP are not obliged to indemnify against the cost of remedying the flat roof, the claimants are in my view entitled to the reasonable costs of rectifying the parapets in isolation and ZIP cannot, having successfully refused indemnity in relation to the flat roofs, then be heard to say that the reasonable cost of rectifying the parapets must be ascertained on the assumption that the claimants will repair the flat roof anyway. </p>

In my view one has to consider the whole structure, from the external render all the way through to the internal plasterboard, as one composite structure which performs a load-bearing function. It would not be appropriate in my view to consider the render separately from the insulation and both separately from the OSB and so on. I agree with the claimants that support for this conclusion can be derived from the technical requirements referring to curtain walling, which requires that: “dead and live loads should be transferred safely to the building structure without undue permanent deformation or deflection of any component”. </p>

It is accepted by ZIP and in any event I am satisfied that the absence of an effective VCL creates a risk of condensation within the external walls which will have the effect of corroding the steelwork and deterioration and rotting of the timber elements within the external walls. However, as Mr Huband said and Mr Troughton, somewhat reluctantly, agreed the fact that the cavity is ventilated – albeit admittedly accidentally and inappropriately as contrary to Part L - means that the adverse effects of condensation is prevented or minimised.  Therefore, ZIP argues, the definition of major physical damage is not satisfied since there is no adverse effect on the structural stability or resistance to damp and water penetration of the external walls. Insofar as Mr Troughton protested that the heat loss through the ventilated cavity leads to a cold environment within the flats, he also had to accept in cross examination that he was unable to quantify this and Part L is not the subject of a separate Scott Schedule pleaded case albeit that this non-compliance with Part L is referred to in Scott </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">10.4.7  Whilst I accept the claimant’s case as to the presence of these defects, I am unable to accept that individually or cumulatively they would justify the complete replacement of the external wall. I agree with ZIP that in order to make good this case it would have been necessary for the claimants to: (a) produce a detailed survey report, showing on an individual external wall section by section basis where all of the relevant defects are situated, identifying how they lead to water ingress and consequential damage to the wall structure which is not prevented or mitigated by the accidental cavity; (b) identify the necessary remedial works on the basis of an itemised repair basis and, separately, a globalised repair basis, so as to satisfy the court that it would be more economic to undertake a globalised repair solution compared to an individual repair solution.  That is not something which Mr Troughton or Mr Bramall have done. That is not a criticism; I can understand why in the real world the experts would conclude that the totality of the problems in the external walls justify a complete replacement. However, in the context of this policy claim, if one is forced to strip out the VCL and the unintended ventilation as causative items, one is left with a series of individual defects, albeit some more or less widespread, with an absence of detailed analysis of how they represent either major physical damage or a present or imminent danger, either individually or globally, and a lack of analysis as to why a globalised repair scheme is justified and makes more economical sense than undertaking patch repairs. There was clearly a conflict of opinion between Mr Troughton and Mr Huband as to the patch repairs option. Whilst Mr Troughton obviously believed that patch repairs would be inappropriate and unsightly, it seemed to me that he was giving this evidence on the hop, in circumstances where he had not previously considered this point in any detail previously and, ultimately, I was not persuaded by his evidence on this topic.  This conclusion applies as much to the risk from falling render as to the risk from water penetration more generally. </p>

Whilst ZIP advanced a notification defence to this, since I accept that at least Mr Tarasov notified this claim to JCS within 2 years of the effective date I am satisfied that this defence must fail. I also note the concession in relation to the cedar cladding on the parapet on the south side of the development referred to at paragraph 177 of ZIP’s opening submissions but assume that it will be covered by the necessary remedial work to the parapets more generally.  </p>

It is common ground that there are 28 relevant base plates; the structural experts agree that 8 of the 9 which they inspected were found not to be grouted, whereas one was grouted. Given the modest remedial costs of £3,539 for doing the work, I am satisfied that the claimants have made out their case in relation to the whole; if only one out of 9 is satisfactory then it seems to me that on the balance of probabilities the likelihood is that the remainder will be unsatisfactory.

Both Mr Allen and Mr Hambly were crossexamined about this and, to summarise their evidence, the position in my view is as follows: (1) Mr Allen agreed that a guardrail would suffice, subject to the risk that it might subsequently be removed, which I regard as an inadequate objection, and to the need to provide an infill panel below to prevent children from getting under the guardrail; (2) Mr Hambly accepted that the guardrail option had not been raised in ZIP’s original counter schedule and had been raised by him following a further analysis of the reason for the problem; (3) Mr Hambly was disposed to accept that an infill panel would be a good idea - although he believed that the kite marking on the glass indicated that it should be sufficient anyway, he had not investigated this and could not be definite; </p>

It was not entirely clear to me what the agreed costing of this solution was (compare paragraph 333 of the claimants’ closing submissions and paragraph 176 of the defendants’ closing submissions). Moreover, I am not sure whether or not the infill panel has been priced and there is no indication that the further securing work suggested by Mr Hambly has been priced. Accordingly, in the same way as above, if it had mattered I would have wanted the quantum experts to address all this upon receipt of the draft judgment.

Although he also said that he was “perfectly happy” walking on the balconies, he accepts that he could not “back analyse it to prove” that they are in fact safe to use. Fortunately, the balconies have not to date failed whilst in use but, as the claimants submit, if there is a material non-compliance and a not fanciful risk that - for example - a number of occupants or their guests standing or, perhaps for example, dancing on the balconies might result in their failure, it is obviously necessary to undertake remedial works. </p>

In his supplemental report he identified the documentary evidence which he expected to see to satisfy himself that the doors were fire doors.  In cross-examination it was put to him that he could have conducted further physical inspections to satisfy himself whether or not the doors were fire doors.  As a result, it was agreed that he and Mr Pagan should undertake a joint survey which, having removed the doors from their frames, revealed that there was evidence on the doors of two of five to indicate they were fire doors, whereas none had correct letterplates and three did not have suitable firestopping or the correct intumescent strips. </p>

I reject, if pursued, any argument by ZIP that the lack of a full inspection of a greater proportion of doors means that I cannot be satisfied in relation to any specified number and therefore have no material before me to make any informed assessment.  Given that neither ZIP nor Mr Pagan suggested that this joint inspection be undertaken before trial or that the claimants or Mr Lavender unreasonably refused to agree until trial I am satisfied that insofar as there is a lack of detailed evidence in relation to a greater number of fire doors that should not prevent the claimants from recovering anything.  Taking an approximate approach and erring on the side of caution I am satisfied that 50% of the total require replacement and that the appropriate course is to reduce the total claim relating to the fire doors by one third.   </p>

However that is based on an email from Mainstay to Ms Bedi which, although it refers to bricking up, could just as well be a lazy or mistaken reference to the incombustible boards which are recorded as having been installed.  I am satisfied on the basis of that evidence that the claim is made out as claimed and costed and the lift exception is plainly not engaged. </p>

The evidence shows that for it to be a present or imminent danger it would be necessary for a flat occupant or invitee (such as an electrician) to be inside the cylinder cupboard at a time when a discharge of high temperature water or steam might occur and for the overflow to be incapable of being accommodated by the discharge system, notwithstanding its non-compliance.    </p>

However it is a truism that events such as this can and will occur even though they are statistically unlikely to happen at any given moment in time.  It cannot be said that the discharge of high temperature water or steam cannot occur (indeed ZIP’s expert accepted that it could) and it also cannot be said that the discharge system will undoubtedly safely carry any such discharge away (in circumstances where the Bldg Regs and technical requirements have been contravened in a material way).  In such circumstances, it seems to me that the risk must be present or imminent even if it is a remote risk.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that the claim succeeds. </p>

Furthermore, as he also said, the current market in the Manchester area is buoyant such that contractors would not be inclined to offer or accept discounts from their usual rates on this basis. I accept and prefer Mr Bramall’s opinion on this issue, in circumstances where it does not seem to me that this work is obviously attractive compared to other jobs and where Mr Bramall seems to me to have rather better knowledge of the local market than Ms Nash.

It is important to bear in mind that my task is to ascertain the reasonable cost of the remedial works for which the claimants are entitled to be indemnified.  That is different from the task which a quantity surveyor is asked to perform in a usual construction project, which is simply to assess the likely total out-turn cost of a project by reference both to the vicissitudes inherent in any project and also to the risks referable to the particular project given such matters as the extent to which the works have already been designed, the extent to which – for example – ground conditions have already been investigated and the extent to which fit-out choices are liable to fluctuate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in">Moreover, as Ms Nash said, the impact of the remedial works will be substantial in that the roof and external walls will (on my findings) have to be completely stripped down to the steel structure and rebuilt, leaving only the structure and internal parts.  To that extent the scope for known unknowns or unknown unknowns is correspondingly reduced.  Whilst it is true that it is possible that the structure, once fully exposed, will transpire to be defective in some as yet unknown way, given the age and complexity of the structure it is not immediately obvious that this is a high risk area and of course the main issue in relation to the structure, the adequacy of the fire protection, has already been fully investigated and catered for.   </p>

If for example it transpires that there is a serious problem with a nonloadbearing element which does not represent a present or imminent danger then the work may have to be done and funded by the claimants but ZIP will not be liable to pay for that work.

In my draft judgment I said that I would leave it to the claimants and ZIP’s legal advisers to consider and discuss with a view, if possible, to reaching agreement as to whether it is a worthwhile exercise.  That process did not produce any agreement.  In the circumstances I will limit myself to recording that: (a) the claimants contend that but for the impact of the maximum liability provisions they would have been entitled to judgment for a sum in excess of £9.7 million exclusive of any claim for VAT; (b) ZIP does not accept this; and (c) I will determine whether or not any and if so which further determinations should be made at the hearing of all consequential matters.   </p>

The first is ZIP’s argument that any monies payable to Walker Morris and the Bank under the funding agreements are not monies which are payable under the contractual indemnity provided by the policy and, hence, since Walker Morris and the Bank have “first call” on any recoveries, any claim must be reduced to the extent of those claims.  The second is ZIP’s argument that, given the amount of the recovery and the amounts which will be deducted from the recovery before monies are available for reinstatement, there is no real likelihood of sufficient monies being available to undertake reinstatement and, in such circumstances, if there is no reinstatement there is no indemnity. The third is ZIP’s argument that the claimants have given control of the decision whether or not to reinstate to the Bank and now 123 Pay in circumstances where, ZIP submits, there is no realistic likelihood that the Bank and now 123 Pay will do anything other than elect to receive its share of the recoveries rather than to agree to reinstatement. </p>

It is important to note, as the claimants submit, that the definition of lender liabilities limits this obligation to sums loaned to the claimants to cover their legal fees including disbursements.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.10in;text-indent:0.5in">Even so, I am far from convinced that this would represent a just outcome.  In many cases where an insurer under an unvalued policy wrongly declines indemnity it will be necessary for the insured to incur a liability for legal costs, which may well in today’s legal climate include the costs of obtaining third party funding, which may well include costs and associated liabilities which will not be fully recouped from the insurer even in the event of a successful outcome.  If it was open to insurers to argue that they should not have to indemnify to the extent that the insured has incurred irrecoverable costs simply to obtain indemnity from the insurer that appears to me to be an abuse.  The answer may be that the question should not be considered by reference to the position as at trial but as it would have been as at the point the insurer should have indemnified and not refused indemnity, unless it can be said that it would not be unjust to have regard to supervening events.  Since this point has not been argued before me and since it is not strictly necessary for me to deal with the issue I say no more about it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.10in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second point, in Appendix 4 to their closing submissions ZIP provided an analysis of the sums which will have to be deducted from any damages awarded to the claimant in order to illustrate the financial outcome.  It is obviously provisional, but it is helpful in providing a broad idea of potential outcomes.  It included the outcome which I have decided applies, namely that the claimants are limited to the maximum value of £3.63M.  It suggests that if one deducts from that recovery the irrecoverable costs which the claimants will have incurred including any adverse costs ordered in favour of ZBC on the assumption – as had transpired – that the claim fails against ZBC and that the ATE policy does not pick up that adverse cost exposure then the end result is that the claimants will have a deficit of around £500,000.   </p>

In that respect it was agreed in closing submissions that this section of the judgment would be provisional and the parties might, if necessary, seek to make further submissions on the details post promulgation if necessary.  Whilst it is not necessary for further submissions to be made given that these conclusions are all hypothetical, ZIP’s Appendix 4 does indicate that on any view there is a real risk that the claimants will end up with insufficient to undertake anything like the programme of works necessary to resolve even the most serious of the matters considered in this judgment, particularly the fire safety related matters which as matters currently stand have left the building empty.    </p>

This provides that it is for the “project manager” (to be appointed by the “lender” – now 123 Pay, but required to act as a trustee on behalf of all of the “proprietors” – defined as the individual leaseholder claimants, Zagora and CJS) to determine “in his/her absolute discretion”, and the lender to agree, whether it is in the best interests of the proprietors as a whole to undertake the remedial works (as defined) and, if so, to use the net recoveries for that purpose.  If the project manager determines, and the lender agrees, that it is not in the best interests of the proprietors as a whole to undertake the remedial works then under clause 5.2 the net recoveries are used to pay the “leaseholder liabilities” (in summary, the leaseholders, which includes CJS, are paid out proportionate to the square footage of their flats). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.10in;text-indent:0.5in">It was a major plank of ZIP’s case that the Bank, which effectively controlled CJS through the administrators, would have no incentive to fund remedial works when it could “take the money and run” by refusing agreement to remedial works.  Although in closing submissions the claimants submitted that its right so to act was restricted by its right only to refuse consent where it was not in the best interests of the proprietors as a whole to undertake the remedial works, I am very doubtful that this is a limitation which could be policed by the court; if the project manager has an absolute discretion then surely so must the Bank and it would be difficult in my view successfully to challenge a refusal to agree save in the most manifestly unreasonable of cases.  On any view, if the analysis by ZIP in Appendix 4 is anything like realistic it is very difficult to see how any refusal of consent could be categorised as manifestly unreasonable.           </p>

Instead, 123 Pay are positively incentivised to support the remedial works being undertaken if they exercise their option to acquire the CJS flats from the administrators on the terms provided in the option agreement. </p>

As my decision has revealed: (a) if Zagora had succeeded against ZIP under the agreement to rectify it would have been on the basis that at the time ZIP (through David Robinson and Mr Parvin) was perfectly willing to allow Zagora to recover the cost of remedial works without deduction for the CJS flat percentage either on a commercial basis or – according to Mr Parvin – on the basis of a tenable interpretation of the policies; (b) the individual leaseholders have succeeded against ZIP on the basis that on the proper interpretation of the policy any individual flat-owner can recover the full cost of repairs to the common parts in a present or imminent danger case even if the other flat-owners could not also have recovered on that basis.  In the circumstances there was nothing wrong in the Bank seeking to fund the claimants in litigating to recover on either basis. </p>

I am not persuaded from the evidence before me that this was always the Bank’s fixed intention come what may.  If that had been the case there would have been no point in setting up the detailed provisions of clause 5 of the Priority Deed which clearly envisaged that remedial works would be undertaken under the decision and direction of an independent person if there was sufficient money to do so.  Indeed one may query why the individual leaseholders were willing to continue the action if their understanding or advice was that this was all an elaborate charade for the Bank to be paid out and for them to be left with a payout but an ongoing liability under the lease.    </p>

In his opinion, no reasonably competent Building Control Officer should have issued the 3 Final Certificates referred to”. </p>

Mr Mather was keen to seek to complete the building control function in relation to New Lawrence House as soon as possible so as to avoid the difficulty of having to deal with the serious concerns expressed by Manchester Building Control with the associated risk of its taking back the building control function in relation to the development. He was also keen to seek to complete the building control function so as to, in popular parlance, get JCS off his back and reduce the overall amount of work on his plate. Knowing that Mr Eadsforth was about to leave ZBG at the end of December 2009 and knowing that Mr Nicholls was effectively no longer involved in undertaking the building warranty surveying function in relation to the development gave him another strong incentive to complete the building warranty function as soon as possible for similar reasons. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">I am properly conscious of the need to be satisfied that there is clear and compelling evidence before finding Mr Mather guilty of deceit.  However, having carefully considered the evidence and rival submissions I am satisfied that the claimants have made out their case.  In particular, I am satisfied that in December 2009 Mr Mather knew that the position was very different from how it would have been expected to be had the normal system been operating properly. He knew that there were real concerns about fire safety provision in the development which had to be addressed before Bldg Regs final certificates could properly be issued insofar as they impacted on the safety of the means of escape through the common areas.  He knew, I am satisfied, that he and Mr Eadsforth were working together at this stage, without Mr Eadsforth being accompanied or supervised by Mr Nicholls, to satisfy themselves that the flats could be passed on the final stage 08 inspections and final building warranty insurance certificates issued as well as Bldg Regs final certificates issued before the Christmas shutdown. He undertook a number of joint inspections with Mr Eadsforth in November and December 2009. I am quite satisfied that he was as aware as Mr Eadsforth undoubtedly was as to the ongoing serious non-compliances with fire safety provision, particularly in relation to the absence of protection for structural steelwork and lack of fire compartmentation. I am quite satisfied that he was not informed by Mr Eadsforth at any time prior to 15 or 21 December 2009 that these non-compliances had been attended to and, from his own inspections he must have known that to be the case. I am quite satisfied that he could not have relied and did not rely upon the final stage 08 inspections or final building warranty insurance certificates issued by Mr Eadsforth in November and December 2009 as demonstrating that Mr Eadsforth was reasonably satisfied that these non-compliances had been attended to, when he was aware from his own inspections that they had not been attended to. In circumstances where he must have known, both from what he was told by Manchester Building Control and by JCS and from his own attendances, that at least some of the flats were already occupied, I am satisfied that he persuaded himself that it was safe to sign off the Bldg Regs final certificates on the basis that the individual flats could reasonably be signed off even though the means of escape were not safe, relying on JCS’ assurances that the fire safety non-compliances would be attended to in the New Year. </p>

At the very least I am satisfied Mr Mather could not positively have believed and did not positively believe, in the light of his involvement in November and December 2009, that ZBC had taken reasonable steps so far as compliance with fire safety was concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">I am conscious that these findings may raise the question as to what Mr Eadsforth’s state of mind was in December 2009 when he was signing off individual flats - and therefore generating the building warranty final insurance certificates - and at least one cover note.  In the absence of his having been asked questions on the point it does not seem to me that I am in a position to make positive findings.  Nor in my view is it necessary for me to do so for the purposes of this case.  The case is pleaded and put solely against Mr Mather.  It does not depend, either from a pleaded or a necessary basis, upon my having to find that there must have been some conspiracy as between Mr Mather and Mr Eadsforth.

Specifically, I am quite satisfied that he did not and could not have believed that whatever he might have seen or might have been told in September 2010 could have changed the position. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">It is, as I have already recorded, not necessary for me to make any positive finding as to Mr Mather’s motive in acting in this manner.  Indeed Mr Asquith went further and submitted that I should not make a finding as to motive when the claimants had consciously declined to plead or assert a specific motive.  Nonetheless I am satisfied that the explanation for Mr Mather acting in this way was, as I have already said in section 4 above, that whilst he knew that by November 2009 this was not a normal job where he could safely rely on the skill and experience of Mr Nicholls in surveying and certifying, he knew that he could not blindly rely on Mr Eadsforth as an inexperienced junior employee who he was effectively supervising, and he knew that he could not blithely rely on JCS’ assurance on matters as critical as fire safety in relation to means of escape, he was under such pressure of work that he did not conduct the careful and detailed inspections which he knew he needed to do before he could conscientiously issue Bldg Regs final certificates and, feeling himself between the rock of pressure from JCS and the hard place of the concerns being expressed by Manchester Building Control, decided that he just wanted to get this job off his desk regardless.  All this explains why he did something which, I accept, he would not have done under normal circumstances.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.33 The ZBC claimants also submitted in their written opening that: “A common theme in the ZBC Leaseholders’ evidence is that many of them were relying on their conveyancers to make sure that the appropriate documentation was in place before they were willing to purchase their flats.  Such documentation likely included the Final Certificates because (a) that is what a prudent conveyancer would seek to obtain (see section I1.4 of The Law Society’s Conveyancing Handbook (24th ed 2017)) … and (b) clause 11 of the sale agreements in which JCS specifically provided that the Development (not just the individual flat) was deemed to comply with Bldg Regs provided it had been inspected and approved by the Building Inspector.  There is no suggestion that ZBC contends that reliance can not be through an agent (such as a conveyancer) ….  In any event, reliance by an agent will suffice: see <span style="font-style:italic">Gross v Hillman</span> [1970] Ch 445, 461 and the final sentence of <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (32nd ed 2015) paragraph 7-031.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.34 Again, Mr Asquith objected that reliance by the ZBC claimants upon their conveyancing solicitors was not a pleaded case. Again I agreed and again the ZBC claimants applied for permission to amend. I granted permission to amend to plead the allegation, on the basis that it would be addressed and determined solely on the basis of the documentary and witness statement evidence already adduced by the ZBC claimants, which I was satisfied that ZBC had come to trial prepared to meet. I also permitted the ZBC claimants to amend to include an allegation that their conveyancing solicitors had relied upon the Bldg Regs final certificates but refused them permission to include an allegation that it should be presumed that they had done so, either in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic">Dadourian</span> case or on the basis of an argument that it would have been negligent for them not to have ensured that Bldg Regs final certificates were in place before exchange or completion.  Thus the pleaded case in its amended form said that: “In reliance upon: (a) the existence of the [relevant Bldg Regs final certificate] and consequently (b) the misrepresentations contained therein and/or (c) their conveyancing solicitors, the [relevant ZBC claimant] and/or their conveyancing solicitors as their agents completed the purchases on their respective ZBC Flats”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.35 In closing submissions it was made clear on behalf of the ZBC claimants that, having reflected on the evidence which had been adduced, whilst all of them pursued the claim on the basis of reliance on their conveyancing solicitors who themselves relied upon the Bldg Regs final certificates, only four, namely Zagora, Mr Manchikalapati, Mr Gledhill and Mr Hussain were also pursuing claims based on their own reliance.  Given my conclusions in section 5 I have no doubt that neither Mr Manchikalapati nor Mr Gledhill can succeed in establishing personal reliance.  I shall return to Mr Hussain below. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.36 I shall also consider the case of Zagora separately from and subsequent to the cases of the individual leaseholder ZBC claimants. There are two reasons for that. The first is that my consideration of its claim as regards reliance is strictly not necessary for the determination of its claim, which has already failed on the first hurdle of intention. The second is that it raises different factual issues from those raised by the individual leaseholders.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.37 One overarching point made by the ZBC claimants is that it was not necessary for them or their conveyancing solicitors actually to have read the Bldg Regs final certificates to have relied upon them. This was not contested in terms by ZBC, in my view rightly so. That is because if it is possible to conclude on the evidence that either the individual claimant or his conveyancing solicitor had become aware of the existence of the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate prior to purchase or completion and was aware that it confirmed that the property had been inspected and signed off by the approved building inspector and, even if unconsciously, viewed this as confirmation that the job had been done properly by the approved building inspector, then that in my view would amount to sufficient reliance. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.38 A further overarching point made by the ZBC claimants is that it was sufficient for them or their conveyancing solicitors to have become aware of the existence of the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate prior to completion, even if they were not aware of its existence prior to exchange. ZBC disputed this on the basis that once the ZBC claimants had exchanged contracts they were committed to the purchase of the flat and, therefore, becoming aware of and relying on the existence of the Bldg Regs final certificate between exchange and completion would be irrelevant. In my view that is true as a statement of the general position. However, given the terms and effect of the relevant sale contracts, as discussed in section 3 above at paragraphs [insert], it seems to me that in principle it might be possible for an individual ZBC claimant to prove that he or his conveyancing solicitors had relied upon the existence of the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate in the context of a decision whether or not to agree to proceed to completion or to contest being compelled to complete on the basis that the individual flat or the whole development had not been properly completed. </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.39 Another overarching point made by ZBC is that the only difference between the 11 leaseholder claimants who bring a claim against it and the remaining 15 who do not is that each of the ZBC claimants completed the purchase of their flats after the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate was issued, whereas each of the non-ZBC claimants did not. Indeed, in some cases the same claimants bring a claim against ZBC in respect of flats completed after the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate was issued but do not bring a claim in respect of flats purchased before that date. This is notwithstanding that in several cases the same firms of solicitors acted for the ZBC claimants and the non-ZBC claimants.  </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.40 The ZBC claimants submit that this is a non-point, because it is obvious that those claimants who completed on their flats before the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate was issued cannot, as a matter of chronological logic, have relied on non-existent certificates and, hence, cannot have a claim against ZBC. ZBC, however, submits that this misunderstands the point which it is making, which is that if it was so important for a prospective purchaser and/or their conveyancing solicitors to know that there was a Bldg Regs final certificate in place, because of the additional security which that gave, then why did the non-ZBC claimants complete and, more pertinently, why did their – often the same - conveyancing solicitors not advise them that they should not complete unless and until a Bldg Regs final certificate had been issued? </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.41 The ZBC claimants are, it seems to me, unable to answer this point. They are unable to adduce any evidence from their conveyancing solicitors which might explain the apparent difference in view between those who completed before and those who completed after Bldg Regs final certificates were issued. The only obvious explanation, which would be fatal to the ZBC claimants’ case, is that the conveyancing solicitors who acted for the ZBC claimants did not in fact consider the Bldg Regs final certificates to be important. In my view this is the only sensible conclusion to be drawn from the evidence which has been placed before me.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in">11.42 There is a complete absence of evidence that any of the ZBC claimants or their conveyancing solicitors were provided with the relevant Bldg Regs final certificate either before exchange or before completion.  There is no suggestion that they asked for it or sought to obtain some comfort, legal or otherwise, that it would be provided.  Nor is that particularly surprising, given that any sensible purchaser and his conveyancing solicitor would be far more interested in the fact that JCS was able to offer a ZBG building warranty as part of the sale package, since that was a policy which was directly enforceable by the purchaser against a blue-chip insurer in accordance with its terms in the event of any breach of Bldg Regs whereas – as any lawyer would know, either through existing familiarity with <span style="font-style:italic">Anns v Merton LBC</span> or a modicum of research – no claim could be made against the building control inspector even on proof of negligence, since only proof of fraud would suffice.   </p>

However they did not, making the trigger the provision of the cover note. There is no basis for inferring that the conveyancing solicitors would have believed there to have been a necessary correlation between the issue of the cover note and the issue of the Bldg Regs final certificate such that the issue of the cover note must have meant that the Bldg Regs final certificate had already been issued. Contractually, there is no relationship between the two.  In practice, as this case has revealed, the cover note should be followed by the building warranty final certificate and then by the Bldg Regs final certificate, but the process of issuing a cover note is a separate process from the issue of the Bldg Regs final certificate.  </p>

I am satisfied that the real question is the reliance of Mr Syed who, I am satisfied, was undoubtedly acting as agent of Mr Hussain for all relevant purposes. The evidence shows clearly that before completion he had been made aware of and received a copy of the Bldg Regs final certificate. It is also clear that he was not prepared to accept that certificate as conclusive, because he was challenging both JCS and Mr Mather as regards what he regarded as the remaining unresolved defective state of the opening windows. Moreover, there is no clear documentary evidence which shows that he believed or he was being advised by the conveyancing solicitors that the issue of the certificate would prevent Mr Hussain from contesting his obligation to complete on the basis of the ongoing problem with the french windows and balcony. </p>

It must be borne in mind that at no time prior to exchange was the Bldg Regs final certificate even in existence, let alone referred to. It follows, in my view, that it could only have been relied upon prior to completion on the basis that it influenced the decision whether or not to complete. There is simply no documentary evidence which shows that it did influence that decision. It was only produced because Manchester Building Control suggested that Mr Syed should check that it related to the right flat. It was not deployed by JCS to force Mr Hussain to complete.  There is no credible evidence that Mr Hussain’s solicitor or Mr Hussain or Mr Syed believed that it did.  The email written to Mr Mather the day after completion is in my judgment not credible as an accurate record of fact; if Mr Syed had genuinely believed that Mr Hussain was compelled to purchase because of the certificate then I have no doubt that he would have continued to correspond with Mr Mather from March 2010 onwards to seek to persuade him to accept that the certificate should be withdrawn or suspended until the ongoing problem with the opening windows as he perceived it had been resolved.  It seems to me that he is just writing to preserve Mr Hussain’s position in relation to any potential future claim.  There is no credible evidence that Mr Syed had any positive belief in the accuracy of the certificate other than in relation to the opening doors.  Indeed, there is no credible evidence that he had any positive belief in its accuracy at all.   </p>

Even his knowledge in August 2012, once he had been in contact with Freehold Managers and Mainstay and had received the risk assessments produced by BDW which clearly indicated problems with fire safety, would not have been sufficient.  Nor would his knowledge by January 2013, when he obtained the surveyor’s report which identified fire safety and structural defects to the common parts, but did not make any reference to the possibility that the Bldg Regs final certificate ought never to have been issued, have been sufficient.

Nonetheless on balance I do not consider that this was enough for him with reasonable diligence to commence an investigation with legal and expert assistance which would have provided him with sufficient knowledge by August 2011.

Assuming I am wrong as regards reliance, by 5 July 2010 Mr Syed clearly believed at that point that the certificate was wrongly issued and that had reasonable steps been taken by Mr Mather it would not have been issued.  By that stage Mr Syed had already previously been advised by Manchester Building Control to commission a survey and instruct a solicitor.  Mr Hussain cannot seek to argue that this knowledge of his agent should not be attributed to him since the email was sent to him for him to send on to Mr Mather and he cannot say: “I did not bother reading it”.  Whilst knowledge of the problem with the balcony is not knowledge of the other defects, had Mr Hussain acted reasonably and made further enquiries with Mr Syed it would not have been unreasonable for him to have acted as recommended by Manchester Building Control.  In such circumstances there is no reason to believe that the other serious problems with the development, specifically the fire safety issues, would not have been revealed in the same way as they were seen by the surveyor instructed by Mr Tarasov later on.  There is no reason to believe that Manchester Building Control would not have been prepared to provide copies of its correspondence with ZBC.  On any view well before August 2011 Mr Hussain would have had the requisite knowledge.  Insofar as the only reason given by Mr Syed for not following the advice from Manchester Building Control was a lack of funds that cannot be a sufficient answer, at least in the context of a buy-to-let investor who ought to have been extremely concerned about the risk of harm to his tenants and who has not adduced evidence that he would not have been able to afford relatively modest expenditure. </p>

In cross-examination Mr Broadhurst accepted that it was Zagora’s conveyancing solicitors who were responsible for these costs being incurred. In closing submissions Zagora argued that this was irrelevant, since: “ZBC is responsible for all the loss that flows from a transaction induced by its fraud. Accordingly, it does not lie in the mouth of ZBC to say that the losses claimed could not reasonably have been foreseen (<span style="font-style:italic">Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd</span> [1969] 2 QB 158, at 167). The rule of law is that any damage directly flowing from the fraudulent inducement may be recovered unless it is caused by the claimant behaving completely without prudence or common sense (<span style="font-style:italic">Doyle v Olby</span>)”. I agree with that submission. Therefore, these losses can be recovered.  Mr Asquith invited me to clarify whether the same reasoning leads me to reject his further argument, raised in closing submissions, that Zagora had, but did not take, the opportunity to proceed with a loan from RBS at a lower rate in May 2013 and I can confirm that it does.  Moreover, I agree with Mr Selby that this submission is not made out on the facts, since it is based solely upon a passing answer from Mr Robinson in cross-examination by Mr Baatz on a point which had not previously been raised in terms by ZBC nor taken up or further investigated with Zagora at trial.  </p>

Since there will be no judgment in favour of any of the claimants against ZBC, there is no need for me to determine anything other than the principle between the parties. I do not need to decide figures. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In paragraph 206 it is submitted by ZBC that Zagora’s claim for diminution in value should not have as its starting point the defect free valuation, £410,000, since Zagora was aware of some defects in the development prior to purchase. It is common ground as I understand it that the starting point should be the actual price paid, which seems to me to be correct in principle.  Mr Asquith invited me to clarify whether or not I had rejected his argument in closing submissions that ZBC did not cause Zagora any loss because Zagora decided to hold on to the freehold in May 2013 after becoming aware of the fire safety issues and despite receiving some expressions of interest.  I clarify that I do reject this argument on the basis that: (a) this evidence does not detract from the evidence, agreed between the experts, that objectively there was a diminution in value; (b) there is no evidence that it could in fact have re-sold the freehold in May 2013 or subsequently at the same price as it paid for it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">In paragraph 210 and onwards ZBC submit that the valuation should take into account the value attributed to the ZBG building warranty. The point, as I understand it, is that if a valuer was aware of the presence of defects, but also aware that they would be covered by the warranty insurance, then there would be no basis for discounting for the cost of remedial works if they were going to be paid by the insurer anyway. Subject to points about the excess and any discount to reflect any uncertainty and aggravation, that argument seems to me to be correct in principle. However, Mr Selby made what seems to me to be an unanswerable point in response, which was that under the structural defects policy here there was an exclusion for anything known about by the insured when purchasing the flat. On that basis, if a valuer was valuing a flat for a prospective purchaser which had the benefit of this policy but was known to have defects, the valuer would have to proceed on the basis that the policy would not pay out in respect of those defects anyway.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.00in">Asquith suggested that this consequence could be avoided by the vendor agreeing to make the warranty claim and then either to assign the claim to the purchaser or to agree to pass any recovery to the purchaser, that argument falls foul of the further provision in the policy that a homeowner is not entitled to make or continue a claim under the policy once he has sold or otherwise disposed of his interest in the flat. As Mr Selby submitted, in the real world no prospective purchaser is going to take on this level of risk in relation to what otherwise ought to be a straightforward purchase of a simple buy to let investment flat in a new build development in Manchester. In the circumstances, I also agree that the appropriate deduction for the aggravation factor should be 10% and not 5% as suggested by Mr Massie, ZBC’s valuer, on the basis of the warranty cover being in place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">However, given my conclusions in relation to the proper construction of the leases, I reject the argument advanced by the claimants that the valuation both of the individual flats and of the freehold should take into account that the leaseholders would not in fact be obliged to contribute towards the cost of repairing the pre-existing defects in the development the subject matter of this case, since I am satisfied that in fact this is not the case. The position, as I am satisfied it is, is that the works ought in principle to be done by a properly constituted management company and then recovered pro rata from the individual flat owners. On that basis, there is no appreciable risk factor.  As invited by Mr Asquith, for clarity I confirm that I reject the claimants’ submission based on its analysis of the proper construction of the leases and the evidence of its expert Mr Taylor that the freehold and leasehold interests in the development are valueless. </p>

Given my conclusions on liability, I do not propose to undertake that analysis in this judgment.  In relation to Zagora I clarify, as invited by Mr Asquith and agreed by Mr Selby, that it is common ground that the diminution in value would be £25,000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.00in">“The general rule is that loss which has or could have been avoided is not recoverable as damages, although expense reasonably incurred in avoiding it may be recoverable as a cost of mitigation. To this there is an exception for collateral payments (<span style="font-style:italic">res inter alios acta</span>), which the law treats as not making good the claimant’s loss. It is difficult to identify a single principle underlying each case. In spite of what the Latin tag might lead one to expect, the critical factor is not the source of the benefit in a third party but its character. Broadly speaking, collateral benefits are those whose receipt arose independently of the circumstances giving rise to the loss…The same is true of a benefit received by right from a third party in respect of the loss, but for which the claimant has given a consideration independent of the legal relationship with the defendant from which the loss arose.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in">Applying that approach the proper analysis in this case, notwithstanding the close factual connection between ZIP and ZBC, is that the claimants were – on the assumption that they established liability against ZBC - induced into purchasing flats which they would not otherwise have purchased as a result of the deceit of ZBC as to their proper performance of its duty as building control inspector. They are entitled to damages for the losses flowing as a result. Separately, as part of the commercial transaction with the vendor, they obtained the benefit of buildings warranty insurance cover. There is no basis in principle, in my judgment, for requiring them to give credit for their recovery under that insurance policy. </p>
