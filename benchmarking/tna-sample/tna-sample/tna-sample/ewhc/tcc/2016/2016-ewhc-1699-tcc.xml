	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">Large-scale civil engineering and infrastructure projects routinely give rise to public benefit and private detriment, whether they be in the Cotswolds or the Andes.  This case involves the consequences of laying a pipeline in Colombia in the mid-1990s, which ran from the oil-fields of Cusiana and Cupiagua in the South to the sea at Coveñas in the North.  Construction work commenced in about December 1995 and continued until August 1997 {J24/82T/1}.  The pipeline is known as the Ocensa pipeline for reasons that will appear.  It passed through regions characterised by difficult terrain, fragile soils, tropical rainfall, and a lawless lack of security; and in doing so it passed through many and varied private land-holdings.  For all of these reasons it was a challenging undertaking.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The benefits of such a pipeline to the Colombian economy and public need hardly be stated.  At the same time, the potential detriments to private landowners whose properties were affected by the creation of and works on a Right of Way [“the ROW”] that was seldom (if ever) less than 25 metres wide and in which the pipeline was laid are easy to imagine.  In particular, it was well known at all material times that the stripping of the land, storage of quantities of soil, working with heavy machinery, and crossing of watercourses gave rise to a risk of erosion of materials from the ROW, especially if disturbed or newly reinstated soil was subject to heavy rainfall.  To obviate that risk, temporary and permanent works were undertaken that were intended to minimise or prevent erosion.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">There was nothing new in the recognition of the risks inherent in the laying of the Ocensa pipeline, though the protective techniques were subject to development with time.  One of the features of the Ocensa project was that for much of its course it followed the path of another pipeline [“the ODC pipeline”] so that much of the work for the Ocensa pipeline took place on or adjacent to what had been the ROW for the ODC pipeline when it had been laid in about 1990-1992. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">This litigation is brought by 109 claimants in respect of 73 farms, each of whom claims that the Ocensa pipeline caused damage for which he or she should be compensated.  It is brought in England because the Defendant was at the relevant time an English subsidiary of BP and was involved in the Ocensa project.  The substantive claims are subject to the Colombian law of torts and contract.  The State of Colombia formally recognises the public benefit attaching to oil pipeline projects and has established a regulatory legal framework that reflects the tension between public benefit and private detriment to which I have already referred.  Whether and to what extent that framework creates, limits or excludes private law rights is only one of the elements of Colombian law affecting the outcome of this litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The existence of 74 claims led the parties and the Court initially to choose 10 and to treat them as “lead cases” in the hope that decisions of the Court on those 10 would lead to resolution of all or most of the others.  This approach was proportionate, sensible and inevitable given that each claim is fact specific and, although financially significant for the individual claimants, the claims are not enormous in absolute terms.  In the event, as the accumulated evidence for the lead cases expanded, the parties agreed that it was only feasible to try four cases in the period allotted by the Court for </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">the trial.  This judgment is the result of the trial of those four cases, which took 62 court days of openings, evidence and closing submissions.  The time spent in court was only the tip of an iceberg of time and effort invested by the parties.  The trial bundle was about 135,000 pages, including expert evidence that took up about 45,000 pages.  The Court did not visit Colombia but over 20 hours of film footage and many photographs have been available which provide important evidence both for the experts and for the Court.  Closing submissions were formidably ordered, crossreferenced and presented in texts of over 2400 pages plus numerous attachments.  It might be thought that, with such an abundance of material, no stone has been left unturned, and so it has sometimes felt.  Even so, the documentation was not complete, not every witness who might have had relevant evidence to give was called, and the pressures on those conducting the litigation to concentrate on a selection of the most important aspects of the litigation were considerable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">Because I have been unable to make the judgment shorter, I should issue two health warnings for anyone tempted to read it.  First, while the trial and its outcome are of intense interest to those directly involved, I doubt whether my attempts to determine how the Supreme Court of Colombia would apply Colombian law to the facts of these cases will interest or influence either English or Colombian lawyers who are not obliged to read them.  Second, I think it unlikely that the detailed facts underlying the individual claims will be of general interest.  Also, it should be understood that, although I have considered and taken into account the entirety of the closing submissions on both sides (including following every hyperlinked reference in those submissions) when preparing and writing the judgment I have not attempted to set out every argument or to refer to every piece of evidence in the judgment.  To follow the traditional format of setting out both sides’ arguments and all of the evidence relied upon would probably have doubled the length of the judgment and the time taken to produce it.  I have therefore attempted to synthesise the positions adopted and the main arguments advanced by the parties, without necessarily setting out everything on which the parties have relied, and have referred to evidence to the extent necessary for coherence.  In particular, I have generally given the page reference for the evidence on which I have relied for my findings rather than setting out all relevant evidence either by reference or in full.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">In briefest outline, I have concluded that all four of the Lead Claims that are the direct subject of this action fail.  Very largely they fail on the facts; but I have in each case also considered the legal basis on which the Claims were brought and the application of relevant principles of Colombian Law to each claim.  The purpose of this judgment is to decide the four Trial Lead Claims and to provide a basis for the resolution of the claims regarding the 69 farms that were not considered in detail at the trial.  To that end I have, as requested, made extensive findings about Colomibian Law irrespective of their direct applicability to the four Trial Lead Cases.  I have also considered the entire body of expert evidence in considerable detail, outlining what appear to an English Court to be the strengths and weaknesses of the expert evidence that was led and tested at trial.  That has been made necessary partly in order to reach necessary findings in the Trial Lead Cases and partly so that the parties may appreciate their general position on the expert evidence when considering the merits of the cases that were not tried. </p>

Of those called to give evidence for the Defendant, Mr Spence and Mr Jones are now resident in England and gave the impression of being from the United Kingdom.  To the contrary, however, Mr Allison is resident in South Australia and gives the impression of being Australian.  The other witnesses give the impression (by name, language and current address) of being South American and, in general, it cannot be said that the nationality of those employed by the Defendant provides a substantial connection between the Defendant in its dealings with the Claimants and the United Kingdom.  The project was carried out in Colombia.  The day-to-day management of the administration of the contract had some connection with Houston but was overwhelmingly in Colombia.  The Claimants are Colombian and their land (the subject of this litigation) is in Colombia.  To the extent that any contracts were entered into between the Defendant, Ocensa or Saipem and the Claimants, it is common ground that they were governed by Colombian Law.  Any breaches of contract and any breaches of non-contractual obligations happened in Colombia.  The alleged damage was suffered in Colombia.  The Defendant, though incorporated in England, had a branch legally established in Colombia by means of registered public deed and was dedicated (in name and in practice) to working in Colombia.  The works were carried out subject to the regulatory regime in force in Colombia, upon which the Defendant relies as excluding any liability it might otherwise have to the Claimants: see [24] ff below.  On the Defendant’s case, therefore, Colombian law is integral to the issue of non-contractual liability before 1 May 1996 just as it is to the equivalent issue after that date.</p>

If uninfluenced by the pressures of potential litigation I strongly suspect that the Defendant would have had the same expectation: if it didn’t, in my judgment, it should have done.</p>

This means that it is not necessary to attempt to disentangle pre- and post-1 May 1996 acts and omissions with a view to judging them by different systems of law; but that is a consequence of my conclusion rather than a reason for it.</p>

As will be seen below, there was eventually a large measure of agreement between them and, where they disagreed, on some occasions I prefer the evidence of Professor Castro and on others the evidence of Professor Vallejo.  Each party attempted fundamentally to undermine the approach and evidence of the other side’s expert and, in my judgment, neither party succeeded.  There were, however, distinct differences in the characteristics and approach of each expert.  Professor Vallejo grounded himself more closely and more rigorously on the provisions of the various norms of Colombian law (as explained below).  His original report was also more thorough in identifying relevant legal provisions than was Professor Castro’s.  His approach was criticised by the Claimants as being too narrow and doctrinaire.  Had he been giving evidence about English law (or another common law system) this might have had more force; but I am persuaded that his approach is and was appropriate when giving evidence about Colombian law, rooted as it is in written laws of various well defined hierarchical status with less emphasis being placed on the organic development of law by the Courts than appears under common law systems. Contrary to the Claimants’ submissions, I generally preferred Professor Vallejo’s levels of rigour to those of Professor Castro, who on occasions frankly accepted that her view of what the law should be differed from a strict (and, in my view, correct) interpretation of what it is.  That said, I do not accept that her objectivity was seriously compromised: the two examples cited by the Defendants in their closing submissions {C4/4.6/37} seemed to me at the time and still seem to be examples of comments that might come naturally to an academic foreign lawyer who </p>

She did not give adequate consideration to the regulatory framework, even when it should have been apparent from Professor Vallejo’s first report that it was an important area where the Court would be assisted by thorough expert evidence.  And (as I detail later at [82]ff below) her use of citations was not always reliable.  While these are valid criticisms, they fall far short of persuading me that I should always prefer the evidence of Professor Vallejo without further thought.  Therefore, while recording that there were valid criticisms to be made of her evidence, I have reviewed all areas of material dispute between her and Professor Vallejo in an attempt to identify where each expert was or was not correct on given points; and I do not think it would be useful to add yet further to this judgment by discussing each of the criticisms made of her, any more than it would be profitable to discuss each criticism made by the Claimants of Professor Vallejo. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Colombian private law (civil and commercial) is rooted in the continental law system.  It consists mainly of written statutory laws contained in Codes, following the French tradition of the Napoleonic Codes.  The Courts are bound by Article 230 of the Constitution to observe this codified law, with fairness, jurisprudence, and the general principles of law and scholarly authorities being “auxiliary criteria of judicial proceedings.”  What this means is that the judge’s primary obligation is to comply with and apply the law; but the judge may turn to the auxiliary criteria if she or he needs them in order to interpret and apply the law {Day22/21:14}. </p>

Second, it has led to the creation of a regulatory structure which seeks to strike the balance between private and public interests.  The regulatory structure provides the context for the laying of the Ocensa pipeline and therefore needs to be considered in some detail. </p>

Articles 109 to 118 of the 1947 Mining Code amended the provisions for assessing and payment of compensation for damage caused by exploration and exploitation.  Specifically,  Article 112 of the 1947 Mining Code provided that exploration of mines could be carried out freely in all the territory of the Republic, but that where land was settled or privately owned it was necessary to notify the owner or occupier in advance.  The owner or occupier could not oppose the carrying out of the works but was entitled to demand from the miner the value of the damages caused to him.  Article 115 provided that, when dealing with prospection or exploration, the mining company “will” guarantee with a sufficient bond, granted before the Mayoralty of the Municipality where the mine is located, the payment of the value of the damage which is caused to the owner of the lands or crops.  If the parties were not in agreement on the amount of the security, it was to be fixed by the Mayor, at the request of any of the parties, and based on an expert assessment of the possible damage.  There was nothing in Article 115 or elsewhere to suggest that an expert assessment of the possible damage under Article 115 is provisional.  Article 116 was specific to exploitation works and provided that: </p>

Where the owner has demanded payment in advance at intervals of six months, Article 116 does not expressly provide for a final and retrospective revaluation of the damage; nor does it expressly exclude it.  It merely states that the six monthly payments shall be “according to the damage assessment of the respective period”, which does not specify when that damage assessment will have been carried out but implies that it will have been carried out before the payment of the periodic compensation.

From early in the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century until 1974 the Colombian State operated a concession system for the exploitation of oil.  The concession system was superseded by the association contract system, which was introduced by Decree 2310 of 1974, and which from then on was the system by which the Colombian state regulated the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in its territory.  Association Contracts cover exploration and exploitation activities in a given area.  I refer to the association contract system in further detail at [44] below. </p>

In order to take advantage of the statement of public utility in this way, interested parties are required to submit to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum a documented application which, amongst other things, explains why the expropriations are necessary together with a list of the names of owners of affected properties and a “list of the steps that have been taken to get what is required through a contract freely entered into with [them]”: Article 84. </p>

To this extent the approach differs from that under the 1947 Mining Code, which does not exclude retrospective payment of damages if periodic payments in advance have not been demanded by the owner.  I will consider the consequences of these similarities and differences below.  The most important issue, also to be considered below at [206], is whether the effect of Article 5 of the 1954 Regulations means that, once a payment has been made in respect of the permanent works, no further compensation is payable irrespective of the extent and severity of the damage that may be caused by the permanent works. </p>

Second, Article 1 of Decree 2310 of 1974 and its regulatory Decree 743 of 1975 vested in the Board of Directors of Ecopetrol the power to design various contracting schemes and the terms of model contracts.

Clause 9 provided that exploitation works should be started on the date on which the parties recognised the existence of a commercial field (defined as “that portion of the Contracted Area that is capable of producing oil in quantities and of a quality that is economically exploitable.”).  A commercial field would be recognised by Triton informing Ecopetrol of the discovery of a commercial field and Ecopetrol accepting its existence.  By Clause 10 Triton was the Operator (defined as “the entity designated by the parties which, on behalf of the parties, directly carries out the necessary operations to exploit the oil which may be found in the Contracted Area.”) and, as such, was to have control of all the operations and activities which it deemed necessary for a technical, efficient and economical exploitation of any oil it might find in the Contracted Area.

It must not result from the deliberate actions of one of the parties: if it does, the remedy lies in dolo not error.

It only vitiates consent when it is the deed of one of the parties and when additionally it appears clear that without it the other party would not have entered into the contract (Article 1515 of the Civil Code).  The Supreme Court of Colombia has said (11 April 2000) that “Dolo implies a machination, a wilful assault against the rights and interests of the fellow man … it consists of a cunning, a deceitful conduct whose purpose is to take by surprise the consent of the victim, that is vitiated accordingly.”  In summary, (a) there must be a sort of artifice used by one party to deceive the other party, either by acts or omissions; and (b) the dolo must be determinant of the consent of the other party, meaning that the party consented to the act or contract under a mistaken belief induced by dolo.  In the absence of these two conditions, dolo does not vitiate the will and the contract remains valid, though the fact of the dolo may give rise to an action for damages for the damage it has caused {H23.2/7/442}ff. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Professor Castro argued that, in addition to the requirement that a person’s consent be non-vitiated, the requirement that there be consent carried the additional requirement that the consent be “genuine, free and spontaneous, with clear understanding of the meaning and effects of the legal act that is being consented.” {H14/1/14/} at [24], {H23.2/7/432}.  Although this assertion generated quite considerable crossexamination of the experts on either side, by the time of Closing Submissions, it was the Claimants’ case that Professor Castro’s use of the phrase “genuine, free and spontaneous” was merely intended to give the court an understanding of what the vices of consent mean in practice in Colombian Law.  In case there remains any ambiguity in the Claimants’ position it is necessary to state that I reject the suggestion that there is any additional requirement as originally formulated by Professor Castro.  Neither Article 1502 of the Civil Code nor Article 900 of the Commercial Code imposes any such additional requirement and the use of the word genuine seems entirely superfluous since, if consent is not genuine, it is not consent.  Professor Vallejo’s objection to the use of the word “genuine” was based on the concern that it might be used to introduce a subjective element into the notion of consent rather than looking for the external expression adopted by the party, which is not justified.  His objection is sound.  Similarly, if “free” is intended to mean something other than “not subject to the vitiating vice of duress” it is not clear what, if anything, it adds to the Article 1502 requirement that there be non-vitiated consent.  Professor Castro did not explain what she meant by “spontaneous” except to say that “the proof that consent must be genuine, free and spontaneous is on [sic] the provisions regarding vices of consent.” {Day20/186:10}.  I do not accept that the use of the word “spontaneous” is a legal requirement additional to the requirement that consent must not be vitiated by the vices referred to in Article 900 of the Commercial Code and Article 1502 of the Civil Code.</p>

The Experts agree that a lack of understanding (or even being unable to read or write) is not an issue of legal capacity or incapacity under Colombian Law and that illiteracy does not equate to legal incapacity.  Instead, the issue of lack of understanding can be properly addressed under the provisions governing error and dolo {H23.2/7/453}.  This is not merely theoretical.  Professor Castro accepted that many normal people do not read or understand the contracts they enter into, it being implicit in her answer that they may remain bound by the contracts {Day21/33:19}.  I address the consequences of lack of equality in bargaining power and abuse of rights at [79]ff and  [105]ff below; but lack of understanding is not without more a ground for avoiding contractual obligations either on the grounds of incapacity or as if it were a vice that vitiates consent.  </p>

To my mind, only the last of these three forms of agreement is informative.  Adopting normal English understanding of insurance policies, a policy may be a valued policy or a policy providing for payment subject to an overall limit of indemnity.  If it is a valued policy, the sum payable upon the occurrence of a contingency is determined.  If it is an unvalued policy, the basis of indemnification will (as a matter of normal practice) be defined: for example, by reference to the replacement cost of a chattel, new for old (or not), diminution in value, loss of profits (which typically includes a formula to be applied in calculation), a person’s liability to a third party, and so on depending on the type of policy concerned.  If an insurance policy were to be so deficient that it did not enable the sum payable in the event of the occurrence of an insured risk to be determined with certainty, it is not obvious why Colombian Law should regard that policy as compliant with Article 1518.  That was Professor Vallejo’s view too because “the amount, the amount of the loss, the scope, the size of the loss, is a condition, obviously a condition <span style="font-style:italic">that would have to be defined by the insurer</span>.” {Day22/88:4}.  </p>

The Claimants submit that it is “highly infeasible that a Colombian court would provide no redress to the victim of a drug trial simply because the contract did not provide a precise mechanism as to how compensation would be calculated.”  To an English lawyer that seems intuitively attractive and there are various tools or devices that might be used to ensure that compensation was paid.  However, on closer examination, problems become apparent.  First, an obvious mechanism that a lawyer would use under English law where the terms of the contract are deficient would be the use of an implied term.  But what would be the precise scope of the implied term?  A number of alternatives present themselves of which two suffice to illustrate the problem: compensation equivalent to that which would be awarded by a Court awarding damages for losses caused by established negligence; or compensation amounting to an indemnity against all losses caused by involvement in the trial, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable.  Second, English law does not have Article 1518, which on its face requires the contract itself to ensure that the sum payable is determined or determinable and appears to me to be relevant to the question whether the Colombian Court would resort to the use of an implied term to remedy the deficiency to which Article 1518 is directed.  Third, as a matter of fact pharmaceutical trials in the United Kingdom are closely regulated, one imposed requirement typically being the putting in place of an insurance policy (with a determined limit of indemnity) as protection for the subject in the event of an adverse outcome.  The existence and terms of that regulation may affect the intuitive reaction about what redress a Court should award (if any) to the victim against the manufacturer.  Transposing this by analogy to Colombia, the State has imposed a detailed regulatory system upon those involved in laying pipelines, which will be considered in some detail later in this judgment.  As will be seen, part of the regulatory process in this case was the imposition of a requirement under the Environmental Licence that the licensee should “establish a system for the evaluation of the damage caused during the construction works and the adoption of immediate mitigation, recovery and compensation measures”: see [341] below.  Little is known about the Licensee’s compliance with this requirement or how, if at all, it was monitored or approved by the Ministry; but it is to my mind not self-evident that the words “full and equitable compensation” would in these circumstances be regarded as giving rise to an obligation to pay more than provided for under a system imposed as part of the regulatory structure that seeks to balance private and public interests.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">These considerations demand a re-examination of the initial, intuitive, willingness to accept that the Colombian Court would accept that an agreement to provide “full compensation” or “full and equitable compensation” satisfied the requirement that the sum payable should be determined or determinable.  Professor Vallejo’s opinion is that it would not, for the reasons outlined in his report, the joint statement and in cross-examination.  Professor Castro suggested in cross-examination that it would be sufficient to leave determination of the sum to be paid “to the process of the law” {Day 21/5:6}.  I would be prepared to accept that parties could frame an agreement by reference to provisions of the law which would make clear how the sum payable should be determined, but that is not the issue that has arisen in this case since no such formula was adopted.  The issue that falls to be decided in this case is whether a </p>

On that Professor Castro was ultimately constrained to agree with Professor Vallejo although she described his view as a narrow one.  More than once, she accepted that this was what Article 1518 said: {Day21/6:11} ff, {Day21/7:5} ff, {Day21/9:10}.  Apart from referring to “the process of law”, Professor Castro also referred to and relied upon Article 920 of the Commercial Code which provides for the market to fix the price in certain circumstances which do not apply here.  She did not refer to any other provision or authority in support of her views. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">This is a powerful endorsement of Professor Vallejo’s opinion on the application of Article 1518.  The last words from the citation emphasise that, if the sum payable is not actually determined, it must be determinable “with the basis provided in the contract” to know the amount with certainty.  For the reasons I have outlined above, a mere statement that compensation, or full compensation or full and equitable compensation will be paid does not of itself provide the basis to know the amount with certainty and therefore fails to satisfy the requirements of Article 1518.  A contract may define what is meant by compensation elsewhere so as to satisfy Article 1518; or the parties may enter into a subsequent agreement which enables the sum payable to be determined with certainty – in which case it will be the subsequent agreement that is operative.  But on the basic issue I prefer the evidence of Professor Vallejo for the reasons he gave and for the reasons I have set out above.  In the light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Colombia to which I have referred, the criticism that his view is a “narrow” one is misplaced and I reject it. </p>

The answer to this is to be found in the terms of Article 1603 of the Civil Code and Articles 863 and 871 of the Commercial Code, which say that (whether or not this is expressly provided in a contract) “the parties shall proceed in good faith in the pre-contractual stage” (Article 863) and that “contracts must be executed and performed in good faith” (Article 871 and see Article 1603).  Therefore, to the extent that the duty of good faith has substance which is not expressly provided for in the contract, there will be additional duties imposed on the parties, which supplement the strictly contractual obligations by establishing how those obligations should be performed.

It maintains that, in the pre-contractual stage, the due fulfilment of the duty of information includes providing information about “those characteristics which avoid the assumption, on the part of either contracting party, of risks which are excessive, unforeseen, hidden or abnormal contingencies such that all the risks assumed by the parties are duly compensated.” {I2/12/535}.  It does not, however, suggest that the obligation extends to all of “the true implications and risks of the contract.” Professor Vallejo disputes that the supportive elements of the decision are a correct statement of Colombian Law, pointing to the absence of any Supreme Court decision that supports them.  In his view the duty to inform should cover only known risks (i.e. those that are likely to occur in the absence of any breach of contract) because good faith is also presumed – as a matter of law – at all stages so that it would be wrong to anticipate a future breach of contract.  In addition, it is entirely unclear why or how a party should be expected as part of a duty of good faith to explain “hidden or abnormal contingencies”, still less unforeseen ones.  Although this award provides some support for Professor Castro’s opinion, arbitration awards are neither law nor auxiliary criteria, though they may command respect by virtue of their contents: see [22] above.    </p>

It concerned the sale of shares by a contract made between people who had been business partners (albeit with a degree of informality based upon mutual trust) for over three decades, which (the tribunal found) imposed a requirement of “the utmost loyalty and honesty in behaviour” towards each other.  The central allegation was that some of the shares were grossly undervalued to the Claimants’ disadvantage.  The undervalue stemmed from a report (“the Zitzmann report”) which had been commissioned by the Defendants and which made various adjustments for which there was no apparent justification.  Much of the award is taken up with matters that are not directly relevant, including an interesting discursion on the need for agreement on the essentials of the contract at p. 621ff. Professor Castro’s note said that the award included the statement: “the duty of information is granted in favour of whomsoever could legitimately rely on the counterparty, by reason of the nature of the contract or the parties … each of the parties has to inform the other regarding all points that could be of interest to the other” {I2/12/536}.

But in addition, “It could be said, in conclusion, that when there is a relationship of trust between the parties, the reciprocal duty of information should be automatic.  That is, that each party has to inform the other of all points which could be of interest to the other.  As such, the relationship of trust excludes, for both parties, any responsibility to investigate or get informed.”  It is added that this doesn’t entirely exclude this responsibility (negligence cannot be encouraged) but it does diminish it, as a result of the mutual trust and bonds of friendship of many years between contracting parties.” </p>

The apparently broad statement of principle derived from the particular relationship of trust (not simply inequality), which gave rise to an obligation to inform of all points of interest.  The specificity of the circumstances to which the citation relates is clear from the (qualified) indication that the relationship of trust excludes any responsibility upon the parties to investigate or to get informed.

With regards good faith, in its condition as a legal principle, it must be said that this plays an integral function in the contract in that it gives rise to special duties of conduct (to information, to advice, to loyalty), each of which are required in all cases, in accordance with the nature of the agreement and with what each party seeks. As a consequence, good faith serves an integral function in defining the content of the obligation and the determination of the service that is due. Good faith imposes on the debtor the obligation to supply the creditor with whatever assistance is required to satisfy his interests and, at the same time, the concepts of loyalty and correctness impose a duty to respect and safeguard the interests or utility of the counterparty, and consequently the obligation to avoid any behaviour which may cause damage to the other party. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">The duty of good faith in the period up to execution of a commercial contract is a general duty aimed at ensuring that the parties can reach a reasonably informed decision about the important aspects of a proposed contract and whether they wish to enter into it. The scope of the duty may vary depending upon the relations between the parties: for example, a relationship of trust may impose higher obligations than would otherwise exist.  Similarly, the obligation upon a surgeon with a patient who is contemplating an operation may be very extensive so that the patient can make an informed assessment of whether to enter into the contract for surgery or not: the scope of the obligation would be a function of the degree of known reliance of the patient upon the surgeon.  The variable scope of the duty is implicit in the experts’ agreement that it is to comply with the conduct that is required/expected from a competent and dutiful professional in the relevant industry placed in the same external factual circumstances of the contracting party: this test contains two variables, namely (a) the external factual circumstances and (b) the standard to be expected of a professional in the relevant industry.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">Since the purpose of the duty is to ensure that parties enter into contracts on the basis of sufficient information, the duty on a contracting party disappears or is at least attenuated in relation to information that the other party already has or should have.  There is no obligation upon a party to disclose information which he does not know.  Furthermore, the duty does not extend to requiring a party to inform the other party of the risks that could occur if the informing party were to breach his contract, since Colombian law assumes in the period up to and including the conclusion of the contract that the continuing duty of good faith will be adhered to and that parties will not breach their contracts.  The situation might be otherwise if at the time of contracting, the disclosing party had already formed the intention that it would breach its contractual obligations: I would reject any suggestion that this possible exception applies on the facts of this litigation. </p>

There is no duty to provide “complete” information “to orientate and warn the other party about the true implications and risks of the contract.”  Nor is there a duty to provide “a complete explanation about the magnitude of the project” or to disclose “all material information about the negative impact and probable losses.”  I prefer the formulations in the extracts from Professor Munar’s book that the party owing the obligation is called to provide information “as regards to the object, circumstances or distinctive features” of the agreement “whose importance … is substantial for the purposes of freeing the consent of the counter party from artifices or defects which may affect it.”  In other words, “It must refer to questions of importance, that is, those that influence the counterparties’ consent, as tends to occur with questions relating to the negotiable object, the cause and effect.”  Provided the counter party is furnished with this important information, either from his own knowledge or from information provided to him in the course of negotiations, he is in a position to weigh the risks for himself and to decide whether or not to enter into the contract on the terms being proposed. </p>

On many occasions it was submitted that the Claimants understood their land, a submission that is easy to accept in the case of all working farmers.  They would all be immediately alert to the general consequences for their fragile land of bulldozing a strip for the ROW, piling up mounds of earth, and working on the exposed surface with heavy machinery before attempting to reinstate the land.  Many had prior experience of the ODC pipeline which, as outlined below, will have caused major disruption during construction.  While the ODC ROW had recovered well over parts of its length, in other parts it was still in a worse condition in 2005/2006 than it had been before the ODC works; and a number of landowners had suffered damage off the ROW in respect of which claims had been made and settlements achieved: see [393]ff below.  In the close-knit agricultural communities with which this litigation is concerned, the impact of the ODC ROW and the likely impact of the Ocensa pipeline works would have been matters of common (though not necessarily universal) knowledge, at least at a general level of understanding.  If further evidence is required for this conclusion it is to be found in the comments made at the public meetings, which showed a clear appreciation that the damaging mistakes made during the construction of the ODC pipeline should not be repeated with the Ocensa pipeline: see [338]ff below. </p>

Unjustified breaking off of negotiations happens when the party withdraws without justification from negotiations conducted up to the point of leading the other party to be reasonably confident of the conclusion of the contract.  Pre-contractual liability does not presuppose an obligation to conclude a contract.  On the contrary the existence of such a contract excludes pre-contractual liability because in that case the party under obligation will be liable for non-performance.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The citation from Bianca is consistent with passages from the Decision of the Supreme Court dated 23 May 2005 which support the existence of an entitlement to compensation where contract negotiations are frustrated to place the affected party in the same economic situation as if the frustrated negotiations had not taken place.  This is the well-established doctrine identified by the experts in their agreed statement.  The relevant passage continues “…however, such compensation may not be claimed under the same conditions to those that would originate due to failure to perform an obligation, as if the purported contract had been concluded.”: see {I2/12.1/539.2}.  This emphasises that the agreed doctrine is dependent upon no contract having been concluded.  Although the passage does not expressly say that no other remedy may flow as a result of pre-contractual bad faith, there is no suggestion that it may do so.  Specifically, there is no support for Professor Castro’s contention that pre-contractual bad faith may give rise to a free-standing claim for damages where a contract has been concluded. </p>

Professor Vallejo’s evidence is that he is not aware of a single reported case in which damages have been awarded for breach of the duty of good faith, in circumstances where the parties have subsequently entered into a contract.  In his opinion, to do so would be clearly a contravention of Colombian Law.  His position is supported by his two additional citations, which include a decision of the Supreme Court that is in point.  The existence of such a remedy would also be inconsistent with the agreed statement of the experts that “Bad faith does not constitute a free-standing cause of action.  If bad faith is relied on it must be framed within a legally recognised cause of action.”  To my mind, the system of remedies agreed between the experts as set out at [76] above provides a coherent structure: Colombian law provides a compensatory remedy in the event that the Defendant frustrates the formation of a contract; if, however, a contract </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It is common ground that the contracts in issue in this litigation are contracts of mutual benefit of the parties {Day21/69:3} ff.  Under such contracts the debtor/obligor must perform his obligations with due care and diligence and will be liable for breach resulting from medium or ordinary fault pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1604 and 63 of the Civil Code {H23.2/7/451}.  The relevant standard of care is that of the dutiful merchant placed in the same external circumstances of the merchant {H23.2/7/451}.  The exercise of contractual rights is governed by the doctrine of abuse of rights, which is connected but different {Day21/60:3} ff.  The Claimants submit that it is implausible that the victim of a negligent exercise of <span style="font-style:italic">rights</span> under a contract would have no remedy under Colombian law.  Professor Vallejo disagreed, and so do I.  The submission takes no account of the clear separation that Colombian law recognises between claims in contract and in tort, and attempts to elide tortious principles with those that apply in contract.  Where a contract confers rights upon a party, they must be exercised in good faith; and an abuse of those rights can give rise to a remedy as set out below.  In addition, if a party’s conduct amounts to a breach of contract, Colombian law provides remedies.  There is, to my mind, no compelling reason why conduct in good faith which falls within the terms of the agreement between the parties should give rise to a quasi-tortious remedy in contract. </p>

Professor Vallejo responds that dominant position is defined for the purposes of Article 333 as being able to determine directly or indirectly the conditions of a market, and that Article 333 is concerned with conduct in relation to competitors and the protection of the relevant market {H23.2/7/456}.  It is neither possible nor necessary to resolve this sub-issue, because it is clear from the facts of the Supreme Court decision on 19 October 1994 that the existence of a dominant position as between individual contracting parties (in that case the bank and the borrower) is relevant when investigating the issue of abuse of rights.  It is virtually self-evident that an imbalance in power may enable the dominant party to impose “a provision which significantly departs from the standard permissible terms governing the respective contract or activity, and in a manner contrary to the normal practices of the trade” or to “[exercise] a right in an improper way and which distorts its genuine purpose” but does not justify an assumption that it will have done so.  To that extent, I prefer the evidence of Professor Castro that what she calls an asymmetry of information or power may be relevant to the question whether there has been an abuse of rights.   </p>

If that were correct, it would give an extended meaning to the term “abuse”; but it is not.  As set out above, the experts are agreed that an element of abuse of rights is that the right should be exercised in a way which “distorts its proper purpose” or, in the case of imposition of terms, “significantly departs from the standard permissible terms governing the respective contract or activity, and in a manner contrary to the normal practices of the trade.”  Professor Castro expressed this requirement in different terms in her original report as follows: </p>

The mere fact that a contract term is onerous may raise a question; but it does not demonstrate or necessarily evidence abuse of rights.  In this regard I accept the evidence of Professor Vallejo (at {Day23/63:19}) that, while a contract term providing for compensation of damage which was not a genuine preestimate of the damage <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> be the result of an abuse of rights, it is necessary to apply the agreed test to determine whether it is so.

At the same time, it should not be forgotten that the backdrop of potential expropriation is part of the balance between private and public interests established by the Colombian State and that the articles establishing that balance treat expropriation as a last resort, which only comes into play once the entrepreneur makes an application and provides a list of “the steps that have been taken to get what is required through a contract freely entered into with [the landowners]”: see [38] above.  It is therefore clear that the Colombian legal framework does not treat the possibility of expropriation as automatically depriving the landowner of freedom of contract.  That does not, of course, determine whether there has or has not been an abuse of rights in a given case.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Articles 14, 17 and 35 establish the procedure to be adopted when the parties present themselves before a Notary with a view to executing a public deed.  Pursuant to Article 14, the first two stages of the process overseen by the Notary (“reception” and “extension”) involve the reduction to writing of the declarations of the parties.  Article 17 requires the Notary to review the parties’ declarations and to verify that the presented draft is consistent with the purpose of the attendants.  If and to the extent that it is not, he may suggest amendments that are necessary in order to achieve consistency.  To that extent he is clearly entitled to give legal advice about the content of the document, but that advice goes to its consistency with the parties’ declared purpose of the transaction: it does not go to whether the transaction is in the interests of the parties (or either of them).  Article 35 then requires the deed to be read in its entirety either by the Notary or by the interested parties or by the person appointed by them, who may modify the deed as they consider appropriate before expressing their acceptance.  This would naturally be an opportunity for a prospective party to try to modify the deed to his advantage, but it does not follow that it is the Notary’s function to address or advise on that question.  Rather, it would be consistent with his previously stated obligations for the Notary’s interest at this stage to be to ensure that the necessary formalities are all in place and that the document is consistent with the parties’ declarations and purpose. </p>

Her opinion was that “a Notary does not ensure that the parties understand the content or that the contents are true. … [The] Notary does not have a function or obligation to give legal advice to the parties as to the contents of a particular deed that is to be signed”; and that “for contracts where a public deed executed before a Notary Public is required by law, notarization amounts to compliance with [the] formal requirement[s].” {H14/1/46} at [113], [116].  At one point in her evidence, she said that the Notary does not review the contents of the document {Day21/77:18}, but it was not clear whether she meant this as an absolute statement or as meaning that the Notary would not review the contents of the document with a view to giving partial legal advice to one side or the other.  If she meant the former, she would have been wrong since it would be directly contrary to the express terms of Article 17.  If she meant the latter, the position is more complicated. </p>

The furthest that she would go was to accept that, if a party came before a Notary and said he or she did not understand the proposed agreement, the Notary would provide a general explanation of the nature of the agreement (for example, that it is a contract for the sale of property) but not of specific provisions (such as waivers or settlement clauses).  And she accepted that if an illiterate campesino farmer were to ask the Notary for advice on material or substantial aspects it might be given, though that is not the role of the Notary {Day21/80:20}. </p>

He appeared to go further in his supplemental report when saying, in reliance on Article 7, that “Notary public offices in Colombia have the duty to advise and counsel the parties requesting their assistance; especially in the case of contracts that are executed with their intervention as a matter of law (for example an easement deed affecting real property).  Under the good faith principle, a party may not sign a contract without understanding its terms, without seeking explanations from the other party and without requesting clarifications from the Notary (a third independent expert), and later plead avoidance of the contract/further compensation with the argument of illiteracy.” {H15/2/254} at [111]. By Professor Vallejo’s normal high standards of precision, this passage is surprisingly vague in two respects.  First, he did not identify the scope of the duty to advise, leaving it unclear whether his reference to the parties “requesting [the Notary’s] assistance” was a reference to seeking the overall assistance outlined in the Articles or to seeking specific assistance on a matter of legal substance.  Second, his reference to a party’s failure to request “clarifications” from the Notary gave no indication of the nature of the clarifications that he had in mind.  He provided no further precision or elaboration in the joint statement, merely saying that “the Notary has a duty to ensure that both parties enter into the transaction freely and that the transaction reflects the will of both parties”; and “the law does not limit the counselling function of the Notary to the verification of the compliance of the legal formalities required for a public deed.  As per the quoted norms, this function of the Notary is much wider, and covers all the issues raised by the parties executing the contract related to the content of the agreement, including doubts, misunderstandings or lack of knowledge of the parties requesting the notarial advice.” {H23.2/7/474}.

The Claimants, however, submit that Professor Vallejo changed his evidence on the role of the Notary and that “the implausibility of Dr Vallejo’s original evidence on the role of the Notary is perhaps symptomatic of the credibility of his evidence generally.”  I disagree on both counts.  As summarised above and set out in greater detail in his original report, Professor Vallejo did not assert that the Notary was under a general duty to give legal advice on the desirability or otherwise of undertaking the obligations in the proposed agreement or to advise on how the relative position of a party to the proposed agreement might be improved; nor did he advocate such a general duty in his Supplemental Report.  The nearest he came to it was in the passages in the Joint Statement that I have set out above, particularly the phrase “all the issues raised by the parties executing the contract…”.  However, he had (typically) made clear in his report that his opinion was closely based upon the terms of the relevant Articles, including Article 7 with its reference to the Notary being at the service of the law and not the parties. His additional words in the Joint Statement “including doubts, misunderstandings or lack of knowledge of the parties requesting the notarial advice” as examples of issues on which the Notary would advise was consistent with the overall thrust of his evidence, namely that it was the Notary’s function to ensure that the parties understand the agreement they are proposing to execute; and he did not include any examples that necessarily went outside those limits. </p>

The Notary is required to ensure that the formal requirements of the proposed transaction are complied with.  He is also required to ensure that the written transaction complies with the purposes and will of the parties as declared to him.  He will provide explanations (which may involve giving his legal opinion) about matters raised with him concerning the content of the proposed agreement so far as they concern establishing that the proposed transaction complies with the purposes and will of the parties as declared to him.  He will not, as a general rule, give partial legal advice to one or more of the parties on the desirability of entering into the transaction as a whole or on how to improve their relative positions by amending the proposed draft and is under no formal duty to do so.

If it becomes apparent (for whatever reason) that the parties need to discuss matters further or that a party needs partial legal advice in order to get to the stage of expressing consent to the transaction, the Notary will either afford the opportunity for further discussion or refer the needful party elsewhere.  For the avoidance of doubt, I accept Professor Vallejo’s general account of how things would work before a Notary in a small community, which I have summarised briefly above.  However, I would not exclude the possibility that, if asked, a Notary might give an illiterate campesino farmer some legal advice on the substance of a proposed agreement, as accepted by Professor Castro.  He would not be under a duty to do so and should remember that he is at the service of the law and not of the parties.

An assignment takes effect between the assignor and assignee on execution of the agreement to assign, but to make the assignment binding (oponible) on the assigned, a notice of the assignment must be served so that the assigned is bound to satisfy any obligations towards or demand any rights from the assignee from that moment forward; or the assigned must demonstrate acceptance of the assignment {H14/1/53} at [134], {H23.2/7/487}. </p>

It is accepted on all sides that Article 888-3 is not applicable.  The Defendant contends that the effect of Article 888-2 is that if a contract of assignment is contained in a public deed, it binds the assigned whether or not the assigned is otherwise given notice of the assignment.  The Claimants respond that the purpose of Article 888-2 is to lay down the formalities that must be complied with for a public deed to become effective as against third parties and is not to give notice of an assignment to the assignor’s counterparty to the original agreement.  The Claimants submit that Article 894 is applicable and requires actual notice to be given to the assigned counterparty to the original agreement.  The dispute is important because the Defendant says that it has effectively assigned both its rights and its obligations under the various ROW agreements it had entered into with the Claimants by Public Deed 4317 of 9 October 1995 {J13/51T/1} and that notice of that assignment was given by registration of the deed in the real property registry on and from 21 November 1996.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The high point for the Defendant’s argument is the general principle of Colombian law that once a deed has been registered it creates a presumption that everyone is informed of the transaction.  Application of that principle would lead to the conclusion that everyone (including the Claimants) was informed of the assignment on and from 21 November 1996.  That said, I accept the evidence of Professor Castro that the public registration of transactions over real estate has a special, public interest function: to record the legal status of the property for different purposes, in order to disclose the legal standing of the property for potential buyers or lenders, inheritance taxes and the like.

Viewed in isolation, the main thrust of Article 888 goes to formalities for executing assignments.  Thus Article 888-1 lays down the general rule that the formalities for effecting an assignment are dependent upon whether the original contract was oral or in writing.  Seen in this light, Article 888-2 is primarily concerned with how to execute the assignment of a contract that is contained in a public deed.  That does not, however, determine the meaning to be attributed to the second clause of Article 888-2.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The language of the second clause (“… but it shall not produce effects with respect to third parties …”) bears comparison with the language of Article 894, which is agreed to establish the general requirement of notification or acceptance.  First, the language of Article 894 (“… it shall only produce effects from the [date of] notification or acceptance …”) is very similar to that of the second clause of Article 888-2, set out above.  Second, Article 888-2 refers only to “third parties” while Article 894 refers to “the assigned party and third parties” (in Spanish “contratante cedido y de terceros”).  There is no reason to think that this distinction is accidental.  It supports the conclusion that the second clause of 888-2 neither refers nor applies to the assigned party.  On this interpretation the combined effect of Articles 888-2 and 894 would be that an assignment by public deed only produces effects as against the assigned party on actual notification or acceptance (Article 894) but, as against third parties, recording the public deed in the corresponding registry is the formal prerequisite to the producing of effects.  That is coherent and intelligible since it combines the public purpose of registration (namely informing those who would not otherwise have access or entitlement to the information) while preserving the right of the assigned (because of its much closer connection with the transaction) to be notified.  It is not without difficulty because it requires “third parties” in Article 888-2 to be taken as meaning “third parties to the original contract” rather than “third parties to the assignment”.  However, that is not an insuperable objection given that third parties to the original contract will also be third parties to the assignment unless they happen to be the assignee, in which case their position is express and clear.  Interpreting “third parties” in Article 888-2 in this way enables consistency to be achieved with Article 894 and seems to me to be logical and correct. </p>

Article 893 (set out above) provides valuable protection for an assigned contracting party, which is irrelevant to strangers to the contract: he has 10 days following notification to demand performance of the obligation from the assignor.  That protection would be lost unless the Claimant happened to inspect the property register (which would carry a cost) within 10 days of registration.  The arbitrary nature of that state of affairs is demonstrated by the fact that the public deed in question, though dated 9 October 1995, was not registered until 21 November 1996.  No reason has been advanced why any of the Claimants should have inspected the register in the 10 days after 21 November 1996 and none is readily conceivable.  The Defendant’s interpretation would have the bizarre consequence that the provisions for public registration, which are intended to provide information and protection for third parties, would have precisely the opposite effect on the assigned, who would lose the right to actual notice and, with it, his protection. </p>

Having emphasised that point, she accepted that it is necessary to assess the conduct of the parties objectively in order to ascertain whether there has been an unequivocal tacit acceptance {Day21/121:6} ff.  Later she appeared to revert to a requirement of actual understanding (as opposed to unequivocal externalised behaviour) when asserting that dealing with another person (i.e. the assignee) without any reservation “does not necessarily imply a tacit acceptance if there is absence of at least some knowledge … that there has been an assignment of contract …” {Day21/126:15} ff. </p>

In consequence, what is required for tacit acceptance is (as the experts agreed) “unequivocal behaviour of the assigned party amounting to performance or [continued] performance towards the assignee.”  That said, acceptance of Professor Vallejo’s reasoning leads me also to conclude that he went too far in saying that tacit acceptance “consists of any conduct which would be <span style="font-style:italic">consistent</span> with his acceptance of the assignee as the new party to the contract.”  Mere consistency with acceptance is not enough: for conduct to be objectively unequivocal it must also be <span style="font-style:italic">inconsistent </span>with any other interpretation.   </p>

Thus, for example, to let a third-party engineering contractor onto one’s land to carry out works pursuant to an agreement with someone else may well be equivocal because, without more, it may be consistent with the engineering contractor carrying out works on behalf of that other person; but entering into a formal settlement agreement with the engineering contractor in respect of the damage he is alleged to have caused may carry other implications.   </p>

Relevant examples of this type of obligations are: to transfer the property of the goods sold to the buyer, to refrain from certain conduct, and the transportation of persons or goods. Failure to obtain the promised result makes the obligor/debtor contractually liable. In order to escape liability, the obligor/debtor must demonstrate an extraneous cause (i.e. force majeure, acts of God, the exclusive negligence of the obligee/creditor, and the exclusive conduct of a third party). </p>

In this type of contractual obligations, the obligor/debtor only commits himself to use the means which are ordinarily adequate to obtain the required result, without the obligation to achieve it. When the desired result is not obtained, in spite of the diligence employed, there is no fault from the debtor/obligor and no liability attaches to him. Such are the obligations assumed by certain professionals, as for example, doctors. In other words, in best efforts obligations the obligator/debtor may escape liability by proving due diligence and care in the circumstances of the case. </p>

In these circumstances, it continues, “there is not accumulation of responsibilities, but only the determination to assign the blame that stands out the most.

If the obligation is necessary to prove the fault of the debtor or author of the damage, while if the obligation is of result fault then it is presumed in accordance with Article 1604 of the Civil Code. <span style="font-style:italic">Therefore, if there is a contractual liability that simultaneously implies the exercising of a dangerous activity, the exoneration of the burden to prove fault does not depend on the presumption stated under Article 2356 of the Civil Code but rather on the obligation assumed to it being a result obligation, under Article 1604 ibidem, which is the appropriate specific norm for contracts.</span>  …  Neither law nor doctrine authorise the exercising of a hybrid action, an expression used by the commentators, because the juxtaposition or accumulation of these two differentiated types of liability is impossible, because the contractual, by its own nature, excludes liability generated by tort liability.” {H15/1/96}  [Emphasis added] </p>

This does not offend against the requirement that the legal doctrines of contract and tort are and should be kept separate and distinct; but it guards against the unfairness of a wrongdoer escaping all liability simply because the Claimant has chosen the wrong cause of action when issuing proceedings.  As in English procedure, the Claimant may keep claims in tort and contract open simultaneously right up to judgment, it being a matter ultimately for the Court in the light of all evidence and submissions to determine whether and to what extent the parties’ mutual rights and obligations are governed by contract {H15/1/98} at [441].   </p>

Ultimately, Professor Castro appeared to agree that this is so because, in relation to a personal injury claim arising out of contractual carriage of passengers, she agreed that an extra-contractual claim was dismissed because “if the contract is breached, the tort claim should be dismissed.” {Day21/139:5} ff.  But, as made clear in the last citation from the decision of 24 June 1942, even where there is a contract, the facts of the claim may be such that some of them are not within the ambit of the parties’ agreement.  If that happens, it is open to the Claimant to look to the law of tort to see whether those facts that are not regulated by contract may give rise separately to a claim over and above that which he has in contract.  In this way, the guiding principle that there should not be double recovery is preserved.   </p>

It does not follow (and none of the citations set out above suggest) that tortious remedies are restricted or excluded whenever there is a contract between the parties, whatever its content.  This is important in the present case because the contracts between claimants and the Defendant (or, in some cases, Ocensa) did not seek to regulate the manner in which the pipeline works were to be carried out; nor were they contracts for the carrying out of the pipeline works as such.  The First letter, if it was a contract (as to which see later), merely requested and provided authorisation to carry out works on the landowner’s land, without which the works would (without more) be an illegal trespass: see [368] below.  It did not oblige the Defendant to undertake the works, nor did it impose any terms about how the works were to be carried out.  It was not in any sense a contract to achieve an object or imposing a “result obligation”.  The passage relied upon by the Claimants as a contractual guarantee of “fair and equitable compensation” does not (assuming it has contractual force) affect the manner in which the pipeline works are to be carried out.  At most it could be said to affect the level of compensation that would be due to the landowner in the event of damage to his property. </p>

Although it may be said that the contemplation of the pipeline works “implies the exercising of a dangerous activity”, that is not of itself sufficient to exclude the dangerous activities doctrine.  As the passage from the decision of 19 April 1993 that I have highlighted makes clear, what is being contemplated and required is a contract which is relevant to the tortious doctrine of dangerous activities because it imposes a “result obligation” (i.e. to bring the works to a satisfactory conclusion) and therefore relevantly regulates the relations between the parties so as to exclude the need to prove fault <span style="font-style:italic">as a matter of contract</span>.

It is common ground that the construction of a pipeline is a dangerous activity, though some related activities (e.g. the accounts function or drawing of plans) would not be included {H14/3/269}.

There may be more than one co-guardian, often with different angles of responsibility and interest, each of whom will be jointly and severally liable for damage falling within the scope of the doctrine: see the citation from the decisions of the Supreme Court of 22 April 1997 and 19 December 2011 at {H23.2/7/507}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Professor Castro suggested that, in addition to the “dangerous activities” doctrine there were separate principles relating to “risk-benefit” and “created risk” theories.  This appeared to be the basis for the Claimants’ formulation of their pleaded case at, for example, {B1.3/5/483} and {B1.3/5/485}.  In their closing submissions the Claimants invited the Court to consider the case law she cited, which I have done.  To my mind, what the authorities show is that the Supreme Court (as is the way of higher courts in many jurisdictions) has considered the extent to which the theories might be said to underpin the dangerous activities doctrine, without coming to any clear or unanimous conclusion.  They do not show that the theories are a proxy or substitute for the dangerous activities doctrine; nor do they generate additional rights or obligations over and above those clearly understood as falling within the dangerous activities doctrine.  Nothing in the cited authorities suggests that, on the facts of this litigation, Claimants who would otherwise fail on any material issue would or might succeed if separate consideration were given to the risk theories.  It is therefore not necessary to say more about them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Another point of principle that divides the parties is whether a person who becomes guardian of a dangerous activity automatically becomes liable under the doctrine for all adverse consequences of the dangerous activity.  The Claimants submit that he does; the Defendant submits that there must be a causal link between the damage and the specific conduct of the guardian.  This point was raised but not fully developed during the trial and closing submissions.  On the material that is available to the Court, I consider that the root of this division is a concentration by the parties and the experts upon “laying the pipeline” as a single “dangerous activity.”  Without going behind the agreement that I have already rehearsed, this all-embracing description obscures the reality of a huge engineering project, which is that “laying the pipeline” involves many different activities, with many different people having responsibilities for different aspects of the project.  So, for example, a person might have complete control over the early stripping works but have gone off site and been relieved of all responsibility by the time that the trench for the pipe was dug, the trench was laid, and any restorative works were carried out.  It is not obvious in principle why such a person, though he might satisfy the definition of guardianship for the stripping works, should have any responsibility for damage caused in those later operations to which he made no contribution and with which he had no involvement.  This suggests that, in principle, Professor Vallejo should be right in asserting that there must be at least some causal link between the activities of the person said to be the guardian and the damage that occurs.  This is not a difficult concept if (in the illustration) the stripping works and the subsequent works are treated as separate dangerous activities, even though they all contribute to the aggregated project of laying the pipeline which, viewed overall, is also regarded as a dangerous activity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I therefore find that under Colombian law it is too simple merely to treat an aggregation of dangerous activities as if they were one and indivisible; and that liability under the dangerous activities doctrine will be imposed upon a person in respect of damage caused by a dangerous activity (or element of a dangerous activity) falling within his area of responsibility.  Once it is established that the cause of damage fell within his area of responsibility, he will be liable and, if he has coguardians responsible in respect of the same area of activity, he will be jointly and severally liable with those on whom equivalent liability is imposed.  In this way the object of the dangerous activities doctrine will be satisfied by joint and several liability being imposed on any and all of those responsible for exercising independent powers of control or management over the activity that causes the damage; but it does not arbitrarily impose liability on those who may have nothing at all to do with the cause of damage.  Whether sub-dividing the activities and responsibilities in this way has any relevance for a party having overall control of the project will be a question of fact.  In the absence of submissions directly on the point, I would hold that, where there is evidence that would otherwise lead to the conclusion that a party had overall control of a project as a whole, it would be for such a party to demonstrate that he was <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>involved in or responsible for the particular area of interest, and not for a claimant to demonstrate separately that he was. This seems to me to be consistent with the Supreme Court’s treatment of owners in the passage I have cited above. </p>

In cross examination she confirmed that, in general, independent contractors are not subordinates or dependants of the principal so that, as against third parties in tort, people who engage independent contractors are, without more, not liable for the negligent acts or omissions of the independent contractors; but the principal may be liable for those acts or omissions (without reference to the dangerous activities doctrine) if he exercises a sufficient control over the contractor.

She relies upon Article 1522 as establishing that an agreement to forgive future dolo cannot be valid.  She then states her opinion that a settlement cannot be used as a means to avoid the duty to act with care in the future “as it is intended to finish or prevent litigation between the parties as long as the settled matter is identified as dubious and litigious at the time of the agreement, excluding future misconducts” {H23.2/7/520}. She then relies upon Articles 1619 and 2485 of the Civil Code in support of her opinion that settlement agreements must be restrictively construed and “limited to the matters on which the parties did agree upon.

In this way, in order for a settlement to exist, three requisites must be present: 1. The existence of a litigious difference, not necessarily before a Court; 2. The will to settle such differences or to prevent them out of Court, and 3. Reciprocal concession of the parties for that purpose.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">A number of points arise.  First, the fact that it is not possible to agree to forgive future dolo (i.e. dolo that has not yet occurred) and that a settlement cannot be used as a means to avoid the duty to act with care in the future (on which I accept Professor Castro’s evidence) does not of itself answer the question whether it is possible to settle disputes arising out of <span style="font-style:italic">past </span>dolo or <span style="font-style:italic">past </span>breach of the duty to act with care, whether they be known or unknown.  Second, in her Supplemental Report {H14/3/279}, Professor Castro referred to Professor Vallejo’s opinion that “a settlement agreement may compromise a claim in respect to future loss and may compromise a potential claim for damage of which the party is unaware at the time the settlement agreement is executed”, responding that “this general statement may be accepted under Colombian law, provided there is a litigious difference between the parties who execute the settlement agreement. The parties can make mutual concessions aimed at preventing or ending a claim that must be actual or imminent.  Mere waiver of future, undetermined undisputed rights is not deemed as a settlement, as provided in Article 2469 [of the Civil Code].”  Seen in this context, her description of a claim as “imminent” means “about to happen (or become actual)” as distinct from “actual”.  In other words, claims of which a person is unaware and which have therefore not been brought into existence by being formulated may be “imminent” and susceptible to settlement.  Third, the passage just cited accepts as a general principle that a potential claim for damage of which the party is unaware at the time the settlement is agreed may be effectively compromised.  Fourth, the word “eventual” in Article 2469 does not mean or imply that the dispute which may eventuate in a lawsuit must be either formulated or known at the time that a settlement is concluded.  To the contrary, Article 2469 differentiates between concluding a pending dispute (which, by definition, must be formulated and advanced) and preventing an eventual lawsuit (which, as a matter of language and context, need be neither).  Fifth, during her oral evidence Professor Castro accepted that an agreement that purported to settle not only matters that had been the subject of discussion or claim but also any disputes which may subsequently arise could in principle be valid if the subject matter is well identified {Day21/179:1} ff.  This evidence, which is consistent with the terms of Article 2485, I accept. Sixth, Professor Castro accepted the analysis of Professor Jaramillo at {I2/4T/240} - {I2/4T/242} including the following passage, which supports the possibility of settling of disputes that have not yet been identified: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In the light of these considerations, I conclude that neither party has accurately characterised the true effect of Professor Castro’s evidence that a dispute must be “actual or imminent”.  Her use of the word “imminent”, when properly understood as set out above, is not (as was submitted by the Defendant) “an inaccurate gloss” applied to the words of Article 2469.  Although it took time to identify precisely what her opinion is in this area, my impression at the time and my finding now is that this was due to nuances of language rather than any significant lack of objectivity.  On the other hand (contrary to what was submitted by the Claimants) it is possible to settle future controversies that are not foreseen or not specifically identified at the time of the agreement if appropriate wording is used, since that is what Article 2469 contemplates when referring to the prevention of eventual lawsuits.  The prerequisites for a valid settlement are those set out at [177] and the principle underlying those pre-requisites is, as explained by Jaramillo, the freedom of the parties to resolve uncertainty by agreement.  Normal principles of construction apply to the interpretation of settlement agreements.  Article 1624 of the Civil Code applies in case of ambiguity: see [71].  There is otherwise no specific rule requiring a restrictive or partial interpretation of settlements; but Article 2485 emphasises the need for </p>

When interpreting a settlement agreement (as with other contracts) it is correct to have regard to other agreements “whether before or after [the settlement agreement] which are interrelated or connected, as applicable, which due to their type or scope can be used as a compass in order to reconstruct” the common intention of the parties {I2/4T/262} {Day21/186:7}.  Specifically, in the present litigation, it could be appropriate to construe the settlement agreements and Paz y Salvos together, as Professor Castro accepted and explained at {Day21/187:13}.  </p>

The Defendant’s case is that the agreements amounted to a novation because (as between the Claimants and Ocensa/Saipem) they substituted an obligation in contract which was incompatible with the continued existence of their prior obligation in tort.  In her written evidence, Professor Castro gave as her opinion that, for the agreements between the Claimants and Ocensa/Saipem to affect the position of the Defendant, there had to be an unequivocal intention not merely to enter into a novation as between themselves but also to affect the position of the Defendant {H23.2/7/527}.  She did so on the basis that Ocensa/Saipem’s new obligation was not incompatible with the more general obligation of the Defendant to compensate all damages caused by its fault or dolo.  However, in her oral evidence her position changed.  She accepted that <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> a settlement agreement did amount to a novation as between the Claimants and Ocensa/Saipem, the settlement would be effected not only between the parties to the agreements but also between the Claimant and those originally having joint and several liability with Ocensa or Saipem {Day21/207:14}<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

Article 15 of the Civil Code provides that “Rights conferred by the law can be renounced / waived, provided that the only interest affected by the renunciation/waiver is the interest of the person who resigns and that such renunciation/waiver is not prohibited.”  The experts agree that a party may renounce a right by a clear expression that he no longer wants to pursue the right or bring actions with regard to the right.  Professor Castro added that a waiver of rights must be “clear, unequivocal and precise.”  It is not obvious that the words “unequivocal and precise” add anything to the agreed formulation, which I accept.  She also added that the waiving party must be aware of the scope of its relinquishment, which must never be global or unspecified, so to benefit another party without limitation in the future.  Once again, it is not obvious what this adds to the agreed formulation: if the party renounces a right by a clear expression that he no longer wishes to pursue a right or to bring actions with regard to the right, Colombian law will take that externalised expression as showing that the party is aware of the scope of the relinquishment that has been so clearly expressed.  Although it is common ground that a person cannot renounce the right to bring claims for damages arising from (future) malicious breach of contract or a malicious tort {Day21/197:9} ff, I am not satisfied that there is any other conceptual limit on what rights may be renounced provided that the agreed test is satisfied.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">Drawing the strands of this evidence together I find that there is no reason in principle why moral damages should not be granted in a case arising out of damage to land.  That said, I accept that the Colombian Court is conservative both in the circumstances in which such awards will be made and in the amounts awarded.  No award of moral damages has, to the knowledge of the experts, ever been made in a case arising out of damage to land although very many such cases of varying degrees of severity must have come before the Courts over time.  This is not surprising, even if such damages are theoretically available, when one considers the basis and justification for an award of moral damages.  The language of the Supreme Court, cited above, speaks of “the most intimate feelings” and “the grief that the victim suffers, who is the only one capable to measure its intensity.”  This suggests that there is a high threshold, which is more likely to be achieved in a claim where a Claimant has suffered loss of their own bodily autonomy or functions, or where a Claimant is bereaved by the death of a close relative, than in a claim where land is damaged.  An attack on a person’s honour, freedom and reputation is also, in universal experience, liable to stir intense and intimate feelings that may be as destructive as grief.  Without in any way underestimating the strength of feelings that can be generated by damage to a person’s land or the deleterious effect that may have on their general quality of life, those feelings are not readily equated with the grief and pain suffered on the loss of a child, partner or parent except, perhaps, in extreme and unusual cases.  Nor does it seem appropriate to create a linear scale from COP55,000,000 down to zero to cater for all feelings of upset that may be experienced.  On the evidence that is available to this Court, moral damages are not appropriate until a person’s most intimate feelings are affected to a high degree. </p>

The Supreme Court in its decision of 13 May 2008 said that such damages are concerned with the “… decrease in the quality of life of the victim, in the loss or difficulty in making contact to or to relate to persons or things, in order to enjoy a normal existence, as well as depriving the affected person from the possibility of performing the more elementary actions that characterise the reality of their everyday life.”  The Court defined the loss of amenities as the deterioration of the quality of life of the victim due to an accident, and held that this type of damage produces the loss of or difficulty of enjoying an ordinary life, and the victim is compelled to live his life under far more complicated or demanding circumstances than other people insofar as </p>

As a result, the quality of life is reduced and the possibilities, options, projects and goals disappear or the level of difficulty to achieve them is increased.

Thus, although neither expert is aware of any reported case where damages for loss of amenities have been awarded in a case based on damage to property, Professor Vallejo was right to accept that it is conceptually possible that they could be.  Professor Castro, however, accepted that it would require exceptional circumstances where a person’s entire way of life was seriously affected by damage to his property to justify such an award {Day21/212:5} ff.

But it is pertinent to ask why there has been, to the knowledge of the experts, no award in similar circumstances before and why Professor Castro regarded the award in circumstances such as this as being a possible application of existing principle rather than being one which she could be confident that the Colombian Court would adopt.  It seems most likely that the answer lies in the Supreme Court’s description of what the damages are for, as summarised by the experts and set out above.  The picture that emerges is of an impediment, the core characteristic of which is that it prevents the Claimant from enjoying the normal amenities of life because even the normal tasks and activities of everyday life become difficult.  This picture is more readily applicable to someone who is struggling with a physical disability after an accident than to someone whose land suffers a loss of productivity by reason of damage and deterioration.  I would therefore accept Professor Castro’s evidence that what is required is something exceptional so that the Court may be tempted to take an incremental step by analogy with established cases rather than simply adopting a conceptual possibility. </p>

That does not obviate the burden upon the Claimant to show that an award should be made and to put before the Court the materials on the basis of which the Court can make an informed assessment of what quantum of these damages (which would be regarded as nonpecuniary and unliquidated in English legal parlance) is fair.  While assessment will necessarily be imprecise, I would not accept (if that is what Professor Castro was implying) that the Court can resort to principles of fairness or equity as a substitute for evidence that enables the Court to make a rational assessment of what falls to be compensated. </p>

The phrase “all damages” is not qualified in any way in the Article.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, however, a third feature of equal importance on the clear wording of Article 5: it does not define the scope of what is to be included in “all damages”.  It does not (for example) say “all damages which may in the event be caused by the entrepreneur’s activities, whether contemplated and included in the compensation as assessed or not”; nor does it say “all damages within the scope or contemplation of the assessment of damages that has been carried out”.  This absence of definition permits the parties to adopt their opposing positions.  I bear in mind at all times that the agreed rules for the interpretation of the law include that (a) when the meaning of the law is clear, its terms should not be disregarded on the pretext that it is necessary to consult the spirit of the law, and (b) the court should not have regard to arguments that a law is too harsh or too generous when interpreting the law.  However, it has not been suggested that the Court is not to have regard to the implications of one possible interpretation when chosing between two or more interpretations of a law whose meaning is not clear.  And I am not satisfied that the terms of Article 5 itself, or of the 1954 Regulations when read as a whole, clearly define what is meant by “all damages”.  As is apparent from the rest of this judgment and from the basic nature of the Defendant’s case, it is not to be assumed in advance that the laying of a pipeline will cause damage outside the ROW even though there is a well-recognised risk that such damage could be caused and that it could be very severe (sometimes for reasons outside the entrepreneur’s control).  There is no satisfactory evidence which enables me to make findings about how the experts, the Mayor or the Court would approach their tasks and, in particular, whether the experts, the Mayor or the Court would assume that damage would be confined to the ROW (or, more generally, the area of the mining or petroleum easement).  On the available evidence it is entirely possible that practices and assumptions may vary from case to case or area to area where the machinery of the 1947 Mining Code or the 1954 Regulations is adopted.  However, it seems safe to assume that where the machinery is adopted, the opinion of the experts and the decision of the Mayor or the Court would state the assumptions upon which they have reached their conclusions and decisions.  It also seems likely that they would and should assume that good faith and reasonable skill would be used in exercising the easement.  If that is right, it is not clear why they should or would assume damage outside the area affected by the ROW or easement as the case may be.  These considerations contribute to my assessment that the meaning of “all damages” </p>

The Claimants, while accepting that the relevant machinery for oil pipeline works are to be found in Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the 1954 Regulations, point to the fact that the mechanism under the 1947 Mining Code includes the periodic fixing of compensation in advance, leading to payment of compensation every six months for the damage so calculated (in advance) for the respective period.  The experts agree that “[the 1954 Regulations] together with Article 116 of [the 1947 Mining Code] sets out the procedure for the valuation with the intervention of Experts before the municipal Court of the local jurisdiction” {H23.2/7/532}.  The Claimants rely upon the fact that, under Article 116, the compensation amount is fixed by the Mayor “with prior provisional expert assessment of the damages suffered, which cannot be appealed.”  Relying upon Article 116, the Claimants then submit that Article 5 of the 1954 Regulations is an amendment of the 6-monthly payment arrangement provided for by Article 116 of the 1947 Mining Code but that “nothing in Article 5 derogates from the principle in Article 116 of the 1947 Decree that the assessment of the compensation is to be a “prior provisional assessment” {C4/3.4/70} at [214].  The Claimants rely upon answers given by Professor Vallejo at {Day23/116:9} as Professor Vallejo “effectively accept[ing]” that this was the correct interpretation and a passage of discussion with the Court at {Day23/127:22} as the Court accepting that this was the effect of his evidence. </p>

First, the phrase “prior provisional assessment” does not appear in Articles 2, 3 or 4 of the 1954 Regulations.  Second, the notion of a “prior <span style="font-style:italic">provisional </span>assessment” (which, under Article 116, cannot be appealed) is inconsistent with (and cannot survive) an amendment to the mechanism by Articles 2-4 pursuant to which the expert’s determination leads to a ruling by the Court on the proper level of compensation that is to be accrued and paid once.  It can only have meaning in relation to periodic payments, which may permit a subsequent revision of a previous periodic assessment.  </p>

Nor is there any meaningful other sense in which the expert’s intervention under the machinery is provisional, as the experts in question have no further involvement even on the Claimants’ case that a separate action for damages may be brought.  The Claimants’ submission to the contrary seems to me to fall into the twin errors of assuming that the part of the machinery under Article 116 upon which they wish to rely survives and qualifies the mechanism under Articles 2-4 of the 1954 Regulations and of being essentially circular.   </p>

I reach that conclusion because (assuming that was what was intended to be put) I consider that the question was unclear and that if Professor Vallejo had been assenting to the wider proposition that I have set out above it would be inconsistent with the rest of his evidence, which was that the single accrual, assessment and payment of compensation for permanent occupation and damages is not susceptible to subsequent revision.  If I am wrong in that assessment of Professor Vallejo’s answer, I consider his answer to be inconsistent with the rest of his evidence and the other considerations that I set out in this section and I reject it as incorrect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">I will return to this statement of Professor Vallejo’s opinion later.  At this stage I merely note two points.  First, in his first paragraph Professor Vallejo states at (3) his opinion, which supports the Defendant’s case, that the compensation covers all damages resulting from the construction works performed in the property.  I take this to be an opinion on the legal effect of the payment of compensation pursuant to a valuation and determination in accordance with the Article 5 machinery.  As I have already pointed out, it is impossible to assert with any confidence what assumptions will be made by the experts, the Mayor or the Court about what damage will be caused when the works are carried out; in particular, it is impossible to assert with any confidence whether they will assume that any damage will be caused outside the area of the easement or the ROW as the case may be.  Second, in his second paragraph he states that “the intention of Article 5 is to prevent a landowner from obtaining compensation in respect of the damage caused by the construction and occupation of an oil pipeline more than once and therefore to preclude further claims whether in tort </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">or contract.”  I accept his opinion that the intention of Article 5 is to prevent multiple claims for damage that falls within the scope of the assessment that has been made operating the Article 5 machinery.  It is clearly referable and apposite to the scope of damages predicted by those involved in the Article 5 machinery.  However, his opinion is at least double-edged if the Article 5 determination of compensation is made on the basis of assumptions that exclude a certain scope of damage which, in the event, occurs.  Thus, for example, if the assessment of damages assumes that damage will be confined to the area of the ROW or the easement as the case may be, the intention of Article 5, as stated by Professor Vallejo, does not provide support for preventing recovery in respect of damage occurring outside the ROW or the easement since, by definition, there will be no double recovery.  </p>

This was wrong and Professor Castro later agreed that it can be brought into play by agreement between the parties that obviates the need to operate the Article 2-4 mechanism; but it explains and provides the context for Professor Castro’s opinion.  On that basis, Professor Castro’s opinion was that “the compensation referred to in Article 5 is paid once and for good” because the Article 2-4 mechanism provided “an objective and independent appraisal of all damages, with the possibility of judicial review in case of disagreement”: see [121].  She used similar language in [122] when she said that “the rule about one-time all-included compensation can only be applied if the procedure set forth by Articles 2-4 is followed completely”; and again in [123]: “If Article 5 is applied in full compliance with the above mentioned procedure, then the compensation paid should be final and no further assessment would be possible.”  However, the apparent clarity of these statements was qualified by the last two sentences of [123].  The first sentence was an assertion that damages which were “long term losses that were not within the contemplation of the parties” were not included in the ambit of Article 5 where “this method of assessing damages” was followed.  What is clear is that Professor Castro did not seek to make an exception based on whether or not the damage was caused by culpa.  But her opinion was that damage that was not addressed in the course of the Article 5 machinery was therefore “not within the contemplation of the parties” and was therefore not covered by the blanket exclusion which otherwise she recognised. </p>

The first is what the Defendant characterises as the clear and unqualified terms of Article 5, which Professor Castro acknowledged to be “a problem.”  For the reasons I have set out above, it is not right to import the notion of a “prior <span style="font-style:italic">provisional</span> expert<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>assessment” in the way suggested by the Claimants.  Professor Castro’s acceptance that her construction was problematic in the face of the wording of Article 5 was reasonable, since the wording of Article 5 does not provide express support for her views and it would be possible to interpret the words “all damages” as meaning “all damages which may in the event be caused by the entrepreneur’s activities, whether contemplated and included in the compensation as assessed or not”.  However, for the reasons I have given, I do not consider that the terms of Article 5 are clear so as to preclude any other interpretation. </p>

	  <content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.10in">recipe for multiple claims, which is the very thing that Article 5 was intended to prevent; and it would prevent investors from having a serious and objective estimate of the damage which would be payable to landowners.  Professor Castro did not provide a ready definition of “normal” damage, but that should not prove to be a difficult problem in any given case.  Furthermore, in any given case the assumptions that have been made by the experts, the Mayor or the Court as to what damage would be caused by the pipeline should be clear and will provide the starting point for assessing what was and was not in contemplation and assumptions that were applied.  Those assumptions may with good reason differ from case to case, as the facts of the lead cases and the evidence at trial show: a pipeline may run through widely differing topographies and present widely differing challenges. It is only necessary to compare the gentle slopes of LC54 with the much more challenging terrain of LC50 or LC74.  What damage is “normal” or to be contemplated in such circumstances?  On the evidence that is before this Court it is neither necessary nor desirable to try to lay down strict parameters.  It is not desirable because the assumptions that have been made in the course of the operation of the Article 5 machinery should be clear; and it is not necessary because a Colombian Court would be just as well able to determine whether a subsequent claim fell within the ambit of the prior assessment and decision or not.  The Defendant’s floodgates argument can readily be overstated.  On the Claimants’ interpretation, it is not open to an aggrieved landowner to bring a further claim simply because the damage he suffered was more severe than that assessed by the Article 5 machinery.  He will only be entitled to bring a further claim if he can </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">show that the damage for which he now seeks compensation was not within the scope of the assessment.  As I have said, the Court does not have direct evidence of assessments made pursuant to Article 5 as the cases in this litigation involve agreements, which require separate consideration.  But, taking the analogy of a typical ROW Agreement in this case, where an assessment determined that the relevant compensation for the passage and occupation of the pipeline comprised damage to the land taken by the ROW (which necessarily contemplates watercourses crossed by the ROW), destruction of certain fences, loss of certain trees and destruction of certain structures, it would not be open to the landowner subsequently to argue that he had been undercompensated for the damage to his land taken by the ROW, that the length or value of his fences had been underestimated, that he had in fact had more trees on the ROW or that they were more valuable than assessed, or that the value of the structure had been underassessed.  All such matters would clearly be within scope of the assessment and the ambit of the Article 5 exclusion.  On any view, that is a substantial protection for the oil entrepreneur and will, or should, preclude many claims. </p>

It is also correct that the terms of the 1954 Regulations do not state that the amendments made by those regulations were intended to provide a more limited regime which required or permitted that it be topped up by additional claims for damages through the courts.  However, that does not of itself either point to or determine the proper interpretation of Article 5 because, if it is right that the Article 5 assessment does not contemplate or include certain types of damage because they cannot be assessed at that time, the 1954 Regulations are simply silent on how that omission is to be addressed. </p>

The laying of pipelines is a dangerous activity so that culpa is presumed and does not have to be proved.  Professor Castro did not directly address this difficulty, but it is real: if cases where culpa is either proved or presumed are outside the ambit of Article 5, the Article would provide no protection to the pipeline layer at all.  The Claimants rely upon the experts’ agreement that damage caused by dolo or gross negligence is outside the ambit of Article 5.  That is of no assistance to the Claimants because of Article 1522 of the Civil Code, which declares invalid any agreement that forgives future dolo: see [176].  Nor is there any reason to assume that, simply because dolo and gross negligence are not expressly mentioned as founding an exception to Article 5, culpa is to be treated in the same way because (or although) it is not mentioned either. </p>

Subsequently HOCOL’s concession was terminated and its rights were transferred to Ecopetrol, representing the state.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The final major strand of the Claimants’ argument rests upon the assertion that Professor Vallejo’s view, if upheld, would be extremely unfair to landowners.  The Defendant responds to this submission by pointing to the wider balance of interests including the impact of the regulatory regime.  I do not find either submission strongly persuasive, because it was for the Colombian law makers to establish the balance that was to be struck between landowners and oil entrepreneurs.  The Court’s task is to identify that balance, not to strike its own.  Whether the correct interpretation is the Claimants’ or that of the Defendant, compensation payments made under Article 5 may be insufficient to provide full compensation for damage that is caused to affected land, because the Article 5 assessment may clearly comprehend, but undercompensate, damage that will occur – for example on the ROW or the area of the easement.  From the point of view of the landowner that is obviously disadvantageous and regrettable, but it is implicitly accepted even on the Claimants’ interpretation.  In some cases the effect of Professor Vallejo’s view would be to increase the discrepancy between the Article 5 payment and the damage that is caused - for example if the Article 5 assessment assumes that there will be no damage off the ROW or the area of the easement.  That is, equally obviously, more disadvantageous and more regrettable from the point of view of the landowner.  However, the extent of the disadvantage can only be determined by deciding the correct interpretation of Article 5, and not the other way round.  And, as the discussion above has already made clear, the landowner retains the right to claim further compensation if he can prove dolo or gross negligence; and the private law rights of the landowner are not to be viewed in isolation, being balanced against the beneficial status of the oil industry. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The balance that has been struck by the Colombian legislature includes the limitations upon the right of compensation imposed by the 1954 Regulations.  It also includes the regulatory structure described elsewhere in this judgment.  Particular aspects of that structure include the requirement that the oil entrepreneur must obtain approval from the Ministry (including approval of the route to be taken) and must obtain an environmental licence which, as the licence in the present case shows, may impose substantial requirements; and the structure provides for detailed technical standards to be imposed.  As Professor Castro agreed, the regulatory structure gives rise to ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with the Licence {Day20/88:2}. The environmental licence in this case stated that the Ministry would supervise the execution of the works and verify compliance with the licence; and it provided for the Ministry to determine and stipulate corrective measures in the event of unforeseen environmental effects; and the licence itself required the licensee to establish a compensation scheme for damage caused during the construction works: see [341].  There is evidence of continuing monitoring and investigation, including an investigation in 2002 which required Ocensa to take various steps {K60/588/1}.  In addition, there are public law remedies that a landowner can invoke, including bringing an “action for compliance” or an “action popular”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>{H15/1/190}. </p>

However, any interpretation of a legal provision which deprives a landowner of any compensation for damage however extensive and whether or not that damage could have been, would have been or was contemplated when the Article 5 compensation was fixed requires careful scrutiny, particularly when it would have been simple and straightforward for the lawmakers to clarify their meaning if that was what was intended.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There can be no doubt that, in advance of building the pipeline, it was contemplated that damage caused outside the strip of land required for the ROW would be the subject of future agreement and further compensation over and above the initial evaluation for the purposes of the ROW Agreement, which would be of those damages which may be caused to the occupied strip of land {K9/34T/39}: see [359].  This was reflected in the Land Acquisition Manual, which included in the Final Phase of activities that “the Land Negotiator will verify the payment of the damages caused by the Ocensa contractors out of the area negotiated by the Company” {K66/618T/13}; and it was also reflected in the contractual arrangements between Ocensa and Saipem, which made the payment of final sums due under Saipem’s contract dependent upon provision by Saipem of Paz y Salvos from affected landowners {J14/54.1/66}.  Mr Allison, of whom more later, was equally in no doubt that the processes that were to be undertaken for negotiating compensation in advance would not preclude the need for later re-evaluation and further compensation.  To the contrary, his evidence was that there was very likely to be damage outside the ROW and so there had to be a mechanism for coping with that {Day15/25:18}.  It is beyond argument that the oil entrepreneurs in this case considered that there would be additional compensation that had to be paid after the works were completed.   </p>

It remains of interest, however, that someone (evidently a lawyer) said, in a sentence that resonates with Professor Castro’s opinion: “Let’s remember that in our uncouth and sometimes disorganised legislation, there are norms which ought to be studied and analysed as a whole and that no matter how specialised the matter they should not be put to one side.  This is the case with the provisions regarding contractual and extra contractual civil responsibility to which we respectfully refer” {K19/154T3/1}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I have concluded that Professor Vallejo’s statement of opinion as stated in (3) of the first paragraph of the summary of his opinion set out at [217] requires qualification in the light of Professor Castro’s evidence that the Article 5 exclusion of future claims applies when the assessment is “complete and objective”.  I have reached this conclusion on the basis of the considerations I have set out at length above, my primary reasons being that I do not regard the terms of Article 5 as being clear and that, even allowing for the acknowledged fact that the Colombian State has deliberately established a regime that is favourable to the oil industry, I can see no good reason for extending the protection given by Article 5 beyond the scope of an assessment or decision that is made when operating its machinery.  I do not need or attempt to lay down a comprehensive or prescriptive code to define what will and will not be considered to be within the scope of a particular assessment or decision, for the simple reason that this case does not involve any case where the Article 5 machinery was operated so as to give rise to an assessment of damages by either the Mayor or the Court.  However, the mere fact that, in the event, the Article 5 compensation proves to be under-compensation for the damage that is within the scope of the assessment will not be good grounds for claiming further compensation, which has some relevance for what comes later.  An interpretation of Article 5 which precludes any further claim in respect of damages that were within the scope of the original assessment but permits claims for damage falling outside the scope of the assessment that has been carried out under the Regulations still provides considerable protection for the oil industry.  I would expect that any assessment by the experts, the Mayor or the Court would include within its scope damages that would be regarded as “normal” but what is regarded as “normal” may vary from case to case.  However, what was within the scope of the original assessment will be determinable on the facts of the case because the assumptions underlying the assessment should be clear from the operation of the Article 5 machinery by the experts, the Mayor or the Court exercising their respective functions.  As I have said, I do not know what basis or scope of assessment is in fact applied by the Colombian courts that are charged with this responsibility.  My conclusion is therefore purely one of principle on the meaning of Article 5 without knowing whether it would have any application in real life after an assessment by the Colombian court. </p>

So, for example, if on the proper construction of an agreement it covered only damage on the ROW and not any future damage off the ROW and did so on terms that did not prevent such damage from being subject to later assessement or compensation, effect should be given to that agreement because the oil company would voluntarily have given up its potential protection pursuant to Article 5 for damage off the ROW.  I see nothing in Article 5 which renders it impermissible for an oil company to contract on those terms, if it so wished.  The fact that the Ocensa works were carried out (and could only be carried out) pursuant to an Environmental Licence which required Ocensa to establish a system for the evaluation of the damage caused during the construction works and the adoption of immediate mitigation, recovery and compensation measures is material.  It means that Ocensa could not have contended at any stage that the payments it made to landowners pursuant to the ROW Agreements excluded the possibility of future payments being made without putting itself in breach of the Licence.  I consider the contracts in this litigation elsewhere as appropriate: see [374] below. <br/></p>

I have kept those submissions in mind at all times when assessing the quality and reliability of the evidence that each witness has given.  It is true that the environment of an English court hearing, whether the witness travelled to London or gave evidence by videolink from Colombia, was alien for all of the lay witnesses called on behalf of the Claimants and, to a lesser extent, for those called on behalf of the Defendant.  It is also true that it took some time before some of the Counsel on each side shed some of the bad habits that can creep into the technique of even the most expert examiners and cross-examiners.  In general, where questions were liable to confuse a witness, either the witness made clear that the question was not understood or the Court or Counsel intervened to obtain more acceptable formulations.  In reviewing the evidence for the purposes of writing this judgment, there have been very few occasions where it has seemed that there was a significant misunderstanding between Counsel and the questioner. </p>

All of the witnesses for whom English was not their first language were courteous and some used phrases which might not have been expected of a witness from England.  A recurring example was to respond to Counsel who said “thank you” after an answer by saying “you are welcome” or “my pleasure”.  But these and other courtesies did not appear to be the product of undue deference.  On the contrary, the canny toughness to which I refer elsewhere in the judgment was often in evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The main difficulty with the lay evidence is that a number of witnesses were poor historians.  This applied extensively to evidence where chronology was important.  As will be seen in the analysis and review of the evidence in the Sections dealing with the four Trial Lead Cases in detail, there are a number of critically important points where I reject the evidence of the lay witnesses about when things happened.  The Claimants accepted and submitted in relation to a number of witnesses that they would have difficulty in putting events in chronological order for cultural reasons.  I accept and have made due allowance for the fact that this is so.  But the problem went deeper than that.  Reviewing the lay evidence overall as one of the last parts of writing this judgment, I find myself driven to the conclusion that the Claimants’ inherent difficulties with chronological memory have on occasions been reinforced by the process of litigation.  For numerous reasons, including time constraints, this trial and this judgment have not investigated in detail how that came about; but it certainly did.  The problem showed itself in ways that were both general and particular.  Particular instances include the timing of Snr Sequeda’s (LC39) house move and when Snr Buitrago and Snr Manco (LC50) dug their fish ponds – there are numerous others that are to be found in the Sections dealing with the Lead Cases in detail.  More generally, the mantra that the ODC pipeline caused no damage and that all of the Claimants’ troubles started with the Ocensa pipeline pervaded the evidence and was frequently wrong for the reasons that I have detailed elsewhere. </p>

The mere fact that there are inconsistencies or unreliability in parts of a witness’ evidence is normal in the Court’s experience, which must be taken into account when assessing the evidence as a whole and whether some parts can be accepted as reliable.  I also accept wholeheartedly the observation of the Court of Appeal, made in a different context in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (a child) </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 12 at [20], that “wading through a mass of evidence, much of it usually uncorroborated and often coming from witnesses who, for whatever reasons, may be neither reliable nor even truthful, the difficulty of discerning where the truth actually lies, what findings he can properly make, is often one of almost excruciating difficulty.  Yet as Baroness Hale of Richmond tartly observed … “it is a task which we are paid to perform to the best of our ability”.  The task, as she acknowledged, is a difficult one, to be performed without prejudice and preconceived ideas.”  Those observations are directly applicable to the task of fact finding in this case.  The task has been difficult; and I have not ducked it.   </p>

I have been very conscious that cultural difficulties and the fact of hearing evidence in translation may have made that process less secure than might otherwise have been the case and have made as much allowance for those features as possible.  I have also, inevitably, had to look at the internal quality of the evidence, and to use the other techniques and cross-checks that will always be used by the English courts when assessing witness evidence.  I have at all times looked for what the Claimants called a kernel of truth in even the least satisfactory evidence.  The length of this judgment is in no small measure because of the need for extreme care in assessing the witness evidence and because, where unreliable, its unreliability was often not apparent simply on the face of what the witness came to court to say.   </p>

The Cusiana field was discovered in about 1988; the Cupiagua field was discovered about four years later.  Two pipelines were constructed at an early stage.  The Oleoducto Central de los Llanos (or “OCL”) pipeline ran from El Porvenir in the south to Vasconia and the Oleoducto de Colombia (or “ODC”) pipeline ran from Vasconia to Coveñas in the north.  The ODC pipeline was laid in 1990-1991 and is important for this litigation and judgment.    </p>

Its installation would have been subject to the regulatory regime then in place.  It commenced before the introduction of law 93 of 1993 and no environmental licence is available to the court.  It is, however, clear that those responsible for the ODC pipeline engaged with affected landowners in advance of laying the pipeline.  As happened later with the Ocensa pipeline, notice was initially given of the intention to carry out the works.  Later, agreements were entered into with the landowners pursuant to which a payment would have been made that would have fallen within the terms of Article 5 of the 1954 Regulations.   </p>

Later, in May 1996, he entered into another damages agreement with ODC {M/183T/726.0.5} under which he was to be paid COP 5,000,000 because the passing of a drill over land outside the ROW had caused damage in an area of 10,000m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>and had formed a lake with sediments in the area of the ROW in an area of 20,000m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>.

There is no evidence that LC50, LC54 or LC74 entered into such a document with ODC or its contractors.  It is probable that ODC would have attempted to enter into Paz y Salvos with landowners, at least where there had been a claim for damages over and above the damage contemplated by the original ROW agreements, but the evidence does not permit a finding that it did so in every case or in every case where there had been a claim for additional damages.  The fact that the LC39 Paz y Salvo relates to damage caused outside the area covered by the original easement and was concluded with ODC’s contractor suggests that ODC operated a system like that subsequently operated by Ocensa, under which ODC took responsibility for additional damage on the ROW while its contractors took responsibility for damage off it.  However, not enough is known about the ODC approach to settling cases and obtaining Paz y Salvos to make specific findings on this point. </p>

Work on Phase I started in 1993 and was designed to increase production levels from about 12,000 barrels per day (“bpd”) to about 185,000 bpd.  Above 185,000 bpd production was constrained by the lack of pipeline transportation infrastructure.  Accordingly Phase II had two components.  The first was to increase field production up to about 500,000 bpd by about 1998.  The second was to construct an 800km pipeline and related infrastructure from the oilfields to Coveñas in the North, which would expand average pipeline transportation capacity to 560,000 bpd. </p>

Thus, for example, the Operator was required to determine the number of employees and their selection, their hours of work and compensation (Article 4.8);  it was to acquire and furnish all materials and equipment required in the performance of the JOA and the Association Contracts, making every effort to obtain them on terms and conditions most favourable to all of the Parties to the JOA (Article 4.9(b)); it was to select all contractors to be used in the Joint Operations and award contracts on specified criteria (Article 4.9(e)); it was to secure or cause to be secured all permits, easements and other necessary rights (Article 4.9(f)); it was to perform (or cause to be performed) in a good and workmanlike manner all engineering, design and construction work on the project in accordance with the terms of the JOA (Article 4.9(m)); and it was to carry out each Work Program within the limits of the relevant Budget.  In addition it was to discharge various administrative functions such as providing to the Parties designated reports and such other reports as the Operating Committee may determine (Article 4.9(c)), keeping books, accounts and records (Article 4.9(j)), and (when and as directed by the Operating Committee) representing the Parties before Ecopetrol and the Government (Article 4.9(k)). </p>

These powers and duties included (by Article 5.4)  “(a) the consideration and determination of all matters relating to general policies, procedures and methods of Joint Operations; (b) the consideration, revision and approval or disapproval of all proposed work programs, budgets and [authorisations for expenditure] prepared and submitted to it … ; (e) the consideration and, if so required, the determination of any other matter relating to the Joint Operations which may be referred to it by any party or which is otherwise designated under [the JOA] for reference to it.”  Work Programs and Budgets required approval by the Operating Committee and, when given, that approval authorized and obliged the Operator to proceed in accordance with them (Article 6.1).

First, the Operator was to have exclusive charge of the Joint Operations and was the party that was to conduct them.  The 1994 JOA did not contemplate that the other parties (or the Defendant except when acting in its capacity as Operator) would become directly involved in the conduct of the Joint Operations: the central purpose of appointing the Operator was to relieve the Joint Venturers (as such) of the need for all to become involved in the direct running of the Joint Operations.  Article 5 of the 1994 JOA identifies the degree of control to be exercised by the Operating Committee as being essentially high level and supervisory, so as to give it “overall” management: this is shown by the extracts set out above and is consistent with the authorizing and obliging effect of approval of Work Programmes and Budgets.  Thus, while it would be correct to say that the Operating Committee held ultimate residual power, the Operator was charged with conducting the Joint Operations and was expected to direct them.  Viewed from outside the joint venturers’ camp, it was the Operator who was going to run the Joint Operations. </p>

Clause 2 committed the Parties to conduct various Preliminary Activities including Technical Studies containing but not limited to preliminary engineering as necessary, routing, permits and rights of way, and environmental studies.  These studies were to be completed to the satisfaction of all Parties as a prerequisite to forming an SA (Clause 2.4).  In order to conduct the Preliminary Activities during the Initial Stage, the Parties agreed to appoint a Steering Committee consisting of one representative of each Party.  The Steering Committee was to determine the governing rules for the performance of the Preliminary Activities and was to be superseded by a similarly tasked body set up under the Articles of Incorporation of the SA (Clause 3).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The soils in the area of interest typically present three or four different layers or “horizons”.  Where present, the surface layer will be horizon O, which is formed by the accumulation of undecomposed organic materials (such as leaves, branches or other organic debris).  It is most prominent in forested areas because of the organic matter shed by the trees, but even in the forests there is little or no opportunity for significant amounts of organic matter to be added to the soil because of rapid decomposition caused by high temperatures and high biological activity.  Horizon O tends to disappear when forest is cleared for agricultural use because the existing organic material decomposes and is not replaced.  Accordingly, the first horizon that is typically encountered is a surface layer of topsoil (horizon A).  Topsoil is substantially comprised of decomposed organic materials which give it a relatively dark colour; it is the horizon that will be richest in nutrients and other characteristics which mean that most biological activity (e.g. root growth, worms, fungi and bacteria) will occur there.  The potential productivity of the soil depends as a whole upon the depth and composition of the horizon A.  The next layer (horizon B) is a subsuperficial horizon, which contains less organic material than horizon A, and is therefore lighter in colour.  Root growth and other biological process can continue into horizon B but to a progressively decreasing extent with depth.  Below horizon B comes horizon C, which is the soil’s parent material, which has been produced by the alteration of the underlying rock<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The composition of the soils on the properties through which the Ocensa pipeline ran varied, but some generalisations can be made.  First, tropical soils typically have a thin layer of topsoil (&lt;15 cms) because the conditions do not allow for the contribution of much additional organic matter when the forest canopy is removed.  Second, deforestation results in a reduction in the soil’s organic content.  Third, soils in the region generally have low levels of fertility because of low levels of essential minerals which are exacerbated by water run-off and leaching.  Fourth, the soils tend to be very acidic.  Fifth, as the depth of soil increases, so the level of organic material will decrease.  Sixth, the soils are fragile, both because of the thinness of horizon A, and also because they are susceptible to erosion.  The precise susceptibility to erosion will depend upon a number of variables including the composition of the soil, the extent of vegetation cover (or lack of it), the amount and heaviness of rainfall, and the flatness or steepness of the terrain.  As a general proposition and rule, deforestation leads to increased rates of surface water runoff and erosion because of the absence of the protective canopy of trees.  The extent to which it will do so depends upon the agricultural practices that follow and the extent to which the soil is or remains exposed to direct impact from rain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dr Obando, the expert agrologist instructed on behalf of the Claimants, did not challenge these summaries.  He relied upon IGAC’s later survey, which was carried out in 2007 and which was to the same effect.  He also made the point that IGAC categorised the susceptibility of the soils to erosion as “high” {H3.4/4/670}; and it was his opinion that the IGAC’s regional descriptions were broadly applicable to the four trial properties {H3.4/4} at 931, 986, 1028, 1109.  Dr Card and Dr Savigny agreed that “the soils on Lead Claimant properties are an inseparable mixture of silts and clays classified according to the Unified Soil Classification System as (a) silts of low to high plasticity and (b) clays of intermediate to high plasticity.  A very small fraction of soil falls outside these two classifications and is non-plastic. … [The soils] exist as a uniformly heterogeneous mixture of varying constituent proportions of clay, silt and sand sized particles.” {H23.3/8/579}.  I accept that the regional descriptions and the experts’ summaries (as above) are accurate general descriptions of the soils on the Lead Claimant properties.  It is also common ground that once soils are disturbed, they lose cohesion {Day35/33:20}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The central area of Antioquia has been and remains a wild and lawless place. Leftwing guerrilla groups perpetrated violence, extortion and kidnapping which led to the formation of a right-wing group known as Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (“AUC”) in 1997.  The AUC was made up of drug-traffickers and landowners who were trying to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion by left-wing groups; and it had its roots in paramilitary armies built up by the drug barons in the 1980s.  In about 2003 there was a pact but the vacuum has been filled by criminal gangs, or bacrims, who are also involved in drug trafficking and extortion.  All of these groups were very violent and conducted turf wars throughout the region.  Snr Mesa (LC54) gave evidence, which I readily accept, that during the time of the criminal gangs he did not go to his property, La Fe, very much and that he was always frightened when he did go (though his farm manager continued to live on the property throughout the period): {D6/100/1179} at [68-69] and {Day6/15:5} ff.  His wife, Rita Aranga gave evidence to like effect, saying that the situation had been bad since the 1980s, while pointing out that there is also fear in the cities that Colombians have to endure. </p>

Video footage repeatedly shows soldiers of the Colombian military providing heavily armed protection against attacks on contractors working on the pipeline. Similar footage and photographs taken during evidence gathering for the current litigation illustrates the ever present danger of violence, extortion and death continuing until the present day. It is easy to admire both those who lived their daily lives under such conditions and the people who undertook substantial engineering projects through technically difficult terrain at considerable personal risk to themselves.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Claimants range from those who can be described as true subsistence farmers, being dependent upon their land for the basic needs of life, to those whose properties generate surpluses of varying size.  There is an active barter economy between neighbours both as to goods and in the matter of helping each other on the land.  Labour is sometimes purchased, depending on the scale of the enterprise, the willingness of neighbours to help and the availability of labour for monetary hire.  Normal sale transactions take place between neighbours and through markets, though access to markets can be difficult.  Travelling merchants may purchase large quantities of a crop; but in the absence of that there is an ever-present risk of inability to get produce to an effective market outlet.  This can and often does result in wasted production, often accompanied by generosity to neighbours who may get foodstuffs either for free or by barter that would otherwise go to waste.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">On the assumption that the four trial cases are typical, a farmer will typically engage in the gradual clearance of his land.  Newly cleared land may be cultivated before being turned over to pasture.  The land will sustain crops, cattle and relatively modest levels of other livestock.  Rotation of crops is practiced, with the minimum period of rotation being about three or four years and longer periods imposing less strain on the fragile and infertile soils.  The wooded areas may provide timber either for use on the farm or for selling on: Snr Buitrago (LC50), for example, first fell in with Snr Manco when he proposed that Snr Manco should buy half his farm and set up a joint timber production business {D5/91/1021} at [17]. </p>

The farmers were financial minnows, many of whom were illiterate and (though undoubtedly canny in the context of their daily lives) not versed in business: the opposite is true of the oil entrepreneurs, including the Defendant.  Although the licensing system made provision for public education about and involvement in the process leading to the laying of the pipeline, with public hearings attended by individuals from local communities as well as public officials who actively intervened in the process (e.g. the Ministry of Environment, the Governor of Antioquia, the Attorney General’s delegates, local Mayors, the Ombudsman’s office and others {K21/197/3}, {E1/5/244} at [9.4], {K21/184T/1}), a disparity in bargaining power inevitably remained.  In negotiations between the parties, the entrepreneurs had the added benefit of their industry being declared to be of public benefit and the long-stop prospect of expropriation, as explained at [24], [38] and [112] above. </p>

Average monthly temperatures are in the region of 25-27º centigrade throughout the year.  Annual rainfall increases as one progresses north towards the Coastal Plains, but even at the southern end of Pipeline North annual rainfall is very high.  For the stretch encompassing LCs 74, 50, 39 and 54 annual rainfall ranges from about 2850 mm in the south to about 4100 mm in the north.  By way of comparison, average annual rainfall in the South of England is in the region of 840 mm.  There are two illdefined rainy periods, the first in May and the second between August and November; however, in the intermediate months of June and July, significant precipitations take place.  Furthermore, even in the dry season from late November/early December to March/April there may be heavy rainfall.  1996 was a particularly wet year.   </p>

In general, there is a period of increased rainfall between the months of April and November.  During the rest of the year, between December and March, there is a period of less precipitation (the dry season).”  While there were variations from year to year and place to place along the stretch of Pipeline North, the general pattern was well known to all: there was a severe risk of frequent and very heavy rainfall during the wet season.  The risk was reduced during the dry season, but occasional outbreaks of rain, which could be heavy, were always possible. </p>

How much and what soil was removed as part of the grading would depend upon the pre-existing state of the land and site-specific construction requirements.  Stage I included geotechnical works to protect topsoil stockpiles.

It was issued for enquiry in February 1995 and for construction in May 1995.  Ocensa’s name did not appear on it: the name of the joint venturers did.  It was accepted by Snr Loeber in evidence (and I too accept) that, at least in ideal conditions, it could apply during the period of construction.  However, it was clearly an idealised representation and should be treated as such.  Subject to that limitation, what it showed was a ROW of 25m width with the ODC pipeline running to the extreme left of the plan.  The Ocensa pipeline was to be installed 10m to the right of the ODC pipeline.  Topsoil from the ROW was to be stacked at either side of the ROW, with the left hand pile being to the right of the line of the ODC pipeline.  The trench spoil was to be deposited to the left of the Ocensa pipeline trench leaving a working width of 15m to the right of the Ocensa pipeline trench for the contractors’ workspace.  On the evidence at trial, it is clear that, even where the Ocensa pipeline and ROW followed the course of the ODC pipeline and ROW, there was no universal practice that the ODC pipeline would be at the very edge of the Ocensa ROW although some offset was necessary so as to avoid damaging it in the course of the Ocensa works.  </p>

The Brown &amp; Root “ideal condition” drawing and others in the same series show no substantial stockpiles of soil, although these were a recognised feature of the construction works in places along the ROW, depending upon how much soil had to be removed in the process of grading and where it could be stored – of which more later.   </p>

The dimensions of the trench would mean that the piles of material excavated from them would usually not be large.  Much greater quantities of soil might be generated by the stripping and grading works.  Sometimes this soil could be accommodated without the use of stockpiles but, particularly in hilly terrain, that might not be possible and stockpiles (which could be very large) might be required at intervals along the ROW.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In closing submissions, the Claimants suggested that the ODC pipeline was inherently likely to have caused less environmental disruption because less heavy machinery was used, this submission being based upon the model of bulldozer being used.  However, a promotional film about the laying of the ODC pipeline in 1992 {L1/134} shows that, even if the laying of the Ocensa pipeline (as shown on numerous photographs and films) may have included the use of what was described as a “bigger digger”, the ODC pipeline construction process was not materially different.  To the contrary, the ODC film gives a good illustration of the size and scope of both undertakings.  It shows the destructive effects of guerrilla attacks (at 3.39), with the commentary frequently referring to the fact that slow progress was made and stoppages occurred because of the security situation.  As will be seen when the individual lead cases are considered, these stoppages could directly affect the impact of the works upon landowners.  The film also shows the use of substantial bulldozers and other heavy machinery (often tracked) for stripping the soil, moving the pipes into position, laying them in the trench, backfilling and regrading the ROW.  Extracts showing bulldozers at work stripping and shifting large quantities of soil (e.g. at 5.09-5.18, 6.22-6.33 and 9.28-10.12) demonstrate the inevitability that soil from different horizons will be mixed when the ODC ROW is being stripped. They also show that the fact that the Brown &amp; Root “ideal condition” drawing described at [308] above is an idealised representation that conveys little of the variation in the terrain and the challenges inherent in the project that was being undertaken.  Other extracts show the use of the ODC ROW by large machinery of all sorts (e.g. at 7.52-8.00 and 9.10-9.15), the varying width of the scar created by the ROW (e.g. at 4.15, and 23.59-24.20), and clear examples of erosion on the ROW and stockpiles of soil (e.g. at 4.26-5.03).  The film appears to have been a promotional or publicity venture; but it gives a clear impression of the scale of the work involved in laying the pipelines and the likely impact of the project on the environment even when geotechnical measures are in place to minimise erosion and damage.   </p>

The qualification is that the ODC ROW was typically 20 metres wide while the Ocensa ROW was typically 25 metres wide (in both cases before the addition of sobreanchos).  As a result, the area disturbed by the Ocensa ROW was typically larger over a given distance than the ODC ROW.  It is the Claimants’ case that no significant damage to their properties was caused by the ODC pipeline and that all of the features of which they complain were attributable to the Ocensa pipeline.  That will be examined in detail later.  However, at this stage I find that the ODC pipeline works will have caused some erosion and sedimentation from the ROW and the associated works. There is much less direct evidence about where, when, and to what extent such erosion and sedimentation occurred.  I will return to that evidence when answering the question </p>

The various experts agree that the environmental risks to soil were erosion, sedimentation and loss of soil productivity {H23.1/2/99}, erosion of the soils inside the ROW {H23.2/6/363}, risks generated by soil erosion, sedimentation of the lower parts of the farms and the channels due to the movement of personnel, machinery and equipment {H23.1/4/262} and geotechnical and hydrotechnical geohazards of which erosion, bank erosion and channel aggradation, creation of wetlands and avulsion are those that represent the majority of alleged impact on Lead Claimant properties {H23.3/8/568}.

Once the pipe is installed and pressure tested, the banks and stream bed will be reformed, using the protection works required.”  The EMP included specifications for stream crossings, divided between Main Stream Crossings (Specification No. B-6-1), Major Stream Crossings (Specification No. B-6-2) and Minor Stream Crossings (Specification No. B-6-3) {K9/35T/156}.  The streams on the trial claim properties are not included in the schedule of streams that are said to be considered minor crossings for the purposes of the specification and “Minor Streams” are not defined. Snr Gasca said that the measures set out in the specification were only applied to the streams in the schedule {Day16/89:24}.  However, photograph 1819-15 {K9/35T/156} suggests that the specification was (or should have been) relevant to most, if not all, of them.  Certainly the environmental impacts which the specification considered (including removal of the riverbed protection vegetation cover and  resuspension of riverbed sediments) and the actions specified (including that once the crossing is made, the banks where material has been removed must be reconditioned to leave them in their original condition; and that bank vegetation must be recovered), the need to protect banks with rock fill, soil-cement sacks or concrete sacks and the need to use temporary culverts are all relevant to the well-known risks that would arise where the ROW crosses a stream. </p>

The importance attached to river crossings was made clear by the contract requirement that Saipem was to provide pictures to establish conditions before and after of the River or Stream to be crossed.  A written agreement was to be prepared by Saipem to be signed by Ocensa and the affected landowner, establishing the existing flow rates and special conditions of the river and adjacent banks of the Rivers or Streams before performing any work related to the crossings.

The design incorporated a wider spacing between ditch diverters and a less robust design of the diverters themselves than had been used on previous projects, which was justified by the introduction of the erosion matting {H23.3/8/618}. The primary design documents were the EMP {K9/35T/182} and the RECS {K14/95}, {K27/262}. Although Dr Card originally criticised the design as there set out, his criticism was misplaced: see [565] below.  However, in October 1996 Saipem requested permission (by TQ61) to omit erosion matting on slopes between 10 and 20% on the basis that it would guarantee reseeding between ditch diverters by TQ61. {K66/611/2}.  On 27 January 1997 the request was refused by Ocensa for Spreads A and A2, but permitted for Spread B on the stated basis of different soil characteristics {K66/611/3}.  The result of this was that for Spread B properties (which would have included LC50 and LC74 {Day16/78:23} ff), matting was omitted from about October 1996 on slopes between 10 and 20%.  On Spreads A and A2, though Saipem’s request was refused for the future, Ocensa permitted that “acceptable work performed to date will be left as it is”.  </p>

In addition to the use of matting and the other available geotechnical techniques outlined above, revetment may be carried out in a number of different ways.  As with all other measures, the need for revetment will depend upon all of the variables in play at a given location.  In some cases, direct drilling under the bed of the stream will prevent or minimise disruption to the stream bed and banks; alternatively, the trench may be excavated from the surface, in which case temporary measures will include diversion of the flow of water using flumes and culverts, after which reinstatement works will inevitably be necessary to restore the bed and banks and to preserve them from future degradation.  Many of the streams in the area are peripheral (in the sense that they may be dry for part of the year). What works are necessary at stream crossings is fact sensitive in every case. </p>

The report set out the background and listed the information that had been provided.  The scale of the information provided is indicated by the fact that the project file sent by the Legal Office of the Ministry to the Sectoral Environmental Department was accompanied by 26 volumes of environmental studies: {K24/240T/1} at [3].  The report recorded the calling of Public Audiences by the Minster in the affected municipalities and went on to analyse the various routing options, opting for the use of the ODC corridor.  It studied the likely impact of the project, concluding that the greatest negative impacts would be generated during the construction phase, that the erosion of slopes would increase as a result of opening the ROW, and that the socioeconomic component would receive the greatest positive impacts as a result of the construction of the Project {K24/240T/19} at [1.5].  While noting that some of the information that had been provided was incomplete, the report concluded with proposed conditions that should be attached to the environmental licence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The Minister’s call for public audiences led to five public meetings, the closest to the Lead Claimants being held in Zaragoza on 19 May 1995 and Puerto Berrio on 23 June 1995. The meetings were advertised in newspapers and on the radio and were well attended {E1/5/244} at [9.4].  The official minutes of the meeting at Zaragoza {K21/184T/1} (which I take to be accurate) record that the route selection and environmental impact were explained.  The Mayor of Zaragoza said that “the old pipeline [i.e. the ODC pipeline] left a bad impression, so they do not want to make the same mistake.”  That was taken up later by the Director of the Environmental Affairs Office of the Antioquia Branch of Inderena (which had regulated environmental issues before law 93 of 1993) said that there had been breach of several obligations of the resolution granting the Environmental Licence for the previous (i.e. ODC) pipeline and that “the area of the previous pipeline will be overflown in order to determine the damage and to recover the area and to avoid repeating the same mistakes.”  The Attorney-General’s delegate said that the objective of the Attorney General’s office “is to defend the collective interest in the environment and the rights of the communities in attendance.”  In terms of the project he said that “according to the fly-by made over the region, natural resources are seriously damaged; deforestation and impact due to mining activity must be addressed by adopting a recovery plan co-ordinated by the Ministry of Environment … .”  The representative of the Ombudsman’s Office intervened.  Issues of compensation were raised, including the non-payment of money for the ODC pipeline.  At the end of the meeting, Ocensa answered a number of the questions that had been asked.  It said that it (Ocensa) was the party responsible for the project that would address concerns at Zaragoza, Medellin and offices set up at camps along the way.  One hundred and twenty people attended the meeting, which lasted from 9.20 am to 4.45 pm. </p>

The initial presentation on behalf of Ocensa emphasised the environmental protection work and the construction techniques including various protective measures.  The Attorney General’s delegate “reiterated to the Ministry of Environment that this is a region and a project where basins are in a high level of degradation; plans must be drawn for managing and recovering hydric basins; …” The Ombudsman’s delegate emphasised that “Environmental laws must be applied and community must act as an inspector.”  One delegate asserted that there had been problems with the old pipeline but that they had been remedied. </p>

The meetings were a clear demonstration of democracy in action, but they do not otherwise assist in determining the issues of liability in this case. </p>

Clause 14 recorded that the Government might appoint any required number of officers “in order to supervise the execution of the works and the performance of this Contract” and that “the Contractor” (presumably Ocensa, though not stated to be so in the contract) undertook to deliver to the government officers any data or information they might require.

The visit report identified numerous failings, including improper geotechnical management of the site where the ROW was being opened.  The visit report raised the prospect of fines being levied and criminal sanctions imposed.  The Recommendations and Actions to be Taken section included that there should be temporary suspension of work opening the ROW and follow up visits {K30/296T/1}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a latent ambiguity in the MOU and the RMOU about the status of the members of the PCMT.  It was to be established pursuant to the SA’s by-laws, but was to be made up of representatives of the Defendant, Triton, Total, the Canadian Group and Brown &amp; Root.  The fact that it was to supervise the contracts entered into by Ocensa did not resolve the ambiguity.  In any event, it was not the MOU or the RMOU which finally enshrined the arrangements and responsibility as between Ocensa and the Defendant for the construction of the pipeline.  The AROCA (to which the Defendant was not a party) did not otherwise define the status of the PCMT beyond describing it as “the PCMT of Ocensa”; and it did not address the status of the members of the PCMT.  It is therefore the terms of the PCMA that are contractually determinative of the responsibilities of Ocensa and the Defendant.  It is not in dispute that the Defendant contracted to manage Ocensa’s contracts; but the Defendant submits that the words “through [the PCMT]” and “within the limitations established under [the PCMA]” mean that it is not to be regarded as a “guardian” of the dangerous activity of pipelaying.  There is also a dispute about what is meant by “with total technical financial, administrative and directive autonomy”, which goes to the level of the Defendant’s control.  Since actual or potential control is the touchstone when determining the question of guardianship, it is material to record that Mr Spence considered that “the PCMT was the vehicle thorough which [the Defendant] was to perform the services under the PCMA” {Day13/79:10}; and that, in answer to a similar question, Mr Allison agreed that “the [PCMT] was the vehicle thoruhg which [the Defendant] was required to discharge its role as manager” {Day15/43:5}.  Elsewhere, the Defendant was referred to routinely as the project manager and as being responsible for ensuring that all contractors complied with the terms and conditions of the licence {K25/242/2}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The <span style="text-decoration:underline">Saipem Contract</span> was concluded between Ocensa and Saipem on 11 October 1995 {J14/54.1/42}.  Saipem’s primary obligation as EPC contractor was to carry out the work: Clauses 2 and 5.  “Company’s Representative” was defined to mean “the individual(s) appointed by [Ocensa] to supervise the Work on behalf of [Ocensa] and to instruct [Saipem] regarding all matters related to the Work.”: Clause 1.2.  Ocensa was to designate a Company’s Representative in writing. The Company’s Representative was to have authority to act for and on behalf of Ocensa on such matters connected with the contract as were notified in writing to Saipem by Ocensa: Clause 3.1.  Those matters included giving instructions for variations in the works: (Clause 13) and suspending the works (Clause 27).  Mr Allison, the Defendant’s employee, was appointed Company’s Representative and confirmed in evidence that his holding that position was one of the means by which he performed his role as project manager with the job of supervising the Saipem contract {Day15/46:7}, and that he had a right to instruct Saipem regarding all matters related to Saipem’s work {Day15/45:23}.  The Company’s Representative was permitted to delegate any of its authorities to one or more individuals as Authorised Representatives (Clause 3.2).  Mr Allison delegated authority to various other of the Defendant’s employees, including Snr Loeber and Snr Daza who were the Construction Managers based in the field and who were overseeing the construction work being done on a day-to-day basis {E3/10/668} at [4.20].  The Company’s Representative’s responsibilities included certifying that mechanical completion, reinstatement and reforestation had been achieved, whereupon Saipem would be entitled to receive a provisional acceptance certificate from Ocensa: Clause 10.2.  Saipem’s invoices were to be sent to the Defendant (with whom Ocensa had by now entered into an accountancy partnership agreement which required the Defendant, among other duties, to process contractor invoices {J13/45T/1}): this arrangement is not directly relevant to the question of control of the works as such. </p>

It had no executive authority but was a forum at which shared technical and commercial decisions could be reached by those closely involved with the project so that agreed proposals could be put to those with executive authority {E1/3/125} at [2.14].  Mr Jones chaired the Project Board, which initially met in Houston, though its focus later migrated to Colombia.  It had representatives of each project partner company and was on occasions referred to as the Technical Sub-committee of the Steering Group.  Although it had no executive authority, its role included identifying ways forward that could then be passed on to the management team {E1/3/147} at [4.3]ff.  It would not discuss day-to-day construction issues unless there were significant financial and/or strategic implications or issues with contractors {E1/3/155} at [4.19]. After the incorporation of Ocensa the role of the Project Board was taken over by the Project Review Board, which performed the same functions. </p>

The MOU and RMOU instituted the Steering Committee, which was the senior decision making body until early 1995: see [269] above and {E1/3/162}.  It dealt predominantly with issues which affected the overall strategy of the pipeline project rather than the conduct of operations in the field.  The Steering Committee was made up of representatives of the project partners (see, for example, {K10/52/1}).  Mr Jones described the Steering Committee as a collaborative forum in which the project partners played an active role and typically had presentations made to them by members of the Project Management Team/PCMT {E1/3/164} at [4.41].

Thus, the change mirrored the change of emphasis on the project from engineering and procurement to construction. Mr Spence fitted into the managerial hierarchy below Ed Truett, who retained responsibility both for the field facilities works and for the transportation works.  Mr Spence was dedicated to the transportation works and thus effectively headed up (below Mr Truett) the PCMT.  Below Mr Spence were Mr Allison (an employee of the Defendant or another BP company), who was the construction manager responsible for overseeing the Saipem Contract on Pipeline North and John Skalski (from IPL)  who filled the equivalent position on Pipeline South, and various other managers.  In turn Mr Allison, on Pipeline North, had various personnel reporting to him.  These included the three construction managers, Snr Daza, Snr Loeber and Snr Vasquez, each of whom was an employee of the Defendant.  Not all of the managers were employed by the Defendant.  Mr Dave Smith, the project engineer, was from Brown &amp; Root, reflecting the fact that they (or, more accurately, another of their group companies) held the contract with Ocensa for the detailed engineering design work {J11/37/1}.  Also within the PCMT, performing geotechnical survey work and overseeing certain aspects of the construction work on Spread B (and thus reporting up to Snr Daza) was Snr Gasca, who was employed by Brown &amp; Root’s subcontractor, Tecniavance, at all material times until October 1997: {E1/1/4} at [2.5]-[2.6].  </p>

It also was responsible for the initial application for the Environmental Licence, which it made on behalf of the project partners: see [335] ff above.  In the period before and after the grant of the Environmental Licence the Defendant managed the land acquisition process, with a team of about thirty experienced land negotiators led by Snr Arce, who reported to Mr Allison.  Mr Allison’s main involvement was in reviewing and approving the manual for land negotiators {K66/618T/1} produced by Mr Arce (of which more later) and in keeping the project partners up-dated on how the work was progressing: {E3/10/649} at [3.23]ff.  The current situation would be included in the Monthly Progress Reports signed off by Mr Truett: see, for example, {K20/160/17}.  As set out in more detail below, until the purported assignment to Ocensa in October 1995, easement agreements (known as ROW Agreements and ROW Deeds) with landowners were entered into by the Defendant in its own name. </p>

As one of those conditions, Ocensa was required by Article 7(9) of the Environmental Licence to establish a system for the evaluation of the damage caused during the construction works and the adoption of immediate mitigation, recovery and compensation measures.  By closing submissions it was the Defendant’s submission that although Article 5 of the 1954 Regulations applied to both on-ROW and off-ROW damage caused by the works, the terms of the Environmental Licence gave rise to a regulatory obligation to put in place a compensation scheme in accordance with the terms of the licence.  The Defendant submits that this regulatory scheme for the provision of compensation is enforceable only at public law and does not give rise to a private law remedy such as the Claimants are attempting to enforce in this litigation.  I consider this submission in detail later; but what is relevant here is that the existence of two separate routes to compensation for the same damage (whether on- or off-ROW) is said to be a reason why individual landowners entered into multiple damages/settlement agreements after the ODC works had been carried out – it being said that they are either payments under a public law scheme of compensation or that they must have been essentially exgratia payments to ensure that there would be no come back from landowners alleging dolo: {Day61/35:25}.</p>

The “Philosophy for the Negotiation of Land” was stated to include “Pay all damages and negotiate the easements in order to carry out the [construction and maintenance of the pipeline] at commercial prices within the approved budget”; and “Maintain the equilibrium between the landowners or possessors of a specific area, at the price levels which are </p>

First, the basic price in LC74’s case per square metre was COP 300, or COP 3,000,000 per hectare. This rate does not match any of the rates set out in the Manual’s Table of Prices: see [365] above.  The rate of COP 300 per square metre was applied to the area of the ROW as it passed through LC74’s property (i.e. 488 metres x 25 metres width: 12,200 square metres or 1.2 hectares): Clause 5.  Second, the landowner promised to constitute over the property and, in particular, the area of the ROW the rights of easement, use, occupation and way established by law in favour of the petroleum industry<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>to enable the works to be carried out: Clause 6.  Third, the landowner promised to enter into a supplemental agreement if the Defendant discovered it needed to occupy more land or a different route, provided that the Defendant made a supplementary payment at the same rate: Clauses 7 and 8.  Fourth, the agreement said that it had “settling effects and, thus, prevents any pending or future litigation between the same parties for the constitution of the right of way and rights of easement of the pipeline and the use, occupation and compensation of damages”: Clause 17.  I shall resolve later whether the settling effects were effective and, if so, whether they were intended to refer only to the area of the ROW itself. Fifth, the parties agreed to enter into a public deed of creation of the oil pipeline easement and right of way: Clause 18. </p>

The ROW Easements were also in standard form with necessary adjustments and were executed by the Defendant and the landowner.  One of the standard features was that the document declared that it was made before a named Notary.  Apart from being in the form of a public deed, the ROW Easements were in similar form to the ROW Agreements, including the Defendant availing itself of the public utility and easement benefits established for the petroleum industry (Clause 4), multiple references to the Petroleum Code and Article 5 of the 1954 Regulations, and reference to the settling effects of the agreement (Clause 17).  In Clauses 6 and 7 of the ROW Easement, the landowner constituted the easement (Clause 6) and authorised the occupation of a larger area (Clause 7) where in the ROW Agreement he had merely promised to do so.  Clause 9 differed from the equivalent clause in the ROW Agreement in referring (in the case of LC74) only to </p>

The last sentence of the Paragraph to Clause 9 of the ROW Agreement was omitted from the ROW Easement.

The geotechnical works on Spreads A1 and A2 were sub-contracted to a company called Dinosaurios; the geotechnical works on Spread B was subcontracted to companies called Bronco and Progeocon.  The identity of the sub-contractors has not been shown to be material.  One feature of the construction works was the use of local labour.  This was identified in the public meetings as being a social benefit to the communities through which the pipeline passed.  It was a priority identified in the Environmental Licence at Article 21; and it was included as an obligatory requirement in the EMP {K9/35T/12}.  Saipem’s tender identified the use of local resources as being “the only way to actually promote the well-fare (sic) of the inhabitants and the progress of the Country”; it anticipated that Colombian content would represent approximately 50% of the total contract value and included ROW clearing and grading and final restoration and environmental protection amongst the activities to be carried out by local labour {J14/54.1/124}.  In October 1996, Ocensa’s project update recorded that over 78% of the total employment for the project had been with “local workers from the communities affected by the construction” {K38/378/3}. </p>

It is not clear precisely what activities would or would not be allocated to local workers or whether some may already have had some training and I make no finding on those points.  Snr Loeber accepted that some workers, depending on the precise area, were better and more reliable than others.  He explained this as meaning that productivity was affected so that it might mean that the time to install temporary geotechnical work might go slower than anticipated, not that it would be forgotten altogether.  His solution was that additional local workers would be hired to try to increase the rate of progress {Day18/31:22} ff.  I accept his evidence on this point.

In acknowledging the fact of variations, Dr Savigny made the qualification that there was no reason on the four trial case properties to believe that there was “any glaring exception to the standards”.  Dr Savigny said in evidence that the variations were particularly apparent from LC74 south to the Rio San Bartolomé (i.e. the area of the early progress on Spread B).  Dr Card had not noticed any particular pattern to the variations and had not attempted to analyse them formally any more than had Dr Savigny. On all of the evidence I find that the quality of workmanship along the ROW was not constant.  That finding, and the absence of any cogent case of consistent or constant design defects together provide a sufficient explanation for my view that each claim in this litigation is very largely fact specific. </p>

It therefore started after the execution of the purported assignment of the Defendant’s rights and obligations on 9 October 1995 but before its public registration on 21 November 1996: see [372] above. The work spanned both the dry and the wet seasons: see {E1/2/110} at [5.26].  The violence of the climate was such that there was a risk of protection works such as retaining walls, trinchos or protection barriers being washed away, and this happened on occasions.  This was not necessarily or even probably due to design or construction defects.  It was not a common occurrence and, when it happened, Saipem were instructed to reinstate the damage: see {E1/1/38} at [12.29], {E2/7/337} at [14.1(d)].  I do not exclude the possibility that there were some delays in effecting reinstatement, whether because of a failure to notice damage or to instruct repairs or otherwise, but this too would be fact specific in every case and the evidence has not been examined in sufficient detail in this trial to make specific findings except in the four trial cases. </p>

I have referred to video footage of the ODC and Ocensa works being carried out.  The available video relating to the ODC works is a promotional film produced on behalf of ODC {L1/134}.  Those showing the carrying out of the Ocensa works include some promotional films produced on behalf of Ocensa, typically recording progress and showing short clips of works being carried out ({L1/209} {L1/210} {L1/210.1} {L1/225}{L1/226} {L1/228}  {L1/229}); but they also include ones where the film has been taken, without apparent editing, in the normal course of the works (e.g. {L1/208} {L2/787} -{L2/797} {L2/799} – {L2/801}).

In briefest outline, the Defendant agreed to provide the management of the contract for Ocensa through the PCMT, with technical, financial, administrative and directive autonomy subject to the terms of the PCMA.  In that role it managed, supervised and controlled Ocensa’s contracts for the construction of the pipeline on a day-to-day basis.  Mr Allison and Mr Spence were at all times employees of the Defendant, as were most of the senior management team on the PCMT. Mr Gasca’s employment by Tecniavance was a notable exception but, as a member of the PCMT he came in direct line of management below Mr Allison, Mr Spence and others.

I shall return to the contractual obligation assumed under the PCMA in Section 7.  An audit report produced by Total in about September 1997 stated that “the construction is operated by BP under a [PCMA]” {K49/517/2}, which Snr Gasca accepted was a correct description because “BP was the one that had done the contracts, carried out the studies and the construction contracts, and they were the ones that had sent some of those supervisors on the field, and if that means they built the pipeline, well, yes, then” {Day17/47:12}.  In a joint review document with Ocensa produced in December 1998, the Defendant said that “the PCMA … was formed in February 1995 in order for [the Defendant] to undertake the total Project Management for the Transportation part of Phase II …” {J26/87/3}.  I accept these as reasonably accurate descriptions of the reality of what happened.  The day-to-day management was still subject to the residual power to exercise supervisory control and direction of the Ocensa Board although, as was to be expected, the Board was generally concerned with major budgetary, contractual and financial decisions.  Thus it was Mr Spence’s evidence that, although the Defendant required approval under the terms of the PCMA to enter into the contract with Saipem because (at US$211 million) it exceeded its financial authority, in terms of the day-to-day management, supervision and control of the contracts, it was up to the Defendant to get on and manage, supervise and control that contract, and the PCMT had total autonomy {Day13/89:24}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no evidence that any of the Defendant’s employees who worked on the PCMT were formally seconded to Ocensa, and Mr Allison accepted that he was not “legally” seconded {Day15/69:24}.  Although a number of witnesses asserted that either they or others had been “seconded” to Ocensa, that evidence was either withdrawn or represented no more than that the person was working on behalf of Ocensa {Day13/42:18} {Day17/44:3}.  The decision not to second BP employees to Ocensa was evidently a deliberate decision, foreshadowed by a meeting in Houston in May 1995 on the subject of the PCMA which recorded that “The PCMT will continue to reside within [the Defendant] except for [Brown &amp; Root] members.  Secondment will <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> be used.  [The Defendant] will employ all non B&amp;R members of the IPMT, will be responsible for their security and will pay their salaries and living allowances” {J10/36/14}.  The same document made clear that this was a strategic decision: “For image and operative reasons IPMT members should be able to represent Ocensa and/or act as agents of such.  The PCMA shoud include wording … that allows for this.  Although IPMT will not be seconded to Ocensa in a strict legal sense, the wording of the PCMA should allow for the IPMT to acts [sic] as if seconded.”  It appears that tax efficiency may have played a part in the decision.  The decision was consistent with an earlier Communications Strategy which said that the Defendant, when acting as leader of the project management team, would project itself as the instruments of [Ocensa] and will seek to project the image of [Ocensa] and not its own image.  It is not [the Defendant] that is building the line, it is [Ocensa] … Given that the desired image can be said to be in conflict with the reality of who owns, is building and will operate the line, further explanation may be needed…..”  {K15.1/107.1/1}.  The whole thrust of Ocensa’s communications was for Ocensa to distance itself from the Defendant {K28/274/1}.  This appears to be the reason why letters were not to be sent out on the Defendant’s own headed paper and why the Defendants’ employees working on the project carried Ocensa business cards. </p>

This appears from Clauses 1 to 3 of the typical agreement of this type set out below, which covered payment (again relating to LC74) for sobreanchos and a dump and gabions outside the 25 metre ROW {M/182T/689b}: </p>

The receipts were not all in identical form but those signed by Snr Velez (LC74) are typical.  A receipt signed by Snr Velez for a cheque for COP 5,150,000 dated 16 August 1996 {M/189/765} stated “I [Snr Velez] hereby state that I have received from [Ocensa] the amount of $5,150,000 as payment of 100% of the accidental damage over [La Nieve], and that I have been fully paid in all respects”.  Two later receipts relating to other settlements also contained the statement that he had been fully paid in respect of the agreement that had been reached {M/189/758} {M/189/755}.  Some but not all declared that the payment related to an agreement or contract. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">Common to these receipts is the phrase (in Spanish) “Ocensa se halla a Paz y Salvo”, which has here been translated as “I have been fully paid by Ocensa”.  This same translation of the words (or very similar) has been adopted for other similar forms of receipt (e.g. {M/179T/682.1}, Snr Velez’ receipt for a payment under his ROW Agreement with Ocensa; {M/127T/458.1}, Snr Mesa’s receipt for the second payment under his ROW Agreement for LC54, which is translated as “I have been fully paid in all respects”).  Paz y Salvos were in some respects more formal and, on their terms, went further than the mere receipt of full payment.  In addition to recording the fact of payment for damage, they included express reference to formal renunciation or waiver of future claims.  </p>

The fact that there is no available Ocensa form of Paz y Salvo for LC61 or LC82 and no Paz y Salvo for LC93 is consistent with (a) Paz y Salvos not having been executed or (b) Paz y Salvos having been executed but not being available to the Court.  I am not able to make certain findings as to which of these alternatives may be correct in each case, but there is no basis for an assumption that all Paz y Salvos that were executed have remained and been available for the court. </p>

By way of illustration, LC9’s claim for the loss of the heifer was settled for the claimed sum of COP400,000 (roughly £100); the claim for destruction of crops was settled for COP156,000 (roughly £39); and the claim for sobreanchos was settled for COP3,011,400 (roughly £750).  LC61’s claim for the loss of his cow was settled for the claimed sum of COP350,000 (roughly £85).  I do not underestimate the significance of such sums to the Claimants, but they pale into insignificance when compared with some of the losses that are now claimed and which were not claimed at the time. </p>

The possibility that some of the 74 claimants did not know of the ability to make claims exists and cannot be determined on the evidence at trial; but, given the extent of the public involvement with the project, the likelihood that Ocensa and Saipem would have wanted to close off their potential liabilities where they could, and the prevalence of the settlement agreements for the 10 Lead Claimants, that possibility does not seem likely and would need explanation.   <br/></p>

The SOCI was to include details of the damage alleged to have been caused to the Claimant’s property as a result of the construction of the Ocensa Pipeline.  It was also to provide details of the use of the property before and since the construction of the Ocensa Pipeline, details of any consequential losses claimed by the Claimant and details of the current state of the property.

The importance of the documents for the parties and Court should be apparent to anyone conducting litigation of this sort.  For the parties, even in adversarial negotiations, some trust has to be placed in documents that are presented by reputable opponents seeking an early settlement.

I accept that account.  In briefest outline, information was gathered during three relatively short trips (April/May 2007, March 2008, February 2009), on each of which a number of potential Claimants were interviewed at locations away from their properties.  The information included “some initial information relating to issues of productivity and quantum.”  The time with each Claimant was limited to 2-3 hours, which covered liability and quantum issues and took place without the assistance of technical experts.  The Schedules were prepared on the basis of that information.  Although not expressly stated it is implicit (and I find) that Leigh Day did not go through the Original Schedules with any Claimant before serving them on the Defendant or before incorporating them in the pleaded case.  Leigh Day’s letter says that, when incorporating them in the pleadings, it had been the intention to provide further particulars in respect of the losses alleged in the group action.  As before, there is a well understood difference between providing further particulars of a pleaded claim and changing the basis of the claim substantially.

That process continued even until after the hearing, when the Claimants put in further revisions which are said to reflect the evidence.

These raised, for the first time in the proceedings, claims for the cost of reinstating their lands.  The potential impact on the litigation is illustrated by the effect that the reinstatement claim would have had upon the claim of Snr Sequeda (LC39).  The headline figure for the claim for reinstatement was COP 730,633,559 (c. £271,114).  The aggregate total of all other quantified heads of claim was COP 130,649,270 (c.£48,478).  The Defendant objected to the late introduction of the reinstatement claim and the Claimants’ application to add them was refused by the Senior Master by his order of 15 February 2013, having provided his judgment to the parties in draft on 11 January 2013. </p>

It has therefore been neither necessary nor possible to investigate whether such a reduction has occurred or whether, viewed objectively, there is any apparent relationship between the value of the land and the claims that are made about the economic losses that the Claimants allege that they have suffered as a result of living and working on their damaged lands. </p>

The similarities between the two documents strongly suggest that the Defendant’s First Letter was drafted with the ODC First Letter as its model.  This sets a pattern which is repeated later in the contractual sequence and which is unsurprising given the fact that the ODC pipeline had been laid recently along the same corridor and that Ecopetrol, which had a substantial interest in both pipelines, would have had access to the ODC documents even if the other joint venturers had not.  The most obvious difference between the documents is that the reference to assignment is moved from the main text of the letter in the ODC document to the landowner’s declaration in the Defendant’s document.  That change is not material for present purposes. </p>

It therefore lacked an essential element for the formation of the contract for which the Claimants contend. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant also submits that it has not been shown that the parties intended to enter into a binding contract when sending or signing the First Letter.  The letter was capable of performing and did perform the function of being formal notice under Article 179 of the Mining Code as applicable to the oil industry {H23.2/7/468}.  That does not mean that it cannot also be a contract.  It is also true that no Lead Claimant in this case gave evidence that he regarded the First Letter as a binding contract, and that Snr Sequeda gave evidence in which he said of the First Letter that he “signed a document [that the visitor to his farm] had stated [meant] that I would let them build the pipeline” {D4/71/795}.  It would, in my view, have been surprising if the Claimants had given evidence that they <span style="font-style:italic">did </span>regard the First Letter as a binding contract, as I would find it hard to accept that any of the four from whom I heard evidence had applied their mind to that question at all at the time.  In the light of the expert evidence as a whole, I would be more inclined to look at the form of the document as a whole to see whether it conveys an externalised intention to enter into a binding contract: see [141] above.  Adopting that approach, the document has the look of something formal that is intended to be relied upon; and the reference to assignment of rights and authorisations “conferred in this document” suggests that it has at least some legal effect in giving rise to assignable rights and authorisations.  Thus, though I accept Professor Vallejo’s evidence that there can be an assignment of rights that <span style="font-style:italic">do not</span> arise out of a contract {H15/1/141}, that seems to me to miss the point that the First Letter is contemplating the assignment of rights and authorisations that <span style="font-style:italic">do </span>arise out of it.  I would therefore not find against the Claimants separately on this second ground. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Of much greater substance is the Defendant’s subsidiary argument that, if the First Letter did give rise to a binding contract to pay fair and equitable compensation, it was superseded by the ROW Agreement that each Lead Claimant entered into later.  I refer to the principles of Colombian Law that I have set out at [113]-[114].  In each case that the Court has seen, the First Letter was followed by one or more ROW Agreements.  The ROW Agreements made detailed provision for what the Defendant would pay to the landowner (or occupier) for the disruption caused by the works.  For the reasons that I set out below, I do not consider that the ROW Agreements made provision for every eventuality.  It could therefore be argued that, if the First Letter had the contractual effect for which the Claimants contend, there was a residual area of the First Letter’s contractual obligation to compensate, not covered by the ROW Agreement, which could have survived the execution of the ROW Agreement.  The argument would be that, although the ROW Agreement covered damage on the ROW, any other damage would be subject to the First Letter’s contractual obligation to provide fair and equitable compensation for damage to land, crops and other property outside the ROW that might be damaged. </p>

Taking the question in stages, the obligation to compensate provided by the ROW Agreement differs from and is inconsistent with an obligation to provide fair and equitable compensation.  Leaving aside the Claimants’ submission that the compensation under the ROW Agreement was abusively inadequate, the provisions of the ROW Agreement are expressed in different terms, have different meaning and specify a rate and aggregate amount of recovery that has no place in the First Letter.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">“fair and equitable compensation” is so clear as to call into question whether the parties intended anything of the prior arrangement to survive.  It is material that the First Letter is not mentioned in the ROW Agreement, which is a more extensive and more formal arrangement and the precursor to the yet more formal ROW Easement.  If on its proper construction the provisions for compensation provisions in the ROW Agreement are limited in scope to damage to the ROW itself, there is no need for separate agreement about damage elsewhere.  Rather than continuing an imprecise contractual concept of “fair and equitable compensation”, it seems much more likely that the intention of the ROW Agreement was that compensation for damage off the ROW should be subject to the Colombian law of tort, subject to any contractual impact that the ROW Agreement might have. </p>

That evidence is at least consistent with the vagueness of the reference to compensation in the First Letter when compared with the subsequent ROW Agreements.  The fact that other Lead Claimants did not give the same evidence does not mean that similar conversations did not happen: it is equally consistent with loss of memory or not being asked the question in the course of preparation of witness statements or trial.  I would expect that such conversations happened frequently, since it would be known to all concerned on the Defendant’s side at the time when the First Letters were signed that there were procedures and prices as set out in the Manual, that the First Letter did not represent the last word on the subject, and that the Defendant would be intending to enter into a ROW Agreement with the landowner, if possible.  I am not in a position to make a finding about whether, or in what terms, such conversations happened in the case of Claimants whose cases have not been tried. </p>

The 1954 Regulations, including Article 5, are an integral part of the balance that has been struck but there are substantial counterbalances, including the Environmental Licensing system and the close involvement of the state in monitoring and supervising the oil industry in order to protect both the public interest and private interests: see [43] and [240] above.  Beyond the ambit of the Environmental Licence there is also the involvement of public officials and the Courts in regulating the conduct of oil entrepreneurs (e.g. in relation to the giving of notice, ordering the provision of bonds, and assessing the proper level of compensation), as described in Section 3 above. </p>

Mr Allison was therefore right and entitled to describe the possibility of expropriation as a negotiating tool.  I accept that being reminded in negotiations of the prospect of legally enforceable entry onto or expropriation of land could be both worrying and distressing to land owners or occupiers.

I find that this approach deliberately reflected the intention of the Defendant, which was to agree the compensation payable pursuant to the ROW Agreements by reference to damage to the ROW and not elsewhere.  The Defendant contemplated that damage may happen outside the ROW and intended to compensate that damage separately and in addition to the sums payable under the ROW Agreements.  That intention was evidenced by the Land Acquisition Manual, the Contract with Saipem and the evidence of Mr Allison: see [243] above.  It was also made explicit by the EIS, which provided that “any damages caused outside of the strip of land required for the construction of the pipeline will be subject to a future agreement”: see [359] above.  In context this meant that landowners would be compensated separately for damage to their land outside the ROW. The EIS was submitted to the Ministry as part of the application for the Environmental Licence: see [337] above.  It therefore formed part of the basis upon which the Environmental Licence was issued.  Additional and retrospective compensation of damage caused by the works may be said to be contemplated and endorsed by Article 7(9) of the Environmental Licence: see [341] above. </p>

The rates paid to different Claimants varied both from the Table of Prices in the Manual and between Claimants.  The reasons for these variations are not known but suggest that in some cases real negotiation may have taken place, including negotiation upwards from the prices set out in the Manual.  I accept as genuine the provision in the notes to the Table of Prices that “the negotiator cannot agree on higher prices without prior approval from David Arce or Phil Allison, according to the case” {K66/618T/17}.  The implication, which I accept, is that there was scope for negotiation both upwards and downwards from the figures appearing in the Table.  Whether and to what extent any negotiation actually happened is fact sensitive to each case.  But, viewed overall, the headline allegation that the Defendant imposed (or sought to impose) on the Claimants, “by the exercise of superior bargaining power, a disproportionately low price for the use and occupation of their land and for the normal disruption which would occur in the careful and orderly conduct of the works” is not made out so as to justify a generalised finding to that effect {C4/3.4/215}. </p>

I have not encountered any ROW Agreement which calculates the compensation by reference to damage off the ROW: later sobreanchos agreements adopting the same rate as originally used in the ROW Agreement are not an exception to the general rule because they are provided for by the Eighth Clause and are effectively an extension of the ROW Agreement itself.   </p>

The first would be if Article 5 required that to be the case as a matter of law.  I have rejected that argument at [206] ff.  My rejection of the blanket argument entails the need to look at a contractual agreement such as the ROW Agreement on its terms, to see what is covered and what is not.  The Defendant’s second argument is that the terms of the ROW Agreements themselves provide for a blanket exclusion of all future claims, subject only to proof of dolo.

That being so, the reference to “damages caused during construction on the property” (b) does not necessarily mean damages caused on the property whether on the ROW or off it.  Similarly in (c), the reference “to alteration in the normal economic exploitation of the property” is not necessarily a reference to the economic exploitation of the property whether on or off the ROW.

I should make clear that “contemplated damage” is not limited to the damage typically specified in the Annex, which provides non-exhaustive particulars of the damage that will naturally occur as a result of the stripping of the ROW and the execution of the pipeline works. </p>

In the light of that evidence it would to my mind have been regarded as both disreputable and scandalous if the Defendant had turned round immediately after concluding the ROW Agreement and explained to the landowners (which it certainly did not do in advance) that they were now limited to their payment under the ROW Agreement whatever and wherever damage was caused by the pipeline works.  There is also no evidence to suggest that ODC (or any other person operating in this area in Colombia at the time) would have adopted such an approach, and the existence of multiple settlements by ODC when damage was caused is evidence that it did not do so.  There is no evidence that the Defendant, Ocensa or Saipem made such a suggestion to the landowners at any time before the involvement of the lawyers, much later on.  I do not accept that such conduct would have been in accordance “with the normal practices of the trade”.  Put differently, the submission now being made on behalf of the Defendant implies that the Defendant would deliberately and as a matter of general policy and conduct have engaged in behaviour that was abusive under Colombian Law.   </p>

Just as there were variations in the quality of the works that were carried out, so I can accept that not every negotiator was as correct in his dealings as Snr Medina; and I have no doubt that the senior employees from whom I heard were just as capable of being tough and canny in their walk of life as some of the Claimants are in theirs.  What I reject outright is any suggestion that the Defendant set out to conduct its negotiations with the landowners or its treatment of their lands with abusive contempt.

The ODC ROW on LC54 recovered better, but was still clearly visible from the air in 1995 {L1/143/143}.  I have referred elsewhere to the generally reassuring conversations that would have taken place.  In the light of my interpretation of the ROW Agreement, it would not have been misleading to give the impression that damage would be made good and, as subsequent experience showed, Ocensa both (a) attempted to reinstate the ROW and (b) entertained and settled claims for damage over and above the damage covered by the invoking of Article 5 in the ROW Agreements.  Although Lead Claimants gave evidence that they thought their settlement figures were too low, there is no example of which I am aware amongst the four Trial Lead Claimants of a claim being made to Ocensa or Saipem and being rejected completely; </p>

The test to be applied is whether those carrying out the works exercised their rights to do so “in an improper way and which distorted its genuine purpose”.  On the evidence led at trial and summarised or referred to in this judgment, errors were made but material impropriety has not been shown; and the works were carried out so as to fulfil the purpose of bringing the project to a successful conclusion in the face of very demanding challenges; </p>

Even in the best regulated circumstances, there was always a risk of damage because of the challenges of terrain and climate.

The main relevance for present purposes is that visiting the Notary was an opportunity for landowners who wanted explanations about the content of the proposed agreement so far as they concerned establishing that the proposed agreement complied with the purposes and will of the parties as declared to him.  If the need arose he would afford the needful party an opportunity for further discussion or refer him elsewhere for partial legal advice.  If asked, the Notary might give an illiterate (or otherwise needy) campesino farmer some legal advice on the substance of the proposed agreement.  Visiting the Notary therefore gave the landowner the opportunity to find out more about the agreement if he was uncertain about it.  To that extent it reduced the imbalance between the parties. </p>

On the evidence at trial there is a consistent pattern of Claimants contracting with Ocensa, with specific provision for damage on the ROW, and then going back to obtain further payments not from the person with whom (as they all would have known) they had contracted but from Ocensa and Saipem.  The division of roles is also significant.  It demonstrated that Ocensa was taking responsibility for the matters that had been directly addressed in the ROW Agreements and that it looked to its contractor, Saipem, to deal with matters elsewhere.  There was no room for the Defendant in this arrangement because Ocensa, not the Defendant, was the party taking responsibility for and entering into settlement agreements with and on behalf of Saipem; and Saipem was specified to be Ocensa’s contractor, not the Defendant’s.  A settlement with Ocensa and Saipem was therefore distinctly and unequivocally different from a settlement with the Defendant. </p>

Equally, however, the Defendant would not be able to rely upon the terms of the ROW Agreements to which it is no longer a party to form the contractual basis of a defence against the assigned landowners. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The factual background is summarised at [262] ff, [346] ff and [383] ff above.  Ocensa was the party that entered into the construction contract with Saipem.  That was a large and complex contract which allocated responsibilities to both parties.  Fortunately, it is not necessary to examine the terms of the Saipem contract in further detail here.  What matters is that Ocensa had no management or technical infrastructure that would enable it to run a major construction contract such as the Saipem contract.  It therefore entered into the PCMA with the Defendant.  Proper interpretation of the PCMA is the first step in identifying the Defendant’s responsibilities; but it is not necessarily the last, since it will be necessary to look at de facto control and its exercise in the course of the contract as well. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The relevant terms of the PCMA are set out at [280] above.  The dispute between the parties on its interpretation was whether the words “through the Project Construction Management Team (hereinafter PCMT)” has the effect that the Defendant itself was not managing the contract.  Two things emerge when these words are seen in context.  First, the primary thrust of the Clause 1 is that the Manager (i.e. the Defendant) is required to provide the management of the contracts executed by Ocensa and that its services will include those set out at (i) to (v).  Second, the words that are in issue describe how the Defendant will manage the contracts executed by Ocensa; they do not say that it is the PCMT <span style="font-style:italic">and not the Defendant</span> who will manage the contracts.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">Both of these considerations point to the conclusion that the PCMA imposed upon the Defendant itself the obligation to manage the contracts “with total technical financial, administrative and directive authority.”  The Defendant was to use the PCMT as the vehicle by which it was to provide the management of the contracts, but that does not detract from the fact that it was the Defendant’s contractual obligation to manage them.  Had the contracts been inadequately managed, Ocensa’s contractual remedies would have been directly against the Defendant. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">As well as imposing that contractual obligation, it was the source of the Defendant’s contractual power to manage the contracts as it did.  The Defendant set about managing them through the PCMT as summarised earlier.  Most of those assigned to work on the PCMT were employees of the Defendant or another BP company, including the senior members such as Mr Spence and Mr Allison: see [282] and the summary of assigned employees at {C4/3.4/229} [615-618].  As a deliberate policy, the Defendant did not second its employees to Ocensa in any other sense than that they were working on the Ocensa project and were at pains to give the impression that the project was Colombian and Ocensa’s: see [386] above.  In the absence of any formal secondment it retained the power to hire, fire and determine the work of those of its employees who were working on the Ocensa project.  The PCMT did not have any status which, of itself, had the effect of taking the management of the Saipem contract out of the hands of the Defendant rather than being the vehicle established as the vehicle through which the Defendant would manage the project in accordance with the PCMA.  There were people on the PCMT who were not BP employees, as with the inclusion of employees of Brown &amp; Root who brought their design expertise.  This case, however, is not substantially about design responsibility: it is about the management of the construction project and how the works were done.  Even if design were still substantially in issue and included in an assessment of where control lay and by whom it was exercised, the overwhelming preponderance of control was vested in and exercised by employees of the Defendant.  While I accept that the work of the PCMT was subject to the overall supervisory control of the Ocensa Board, that did not affect the reality of who was exercising autonomous control in managing the Saipem contract on a day-to-day basis at every level from site up to senior management.  If there had been any residual doubt on the basis of evidence about what actually happened on site (which, in my judgment, there is not), it is dispelled by the Defendant’s own assessment of the realities of life: see [385].   </p>

Adopting the restated formulation agreed by the experts, the Defendant exercised an effective and independent power of direction, governance or control over the carrying out of the Ocensa pipeline works by Saipem at all times material to these claims.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The dangerous activities doctrine carries with it the presumption of fault.  The Claimants have independently alleged that the works were carried out negligently.  I have considered those allegations in the context of the individual lead claims.  At this stage it is sufficient to say (as I repeat elsewhere) that no analysis of the programming of the Ocensa works was undertaken.  While I have referred in the course of the judgment to the march chart that formed part of the EIS and have accepted general propositions such as, for example, that revegetation should take place at or about the same time as long-term geotechnical works, I do not accept that the mere fact that it can be shown that works took longer than indicated in a preliminary and high level document such as the march chart, or that there was a gap between various stages in the course of the works is a sufficient basis to found findings of negligence.  As should be well known, and as should be recognised by anyone who has contemplated the challenges that the Ocensa works presented, there may be almost any number of possible reasons for an eventual sequence and timing of works.  It is possible that some delays may of themselves call for an explanation, but the Court will not readily be persuaded that programming was negligent in the absence of proper analysis of its causes. </p>

That provides a rational (and, in my view, correct) explanation for why Ocensa was prepared (by way of example) to compensate Snr Mesa (LC54) for the destruction of a bridge on the ROW on the basis that it had not been covered by the ROW Agreement (“paid in the original negotiation”).  It also explains why Ocensa and Saipem agreed between themselves that Saipem would compensate landowners for damage off the ROW and subsequently implemented their agreement by the settlements involving Saipem.  Snr Mesa again provides an illustration: he entered into a settlement with Saipem because they had affected additional land; but his Paz y Salvo with Saipem recorded that the death of a cow was excluded from its effect.  It was alleged to have been killed because of the lack of the bridge, and was therefore referred back to Ocensa as damage suffered on the ROW and not covered by the ROW Agreement.  This pattern is repeated many times.  The pattern is clear, though I do not suggest that it was necessarily always applied with complete precision.  </p>

Applying the principles as I have found them and as set out at [180], the wording of the forms of settlement agreement either alone or in the light of the Paz y Salvos shows a clear intention to prevent any future claims arising out of the Ocensa works and is technically competent to achieve that aim.  There is no suggestion that the settlement agreements may now be set aside.  I therefore treat them as remaining in force and valid.  On that basis, the effect of a settlement agreement in the standard form for Ocensa alone settles all future claims for damage on the ROW and the effect of the settlement agreement in the standard form involving Saipem settles all future claims for damage off the ROW.  Integral to that decision is the fact that each involves an express renunciation of any right to file either a judicial or extra-judicial claim, which is clear, unequivocal and precise.  I see no policy reason to strain against this construction or outcome, which is consistent with the balance struck by Colombian law between private interests and public benefit, including the policy decision to provide substantial protection to the oil industry as set out elsewhere in this judgment. </p>

It follows from my conclusion that the Ocensa and Saipem settlement agreements settled all existing and future claims inside and outside the ROW respectively that they effected a novation as between the contracting parties by substituting the new contractual rights and obligations under the settlement in place of any existing or future obligation in tort.  Complete novation of all tortious obligations is the combined effect of the two forms of settlement agreement.

It follows that, where and to the extent that settlement agreements took place between the Claimants and Ocensa or Saipem, any liability that the Defendant might otherwise have had to the Claimant in respect of the Ocensa works is extinguished by novation. </p>

The late attempt to introduce claims for the costs of reinstatement and the even later attempt to introduce claims for general damages related to the damage to the land were rejected.  As a result, the claims focus on allegations that the economic capacity of the farms concerned has been reduced and that specific losses have been suffered, such as loss of animals caught in the mire. </p>

Despite that, very substantial resources were devoted to dealing with generalities rather than specific properties.  In the event, my emphasis in this judgment is on the four trial properties; but, not least because it is intended that it should have implications for other claims, it is necessary to deal with some of the generalised allegations as well.  It is also necessary to look at some of the broad principles and matters of opinion that divided the experts before coming to address their potential application to the individual claims.

I have made as much allowance as possible on the basis of the information that has been made available to me about the circumstances in which the various reports were prepared.  I accept without hesitation that the experts have had to confront highly unusual, if not unique, difficulties because of the remoteness, climate and security situation affecting the areas where the Claimants live.  The climate has meant that visits have had to be scheduled to cover the wet and dry seasons; while the security situation has meant that visits to properties have been delayed and, when they have happened, have had to be shorter than would otherwise have been undertaken.</p>

In the course of the report he made frequent cross references, of which [10.2.15] {H1.1/1/112} is typical.  There he said “The increase in sediment of the water in the natural watercourses at the property has increased the turbidity of the water and the iron content (see Expert Reports of Dr Tobon and Dr Obando) which may have an adverse effect on water quality.”  Even more specific are references such as [15.3.3] at {H1.1/1/192} where, in the course of giving his opinion on the process of sedimentation on LC74 he said “Dr Tobon describes in his Expert Report that the waterlogging on the property is due to a high rate of deposition of sediment and that the most likely cause was intense soil erosion from stockpiled soil during ROW and pipeline construction.  I note that Dr Tobon’s opinion appears to be consistent with witness statements given by the Claimants as well as construction workers who also describe soil erosion from stockpiled soil during ROW and pipeline construction.”  This last quotation is in relation to an issue that is right at the heart of the dispute on LC74; </p>

At  [4.3] {H7.3/3/618} he summarised what he said was the evidence from videos and witness statements by saying that “the soil that was removed during the process of excavating this trench or strip of land was deposited on either side of the route, without adequate protection and without any consideration for the natural arrangements of the soil horizons… . This soil was left there, exposed, for however long the works took on each farm, in places with steep slopes (see reports by Franco Obando and Geoff Card for their observations and conclusions on the construction process) and high rainfall … . This significantly contributed to this sediment being carried towards the streams beds either by the water during rainfall events or down the slope by gravity ..”  This illustrates the mutual dependency and support given by the reports of (in this instance) Dr Card, Dr Tobon and Dr Obando.  Most specifically, when writing about LC50 at [1.6.1.6] {H7.4/4/896} Dr Tobon wrote “The amount of soil accumulated in the swampy area greatly exceeds the amount of soil that could have eroded from this grassy area.

By way of example, photographs G15 and G16 in section IV of the general section of Dr Obando’s report clearly show the phenomenon of the inversion of soil layers on one of the LC properties, and paragraph VII.2.7.3.2 details the superficiality of the soil study carried out for the construction of the pipeline. …”; </p>

Dr Card’s answer (which he confirmed he had read before it was sent out in his name {Day24/104:13}) was “References in my report to other expert reports are to the same final versions as were served.”  Yet when he came to give evidence, Dr Card said (and I accept) that he had seen no draft reports and no final reports from the other experts when he completed his first report.  All that he had was verbal discussions in the field and in the hotel (which were in Spanish, so that he had little opportunity to take notes) and possibly a few skype calls and verbal discussions with Dr Tobon before the finalisation of Dr Tobon’s report and with other experts {Day24/20:13} ff, {Day24/100:3} ff, {Day25/166:6}; </p>

Subsequently he said that the particular quote that had been read from his report referred to field notes and what Dr Card had been saying in the field {Day28/21:22}.  Later still he reaffirmed that Leigh Day had not let him see the reports of other experts {Day29/51:16}.  The only possible conclusions are that (a) contrary to his evidence, Dr Tobon saw the purported quote in a draft of Dr Card’s report or (b) he was fed the passage in his own report by the legal team (out of context but with attribution) and adopted it without having seen a draft from Dr Card.  I reject as incredible his explanation that the passage was based upon field notes and what Dr Card had said in the field {Day28/21:22}, since that cannot explain how he came to attribute the purported quote to a particular paragraph of a report from Dr Card.

More broadly, it casts doubt on the integrity of the expert evidence process as a whole, since it must (on the information I have before me) have involved the Claimants’ legal team at some level as well as the experts.  These are very serious drawbacks for a court that is trying to reach a just answer in heavy litigation.  It is only because I have had the opportunity to watch each of the experts over many days that I feel confident in drawing the conclusion that it would be wrong simply to jettison the entirety of any expert’s evidence because of this episode.  I am convinced that, although there are other criticisms to be made of individual experts to which I will refer later, all of the experts who came to court did so with the intention of expressing opinions of which they were rightly or wrongly convinced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The involvement of solicitors in the drafting of experts reports is not the sole preserve of the Claimants.  The involvement of solicitors may, of course, be a necessary and proper part of organising expert evidence and it is (to my mind) inevitable that Freshfields and Counsel will have been closely involved in the preparation of the expert evidence that was served on behalf of the Defendant.  However, the Claimants identified one example, which they say illustrates exactly the same problem as has arisen with their own expert evidence.  Professor Montenegro and Dr Avila produced supplementary reports that were dated 21 May 2014 {H4.9/10/1704} and {H21.9/13/1827}.  They are presented in identical formats and adopted near-identical structures.  The language is so similar that it is quite inconceivable that the two reports have been entirely independently written.  The overwhelming probability that the production of the reports involved a process of cutting and pasting is confirmed by the fact that, although Dr Avila’s report is responding to Mr Delgado’s for the Claimant and Professor Montenegro’s report is responding to Dr Obando’s, the terms of [2.4] of each report are identical: “On the individual Lead Claimants, my conclusions remain substantively unchanged by Dr Obando’s report.” {H4.9/10/1710} and {H21.9/13/1834}.  To any observer with any experience of contested litigation it is apparent that the lawyers have been co-ordinating the responses (and their physical production) which is why the format and structure is the same for each report.  What is not so obvious is whether either expert saw or relied upon the substance of what became the other expert’s report, since the reasons and references in each report are different.  So, while I conclude that Dr Avila must have had at least the framework which is common to his and Professor Montenegro’s May 2014 reports, and that framework must have included the reference to Dr Obando in [2.4] (since there is no other reason why Dr Avila would suddenly have referred to him), I am not in a position to conclude that either Dr Avila or Professor Montenegro adopted substantive material that was fed to him by Freshfields without independently verifying and adopting it.  I return to this issue at [828] when reviewing Dr Avila’s evidence later in this section {H7.4/4/978}. </p>

He included what he called “notable features” and “significant areas of erosion” in his Table 14.2.  Dr Card estimated that the 7 areas included in Table 14.2 would have suffered 3035 cubic metres of soil loss, of which one area (Image/2) contributed 2000 cubic metres (66%).  He said (at [14.2.7]) that this estimate was based upon “measurements of surface area and depth of erosion.”  Image/2 was marked on the Claimants’ annotated aerial image [“CAI”] {B2.3/45/544} as being to the east of the ROW from where erosion could drain into the areas of LC50 said to have been damaged by erosion from the ROW.  At [14.2.10] {H1.1/1/171} Dr Card said that “any sediment originating from the ROW is likely to have entered Streams 1-4. … Based on the soil erosion recorded on the ROW and the lack of functional erosion control measures it is my opinion that soil erosion is on-going due to lack of repair and maintenance to the erosion control measures and lack of vegetation cover on the ROW as I have described in paragraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.6.”  The clear implication of this evidence was that Image/2 had contributed 2000 cubic metres or 66% of the totality of the sediment from the notable features listed in Table 14.2 and that the sediment from Image/2 had fallen to the east of the ROW and onto the parts of LC50 that were said to have been adversely affected.

That deprived him of useful evidence but is not otherwise (at least in the present context) a criticism since it may have been attributable to a lack of time or resources or for other understandable reasons.  In his third report, he made increasing use of extracts from DVDs.  I deal later with other criticisms made of his use of DVD evidence, but one example informs the present assessment of Dr Card as an expert witness.  At [3.4.1] of his third report {H1.5/23/1096} he introduced three screen shots, Figures 3.5 to 3.7, saying “I am unable to identify the specific location where these images are on the Ocensa pipeline works but they represent typical earthwork operations from the DVDs I have reviewed.”  The first two images showed bulldozers working line abreast pushing tumbling and rolling bucket loads of earth that is evidently being shifted on the ROW.  The captions for those two stated “Soil fill is disturbed and compacted only by machine passes.  The soil is not being compacted to an engineering specification … . Soil will be more susceptible to erosion as a result” (Figure 3.5); and “There is no control on layer thickness which are [sic] too thick … . Machine compaction at insitu moisture content is likely to result in high voids ratio in soil that will be erodible when wet due to weakened soil strength” (Figure 3.6).  The third image shows a flat area with a scraper to regulate soil fill thickness and a vibrating smooth cylinder roller.  The caption stated “A good example of Ocensa earthwork operations using vibrating roller compacting equipment and scrapers to regulate placed layer thickness.”  The conjunction of the text and images amounted to clear representations that (a) all three images showed typical earthwork operations on the Ocensa pipeline works, (b) Dr Card was unable to identify their location, (c) images 3.5 and 3.6 represented poor practice while 3.7 represented good practice that could and should have been implemented at the site of images 3.5 and 3.6, and (d) he had reviewed the relevant DVDs.

Worse still, the report was served with a letter from Leigh Day {N/1/1} which represented that the fifth report had come about because Dr Card had carried out a further review of the disclosed documents, especially construction weekly reports.  “This analysis informs the soil loss calculations that he prepared for the 4 TCs.  As a result, he has made some amendments to the soil loss calculations [in the fourth report]. We enclose a copy of this clarifying report.”  When first asked about it, Dr Card maintained that the explanation in the letter was a fair summary of the position when he served his fifth report.

For example, his figure of 8,244 tonnes per hectare for LC54 in the table above was his calculation of the amount that would have come off the ROW (per hectare) in a period of 13.8 weeks.  When scaled up for the area of the relevant stretch of the ROW, it implied a loss in the order of 11,350 tonnes during that period, or 825 tonnes per week or over 100 tonnes per day regularly throughout the period.  Dr Card accepted that this was an utterly ridiculous suggestion {Day25/40:12}. A moment’s thought should have made him realise that such an estimate bore no relation to what was otherwise evidenced in that case, to the extent that his calculation had to be wrong by many orders of magnitude.  This error goes right to the heart of his expert evidence about the quantity and source of sedimentation attributable to the carrying out of the Ocensa works.  Similar considerations apply to all four trial cases, as is clear from the amended figures in his fifth report; </p>

There is no evidence that all stockpiles were built with a base width of 3 metres or with such acute slope angles, and where DVD evidence shows substantial stockpiles the base either always or virtually always has a width of more than 3 metres.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">As with the other experts, I have reviewed all of Dr Card’s evidence since the conclusion of the trial.  That review has reinforced the provisional impression that I had formed during the trial, namely that at some stage in the proceedings, doubtless influenced by the remorseless pressure imposed by the Defendant’s emerging expert evidence and by the demands of participating in large-scale litigation, Dr Card realised that his initial observations and report were inadequate to sustain the conclusions he had reached and that, being convinced that his conclusions had been just, he set about attempting to justify them.  In the course of doing so, he made mistakes that are only explicable by reference to falling from the high standards that are expected of expert witnesses in major litigation.  These mistakes were of four kinds.  First, he became inadequately rigorous in attributing relevance or significance to evidence that he found in the mass of contemporaneous material.  This led him to attempt to bolster the Claimants’ case with evidence that was, as he should have realised, not appropriate for the task e.g. his treatment of Images 3.5-3.7 in his third report.  Second, he advanced quantitative evidence based upon assumptions which he was later forced to accept were ridiculous and qualitative evidence that was essentially non-expert and at times misleading e.g. in his fourth report.  Third, when concessions were required of him they were either slow in coming or not forthcoming at all e.g. his clinging onto the suggestion that the inclusion of Image/2 and Image/3 in the table of notable erosion events on LC50 was simply to provide a fair and balanced record of what he had seen on the ROW.  Fourth, and to my mind most serious, he gave an explanation for the production of his fifth report which was so inadequate as to be substantially untrue.  I do not go so far as to say that he consciously set out to mislead the Court, since that is not an allegation that was expressly put to him or that he dealt with in the course of his evidence; but I have reached the clear conclusion on the basis of the documents and having seen him giving evidence for days that he had by then, if not before, lost those qualities of objectivity and independence of mind which are essential for an expert in contested litigation and that he had become caught up in the siege-mentality which was painfully obvious on a number of occasions (on both sides) during the trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">These findings have two consequences, each of which is serious in the context of a case where the central issue for the technical experts is the relative and absolute contributions of the ROW works and other potential sources of erosion and sedimentation on the Claimants’ properties.  First, I find it impossible to place any reliance upon Dr Card’s attempted quantifications of soil loss from the ROW consequential upon the Ocensa pipeline works.  The destruction of Dr Card’s fourth and fifth reports in cross-examination on this area was complete.  The Claimants evidently recognised the damage that had been done as they placed little or no reliance on Dr Card’s figures in closing submissions, being driven instead to advance calculations prepared by counsel, typically on the basis of a draft report by Professor Morgan who, though he has in the past been consulted by the Defendant, was not an expert in the case.  Even before then, figures were put to the Defendant’s experts on a number of occasions which differed from and effectively abandoned those in Dr Card’s reports and evidence.  Second, I cannot approach Dr Card’s evidence on other matters with the implicit trust that is the privilege of experts whose objectivity and independence have not been successfully impugned. </p>

Put in other words, it is said that he had a tendency to blame everything <span style="font-style:italic">except</span> the Ocensa pipeline for the damage which the Claimants allege that their land has suffered.  The second major criticism the Claimants make of Dr Savigny is that he did not attempt any quantitative analysis of the relative contributions of the ROW and other potential sources of erosion.  There is substance in each of these criticisms, but they can be overstated; and, in my judgment, there was a pervasive though variable tendency of the experts on both sides to concentrate on the features that they thought of particular significance to the relative exclusion of others.  Dr Savigny has long experience in geotechnical works in association with oil pipelines and brought his very considerable expertise and experience to bear in forming his opinions.  He carried out invaluable analysis of historical photographs to identify changing patterns of land use and land quality (i.e. levels of soil exposure) which provide an essential context for any assessment of the impact of the Ocensa pipeline.  His reports addressed the Claimants’ allegations fairly and squarely and at very considerable length.  These same qualities were evident when he gave his oral evidence. </p>

However, the DVDs are useful in giving a general understanding of the challenges faced in various different terrains and the measures that were (at least on occasions) put in place to meet them.  Overall, Dr Savigny’s analysis of the DVDs was thorough and his opinions on what they showed were reliable. </p>

He identified weaknesses and points of disagreement, which were maximised when being deployed in the crossexamination of Dr Savigny.  However, by the end of his evidence, some of the aspects of dispute appeared somewhat synthetic.  I have taken into account the Claimants’ criticisms of Dr Savigny’s methodology and results at {C4/3.5/354}ff.  It is not necessary to engage in a detailed examination of those points because neither Dr Gundlach nor the Claimants say that there is no value in the photo-interpretation exercise that Dr Savigny carried out.  They caution against attributing spurious accuracy or precision to the resulting land use and land quality maps.  That is reasonable, as Dr Savigny accepted.  I bear in mind at all times that Dr Savigny had limited photographic evidence with which to work, and that attempting to draw longterm trends from a small number of photographic snap-shots will lack precision.  Subject to those qualifications, the photo-interpretation work carried out by Dr Savigny and those working with him was thorough, generally reliable (with a few identified exceptions), and helpful. </p>

As a result of the manner in which his work had been produced and his limited involvement in the case, it was established that (at least in the case of LC54 and LC74) his mapping exercise was deficient because it had no regard to local topography, included areas uphill from the ROW and excluded areas which, on any view, should have been included.

Both in their pleaded case, however, and in the evidence that was served in support, the Claimants referred to contemporaneous documents identifying concerns or problems and relied upon them in support of a broad case which asserted generalised failures in the design and construction of the works.  The breadth of the allegations can be illustrated by reference to [5]-[18] of the Claimants’ Further Information served in February 2012 {B2.2/32/232}ff.  The Further Information alleged that “there were no or no proper measures to prevent and control erosion and/or any measures were not properly designed and/or installed” [5]; “measures to store protect and preserve topsoil, trench spoil and other excavated material were not property designed. ... Further or alternatively, proper measures to store, protect and preserve topsoil, trench spoil and other excavated material were not taken and/or installed or properly installed on the Lead Properties” [10]; and “all excavated material should have been (but was not) stored within silt fences or other secure retaining structures, which should have been covered;...” [11].  These allegations were said to be “generic matters which apply to all Lead Properties unless otherwise stated: {B2.2/32/240} at [1].  It was thus the Claimants’ case not merely that there were individual deficiencies on Lead Claimant properties but that the deficiencies on Lead Claimant properties were themselves examples of generalised deficiencies as were alleged in the Further Information.  In support of these generalised allegations, the Claimants relied upon extracts from the contemporaneous documents to which they referred at [14].  If the Court could be persuaded of generalised deficiencies as alleged, it could provide support for a finding of lack of good faith, abuse of rights or dolo on the part of the Defendant in its dealings with the Claimants, though a failure to persuade the Court of generalised deficiencies would not necessarily be fatal to such a finding. </p>

These incidents during ROW construction of poor geotechnical management will certainly have contributed to large volumes of soil erosion and sediment being transported into natural water courses causing siltation and adverse flow conditions”{H23.3/8/582} at [2.3.4].  His selection was comprehensively reviewed and responded to by Dr Savigny in his Supplemental Report No 6 {H2.6/8/1708} at [3.2.1]ff<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">

	      </authorialNote>.  Substantially for the reasons given by Dr Savigny in his review, I agree with his conclusion that the documents selected by Dr Card do not justify drawing any conclusion to the effect that the carrying out of the project was subject to generalised deficiencies.  In accepting Dr Savigny’s evidence, I agree that the documents are typical of those that are generated in the course of any typical large-scale civil engineering project.  While it is common ground that, <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>geotechnical protective measures were not taken or were inadequate, erosion and sedimentation could follow,  the documents do not justify the conclusion that there was in general poor geotechnical management or that large volumes of soil erosion and sediment were routinely or even commonly transported into the natural water courses.  Whether large volumes of soil erosion and sediment were transported into water courses (or elsewhere) is a question of fact which must be decided on the evidence relating to individual properties and places, taking into account all relevant evidence both generic and specific. </p>

He subdivided them and allocated them to what he called “the most important issues that repeatedly occur during the Ocensa construction and reinstatement operations”, namely (1) problems with geotechnical works including reinstatement works, (2) problems with transport and deposition of sediments, (3) problems with revegetation works, including impacts by cattle activities, and (4) delays in the progress of works due to rainfall, lack of coordination between work fronts and other factors. </p>

In the light of those submissions I can state my conclusions shortly.  Some of the documents predate the carrying out of works on any of the Trial Claimant properties (May 1996 for LC74 being the earliest); there is other evidence in the case (of which some is identified by the Defendant in its closing submissions on this point) that identified problems were taken seriously where identified, and were rectified where possible; and the selection taken at its highest does not evidence widespread problems such as would justify Dr Card’s conclusion that there was a failure of management or supervision on a pervasive scale.

I deal with the results of that work when considering stockpiles below at [540].  Though not as serious as the failure to provide a fair presentation of specific images (which I have criticised at [504.iii)] above) Dr Card’s selection of the images of stockpiles without identifying that they were taken in January 1996 on a stretch of the ROW which is  not generally representative was in my view an example of lack of rigour on his part in selecting and presenting evidence which appeared to assist the Claimants’ case but which on close inspection provided limited assistance to the Court. </p>

The tests are not capable of being extrapolated to provide quantitive assessment of the effect of disturbing the soils on the ROW, but it is common ground that soil that has been disturbed is more susceptible to erosion than soil that has not.  The inability to extrapolate is compounded by the fact that the ROW was not treated to a regulated compaction regime like that afforded to a runway.

Under agricultural production, mean annual soil loss typically ranges from 0.1 to 100 t/ha, again depending on local conditions and whether any erosion control measures are practised.  Where land is cleared for construction work, typical annual rates are 1,000 to 10,0000 t/ha.”  Although these ranges are very wide, the trend is not in doubt and is confirmed by ample evidence including a PowerPoint presentation by Snr Gasca which indicates a background rate of 5 t/ha for original land use prior to construction and a rate in excess of 1000 t/ha after construction without doing any restoration work {K57/548/10}. </p>

For example, the suggested K-value for Sand with 4% organic content is 0.002, while that for Silt with &gt;0.5% organic content is 0.060, a relative increase by a factor of 30.  Similarly, the average suggested annual C-factor value for bare soil (recently tilled downslope) is 1 whereas that for dense forest with good litter layer is 0.001-0.01.  Table 6 in version 1 {H1.6/41/1707} offers C-factor values for ground conditions at construction sites ranging from 1.3 (“compact, smooth, scraped with bulldozer or scraper up and down hill”) to 0.9 (“loose with smooth surface greater than 0.3m depth”)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-right:0.09in"> Table 6 of Version 1 does not appear in Version 2, but it seems probable that it would have been on page 14 of Version 2 if that were not missing (apparently because of a problem in sending faxes). </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  These guide values are neither universally accepted nor of universal application.  Different suggested values are suggested by different authors: see {H1.4/22/841}; and each of the variables requires a more or less scientifically precise judgment to be formed.  Although when comparing prospective rates of erosion on the ROW and on the land adjacent to it, R, K and S are likely to be similar, if not identical, that cannot be assumed as the ROW was frequently laid so as to minimise the slope across it when compared with the surrounding terrain - this is illustrated by photographs (not all of the Ocensa pipeline) at {K66/615/28}ff.  Conversely, Dr Tobon’s measurements of slope downstream, upstream and on the ROW (fiercely criticised by Professor Monsalve) suggest that the gradient will alter in those three areas. </p>

It is recommended that a maximum value of 8.0 be set for the S-factor” {K49/520/10}.  The following page sets out the extreme difficulty in measuring slope length (Factor L). </p>

At {H1.6/41/1712} the USLE is used to provide estimations of the rate of soil loss for natural conditions and after construction but before installation of erosion control measures.  The estimate for conditions after construction (2113 t/ha/yr} is 433 times greater than that for natural conditions (4.88 t/ha/yr), which is entirely attributable to the choice of C factor (1.3 “compact, smooth, scraped with bulldozer or scraper up and down hill” vs 0.003 “good dense cover”).  This calculation is relied upon by the Claimants in their closing submissions {C4/3.5/390}.  Had it been assumed that the land was being cultivated with cassava (0.20-0.80) or had been (at least for part of the year) bare soil recently tilled downslope (1.0) the differential would have been greatly reduced.   </p>

The imprecision is compounded if an additional variable, namely a sediment transport factor is applied to reflect the fact that not all eroded soil will be transported over given distances.  The extreme variability of the transport factor is shown by the fact that Professor Morgan has expressed the view that it can vary from about 3 to 90 per cent, decreasing with greater basin area and lower average slope {H1.6/40/1692}.   </p>

The skilful extracting of concessions and other points from the Defendant’s experts cannot adequately compensate for the absence of a coherent and reliable body of expert evidence from those called on behalf of the Claimants.

It is that the worked example does not appear in Version 2.  It had been one of two illustrative examples and had adopted mean annual estimations for the Cusiana-Coveñas section of the pipeline in the eastern piedmont of the Cordillera Oriental using data for the Yopal recording station for which only mean monthly and mean annual information existed{H1.6/41/1708} and was made for the section of the pipeline described as being between K17+00 and K17+240 where the land was steeply sloping (25-50%), the soil was a loamy sand and the land cover was natural grassland {H1.6/41/1712}; and it appeared in the main body of the draft text.  In the second version, no equivalent or similar worked example appeared in the main body of the text.  Instead, Appendix 1 of the second version included a more detailed exercise for the section of pipeline between K+800 and K10+600 where different slopes and different soils were subject to natural pasture, woody shrub, managed pasture and abandoned cultivation {K49/520/30}.  Despite these differences in soil and land use, C-factors for natural pasture (0.003) and after construction (1.3) were retained throughout  - thus maintaining as differential factor of 433 as had existed in the version 1 worked example.  Other factors were subject to more modest variations so that application of the USLE led to many different results.   </p>

The text recorded that “for the section between K2+750 and K2+750 where the slope is 43º, the rate is 4,013 t/ha for the bare compacted soil, which is not unreasonable for a steeply-sloping construction site in tropical rainfall conditions.  The estimated rate under natural pasture, which was also the original land cover, is 9.3t/ha.  This value is rather high and indicates that achieving a target mean annual soil loss of 2 t/ha will be difficult.  The value of 9 t/ha should therefore be used as the “final” erosion target” {K49/520/34}. </p>

To that extent it is a useful tool for the purpose of showing trends and providing a measure of confirmation for other evidence.  It needs to be treated with extreme caution when seeking to extrapolate to estimate actual quantities of soil lost in the past, not least because the predicted soil lost is (as USLE recognises) dependent upon assumptions about rainfall which may not be replicated in a particular place at a particular time. This is so even if a given area has on average greater or lesser rainfall that assumed for a USLE calculation.  To similar effect, I accept Dr Card’s evidence that “using the USLE to simulate what will happen over a short time period or during a single event will lead to poor results for a system that is characterised by high temporal variability” {H1.4/22/838}.  (I note in passing that Professor Morgan’s paper makes plain that to assume that erosivity increases linearly with rain intensity would be wrong: see [2.3.1] at {K49/520/4}.) </p>

While I accept (and it is common ground) that the USLE is likely to show that the ROW soil was likely to be lost at a greater rate per hectare per year for the period of construction and some time thereafter than was likely to be lost per hectare per year from land under agricultural production or subject to deforestation) extrapolating from those rates of soil loss to identifying the rate at which sediment will enter streams on a given property is likely to be very unreliable.  This is because of the uncertainties surrounding the course to be taken by any sediment that leaves the ROW or areas of agricultural production or deforestation.  Further expert judgment is required to form any valid  assessment of what, if any, proportion of the sediment that is lost from the various sources will make its way to streams, either directly or indirectly.  It cannot be assumed that all or a large part of sedimentation from the ROW will end up in streams: to the contrary, it is part of the Claimants’ case that large quantities were found on fields in the course of the inspections and investigations for this litigation. </p>

Snr Gasca gave evidence which suggested that anything over about 4 metres would be “too high” for a stockpile {Day 14/118:14} ff and that he didn’t remember seeing stockpiles higher than that. There are films and photographs showing stockpiles which, though not formally measured, are clearly more than four metres high.  There is a clear general relationship between the topography of the terrain through which the ROW passed and the absence, presence and size of stockpiles: the steeper and more difficult the terrain, the greater the likely need to strip and stockpile larger amounts of soil.  {L2/794} at c. 8.21-10.00 gives a good representation of the ROW which bears passing resemblance to the Brown &amp; Root ideal ROW drawing: despite undulating terrain and some significant cuts to the side of the ROW, there are no significant stockpiles after opening of the trench: and see {L1/229} at 7.28, {L2/788} and {L2/806.1}<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="21">

The relationship between the complexity of the terrain and the size of stockpiles as shown on the video footage and photographs is not exact: for example, {L2/790} at about 2.00 and 27.05 shows significant stockpiles that appear to have been created at the edge of one or more camps or storage depots in relatively flat terrain.  More typical of the topographical need to accumulate stockpiles, however is {L2/790} at about 38.28-42.52, which shows substantial stockpiling of sub-surface soil at the side of a hilly stretch of the ROW. </p>

Accordingly, I would not accept that a stockpile over about 4 metres high was automatically “too high” and contrary to good practice; equally, it would not necessarily follow that a stockpile under 4 metres high was, for that reason alone, not “too high”.</p>

Rather, the criticism that is levied is that they were not provided where they should have been or, in the case of retention structures, they were not of adequate size or strength for the particular location.  Review of the photographic and DVD evidence shows examples of silt fences and retention structures, and other areas where the experts disputed whether they were necessary or, where present, whether they were adequate.  What was clear was that the factual evidence called on behalf of the Claimants about practice along the ROW, to the effect that there was no protection of soils or watercourses along the ROW, was unreliable {Day9/10:5} ff.  Similarly, the factual evidence of Snr Nelson Clavijo to the effect that great quantities of earth were scattered across fields {D11.2/177/2114} is not borne out by the contemporaneous evidence of DVDs and photographs.  His statement describes landslides and “mountains of mud” in times of heavy rain.  Even allowing for (what I find to be) an element of hyperbole, this evidence does not go directly to the presence or adequacy of silt fences and retention structures, and is not specific to the Trial Cases or (so far as I am aware) the Lead Claimants’ cases.

Some stockpiles were necessarily very large and it would not have been feasible to have covered such large mounds of earth with tarpaulins, with the implication that the tarpaulins would not merely have to be placed and secured but removed whenever the stockpile was to be added to or soil removed from it.  Equally, there is no evidence that justifies the conclusion that, as a matter of general good practice, modest windrows should always be covered.  While I do not exclude the possibility that there may have been occasions when some stored piles of soil should have been covered in particular circumstances dictated by topography, climate or particular susceptibility to erosion, I reject as entirely unrealistic any formulaic assertion that stockpiles and other exposed earth should always or usually be covered as a matter of routine good practice. </p>

Where this was done, the stripped topsoil and the excavated trench soil would be kept separate and I have seen no evidence of generalised failure to follow this practice.  The question of poor practice in relation to soil segregation is therefore fact sensitive and to be decided on sitespecific evidence. </p>

I have summarised the contractual provisions at [314] above.  Snr Loeber and Snr Gasca gave evidence about the approach to stream crossings which, if followed, would have amounted to good practice.  There is ample evidence on the DVDs of crossings being protected by flumes, sediment traps and channels, which appears satisfactory.  I also accept Snr Gasca’s evidence that there were special crossing teams dedicated to the crossing of streams that were not dry and that, in general, the waterbed would be reconformed to its original state {Day18/50:7}.  However, there is also evidence on the DVDs which points the other way with the ROW apparently running immediately on both sides of the stream without any apparent protection {H7.5/48/1448}; and Snr Gasca’s evidence was clear that sediment traps were not installed on crossings other than those listed in the EMP {Day16/90:5}, which would exclude the streams on the Trial Case properties.  Snr Loeber’s evidence was also that flume pipes were not installed across the entire width of the ROW but only across the part that served as a transit road {Day18/84:10}.  Whether for that reason or otherwise, there is evidence on the DVDs of sedimentation of the stream bed adjacent to a culvert where there is no obvious protection where the ROW meets the flow of the stream {H7.5/48/1450}; and during the course of 1996 concerns were periodically raised about run-off into watersources {K31/305/20}, {K34/339T/2}, {K38/379.1.1T/2}, {H1.6/24/1384}, {K38/392T/1}. </p>

In reaching this conclusion I take into account the evidence cited in Section 10 of the Claimants’ closing submissions, some of which I have mentioned specifically above; and also the detailed evidence about the four Trial Cases, to which I refer in greater detail later.  This generalised case on short term erosion measures is largely advanced on the basis of a presentation of contemporaneous documents which, both singly and cumulatively, are unremarkable in the context of a major and complex civil engineering project such as this.  With the sole exception of not covering stockpiles (as to which see [549]-[550] above) the contemporaneous documents are, both in content and number, consistent with a project where the systemic intention on all sides was to do a good job.  That is also true of the DVD and photographic evidence which (making due allowance for the fact that some of it is promotional material) is also consistent with a project being carried out generally to acceptable standards in conditions that are often extremely challenging. </p>

At the least, this shows that the standard of work was variable.  Given the emphasis on pressing ahead quickly with the construction of the pipeline, this is no surprise and it can safely be said that that variation meant that the standard sometimes fell below acceptable levels.  Dr Savigny’s comment at {H2.7/9/1724} is telling: “... my past experience indicates that a contractor will take steps that enable the fastest possible advance of the construction spread.  This approach acknowledges that some problems may develop but they will be dealt with quickly, as required to avoid adverse environmental or safety impacts; or, relegated to reinstatement where short term impacts are not foreseeable.”” {C4/3.5/313}. </p>

The first is that attempting to make fast progress was desirable from all points of view.  Quite apart from the commercial benefits of a promptly executed contract to those undertaking it, prompt carrying out of the works was to the benefit of the landowners, it being an integral part of the Claimants’ case that the works should be carried out quickly so as to minimise the time that the soils on and from the ROW were exposed to the elements between initial stripping and final reconforming and revegetation: see [561] below.  The second is that the contemporaneous documents, DVDs and photographs bear out Dr Savigny’s experience and support his expression of opinion. </p>

As Dr Card rightly stated, what was found might or might not have been the spacing as laid, since some rows of diverters may have completely eroded and may therefore been missed on inspection.  The experts offered possible reasons that may have contributed to such erosion.  Dr Card concentrated on the potential contribution of a lack of erosion matting while Dr Savigny drew attention to the potentially destructive effect of cattle.  Both are possible contributors, but they may not provide a full explanation for all of the cases where ditch diverters are no longer visible.  I am not satisfied that either is a necessary pre-requisite for the total erosion of some ditch diverters over the period between possible installation and litigation inspections: some may have failed over time for other reasons, including the destructive effect of climate, or simply with the passage of time.   </p>

And I conclude that the inability to find a particular ditch diverter on a property where it is evident that other ditch diverters were put in place does not without more justify the conclusion that the “missing” ditch diverter was not installed or (assuming it was installed in the first place) was defectively installed or protected.

The contemporaneous correspondence records concerns about the deleterious effect of implementing TQ61 {K66/611/6}, and Snr Gasca in evidence agreed with the concerns expressed at the time that omitting the matting in accordance with TQ61 was “not the most suitable response” {Day16/71:16}. </p>

It follows that I do not find it to have been automatically negligent to have omitted matting on slopes between 10% and 20%; but, given that the RECS design (a) involved an increase in the spacing of ditch diverters and a reduction in the robustness of their construction and (b) was adopted precisely because it was thought to be (and was) appropriate as a general design for a composite approach involving both ditch diverters and erosion control matting, the various criteria identified by Dr Savigny need to be considered with care on a case by case basis to see whether the omission of erosion control matting in a given location was justifiable. </p>

Therefore, although some small remnants of fique matting were found during inspections, the fact that matting was not found in a particular place more than 10 years after the works were completed does not prove that it was not laid there in the first place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">There is limited contemporaneous evidence about where erosion control matting was placed either on the Trial Properties or generally.  The position is not helped by the Defendant’s confusion about how erosion control matting would be shown on the GDS,  Snr Gasca gave evidence that erosion control matting was used on Spread B during his time.  His evidence ultimately was that the positioning of erosion control matting would have been marked on the ground and was not marked on the GDS {Day17/27:17} ff.  The Claimants describe this evidence as implausible {C4/3.5/334} and point to the fact that he was not on site for the duration of the contract.  The latter point is justified, but I do not regard his evidence as implausible.  I accept that erosion control matting was not marked on the GDS on Spread B; but the overall level of competence and supervision that is evident when the evidence is viewed overall makes it highly unlikely that no thought was given and no decision made about where erosion control matting should be placed.  Since it does not appear to have been recorded on the GDS or any other document that is now available to the parties, it seems highly likely (and I find) that decisions were made on site and would have been taken in the knowledge of the RECS design and (where applicable) TQ61.  It does not follow that the RECS design or TQ61 were always followed and, if they were not (so that erosion control matting was omitted) the risk of erosion was increased.  The evidence does not justify the conclusion that the contractual design was routinely ignored or that erosion control matting was routinely omitted.  Snr Gasca said that the project’s erosion control measures were good and that erosion levels were well within acceptable limits ({E1/1/87} at [19.7]).  That evidence was consistent with his 2001 Paper {K57/548/21} as explained in his witness statement at [19.8].  I accept that it was the genuine view of those involved in the project that the approach to erosion control measures had been “conservative” and in some respects went beyond what was strictly necessary. </p>

No Spread-wide analysis has been carried out that would justify overarching conclusions about whether or to what extent markings on the GDS represented a pattern of compliance or non-compliance with the contractual design.  In any event, I would not be prepared to make a general finding that erosion control matting was always laid in accordance with markings on the GDS.  It seems equally possible that on occasions decisions were taken on the ground either to increase or to decrease the amount of erosion control matting relative to what was shown on the GDS. </p>

I bear in mind the contemporaneous documents that refer to erosion occurring during and after the works.  However, to the extent that the Claimants continue to seek generic findings about the extent of the application of erosion control matting other than that it would have been generally in accordance with the RECS and (where appropriate) TQ61, the only generic finding that is appropriate to be made in the light of the expert evidence of Dr Savigny and Dr Card is that failure to comply with those contractual requirements would increase the risk of erosion and would require justification on a case by case basis. </p>

Dr Card’s review recognised that contractors were reluctant to plant in the dry season, and expressed no opinion that this was unacceptable, merely pointing to the recommendations in a paper prepared in 2001 where contractors raise this difficulty {H1.6/24/1396}.  Further rational support for the desirability of not planting in the dry season comes from Dr Velez who, when arguing for dense application of seeds on sloping ground said that “to support this high population [of seeds], the soil requires correct management ... and an appropriate moisture level, which is possible if planting takes place at the beginning of the rainy season” {H5.7/10/1518}.  It would be wrong to make a generic finding that any gap over and above a certain period between stages of the works (including between final geotechnical works and revegetation) either was or was not negligent, and I make no such finding.  Having regard to the general desirability of revegetation happening at the same time as long-term erosion works, where there is a substantial gap and there is evidence that the length of the gap has contributed to a significant increase in erosion over and above what would have happened in any event, it may be a proportionate use of resources to look at the reasons underlying the gap in detail. </p>

In such situations he described the intent of the ditch diverters as “to control water to an undisturbed area adjacent to the [ROW], and at that point it is discharging into terrain that is comparable to the other terrain on either – generally on either side of the [ROW]” {Day37/12:19}.    </p>

While I accept that there may be circumstances in which dispersal to the land adjacent to the ROW may be unacceptable because of the longitudinal or cross-slope gradients, the anticipated volume of erosion and sediment that will be carried by the runoff water, or because of the erodibility of the surrounding soil or lack of vegetation (or a combination of all these things) I am persuaded by Dr Savigny’s reasoning that there may be times when it is better to let the water discharged from a ditch diverter dissipate directly onto the surrounding land.  I accept that this may have a concentrating effect at the point of discharge from the individual ditch diverter  but it is clear from the evidence about the USLE and the need to introduce a sediment transport factor that further movement of the sediment will occur: see [531] above.  So the question will be whether it is better to allow runoff across a broad front from a number of ditch diverters or to concentrate the runoff yet further and to discharge it in fewer places.  I place no limitation on the list of possibly relevant considerations and accept Snr Loeber’s evidence that the timing of the works and the prevailing weather conditions could be factors to take into account {Day19/73:21}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It is clear from various photographs that the ROW was not routinely fenced off, though it sometimes was.  The reasons for this lack of consistency are not clear but are likely to be site-specific in many cases. The August 1997 report leaves open the prospect that in some cases it may have been assessed that there was no appreciable risk against which fencing was required.  There are obvious considerations both in favour and against fencing off the line of the ROW, even where there is a potential risk of damage.  In favour is that, if there is a risk from people or cattle, fencing it off protects the ROW, which may be particularly necessary in its early stages of revegetation.  Against would be that, as in LC54, fencing off the ROW would bisect fields, restrict access to water in some parts of the fields and restrict access across the farm.  So an alternative solution is to remove livestock from the affected fields altogether for a time, or to fence them temporarily on one side of the ROW and then move them to the other, if that is practicable from the point of view of stock husbandry, milking and general farm management.  Evidence was also given during the trial of fencing off the ROW (not on LC54) but creating a passage across it at a selected point or points.  That evidence is consistent with implementation of the EMP statement that the ROW should be fenced off “in agreement with the owner”: the statement allows for no fencing to be provided if there is no or no appreciable risk or if the owner didn’t want it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In comparison with other issues, the generic evidence and submissions on fencing are short.  The risk of damage from cattle or humans will be most obvious to the landowner who will know how he would wish to use his fields.  If he wished to keep cattle in fields which spanned the ROW, the terms of the EMP suggest that Ocensa would agree to provide fencing to enable him to keep his cattle off the ROW itself.  I do not consider that this gives rise to an unlimited obligation to fence the ROW, for a number of reasons which interlink.  First, the land is and remains the property of the landowner subject to the grant of the rights by the ROW Agreement and the easement as set out in the Public Deed.  Neither Saipem nor Ocensa nor the Defendant were given the right to fence off the ROW by those documents: see [369] (particularly clauses 6 and 7) and [371]; nor has it been suggested that the provisions of the Mining or Petroleum Codes give the right to fence off the ROW without the agreement of the landowner.  As against that, the pipeline works carry a risk of damage, with the result that good practice requires the carrying out of erosion control works as part of the pipeline works.  But what else?  It seems to me that fencing off the pipeline works raises different and additional questions because (a) the standard ROW Agreement provides limited compensation for the effects of the works on productivity and (b) while it is the landowners’ right to have access to his land at all times provided he does not obstruct the entrepreneurs’ exploitation of their easement, even the entrepreneur’s best efforts to restore and return the land after taking advantage of his easement may be nullified if the landowner takes immediate or premature access for his cattle.   </p>

It does not appear whether the decision in August 1997 to enclose the area of Spread B with electric fences at the most critical points was taken with the agreement of the relevant landowners, or whether the matter had been discussed with them, or precisely what nature of economic and farming imperative made the landowners put their cattle in the fields with the recently sown ROW.  And the 2002 report that “in some cases the inhabitants of the area remove protective fencing so that cattle enter into the area and destroy the works” suggests that the absence of fences may not always be attributable to lack of willingness on the part of Saipem and others responsible for the works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Where fences were agreed to be inserted, the question of adequacy is also not entirely straightforward.  On the assumption that the intention of the fencing was to protect vegetation on the ROW until it was established, the period during which it would be required might vary considerably from place to place.  The EMP specification was for 3 strands of barbed wire, which to European eyes suggests a degree of permanence that would be positively disadvantageous if access to the ROW was going to be required within a period measured in months.  There is no material that would justify the generic finding that a fence should last a particular length of time, or even that it should be barbed rather than electric.  There is evidence (for example, in the case of LC54) of fences being damaged after installation.  I do not accept that the fact that a fence gets damaged means that it was negligently constructed: damage to fences is a fact of farming life the world over and, if it happens, repairs are readily carried out.  If a farmer finds that one of the fences on his land is damaged and chooses not to repair it, damage caused thereafter by animal incursion would (to an English tort lawyer) appear to be caused by his decision not to repair the damage to the fence of which he knew.   </p>

I do not understand it to be seriously disputed that those requirements and the steps described by Snr Gasca, if adhered to, were consistent with and represented good practice.  If it is disputed, I reject the grounds of dispute.  What is certainly common ground is that “water crossings pose one of the more significant environmental impact risks associated with pipeline construction” {H23.3/8/650} at line 2429.  Dr Savigny identified that specific attention was given to reducing the impact of traditional techniques for watercourse crossing in Canada in and from 1992 and that practice in Colombia probably lagged behind that in the United States and Canada </p>

As in other respects, it is clear from his evidence that erosion control techniques were developing throughout the 1990s; but it is pertinent to remember that those constructing the Ocensa pipeline had access to the most modern expertise available through the joint venturers.  And, given the extreme importance of watercourses to the agricultural communities through which the Ocensa pipeline passed, until less invasive techniques were developed, the need to use existing techniques to protect watercourse crossings and to minimise the adverse effects of sedimentation that may have occurred was paramount.  Precisely what techniques should be used to protect a given watercourse crossing as and after the works were carried out, and whether it was thereafter necessary to remove sediment from river beds in order to restore them so far as possible to their pre-works condition would be a matter for judgement in each case.  But I accept the generic proposition that the available techniques could and should have been used as necessary to prevent the sedimentation of watercourses so far as reasonably practicable.   </p>

Small quantities might not matter, because of the ability of the water flow to clear them with time; but if significantly detrimental sedimentation of a stream took place (whether or not reasonable precautions had taken place), steps could and should have been taken to remove it so as to prevent lasting damage to the watercourse. Snr Loeber effectively recognised this when giving evidence about post-works walkthroughs.  The walkthrough would generally be limited to the ROW and adjacent to it, but it was made with the intention of picking up and remedying deficiencies in the works and problems caused by the construction {Day19/43:17} ff, which should have included deficiencies in and near to watercourses that were caused by the works.  Damage to watercourses was evidently part of the remit, as evidenced by his recollection of one case where the inspectors were stopped by a farmer who said that his watercourse had been contaminated {Day19/44:7}.   </p>

Only one record of walkthroughs identifies removal of sediment from streams as a work to be done {J24/74T/39} and there is no record of removal of sedimentation in the available weekly construction records, though I am not convinced they would necessarily have merited being mentioned there.  Factual evidence, apart from evidence of system from Snr Loeber and Snr Gasca, is either entirely or almost entirely absent.  Absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence, but in this area there is an almost deafening silence.  It remains to be determined on a site by site basis whether there was or would have been sedimentation of particular watercourses that required or justified cleaning out while the initial works were being conducted or later, and whether sedimentation attributable to the ROW works has caused damage.  That said, I have the clear impression from the evidence that clearing of sediment from watercourses as a distinct operation (as opposed to being part of or incidental to the works on a crossing as the main works were being carried out) happened rarely. </p>

Second, where the two pipelines followed the same route, the potential for erosion from the ODC ROW would have been similar to the potential for erosion from the Ocensa Row, subject to the fact that the Ocensa ROW had already been disturbed by the ODC works and will therefore already have been in a more fragile condition than when those constructing the ODC ROW started their works on land that had not previously been subject to such disruption.

These high concentrations of total iron in this caño are associated with sediments that were deposited on the caño’s bed and that caused the bed’s narrowing.”  It is now entirely clear that Dr Tobon is not an expert on issues such as the quality of water for human and animal consumption and that he would not be able to to provide an objective interpretation such as I have just set out (which, for shorthand became known as “the third column”) {Day28/10:10}, {Day28/63:6} {Day28/166:1}. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Three criticisms are made, which are interlinked.  First, Dr Tobon should not have included the third column and other interpretations of water quality and fitness for human or animal consumption as it was outside his area of expertise.  Second, Dr Tobon should not have signed the expert’s statement of truth asserting that all matters in his first report were within his field of expertise.  Third, when coming to give evidence to the Court, Dr Tobon should have made clear his absence of expertise in this area rather than leaving it to be established in cross-examination.  Applying the high standards applicable to experts in contested English litigation, I accept all of these criticisms as justified.  However, there are very substantial mitigating circumstances.  First, Dr Tobon said in evidence that he told Leigh Day he was not an expert in this area {Day28/10:16}.  Even if he did not, the obligation on the legal team to ensure that an expert does not give evidence which he is not qualified to give is always present and is particularly important when dealing with experts who are not experienced in the demands and technicalities of contested English litigation.  Second, Dr Tobon had referred to his lack of expertise about water quality for animal consumption and about the levels of Manganese that generates toxicity or health problems in answering Part 35 Questions, which will have been done with the assistance of the legal team {H7.5/44.2/1289.29}; and in his joint meeting with the Defendant’s water quality expert he is recorded as having said that he was “not an expert on issues such as quality of water for human or animal consumption” {H23.5/15/1230}.  As for the question of clarifying the position when he came to give evidence, I consider that any criticism is more fairly directed at the legal team who by then knew Dr Tobon well.  My instinctive reaction (not having heard argument specifically on the point) is that it is a responsibility of those having conduct of the trial to decide (after reviewing all of their evidence) what matters are going to be brought to the attention of the Court by way of correction or otherwise at the start of a witness’ evidence, whether that is done in answer to specific questions in chief or the expert “volunteers” matters.  This will involve prior dialogue with the witness, and it may be that the witness’ (privileged) answers will deflect the lawyers.  Whether I am right or wrong in my instinctive reaction, I would be slow to criticise someone such as Dr Tobon who is unfamiliar with English procedure and the Court’s expectations and who would hope and expect to be guided by others about how he should assist the Court.  I do not think that the fact that he has been provided with the normal information about an experts’ duties alters the position; my attitude would be different if he were an experienced English litigation expert.  Finally, when tackled on his lack of expertise in cross-examination, he readily acknowledged it. </p>

In addition it is said that his first sampling exercise assumed that, if the Ocensa pipeline construction impacted water quality, it would be evident at the ROW crossing and that his explanation of his second sampling method, namely that he was testing the null hypothesis that there are no differences between the concentration of any element upstream or downstream of the ROW if there is no impact from the ROW, is not to be accepted.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">I do not consider it irrational for the second sampling to have been based on a methodology that assumed that the upstream sample would represent the natural condition of the stream and that the downstream sample would reflect water altered by the construction of the pipeline {H7.3/3/654} at [2.3.1.11].  To my mind, it is then correct to describe the hypothesis being tested as being that if there is no impact from the ROW there will be no differences between the concentration of any element upstream or downstream of the ROW.  Other criticisms might be made, such as whether it is reasonable to hypothesise that the actual point of crossing the ROW may still be a “point of impact” many years later; but that is another matter.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The second criticism under this head ({C4/4.7/340} at [54]-[58]) relates to the fact that, although he set out to take samples in pre-defined places, in fact he did not do so; and his evidence (to which I have already referred) about taking (or not taking) samples from stagnant water.  While it is legitimate to question where and why he took his samples, I reject the suggestion that he set out to obtain samples that would provide results intended to be biased in favour of the Claimants.  Similarly, I am not persuaded that his taking of  individual “spot samples” on comparator farms without having any a priori method for defining where such samples should be taken as evidence of deliberate bias.  It raises questions about whether the samples are representative, but that is another question, to be assessed elsewhere. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dr Tobon was cross-examined on both of these changes.  He undoubtedly knew it to be the Claimants’ case that stream water had been rendered unfit for human consumption by the Ocensa pipeline works.  He must also have known that <span style="font-style:italic">E. coli</span> and total coliforms (if found) would (at least as a working assumption) have their origins in faeces and not in the pipeline works; and he knew that their presence would independently render stream water unfit for human consumption in accordance with the WHO guidelines to which he referred {H7.3/3/875}.  It is also correct (and he recognised) that the samples tested provided consistent evidence of the widespread presence of each.  His evidence was that the decision not to continue testing for <span style="font-style:italic">E. coli</span> and total coliforms was his and that he had communicated that decision to Leigh Day.  His reason for doing so was that he is a hydrologist and he decided to focus on the hydrological factors and everything that was related to hydrology; in other words he decided to analyse the aspects that he thought were relevant in order to be able to identify any level of damage that might have been caused (by the pipeline works) to the streams in the farms {Day29/75:6} ff.  He later described his objective as being “to find variables that would … help to show the court as variables that were related to what I was observing in the field.  So I went eliminating variables that might give the wrong impression and I focussed on the variables that, at that time, and that I still believe are relevant to the case that I have been asked to analyse” {Day29/77:4}.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">This answer is understandable in relation to eliminating testing for <span style="font-style:italic">E. coli</span> and total coliforms, which are not affected by the mechanism of damage that Dr Tobon thought he had seen.  It is less understandable in relation to the elimination of colour, which was asserted as a marker of damage attributable to the pipeline by the Claimants’ pleadings to which I have already referred.  However, I had no sense at the time that Dr Tobon’s reference to eliminating variables “that might give the wrong impression” meant or implied that he was eliminating variables that he thought might be adverse to the Claimants’ case; and I am not now persuaded that was his meaning.  Review of this section of his evidence (including listening to some of it again as well as reading it) leaves me convinced that his reference to “giving the wrong impression” was an example (not unique in the course of this trial on either side) of intended sense being lost in translation. </p>

In general terms, the concentration of the variables analysed demonstrates the effect of rainfall events on the quality of the water, given that these three small watercourses respond differentially to the rainfall events, transporting part of the sediment load and matter which accumulate on the stream beds” {H7.4/4/988}.  According to his report, the samples for the old and new house sources were both taken on 29 November 2011 so that any rainfall event would have been of equal materiality to both sets of results {H7.4/4/983}, {H7.4/4/986}.  In his itemised comments on the results for iron for each watersource, Dr Tobon referred to the stream waters having been contaminated by iron and that “this is related to a rainfall event the night before the visit” {H7.4/4/984}, {H7.4/4/987}; but he included no note suggesting that the old house results had generally been affected by the rainfall event as he did with the new house note that I have quoted. </p>

As I have made clear, it is unacceptable for an expert to accept material in this way.  Making all due allowance for Dr Tobon’s inexperience of English litigation and what appears on the available information to have been the involvement of the Claimants’ solicitors in this process, it would be wrong to conclude that Dr Tobon’s acting in this way of itself demonstrates bias.  That said, the willingness to accept material which is said to come from another expert without verifying the source or the context is a worrying indication of a lack of independence and objectivity, quite apart from the fact that its prevalence makes the Court’s task much more difficult when trying to decide what is Dr Tobon’s independent view and what is not. </p>

The soil was deposited directly into the beds of the streams, canos and spring sources” {H7.3/3/619}.  In fact the still showed a substantial sediment trap behind a gabion wall which separated it from the main course of the stream at a significant crossing, the purpose of which was to catch soil and to prevent it getting into the main stream.   </p>

If this were the only example of citations from videos, it might be insignificant in the overall scale of things; but in his supplemental report at [10.16] he cited 28 extracts from the disclosed videos as support for his expression of opinion that “from the evidence seen in the videos examined, we can conclude that much of the sediment that built up in the streams, both on the strip traversed by the right of way, and in the water downstream of it, was deposited there during the construction of the Ocensa pipeline, or eroded from the unprotected mounds of soil deposited on each side of the ROW” {H7.5/48/1447}.  I have looked at all of the videos; that exercise alone would leave me in a state of complete uncertainty about whether Dr Tobon looked at some, all or none of them.  My uncertainty is increased by Dr Tobon’s evidence, when referred expressly to the passage I have just set out, that the “role of the videos here was minimal” {Day28/36:22}.

The only point in its favour is that he did not italicise the passage, which he says he would do if quoting directly.  But the evidence in support of my finding that he did quote directly is overwhelming and, even when subject to the pressures of being cross-examined, he must have been able to see that the passage was a direct quote even if he had forgotten about the existence that particular paragraph altogether since including it in his report.  He asserted positively that what appeared in his report was his own work and represented his summary of the underlying papers.  Having reviewed his evidence again, I find myself driven to the conclusion that he knew that evidence to be untrue for two main reasons: first, the evidence is so palpably wrong as to be absurd; and second, there can have been no reason either for him to have reconstructed events to such an absurd conclusion or (which is what he appeared to be asserting) to have a recollection (albeit mistaken) of what he was saying. Before finally reaching this conclusion I have compared my reaction to this passage of Dr Tobon’s evidence with my reaction to Dr. Avila’s in apparently similar circumstances see [777] below.  The witnesses were different and the facts not identical; and in the end, after trying to weigh all of the features of each witness and their evidence, my conclusions are and remain different.  </p>

It was outside his expertise because he purported to deduce from a video about the ODC construction and from an ODC construction manual whether appropriate geotechnical protective steps were carried out, which could only ever be for someone with considerable geotechnical expertise.  It was lacking in merit because one video and a construction manual are no basis for a conclusion about whether proper geotechnical protective steps were undertaken, either in particular areas or over the length of a pipeline that stretched for hundreds of kilometres.  His willingness to express a conclusion on the relative contributions of the ODC and Ocensa lines was also inappropriate because he expressly acknowledged in the course of the offending passage that “based on the information that was made available to me, I cannot determine exactly to what extent the construction of the ODC pipeline contributed to the sedimentation of the streams of the LC farms and if said contribution was significant” {H7.5/48/1423} at [4.59].  This passage of his second report is a clear example of his giving evidence that he should not have done and for which, even on his own logic, was not justified.

Dr Card’s report said that he had not observed gabions on LC74 but also that “I also note that Dr Conrado Tobon also identified during his inspection in January 2012 a gabion retaining wall on each Claimant Property 74.  He describes this feature in his Expert Report” {H1.1/1/53} at [6.3.15].  This bizarre mis-cross-referencing seems most likely to have occurred (in both of the reports) because of the vice of accepting information without verifying it.  This particular instance suffers from the additional vice that Dr Tobon had seen a gabion but did not mention it on the basis of his own inspection.  It exemplifies the difficulties that arise from the Claimants “inter-disciplinary approach” where experts failed to verify the information on which they purport to rely.

I make clear that I do not find that he was deliberately or knowingly biased when carrying out his field investigations; and I do not find that he set out with the conscious intention of procuring or recording evidence that was biased in favour of the Claimants.  However, having found (i) bias in his interpretation of sample results and his selective reliance on WHO guidelines that he professed to be important, (ii) a willingness to express opinions that were outside his field of expertise, (iii) a readiness to assert reliance upon information he had not verified (including, to an extent that I am not able precisely to define, the DVD evidence), (iv) a willingness to express opinions for which there was no reasonable or scientific justification and (v) a willingness to deny that he had quoted directly from an academic article when he must have known that evidence to be untrue, means that any evidence about causation that he gives must be scrutinised with extreme care to ensure that both the source evidence upon which he relies and the logic underpinning his opinion are sound. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">If I had concluded that Dr Tobon was guilty of deliberate bias in his recording of his field observations or in the giving of his opinions about causation, I would be prepared to discard his evidence altogether.  On the findings I have made, however, that would be too extreme a course to take.  Dr Tobon visited the farms on between 3 and 5 occasions between November 2011 and December 2013 spending, in all, just short of 200 hours on the four Lead Claimant farms and the five Comparator Farms.  In the course of those visits he walked the hydrographic basins and the streams that are crossed by the ROW, though there are challenges to the extent of some of his inspections on some of the farms {H23.4/10/831}.  I have not been persuaded that all of his recorded observations on the farms or, for example, his measurements of sediment depth are systematically (though unintentionally) biased so as to be skewed in the Claimants’ favour.  Those observations and measurements therefore remain as part of the overall body of evidence to be considered and tested on their merits (as to accuracy) and for their significance (as to causation) on a case by case basis.  Finally, it is possible to interpret the passage of his oral evidence about the Bruijnzeel article as the knowing and unjustifiable response to the pressures of determined crossexamination without concluding that it infects all of his evidence in the case, and that is how I find it to be. </p>

In the course of that career he has previously advised BP on a number of occasions in different capacities.  Although the Claimants drew attention to his previous work with and for BP, they did not suggest that had affected his approach to his work on this litigation.  What they did, with reason, submit was that the scope of his evidence was carefully circumscribed and that there were a number of flaws in his approach, particularly in relation to his use of the USLE.  It is right that his reports were written on the assumption that all proper and practicable steps had been taken to protect the ROW and prevent soil erosion from it.  However, I formed the clear impression that, as the Claimants submitted, the scope of his evidence had been carefully controlled and circumscribed by others; and I formed the equally clear impression, which was reinforced as he gave his oral evidence and as I have reviewed his evidence as a whole, that the Claimants were right not to level any accusation of partiality against him.  While quite prepared to hold a position when he thought it right to do so, he was also prepared to make concessions when properly called for, as happened during the course of his being skilfully cross-examined at length.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">At first sight this approach tends to understate the contribution of the land in the stream’s basin (other than the ROW) because it excludes any contribution of land below the ROW.  However, the real problem that emerged was that, when assessing the potential contribution of the ROW, he excluded those stretches of the ROW which were not between the points of intersection by the basins he had drawn.  The effect of this was to exclude from consideration 57% of the ROW on LC39, 34% on LC50, 24% on LC54 and 33% on LC74.  A partial answer to this omission was that not all of the ROW would have flowed <span style="font-style:italic">directly</span> (i.e. along the line of the ROW) towards a watercourse, though Dr Gundlach’s evidence showed that even on this basis significant portions of the ROW had been wrongly excluded: see, for example, {H22/2/110}ff.  More importantly, even if soil that was lost from the ROW did not flow directly into streams, it will have flowed downhill until arrested by the topography of the land or by being captured in a stream at a more distant point.  In some cases, soil lost from an area of erosion may have flowed off the property from which it originated, as the Claimants allege to be the case with soil from point E1 beyond the boundaries of LC54; but in other cases, even if it does not make its way to a stream either directly or indirectly, soil lost from the ROW will end up below the ROW on the same property, as is alleged by the Claimants to have happened in field AF2 on LC39.  This has two implications.  First, to exclude the lengths of the ROW without consideration of where soil from them would go was arbitrary and tended to underestimate the amounts of soil making its way into the streams.  Second, it cannot be assumed that all soil from the ROW either went into streams or stayed on the property on which the relevant section of the ROW was situated.  An exercise which assumes that all soil lost from the ROW will end up in streams would therefore be as misguided as one which arbitrarily excludes substantial proportions of the ROW altogether.  More subtle, because it is more difficult to define or quantify, is that it cannot be assumed that all soil lost from that portion of the ROW which falls within a particular stream’s basin will end up either in the stream (because some may remain </p>

He applied no sediment transport factor to the soil losses he had calculated, either from the ROW or from the basin as a whole.  Although the basins in question are, in absolute terms, relatively small, this was a fundamental omission, as he recognised in his evidence {Day39/81:18} ff.  Since much of the basin would be further than the ROW from those parts of streams alleged to have been affected, this error led to overestimation of the contribution of the basin and underestimation of that of the ROW.  When cross-examined Professor Monsalve referred to transport factors in American literature varying between 0.5 and 0.7 {Day39/82:22}, and in a paper submitted after his cross-examination {H8.28/46/7318} he settled on 0.5 (or 50%) as appropriate, which is to be contrasted with the range of 3-90% referred to in the Morgan draft paper: see [531]. </p>

What this demonstrated was the imprecision of the contouring exercise he had undertaken, which in turn affected his assessment of the outline of the basins feeding particular streams.  To my mind, these criticisms of lack of precision of the exercise are not fundamental unless an attempt is made to claim precision for the product of the resulting exercise, which Professor Monsalve did not do.  They do, however, raise questions about the thoroughness of his original exercise, because of his failure to recognise or remedy the implausibility of water flowing uphill. </p>

On his assumptions, that was correct and his revised analysis was not challenged.  Dr Tobon described Professor Monsalve’s revised evidence in his Supplemental Report as “a good piece of work” and confirmed that it was also his view that the ROW occupies a very low percentage of the basin {Day29/143:9} ff. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">One important element of Professor Monsalve’s continuing exercise was his assessment of the proper coverage factor to be applied to the basin (the C factor for the purposes of the USLE calculation).  This gave rise to protracted argument and requires some analysis here.  Professor Morgan’s draft paper described the C factor as “Crop management factor” and provided two tables, for average C-factor values (Table 3) and for pasture and rangeland (Table 4) {H1.6/41/1704}ff.  In the draft paper, he adopted 0.003 as the applicable C-factor where there is 100% ground coverage.

In his application of the USLE calculation, Dr Card adopted a figure of 1 for land on the ROW and 0.07 for land off the ROW, which he said was based upon his field observations and was intended to reflect 60-80% coverage (though he later reduced his figure to 0.02) {H1.4/22/845}.  Professor Monsalve settled on a figure of 0.16 for land off the ROW.  The Claimants submit that, by a process of extrapolation, this meant that he was assuming 34% coverage overall, as shown at {C4/3.8.1/1366.17}.  Professor Monsalve rejected such a simple approach and extrapolation, summarising his approach after cross-examination at {H8.28/46/7318}, where he rejected a purely mechanical application of figures from the Morgan paper and the figures that had been put to him in cross-examination.  He concluded that summary by saying that “it is very difficult, if not impossible, to give an accurate assessment of the absolute amounts of erosion from the ROW or from the drainage basins on the information that is available.”  I unhesitatingly agree with and accept that opinion, for the reasons he there gave, and it appears to be common ground: see [683] below.  In particular, one reason for the reservations expressed about whether the USLE can be used to predict soil loss from catchments, to which I have referred at [523] above, would be the impossibility of assessing with any degree of accuracy the C-factor for an area of any significant size which will inevitably have varying types of vegetation and levels of coverage over time. Even when land coverage is assessed at a specific moment, the coverage on the Claimants’ properties was not homogeneous, as is illustrated by Dr Savigny’s assessment of LC39 in 1995 {H2.8/11/2192}: he assessed different areas as having a 0-10% exposed soil (43% of the whole), 10-50% (41%), 50-90% (10%) and 90-100% (1%).  Identifying a C-factor with mechanical or mathematical precision is impossible and runs the risk of being spurious.  Professor Monsalve’s reliance upon his experience and the aggregation of features applying to what he saw is, in principle at least, a preferable approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The other feature to be resolved at this stage is an inconsistency in the evidence about when erosion can be expected to happen, depending upon the extent of vegetation cover.  In answer to the Court the Defendant’s expert agrologist, Professor Montenegro, said that he did not expect to get soil erosion unless the vegetation cover was less than 30% {Day42/74:7}.  In doing so he agreed with a statement made by Dr Obando at {H3.8/16/1914} at [11.4.15.3].  I do not accept that evidence, either coming from Dr Obando or from Professor Montenegro.  It is implicit in the USLE that erosion can and does occur with almost any level of vegetation cover, and that the rate of erosion will vary with the degree of vegetation cover: there is no particular point before which there will be no erosion and after which erosion will occur.  Specifically, there is no magic or particular significance in 30% vegetation cover as suggested by Dr Obando and accepted by Professor Montenegro.  I prefer and accept the evidence of Dr Uribe at {Day43/77:10} ff that wherever rain falls on the soil with energy there will be erosion and that 30% vegetation cover is not a point of particular significance in the overall range, even for land that has been cleared. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">At the outset of the Claimants’ submissions on the re-worked figures, Ms Thornton made clear that, despite the apparent numerical precision of the exercise, the Claimants were not asking the Court to make specific findings about numbers.  What they were asking the Court to find is that soil loss from the ROW (and therefore sedimentation of streams and land) was orders of magnitude more than it would have been from the deforestation and agricultural use of the hydrological basins above and upstream of the ROW {Day55/85:19} ff.  To that end they rely upon the calculations in support of the specific finding that “by developing the USLE analysis of the Defendant’s advisers, the Claimants can demonstrate that soil loss from the ROW, once the pipe had been laid and the trench covered with soil, would have contributed more sediment on a daily rate to the streams on farms than the contribution from deforestation/agricultural practice” {C4/3.5/388}.  Despite these stated limitations, it is certain that the re-worked calculations are intended to be taken by the Court as evidence in support of the Claimants’ case that soil loss from the ROW happened at such a rate and in such volumes as to overwhelm streams and cause substantial damage to the Claimants’ land.  They are intended to be important evidence lending credence to the evidence of lay witnesses about the impact of the Ocensa Pipeline and the findings recorded in fields and streams to which I will have to turn in due course. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In part the Claimants are pushing at an open door, since the Defendant accepts that the relative rate of soil loss per unit of area would have been greater from the newlydisturbed soil of the ROW than from the undisturbed pasture around it.  However, that is only the start of the Claimants’ case on causation derived from the theoretical behaviour of the soils, because the Claimants contend that the <span style="font-style:italic">rate</span> of loss of soil from the ROW (and hence sedimentation of land and streams that it caused) was so much greater than the rates that had been experienced over time that the streams were unable to cope with the actual <span style="font-style:italic">volumes </span>of soil that left the ROW with the result that streams became “clogged” (to use Dr Tobon’s word) and large quantities of sediment were deposited on fields, reducing their productivity.  The relative rate of difference between the historic rates of erosion and sedimentation and the rates from the ROW during its time of maximum vulnerability therefore matters and the orders of magnitude being suggested by the re-worked USLE calculations must be examined to see if the assumptions on which they are based are reliable, conservative or not.  Only if it is possible to reach reliable conclusions about the <span style="font-style:italic">relative</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">rate </span>of soil loss (even in terms of orders of magnitude) could the Court make inferential findings about the <span style="font-style:italic">volume </span>of soil loss at any given time and whether the USLE exercise provides real support for the Claimants’ case that the volumes were sufficient to clog the Claimants’ streams and cause damage to their land. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">A second feature must be borne in mind at all times.  Both Professor Monsalve’s calculations and the Claimants’ reworkings concentrated on the effect of soil loss (from the basins or the ROW) upon streams.  Professor Monsalve’s failure to apply a sediment transport factor was a material error, for the reasons I have summarised above.  However, it is the Claimants’ case that soil from the ROW did not merely affect streams, but also came to be deposited in large quantities on the Claimants’ fields.  I return to this when reviewing the Claimants’ reworking of the USLE calculation; but it emphasises the need to scrutinise closely the assumptions made by the Claimants in order to determine the extent to which they reflect and support their factual case both as to streams and as to land. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The third feature to be borne in mind at all times is that this reworking is potentially a double-edged sword for the Claimants.  If and to the extent that the Claimants establish that the creation of the Ocensa scar through the fragile ecosystem of central Colombia would predictably have the effect that soil would come off the ROW at high volumes, the same is true of the ODC pipeline.  The main variable as between the pipelines for the purposes of the USLE calculation is the period before revegetation takes hold or other long-term erosion control measures are installed.  There is no evidence before the Court of the time during which particular stretches of the ODC pipeline were exposed and lacking in revegetation or erosion control measures.  There is, however, evidence that revegetation was inadequate or incomplete in places either at or shortly before the Ocensa pipeline was laid; and, even in the short term, the ODC pipeline scar would have been vulnerable to the effects of torrential rain just as the Ocensa pipeline was later.  Even if all criticisms of the reinstatement and revegetation of the Ocensa pipeline were justified (which they were not) it strains credulity to assert that the effects of the Ocensa pipeline were as catastrophic as now alleged and that no soil loss, sedimentation or damage occurred as a result of the ODC pipeline.  That is not to be interpreted as a finding of fact; but it is a consideration that demands close attention to the factual (including observational) evidence of damage that is attributed to the Ocensa pipeline. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The fourth preliminary feature may in some respects act as a qualification of the third.  Soil loss and sedimentation are a function of the impact of erosive rain.  Therefore one of the critical factual questions is the amount of rain that fell on the Ocensa ROW (and, before it, the ODC ROW) while they were at their most vulnerable and as their vulnerability decreased with long-term measures and progressive revegetation.  The USLE calculation assumes an annual level of erosive rain leading to an annual rate of soil loss by virtue of the impact of that erosive rain on land having the other assumed (or proved) characteristics.  However, that annualised rate is not capable of being extrapolated with any confidence to shorter periods since actual rainfall is variable in intensity and duration both within particular seasons of the year and as between seasons.  Thus, for example, to apply the annualised assumption about rainfall erosivity to a period falling within the dry season is likely to overestimate the rate and volume of soil loss while the opposite is likely to be true if the annualised assumption is applied to a period falling within the wet season.  Neither the Claimants’ reworking nor those in Professor Morgan’s draft paper or Professor Monsalve’s exercise take this feature into account. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The end result of the Claimants’ reworking of the USLE on {C4/3.8/1366.4} is a series of daily soil loss volumes from the ROW (average annual soil loss per year [A] x area draining to the stream (ha)/365).  For the reasons just explained, even assuming that the average annual soil loss per year is reliable, this both overstates and understates the case to the extent of losing touch with reality: the actual daily soil loss volumes will depend upon actual daily rainfall; and, as a separate point, it is necessary to take account of the duration of the ROW’s exposure to rain in its assumed vulnerable condition (which includes the complete absence of long term erosion control measures).  By way of example, for the purposes of the revised stockpile calculations put in for closing submissions {C4/3.8/1361.1} the Claimants allege that the ROW was opened on LC39 on 29 November 1996 and that recomposition occurred on 15 March 1997, 103 days later<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="25">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> The Claimants’ reworked calculations related to the period after the pipeline trench had been backfilled until revegetation, which would be shorter {Day58/197:3} </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  That was during the dry season and there is actual evidence about rainfall during that period {C6/24.1/4} to the effect that adopting an annualised approach leads to an overestimate.  As I have already said, no account is taken of season or actual rainfall in the Claimants’ calculation of soil loss from the ROW at {C4/3.8/1366.4}.  The evidential point is not met by the Claimants’ submission that the actual annual rainfall exceeded what was assumed by Professor Morgan in his draft paper: what matters for present purposes is that adopting an annualised rate is an unreliable guide to what would actually have happened on site. </p>

Where land is cleared for construction work, typical annual rates are 1,000 to 10,000 t/ha”.  Dr Savigny said that he had no reason to doubt those rates for construction work, though he had not been able to find data that justified the range {Day37/174:5}.  At the extremes, these figures would lead to relative rates from 10 (1,000/100) to 100,000 (10,000/0.1), which is not of itself informative in attempting to determine what the relative rate would be on-and off ROW in the Ocensa cases. </p>

I reach that conclusion bearing well in mind that the USLE is an empirical equation that is widely used for planning and implementing erosion control measures and that its limitations are well documented.  My conclusion is further reinforced on the state of the expert evidence in the present case, not least because Dr Savigny’s mapping of land use and coverage and how it has changed with time convinces me that to adopt any overall figure for the condition of the basins is likely to be unreliable, even if reached on the basis of an assessment that is reasonable in principle, as was Professor Monsalve’s.  Reviewing the product of the various values for the C-factor as I have done in [692] supports the proposition that the relative rate of soil loss per unit of area from on the ROW will be orders of magnitude greater than from off ROW in the period shortly after construction;  but that is not in dispute: see [683]. </p>

Their justification for doing so was that the annual rainfall in the area of the Lead Claimants’ properties was greater than that assumed by Professor Morgan, so that using his figure was conservative.  Volume of rainfall is obviously of high importance, though it is not the sole determinant of the R factor, as appears from the text of Professor Morgan’s draft paper.  Dr Card in his worked example took an R factor of 1000.  It is not clear how he reached that figure, but it is not consistent with adopting 10183 without expert evidence in support.

In absolute terms, much of the terrain with which the present cases are concerned exceeded 20% steepness (see, in general, LC50 and LC74) while some cases involve gradients of less than that- see, for example, the position on LC54 where gradients on the property were generally 9-11%: see [933] and [986].

The Claimants submit that they have been conservative in taking Professor Monsalve’s original assessment of the length of the ROW that may contribute to sedimentation of the streams.  Thus the exercise states that the daily soil loss from the ROW area that drains into W1 on LC39 is 0.13 tonnes per day, that being 945 tonnes per annum (see the table at [688] above) divided by 365 to provide a daily rate x 0.05 (which is Professor Monsalve’s estimate of the contributing area of the ROW {H8.22/26/5752}).  I agree that the adoption of Professor Monsalve’s area is a conservative approach, but am not able to form any view of the extent to which it is conservative, for the reasons set out at [673] above.  The daily soil loss figures from the basin are said to be 1.28 tonnes (for 100% coverage) or 5.56 tonnes (for 80% coverage), which are unreliable for the reasons previously given.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The final stage in the exercise (again taking LC39 as the exemplar) is to apply sediment transport factors to soil coming from the ROW and the basins so as to arrive at a numerical value for the daily amount of soil arriving in the streams as sedimentation {C4/3.8/1366.5}.  For most streams the Claimants assume that either 100% or 90% of soil loss from the relevant part of the ROW will make it to the stream and that 50% from the basin will do so (that being Professor Monsalve’s figure).  For stream W1 the Claimants also work their example on the basis that either 25% or 3% of the soil lost in the basin will make it to the stream.  On these assumptions the Claimants arrive at a quantified figure (in tonnes per day) for daily sediment delivery from the ROW area and the basin that drains into each stream.  In most cases the resulting daily delivery from the ROW exceeds that from the basin.  The table below summarises the results for LC39 (excluding the 25 and 3% sediment transport factors for W1). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">For the reasons I have already given, these figures are not reliable either as indicators of relative or absolute rates of soil loss.  The parties recognised the Court’s wish to have reliable and quantifiable evidence about quantities of soil loss and sedimentation, but the Claimants’ reworked figures in submissions, though beguiling, suffer from two insurmountable flaws.  First,  they do not have a sufficient grounding in reliable expert evidence; and, second, the multiple variables that would apply in a given case mean that the Claimants’ reworked USLE, based as it is on constant assumptions, cannot be applied as quantitative evidence to individual cases – even to the extent of providing evidence of “orders of magnitude”.  The same applies to the response from the Defendant {C4/4.24/1456}, which was based upon the same assumptions and variables and which purported to show (or, as Mr Lewis put it, to give the “feel”) that the contribution of the ROW to sedimentation of streams between the opening of the ROW and the installation of long term erosion control works was a very small proportion of the contribution from the basin over the preceding 40 years, as explained at {Day60/153:22} ff.  Such a conclusion would be important for the Defendant’s case because of Professor Monsalve’s evidence that a continuous process of erosion in a drainage basin over time can have the same effect on a stream with a low transport capacity as the accumulation of sedimentation as a large deposit of sediment occurring over a short time {H8.21/25/5423}. I draw no quantitative conclusion from the Defendant’s calculations and do not rely on them in reaching my acceptance of Professor Monsalve’s opinion as set out below. </p>

Whether over time and in aggregate a basin will contribute more erosive soil loss and deposit more sediment in streams and on land than will come from the ROW in the relatively short period of its maximum vulnerability and progressive improvement will depend upon the size of the basin, the land use over time, and the period adopted.

The Claimants rely on damage (in the form of sedimentation) to streams happening “at the point at which they intersect the ROW or downstream (but not upstream)” {C4/3/212}ff.  Dr Tobon took samples to test the depth of sedimentation in the streams.  Conscious that the presence of sedimentation of itself did not prove its source, the Claimants’ hydrological evidence relied upon three lines of enquiry and analysis in particular to support the case that the sedimentation came from the ROW and not from background erosion.  The first was analysis of where and to what depths sedimentation was found, to try to substantiate the claim that sedimentation and damage was found on and downstream of the ROW but not upstream.  The second was to see whether there was a distortion of the width of the stream at the intersection with the ROW that would evidence damage during or shortly after construction.  The third was to analyse the water in the streams, because it was (and apparently still is) the Claimants’ case that sediment from the ROW had particular qualities that would reflect in the chemical analysis of the water.   </p>

However, this misses the point and merely asserts what the water quality evidence was intended to prove, namely that there was a difference in the chemical qualities of the water upstream and downstream of the ROW.

But you have to look at what point this deposit of sedimentation happened.  If it happened during a heavy rainfall episode, as happens in the area, of 250 or 300 millimetres in one hour, then the sediments could have been taken down, down the stream.  It is not so clear.  250/300 millimetres of rainfall may happen several times a year.  So that is a really heavy rainfall intensity, and in that way – that is a way in which the sediments could have left the Right of Way, gone down into the streams.  But also, with such high levels of rainfall, these streams would have been able to take the sediments down, and it wouldn’t necessarily have led to this major process of sedimentation.” {Day39/32:3} ff </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">On background erosion, Professor Monsalve’s opinion was that most of the streams on the Lead Claimants’ properties “have an inherently low flow and therefore a low transport capacity.  This is particularly the case in the dry season, and in many cases also in the rainy season.  As such material will accumulate when the stream’s transport capacity is exceeded, which occurs frequently as a result of the stream’s inherently low flow.  A continuous process of erosion in a drainage basin over time can have the same effect on the accumulation of sedimentation in a naturally low longitudinal sloped area of a stream channel as a large deposit of sediment occurring over a short time period.  Over a longer period of time, sediments accumulating as a result of the erosion in a drainage basin will form sedimentation which can be as significant as any sedimentation formed by a sudden deposit of sediment.” {H8.21/25/5423} at [10.45]-[10.46]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I am unable to accept as a general or universal proposition that the streams on Lead Claimant properties were able to cope with background erosion.  Once it is accepted that the depositing of sediment is a function of the carrying capacity of a stream and that most of streams have low transport capacity (to the extent that some are virtually or completely dry for periods at a time), it follows that sediment will be deposited with time, and I accept Professor Monsalve’s opinion to that effect.  Equally, I accept that in times of high rainfall, the transport capacity of a stream is likely to increase with increased volume and velocity of flow.  So the rainfall which strips soil from the ROW (and, for that matter, from the basin) and carries it towards the stream will at the same time increase the transportation capacity of the stream to remove it.  As that capacity is dissipated, either because the rain stops or because of conditions lower down, so fractions of the sediment will be deposited either within the confines of the stream or (if it has burst its banks) beyond (as illustrated by the photographs of flooding on LC54). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The hypothesis that sedimentation downstream of the ROW will be greater than sedimentation above it is consistent with a mechanism of rainfall stripping soil from the ROW and transporting it downhill.  The hypothesis that sedimentation at the point of intersection with the ROW will be greater than sedimentation above it requires more careful thought.  The DVD and factual evidence shows that, on occasions, the ROW would slope down to the banks of a stream, with the trench for the pipeline being excavated on the approach, through the stream and up the other side.  Where that happened, soil could flow along the ROW as it sloped down into the stream, but the relevant area of the ROW, and therefore the quantities entering the stream, would be relatively small though not negligible (as Dr Savigny accepted in answering questions relating to La Enix on LC39).  In other cases the wider topography may have included an element of slope in the direction of the stream even though there may also be an element of slope downhill (and downstream), as illustrated by Dr Gundlach in his criticism of Professor Monsalve’s original work.  There were some cases (of which the streams on LC54 may have been examples) where the potential impact on the streams was reduced or removed by boring under the stream bed so that the disturbed ROW stopped short of the stream.  All of these features would affect the likelihood and extent of soil from the ROW entering the stream at the very point of intersection rather than downhill and downstream.   </p>

However, I do not accept that the existence of sedimentation at the intersection of a stream with the ROW is necessarily evidence that the sedimentation has come from the ROW.  It may, depending upon the specific circumstances of the stream in question, be attributable wholly or in part to deposition of sediment from further upstream caused by the particular lie of the land at that point – it being common ground that one of the features that may cause a stream to deposit sediment is when its downward slope reduces and a stream passes over a relatively flat area. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Although not made entirely clear, the hypothesis that sedimentation at the intersection with the ROW will be greater than above is also based (at least in some places) on the expectation that soil will be deposited directly in the course of the construction works.  This appears from [4.5] of Dr Tobon’s original report where he wrote that “... soil that is removed during civil works for roads and pipelines is carried by water to the drainage zone or stream channel.  This sediment generally enters the stream channels rapidly and in large volumes, <span style="font-style:italic">particularly during rainfall events</span>.  When such deposition of soil takes place, in large volumes over a short time, the accumulation of sediment in the stream channel is generally permanent, especially if the stream has a very low discharge, with no capacity to carry materials away.  This means that very little of the sediment can be moved by the water flow or discharge of these streams.  In these cases, it is common to observe an accumulation of sediment in the stream channel, with a thin sheet of water running over the top of the sediment” (emphasis added) {H7.3/3/620}.  The use of the word “particularly during rainfall events” clearly contemplates that the process here being spoken about may happen without the influence of rain.  In my view, this mechanism for sedimentation at the intersection with the ROW is both plausible and consistent with the evidence of Professor Monsalve because it may involve the rapid deposition of an amount of soil or sediment without a corresponding flow of water that would both carry it to and clear it downstream from the point of intersection with the ROW.  I therefore accept that one of the reasons why there may be sedimentation at the point of intersection of the ROW could be that soil has been deposited in the stream at that point directly in the course of construction activities.  It cannot be assumed that this happened at every stream crossing and the extent to which it happened would be a function of good or bad construction practices. </p>

The agrological evidence (either taken alone or in conjunction with the other evidence in the case) contributes to the conclusion I have expressed elsewhere that there was variation in the quality and effects of the pipeline works along the length of the pipeline.  Equally importantly, for the reasons that follow and unless otherwise stated, I do not consider that the agrological evidence on particular farms on its own justifies generalised findings about the state of the ROW over its entire length on that farm.

The strength of Dr Obando’s approach was that he maximised the possibility of finding a soil profile that had been disrupted by the pipeline works, based on his initial observations; its weakness was that he maximised the possibility of natural variation because of distance.  The strength of Professor Montenegro’s approach was to minimise the possibility of natural variation because of distance; what it did not do was to aim to identify the “worst” bits of the ROW and see what lay underneath.  Whether that was a weakness depends upon whether one wants to form a view of the overall state of the ROW or to maximise the chance, given a limited number of samples, of finding clear evidence of soil disturbance on the ROW and differences between what is found on and off ROW.  The Defendant accepts that Professor Montenegro’s sampling sites are not representative of sub-surface conditions of the eroded parts of the ROW {C4/4.7/393} at [88].  It is clear that Dr Obando’s sampling sites are also not representative of conditions on and off ROW as a whole. </p>

I accept that Professor Montenegro did his best to select sampling sites that were reasonably representative of the non-eroded conditions of the ROW, but also bear in mind his recognition that it would have been better to have had more sites in order to gain a reliable representative view overall {Day41/33:9}.   </p>

Since Dr Obando did not even attempt to obtain samples that were representative of the condition of the ROW as a whole, there would have been no justification for extrapolating from his results to assert generalised conclusions about the state of the ROW as a whole even if he had taken more samples than he did.  The small numbers of samples taken only serves to emphasise that it cannot be justifiable to extrapolate from any set of data including Dr Obando’s results to support conclusions about “the whole length of the ROW” either along the stretch of the ROW with which Ocensa litigation is concerned or along the stretch of the ROW within a particular property.   </p>

This applies to the purported identification of trends of individual results and to conclusions based upon taking the averages of individual results.  The practice of averaging results itself needs considerable caution because different results were frequently taken at or between different depths which would be expected to lead to differences in results in any event.   </p>

The allegation was, quite rightly, not put to Professor Montenegro in cross-examination and was not maintained in closing submissions.  It should not have been made by Dr Obando in the first place, should not have been persisted with and should have been withdrawn unequivocally by Dr Obando when given the opportunity.  The second criticism was to assert the possibility of a “border effect” which may have given rise to cross contamination of his off ROW samples by being on the border of the ROW {H3.8/16/1853}.  I accept that Professor Montenegro chose his off ROW sites in the way he described and with the assistance and guidance of Dr Savigny.  I am not persuaded that there is substance in this criticism.  There is however, substance in the Defendant’s observation that, having alleged in his First Supplemental Report that Professor Montenegro’s LC74 results were affected by border effect (at which time Dr Obando apparently thought that the results were adverse to the Claimants), in his Third Supplementary Report (by which time he had realised that Professor Montenegro’s results could be seen as supporting the Claimants’ case) he wrote of the same sample that “in this particular case, Professor Montenegro probably took samples from representative sites on/off ROW in such a way as to avoid the border effect, which is not surprising given the fact that this is one of the farms located next to farm LC61 which is one of the farms where Professor Montenegro agrees that there was a mixing/inversion of soil horizons” {H3.10/20/2333} cf {H3.8/16/1856}.

Two particular instances of the problem arose with Dr Obando.  First, in his third report at [2.3.1.4] he said that “[i]n the ROW, sites affected by erosion that had been previously identified by Dr Geoff Card were evaluated” {H3.9/18/2120}.  Yet when asked what reliance he placed on reports, draft reports or information supplied by Dr Card he first said that he had not relied on any such information and that Dr Card had not pointed out to him any areas of erosion on the ROW, following that with a further and unsatisfactory answer to the Court {Day30/10:1}.  I was left with the clear impression that the sentence in his third report was simply wrong.  Second, and more seriously, in his fourth report he made extensive references to Dr Card’s fourth report.  Specifically, at [6.2.4.1]ff he recorded his observations of soil deposits on LC39 and stated (at [6.2.4.8]) that “the deposits of soil I saw on this property are consistent with the stockpile loss described in section 4.1 of the Additional Material Report of Dr Card …” {H3.10/20/2324}.  However, when cross-examined, he was unable to give any satisfactory evidence about whether he had or had not read Dr </p>

Had he read Dr Card’s report, with its grossly excessive estimates of soil loss, he should and would have realised that those estimates were inconsistent with his own observations, as recorded in his report.  I am therefore left with the choice between finding that he referred to Dr Card’s report in the terms set out above when he had not read it or that he had read it but failed to appreciate that Dr Card’s estimates were inconsistent with his observations.  In the light of his unsatisfactory evidence in crossexamination, I find that he had not read Dr Card’s report. </p>

The general thrust of his evidence was consistent and was that the area of the ROW was less productive than the surrounding areas because of “compaction due to densification (increase in the soil bulk density), loss of total porosity, loss of organic matter and drop in cationic exchange capacity” {H3.5/5/1009}.  Central to his evidence was that the structure of the soil on the ROW had been changed by mixing, inversion and compaction.

At {H3.5/5/1119} he provided two tables setting out the physical properties of the soils found on LC74 on his first and second visits respectively.  He had mis-recorded results in the table, which may have been simple error, as may have been some of the numbers recorded in the course of his averaging of data in Tables 5 and 6 at {H3.10/20/2329}.  Of much more concern was that his results for soil density on the second visit were recorded as 1.23 g/cm³ off ROW and 1.38  g/cm³ on ROW.  Dr Obando purported to apply the classification of Lal (1994) – of which more later – which, for bulk density can be represented as follows: </p>

This was clearly inappropriate given the ranges proposed by Lal and supposedly adopted by Dr Obando; and it was evidently wrong to the detriment of the Defendant.  In an unsatisfactory passage of his oral evidence {Day32/49:12} ff, Dr Obando singularly failed to answer the question whether he had realised that his rounding of the figures had placed the on ROW figure into a higher category of limitation; he gave an inadequate and wrong explanation for why he had not rounded other numbers that appeared in the same paragraph of his report; and he gave a near incomprehensible series of answers about whether Lal either permitted or required rounding in such circumstances.  I formed the clear impression at the time, which re-visiting the evidence has confirmed, that when giving evidence Dr Obando understood precisely what he had done and was not prepared to admit it.  He should have appreciated the potential significance of what he was doing when he wrote the report; but I am not satisfied that he did, or that the bias in his presentation of the figures was knowing at that stage. </p>

This approach was flawed for a number of reasons.  First, the number of samples was so low as to make the detection of any trends a dubious exercise.  Second, if this approach was to be adopted, it was essential that all results be taken into account.  Yet Dr Obando arbitrarily excluded some results as being anomalous when there was insufficient material on which to determine what was a trend and what was an anomaly.  Where he did so, the excluded results tended to be those that would not support the Claimants’ case.  On occasion he suggested that it was acceptable to exclude one result out of three if he felt that the excluded result fell outside “the general trend” {Day31/122:23}; but this ignored the fact that he did not have sufficient samples to establish satisfactorily a general trend for the ROW as a whole or for the ROW on the properties being considered.  On other occasions he suggested that the omission of results may have been an oversight e.g. {Day31/122:16}.  Neither of these explanations is satisfactory and no satisfactory explanation was provided. </p>

Tests of bulk density and porosity are standard and objective tests for compaction and are universally recognised as such {H6.3/10/698} {Day32/74:24}.  In his first report, Dr Obando adopted bulk density as a prime marker of compaction and, where his bulk density results were favourable to the Claimants, relied upon them.  However, in his second report he adopted a new approach, by reference to the work of Lal, by which he attempted to assess the “sustainability” of soils {H3.8/16/1892}ff.  This work led him to conclude that the Ocensa pipeline affected the sustainability of the soil on the ROW by varying degrees of intensity.  He concluded that off the ROW the soil “varies between highly sustainable and sustainable” while on the ROW is “varies between sustainable with high technological input and unsustainable” {H3.8/16/1896}. </p>

This is based on a part of agrology: the properties.  But to make sure that [the soil] is sustainable, the agronomy must be taken into account” {Day41/101:7}.  Dr Obando cited a 1994 paper by Lal as the foundation for his approach.  Throughout the paper, Lal makes clear that his objective is to “develop criteria and methods for quantitative assessment of sustainable use of soil and water resources” {H6.3/10/655}.  He emphasises repeatedly the need for objective criteria.  Thus, for example, “the concept of sustainability, useful and relevant as it is, needs to be made quantitative, objective and reliable” {H6.3/10/655}; and “it is important, therefore, that objective and science-based criteria are developed and standardised for quantitative assessment of sustainability” {H6.3/10/725}.  He identified reproducible methods for assessing depth to root penetration {H6.3/10/699} and soil physical indicators e.g. {H6.3/10/691} {H6.3/10/693} {H6.3/10/697}; and he tabulated objective criteria for soil quality assessment (including bulk density) at, for example, Tables 18 {H6.3/10/695}, 29 {H6.3/10/711} and 37 {H6.3/10/717}.  Table 37 provided “an example of summation of weighting factors for 10 relevant critical indicators” and Table 38 provided a cumulative rating index based upon the 10 soil indicators identified in Table 37. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">What Dr Obando did was different in three highly material respects.  First, he introduced three new criteria, none of which was susceptible to objective measurement.  The three new criteria were (a) Appearance of Structure (“ES”), (b) Appearance of root depth (“PR”) and (c) Appearance of internal structure of aggregates (“EIA”).  Second, he constructed a table with numeric values for 7 criteria (as opposed to the 10 in Lal’s Table 37) including his 3 new ones.  Third, he adapted the sample rating index from Lal’s Table 38 which he then applied to the 7 criteria which he had selected.  The numeric differences between the two rating index tables are summarised below.  In general terms, Dr Obando has reduced Lal’s index figures by 30% which is in proportion to the reduction of criteria from 10 to 7: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Lal does not support the introduction of Dr Obando’s subjective criteria, and their inclusion is inconsistent with Lal’s goal of achieving reproducible objectivity.  Furthermore, the weighting to be attributed to Dr Obando’s subjective criteria when compared with the other criteria that he retained or excluded from those identified from Lal is neither explained nor demonstrated.  This matters because it is not selfevident that (for example) the subjective appearance of root depth should carry the same weighting as a contributing criterion as should rooting depth determined by the core break method (discussed and used by Lal) or as should bulk density.  The same objection can be levelled at Dr Obando’s weighting (on a scale of 1-5) when assessing each of his subjective criteria.  Lal’s paper, when introducing his Tables 37 and 38 counsels that “site-specific empirical relationships should be established between cumulative rating indices and one or several indices of sustainability discussed in another section of this report” {H6.3/10/716}.  That was not done.  The result is therefore a subjective and unproven composite methodology and rating index based on criteria that depart markedly from those proposed by Lal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dr Obando’s justification for his work was that he had introduced criteria that were likely to change on disturbance of the soil.  And he referred to a paper by Manichon and Gautronneau {H3.10/21T/2377.9} which provided a three-fold categorisation of the appearance of clods of earth (which Dr Obando adapted and applied for his criterion EIA).  Professor Montenegro agreed that an analysis adopting Manichon’s methodology “is a useful analysis to make in the context of this case” {Day41/107:16}; but that agreement falls far short of being an endorsement of Dr Obando’s incorporation of the Manichon categorisation into his adaptation of Lal’s work or as determining the weighting to be applied and the internal score (1-5) when EIA was incorporated into the altered rating index table. </p>

Taking just the four trial cases the divergence between the on and off ROW numbers for the four non-Obando criteria (bulk density, total porosity, basic infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity) and for the three Obando criteria (ES, PR and EIA) respectively in Dr Obando’s table at {H3.8/16/1895} is remarkable:</span>

There is a wealth of evidence to the contrary and I find that his unwavering conviction on this point was wrong.  I do not imagine that all of the evidence that is available to the Court would have been available to him: for example, there is no reason to suppose that he knew of the concerns expressed at the public meetings held before the Ocensa pipeline was laid, or that he knew of the multiple settlement agreements that Lead Claimants had entered into on the basis that the ODC ROW had caused them to suffer damage.  It may also be the case that Dr Obando would not have known and need not have realised that the processes used on the ODC ROW would have been highly likely to cause at least some disturbance to and deterioration of the soil.

The Defendant makes trenchant criticisms of his selection of the location of the CF54 trial pit and whether the LC93 trial pit results support his conclusions: see {C4/4.7/422}.  But even if I were satisfied that there is nothing in those criticisms (which I am not), any consideration of the photographic record as a whole shows that the ODC ROW was clearly visible because it had not fully recovered by the time the Ocensa ROW was laid.  The aerial photographs showing CF54 in 1995, 2002, and 2009 illustrate the point.  The ODC pipeline is clearly visible for much of its length on CF54 in the 1995 photograph because of a relative lack of vegetation {L1/143/143}, including but not only towards the North-Western and South-Eastern boundaries.  In 2002 {L1/258/258} the ODC pipeline remains visible, most clearly towards the NorthWestern Boundary.  Some erosion and lack of vegetation remains visible on the 2009 photograph {L2/474/474}.  </p>

At [7.2.10] Dr Card refers to a report on the actual condition of the ODC ROW prepared by Bateman Ingeneria Ltd, which he references as disclosure document D0001849.  He summarises part of the report by saying that it “identified that geotechnical erosion control protection works on the ODC ROW were destroyed in the area of LC50, LC61, LC74 and LC82 by soil erosion causing large gulleys and rills to form which presumably undermined the ditch diverters and other geotechnical erosion control and drainage measures.  From the documented photographs in the [Bateman] report large erosion gulleys can be seen in the ODC pipe trench itself where the backfilled material has been washed out of the trench.”  The relevance of this report, with its specific references to damage occurring on LC50 and LC74, is obvious.  Disclosure document D0001849 is at {K6/22} and {K6/22T}.  It is in fact </p>

Viewed overall, the criticisms to which I have referred lead me to conclude that I do not share Dr Obando’s apparent certainty in the correctness of his opinions or his readiness to dismiss evidence and opinions that did not coincide with his own.  I am not, however, compelled to dismiss his opinions wholesale or to discount the primary evidence acquired in the course of his investigations. </p>

The risks inherent in laying pipelines were well known to all: see [319]ff.  The methods that were to be adopted during construction were adequate and included separation of Horizon A and the avoidance of mixing or inversion: see [753].  They were not likely to be materially influenced by further or better soil surveys, particularly in the light of Dr Obando’s general acceptance recorded at [291] above and my finding that the summaries to which I there refer are accurate general descriptions of the soils on the Lead Claimants’ properties.  The construction team at least attempted to implement those methods, as appears from the evidence of Snr Gasca and photographic and video evidence.  This finding is not undermined by the confusion in some of the Defendant’s evidence about what constituted Horizons O or A: the construction process was intended to remove the topsoil and store it separately.   </p>

In support of their proposed Finding 95 the Claimants rely upon Professor Montenegro’s acceptance that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn was that construction of a pipeline had caused the soil mixing he observed in LC74 {Day41/45:3}.  Two points must, however, be borne in mind: first, that what matters is the extent to which mixing of soils was damaging for the Claimants; and, second, that Professor Montenegro’s acceptance does not relieve the Court of the need to determine whether damaging soil mixing occurred with the contruction of the ODC pipeline, the Ocensa pipeline, or both.  There was variability in the quality of workmanship such that questions of not attempting to separate Horizon A topsoil or mixing horizons must be considered case by case on the basis of specific evidence.  It also appears (e.g. from the evidence relating to LC54) that specific consideration was given to when and how to revegetate.  There is no evidence that soil studies were undertaken after construction but before revegetation to identify the condition of the soils, but the evidence does not justify a finding that the failure to undertake such soil studies was itself to be regarded as negligent.  What matters is what was done to revegetate and whether the steps taken from place to place were adequate.  That must again be the subject of specific consideration rather than simplified generalisations. </p>

This finding is circular in its reasoning; but it is common ground that, if construction soil leaves the ROW, where it comes to rest will be determined by local topography.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Claimants’ proposed findings 100 and 101 can be taken together.  Proposed Finding 100 is that “the quantity/quality of the vegetation cover on the ROW is now generally poor compared with the cover off the ROW or on the comparative farms” {C4/3.5/421}.  Proposed Finding 101 is that “the damaged soil was less fertile and more erodible” {C4/3.5/422}.  It is common ground that mixing and inversion result in the topmost layer of soil having reduced organic content.  If the organic content is reduced below about 4% the soil becomes less fertile (with the drop-off in fertility occurring at a faster rate below 2% {Day44/44:8}, and see references at {C4/4.7/525} [97]).  Reduction in organic content can therefore have two main adverse effects.  First, the soil structure itself may degrade so that root penetration decreases and susceptibility to erosion increases {H3.10/22/2378}.  Second, ground cover may be adversely affected by reduced fertility, which again may lead to increased susceptibility to erosion.  While making the point that fertility of soil is dependent upon the availability of nutrients as well as upon organic content, Professor Montenegro agreed with these propositions at {Day41/64:25} ff.  In general terms, it may be said that the results for organic material on the ROW have a tendency to be lower than those off the ROW.  For the reasons already given, I am unwilling to extrapolate from the specific to the general; but I accept that, if samples were otherwise comparable and not subject to variation caused by distance or other intervention, reduced organic content on the ROW when compared with content off the ROW is evidence that may support a finding that the soil on the ROW has been damaged.  To identify the cause of the damage requires further investigation on a case by case basis. </p>

The process he described was that trees that were to be sold would be removed, then materials that are not for sale would be removed, and then the land is burnt.  The extent of any erosion that follows will be dependent upon developments in floor cover after the trees have been cut down and the land has been burned {Day41/130:1} ff.

At the most superficial level, they may cause superficial erosion along cattle trails which may then lead to further erosion with the impact of rain on exposed soil.  I accept Dr Obando’s evidence that “in the long term, the driving of cattle leads to the formation of paths, characterised by the lack of vegetation, and areas that have been eroded generally into channels and gullies” {H3.8/16/1920}. There is a wide variety in the extent of cattle trails and any associated erosion that may be found: see {H3.4/4/761} and the illustrative photographs at {H3.4/4/762}.  The area of a single cattle trail is much smaller than the area of the ROW, though on some farms extensive cattle trails give the impression of relatively widespread exposure of soil: see, for example, the area generally shown at {H2.3/3/782}.  The impact of the hooves of cattle may also cause surface compaction, but not to the same depth as repeated passages by heavy machinery {Day41/98:10}.  The thickness of compacted layers due to transit of tractors and tillage implements ranges between about 10 and 15 centimetres (though that is not clearly shown in the illustrative drawing at {H3.8/16/1910}) {Day41/9:13}.  Photographs taken on LC9, LC39, LC61 and LC74, for example, illustrate a deeper compaction caused by the transit of machinery on the ROW during the stage of re-filling or soil restoration, which is manifested by the deformation of soil structure.  Compaction such as that illustrated in those photographs has drastic implications for the water dynamics and the depths of roots {H3.8/16/1910} {Day41/99:20}.   </p>

Specifically, the prevalence of references in Dr Velez’ first report to other experts’ reports which he had accepted on the say-so of others (itemised at {H5.7/26/1842}) is a direct and extensive contradiction of his expert’s declaration that he had not included anything in his report that had been suggested to him by others without forming his own independent view of the matter.  I also accept the Defendant’s submission that Dr Velez’ second report appears to be stylistically different from his first in a way that suggests the input of lawyers.  While recognising that I have only read his reports in translation and that Dr Velez did not provide for his second report a document similar to {H5.7/26/1842}, this apparent stylistic divergence adds to the uncertainty about what parts of his reports are truly his work and what was provided to him by others.  This uncertainty is particularly acute in relation to the many parts of his reports where Dr Velez appeared to express clear opinions on causation of damage to the Claimants’ land, for the simple reason that Dr Velez gave evidence (which I accept) that: </p>

To that extent Dr Velez had an advantage, because due weight must be given to statements he made in the course of his evidence about practices in the particular region.  But that advantage can be stretched too far.  For example, while I accept the general proposition that farmers have been working their land in the region for 60 years or more since the onset of substantial deforestation, and that they have a detailed knowledge of their land accumulated over the years, it is stretching things too far to assert or conclude that all farmers through whose land the pipelines passed engaged in best practice in the management of their lands at all time.  While recognising the relative disparity between the experts’ knowledge of the particular region, I found both agronomical expert witnesses to be impressive and to contribute important evidence. </p>

In his first report Dr Velez said that shifting agriculture with fallow periods between one harvest and the next sowing “requires an area four times (and up to 10 times) the size of the area planted” {H5.3/4/582}.  In his second report he relied upon his field experience which, he said, had shown him “that the rest period can be between four and ten years, depending on the levels of productivity expected; in any event there is no deterioration of the ecosystem” {H5.7/10/1543}.  Implicit in this evidence is the tension that may exist between economic, environmental and social considerations.

Thus, for example, he said that indigenous communities, “who rotate and leave fallow periods of 20 or 30 or 40 years”, may allow their land to recover “to a point where they can actually grow two or three crops again, successfully” {Day 43/96:7}.  Dr Velez recognised the tensions that may exist and said that “the most intensive [pattern of rotation] that is available, given the resources that they have, is to use it in a three or four-year cycle.  Other than that, if they would do it in another way they would need other resources and without them it would put the sustainability of the land in jeopardy” {Day 33/78:9}.  Taking the evidence of the experts as a whole, I find that the most intensive pattern of rotation (adopting the shifting agriculture techniques commonly used by campesino farmers) that can be adopted without a severe risk of irreversible damage to the soils is a four (or possibly three) year cycle.  That is the pattern that was typically adopted by the Claimants.  I find that operating at this most intensive end of the spectrum carries with it a significant risk (but not certainty) of deterioration and irreversible damage.  Whether or not the adoption of a four (or possibly three) year cycle will lead to deterioration of individual Claimant’s lands would depend upon a number of factors that would vary from place to place, such as topography, original state of the soils, and the nature of the crops that were grown.   </p>

The techniques are described by Dr Velez at {H5.3/4/593}ff and form the basis of good practice and economic efficiency where adopted by campesino farmers.  I am not persuaded either by the expert or the lay evidence in the case to assume that good practice was always followed.  In particular, I am not persuaded to make a general assumption that the Claimants all adopted agricultural practices that prevented deterioration of their land.  The state of any Claimant’s land before the laying of either the ODC or the Ocensa pipeline is not something that is susceptible to a generic finding. </p>

However, on the evidence at trial, most of the Claimants kept a part of their land for cropping.  A pattern emerged of farmers changing the use of parcels of land over time from forest to cropping to pasture, often replacing what had been cropping land but had been changed to be pasture by cutting down further areas of forest and bringing it into cultivation.  Conversely, there may be occasions when over-working of the land even for pasture may lead to deterioration, which may in turn cause the farmer to return pasture to fallow and secondary forest: on this point I accept Dr Uribe’s evidence at {H6.3/3/592} while recognising (as he did in cross-examination at {Day43/41:22} ff) that his apparently binary description of traditional indigenous and campesino versions of slash and burn agriculture is too simple and incorrect in failing to recognise a spectrum of behaviours depending upon many variables.  I accept the Claimants’ submission that “understanding the environmental impact of the Claimants’ farm management requires an enquiry into their particular agricultural practices as informed by their social background” {C4/3.5/452}. </p>

They rely upon the evidence of Dr Velez to support an allegation that the revegetation programme was negligently compiled in these respects.  I am not satisfied that it is within his expertise to give an opinion in support of a finding of negligence as he has never been involved with either the design or implementation of a large-scale revegetation programme for a large infrastructure project {Day33/24:22}.  I am confirmed in my view that Dr Velez lacks authoritative expertise in this area by the lack of realism in some of the opinions he expressed in this area, for example that the revegetation plan should not merely have considered the specific conditions at each farm but also the conditions of the different areas of the farm crossed by the pipeline {H23.1/4/270}.

The evidence establishes that revegetation of naked soil in the seasonal and geographical conditions that applied to the route of the pipeline was a challenging undertaking which, on the evidence, met with varying degrees of success, as it had done after the laying of the ODC pipeline.  The Agroforestry report prepared for Ocensa in December 1997 identified a need for new planting in some locations where there was found to be a complete lack of vegetation and in other partially planted locations “where planting was not technically correct, leaving too much distance between plants or where the system employed did not match the required parameters [criteria], such as cases of flat terrain that should be evenly planted and was done in rows” {K52/534T/6}.  Dr Velez gave evidence of places where his inspections revealed excessive gaps between planting, with 50cm or more between plants due to low sowing rates {H5.7/10/1518}.  Taken together, this evidence supports a finding that there were places where using inadequate quantities of seed or sowing too far apart (or both) led to inadequate coverage.  It does not support a finding that these failings were universal or that any identified area of no or partial coverage was attributable to such failings, and I make no such findings.   </p>

Even where there is specific factual evidence about what happened in a particular place, it has to be examined with care to see whether, and if so how, it fits with the case being advanced by the Claimants.  For example, Snr Mesa’s evidence at {Day7/8:9} ff  (which the Claimants rely upon in support of their case for a generic finding that grasses were not sowed adequately), when taken with the other evidence about his revegetation works includes at least three features of interest: he says he was not provided with sufficient seed, he was trying to sow in hard ground before the onset of the rains, and he was not paid for the work he did.  This evidence certainly supports a submission that there were difficulties connected with his revegetation works that might explain a lack of coverage; but it does not justify generic findings of failure to sow grasses adequately.

However, it is clear on all of the evidence that rates of revegetation are highly dependent upon variables including the time of sowing and the weather that follows.  Dr Uribe gave a detailed response to the question “how long after the completion of the construction process would you have expected the revegetation to have achieved complete coverage over the ROW” at {H6.3/4/573} which I accept as setting out how revegetation might progress in different circumstances and depending, mainly, on the weather conditions at planting and during the following months after germination.  Under optimal conditions (which he described as adequate moisture most of the time) and provided that cattle were not allowed onto the revegetated area, he would expect that the ROW should be 100% covered by protective vegetation (this includes grasses and “weeds”) at about the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> month after planting, assuming that the area was also fertilised as part of the revegetation scheme.  Under sub-optimal conditions he would expect that the ROW should be 100% covered by protective vegetation at about the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> month.  It is clear from his text that he does not regard 12 months as being an outside limit and, if he had done so, I would not have accepted his evidence.  Rather, the considerable variation that is evidenced in this case on both pipelines and within short distances leads to the finding that his proposed time-lines are ideals that may easily be rendered unfeasible by local factors.  When seen in this light, the assessment of revegetation in the Agroforestry report is not indicative of systemic negligence in the planning or execution of the revegetation programme (except to the extent discussed above), even though it highlights significant areas where the state of the revegetation calls for further work. </p>

These factors impose limitations on the extent or power of any conclusions that can be drawn from the composite sample results and any direct comparison with the results of the Bateman survey, as the Defendant recognises {C4/4.7/524}.  Dr Obando went much further, alleging that Dr Uribe had sought sites “in which there was no apparent mixing and/or inversion, which is probable on the edges of the ROW where samples were taken” {H3.8/16/1860}, an allegation of (knowing) bias that, having read, heard and seen Dr Uribe’s evidence, I reject completely. </p>

And, provided the comparison is taken as a high level of generality, his results corroborate what was diagnosed by the Bateman survey “(i) that the soils are generally acidic or very acidic; (ii) that high Aluminium toxicities are frequent; and (iii) that most essential nutrients are very frequently deficient, with the general exception of Iron and Manganese that are naturally abundant and occasionally toxic to plants in extremely acidic soils” {H6.1/1/50}.  The Bateman study is agreed by Dr Obando to be the closest evidence in relation to the fertility status of the soils of the area before the construction of the Ocensa pipeline {H23.2/6/381} and this assessment is broadly non-controversial.  I find it to be reasonable and correct: and see [289]ff above. </p>

This pisciculture is characterised by self-managed small scale production with the aim of selling the produce autonomously or in business with other entities of a similar nature.  The scale of production is low, and the management is simple.  The principal species that are bred are cachama negra ..., hybrid cachama ... and tilapia roja at a stock of less than 4 fish/m², giving supplementary feed, usually agricultural by-products from the same farm and/or commercial fish feed. ... There are three types of pond that are used in rural, artisanal pisciculture: excavated, semiexcavated and dammed. ...  The areas of the fish ponds vary between 10 and 1000m² with water flowing in and out through hoses of PVC tubing having a diameter of 0.5 to 1.5 inches.”  Elsewhere he wrote that “the fish farming practised on the properties of the Lead Claimants is self-managed and of limited resources (artisanal pisciculture or of limited resources), for self-consumption with sales of some of the surplus” {H11/2/165} </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There was a dispute between Dr Atencio and Dr Henderson about the frequency with which sediment should be removed.  Dr Atencio said that he had observed cycles of two to three years between emptying, removing the sediment and refilling {Day45/64:10}.  Dr Henderson argued for a shorter period, suggesting that it may be necessary at the end of every six-month cycle of fish cultivation, and not limiting his answers to still-water ponds {Day46/133:18}.  I accept his evidence that where the flow of water out of the ponds is at surface or near surface level, it will have no impact on sediment that has sunk to the bottom, but I do not accept his evidence that complete drainage would either be necessary or customary at the end of each cycle – particularly in the low-technology subsistence approach being adopted by the Lead Claimants.  While I would put Dr Atencio’s estimate of a two or three year cycle at the upper end of the time-scale that would prove to be necessary, and consider that every six-months is at or below the bottom end, the evidence as a whole suggests that drainage and removal of sediment about once every one or two years would be necessary in normal circumstances, the exact length of the cycle being dependent upon the volume of sedimentation and the amount that would be removed by waterflow, each of which could be highly variable.  I also bear in mind that carrying out sediment removal is likely to involve or at least reflect a trade-off between investment in the state of the pond and productivity. </p>

The range of density varies between 1 and 4 fish/m² {H11/2/157}.  The average stocking density of cachama for Colombia is 1.54 fish/m² and for Antiquoia is 1.5 fish/m² {H11/6/450}. Density affects productivity: where a density of 4 fish/m² is exceeded the fish will not thrive, even where there is an adequate supply of water renewal {Day45/58:3}.  In extreme cases this can lead to fish dying, with the risk that dead fish may lead to total loss of stock as their decomposition consumes the available oxygen {Day45/59:13}.  There is no evidence of this having happened on any of the Trial Case properties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Stocking density is closely related to yields, which generated the main expert disagreement in this area.  The Claimants argue that it is possible to increase productivity and increase yield in fish ponds by increasing water renewal rates, and they submit that an article by Akifumi and Kubitza “validates as possible the water renewal theory relied upon by Dr Atencio” {C4/3.5/488}.  Dr Atencio’s water renewal theory was expressed in his first supplementary report where he supported the productivity rates claimed on behalf of the Lead Claimants on the basis that sufficient oxygen to permit the claimed productivity rates could have been provided by adequate flows of water from streams into the ponds {H11/6/401}.  The Akifumi paper is in four parts; the parties concentrated on Part 1 {H11/12/620}.  It appears to have been issued under the auspices of the Argentinian Directorate of Fisheries and, while being originally based on experience in Brazil, is adapted for Argentine conditions {H11/12/621}.

For present purposes, the theoretical support it provides is of general application.  The text and Table 5 at {H11/12/625} illustrate that where the supply of water into a pond is the sole source of oxygen for the water that is in the pond, high water renewal rates would be necessary to ensure the survival of the fish.  Table 5 does not expressly state the depth of the pond in question.  Instead, it estimates varying rates of emptying (expressed in l/s/ha) that would be required to sustain a given biomass (weight of fish - expressed in kg/ha) taking into account the oxygen demands of the fish, their feed and their faeces.  The rate of emptying is also expressed as the % of the volume of water in the pond that would be emptied per day.  As calculated in the table 30% emptying (i.e. water renewal at the rate of 52 l/s/ha) is required to sustain 4000 kg/ha of biomass, increasing linearly to 105% emptying/water renewal being required to sustain 14,000 kg/ha of biomass.  The proposed weight of fish that could be cultivated out of the pond is achieved by multiplying the sustainable biomass by the number of fish-harvesting cycles per year.  It is these figures that Dr Atencio relies upon in his support of the feasibility of the losses claimed by the Claimants. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">One of the points made by Akifumi in the cited passage is that the use of renewal water as the sole source of oxygenation is generally prohibited by virtue of water availability restriction.  The Claimants’ case is that their streams on sloping land provide security of water flow that removes this prohibition.  In principle I agree that if a stream provides a suitable and reliable supply of renewal water into the pond<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>then the general prohibition may be avoided, because it is common ground that flowing water is likely to be fully saturated with oxygen.  Technical questions remain to be answered on a case by case basis.  In some cases the pond is formed by damming the stream, so that the renewal of water will equate to the rate of flow of the stream, which will vary with the seasons.  In other cases, the pond is fed by a pipe taking water from the stream, in which case it is not to be assumed without question that the rate of renewal of the pond water equates to the rate of flow of the stream.  Dr Henderson was therefore right, when accepting (in answer to a question which elided a general proposition and specific reference to LC39) that it was theoretically possible for the fish farmer to achieve the water renewal rates set out by Akifumi, to add the qualification “at least at certain times of the year” {Day47/6:18}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dr Henderson relied upon a number of sources to support his view that 9,000-10,000 kilos/ha per annum is a reasonable upper estimate of likely production assuming reasonable levels of technological input and not the more basic operations that typify the Claimants’ fish cultivation.  His opinion was that 2,000-3,000 kilos/ha were more likely from a highly skilled farmer using an artisanal pond if the farmer was not using optimal cycles and 4,000-5,000 if strictly following optimal cycles: see {C4/4.7/545} at [72]-[74].  The Claimants’ major criticism of this evidence is to submit that the papers on which Dr Henderson relies are not relevant to the situation of the Claimants.  Specifically, the Claimants criticise his reliance on papers by St Paul and by Ruiz as being referable to fish farming in standing water and (in the case of Ruiz) being economic models as opposed to the estimations of biomass in the Akifumi paper: see {C4/3.5/488}.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I will consider these criticisms by reference to the Ruiz paper {H11/13/635}.  It is a 2009 doctoral thesis entitled “Economic Analysis of Rural and Artisanal Aquaculture in Ecuador” in association with two named universities, one of which is in Norway and one in Vietnam.  It was produced in the light of the Ecuadorian Government’s “proposal of investment for the Agriculture sector with the installation of ruralartisanal Aquaculture farms to support the economical development of low income families living of[f] short term Agriculture cycle[s]” {H11/13/640}.  It is therefore directed to a similar level of economic activity, for which reason alone the Claimants are correct to concede that there is a point of comparison with the present litigation.  The aim was to identify the likely economic benefit to those who took part in the proposed programme.  It did so by proposing economic models, but they were based upon working assumptions about the costs and scale of return that could be expected from participation.  Those working assumptions included that the pilot project was based on credits starting from US$1,500-2,000, which would (on the Claimants’ own case) be a significant level of investment for campesinos such as are involved in the present litigation.  The data required for the analyses was entirely provided by The Office of Projects &amp; International Cooperation of the Under-secretary of Aquaculture in Ecuador and the spreadsheets were actual summaries of the Rural-Artisanal Aquaculture Project Budgets from three specific cultivations: one polyculture cachama-tilapia, cachama monoculture and red claw crayfish {H11/13/665}.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Two observations may reasonably be made.  First, the type of water supply is not identified and few clues are provided.  All that can be said is that the few photographic illustrations do not appear to include a dammed stream or a pond that is obviously fed from a stream in a hilly area; and that a significant part of the starting budget is the cost of a 2” in/out water pump with slip unions having a five year useful life {H11/13/671}.  Second, the extent of oxygenation of the water in the ponds is not identified.  However, these objections may be overstated.  The absence of a nearby stream does not determine the renewal rate, and the presence of the in/out pumps indicates at least the possibility of their use for renewal and oxygenation purposes.  What does appear is that the figures are presented from a reputable governmental source as reasonable working models and not as absolute maxima. </p>

However, as a soundly based model developed for the purposes of estimating the potential profitability of rural-artisanal fishing, it has sufficient points of similarity to justify Dr Henderson’s use of it as supporting evidence for his opinion on likely productivity from the Claimants’ operations. </p>

That is true, and is an observation that works in favour of placing greater weight on Dr Atencio’s opinion.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Drawing these strands together, I conclude that the figures in Akifumi provide theoretical support for the biomass that could be supported with the projected levels of oxygenation provided by water renewal at the rates there set out.  To that extent they provide validation for Dr Atencio’s theory that oxygen starvation could be overcome by renewal water at the levels of production alleged by the Claimants.  They are not, however, evidence in support of the Claimants’ actual fish-farming practices; nor do the estimated figures purport to be an indicator of what levels of production might reasonably be expected from subsistence (or near subsistence) fish cultivation as practised by the Claimants.  Dr Atencio’s descriptions of the Claimants’ fish farming practises, which I have set out at [798]-[800] above, support the Defendant’s submission that yields will typically be low.  That submission also receives support from Dr Henderson’s evidence, which I have summarised at [807] above.  On all of this evidence, I accept the Defendant’s submission that achieving yields approaching the higher figures set out in Akifumi’s Table 5, requires considerable skill and attention from the farmer and, probably, a more scientific and technically organised approach to production than appears typical on the evidence in this case.  While I do not take Dr Henderson’s figures as fixed upper limits, I find that to achieve yields significantly over 10,000 kg/ha requires skill and attention from the farmers and that claims alleging yields approaching or more than twice that figure require careful scrutiny on a case by case basis.  An unskilful or casual farmer would be unlikely to achieve yields of 10,000 kg/ha. </p>

Between 1989 and 1999 there was a period of sustained growth, with tilapia being the largest contributor, followed by cachama, in part because of state support and programmes given to small-scale fish farming.  There was a sudden slump in production in 2000 for which the reasons are said not to be clear.  Three factors are suggested as contributing: first the economic crisis and recession in Colombia in 1999; second, public order problems affecting supply and production of fish; and third, the massive importation of tilapia primarily from Ecuador at throw away prices.  I accept Dr Atencio’s evidence that this collapse would primarily have hit those who were producing tilapia for sale (whether on an industrial or relatively smaller scale) harder than those whose dominant objective was to supplement their food supply and security {Day45/37:7}. </p>

The Legal Experts do not provide a detailed exposition of how or when the Court might take such a view in the case of the Claimants’ fishing ventures.  It seems to me that the most likely view that the Court would take would be to decide whether it was dealing with something that is in essence a commercial enterprise (in which case the fact that some fish was used for domestic consumption would not remove the need for a permit overall) or subsistence fishing (in which case the fact that small amounts were used for sale or barter would not generate the need for a permit).  Moving from the strictly legal to the strictly pragmatic, it is not obvious to me (and the Legal Experts do not explain) why the court should reduce the damages if a Claimant establishes that a Defendant has prevented him or her from achieving a modest supplement to their subsistence levels, with or without a permit.  I could understand the Court making the assumption for the future that the Claimant should and will obtain a permit (if appropriate) and deducting the cost to the Claimant of doing so: but that is not the way the case is put. </p>

A short while later in answer to a question from the Court he confirmed that he was not always sent the whole of his fellow experts’ reports, but what happened on occasions was that he had a particular area where he felt he needed information, and he would then ask for the relevant part of his fellow experts’ report which would deal with the information {Day50/24:2}. </p>

Please identify which draft reports and other documents you reviewed for each expert, by reference to date” {H20.4/9/851}.

As part of my instructions, I was provided with preliminary findings of some of the other Claimant experts..  I confirm that my findings in my report of June 2013 are based entirely on my own observations, investigations and analyses in the expert discipline of veterinary science.

As I have made clear elsewhere, there would be nothing reprehensible in the Claimants’ lawyers assisting a Colombian expert in the proper presentation of answers to questions submitted under CPR 35.6 – in fact, I would expect them to do so.  To that extent I agree with the Defendant’s submission that Dr Delgado’s answer that the form of the answer was not provided to him is implausible.  However, I do not consider that I would be justified in simply rejecting it out of hand.  That is not, however, the end of the matter, because even if the answer was all Dr Delgado’s own work, it should have been reviewed by the lawyers before going out and any review should have identified that the answer was unsatisfactory.

As my findings in relation to individual cases will make clear, I do not accept all of his evidence; and there are occasions when I find it surprising that he gave claims the support he did.  The example cited by the Defendant of Dr Delgado supporting an annual investment of 4 days to maintain a 100m length of post and barbed wire fence is an example of evidence that is not simply insupportable but surprising {Day50/43:6}.  But, while I suspect that Dr Delgado was too ready to endorse claims made by the Claimants without rigorous analysis, I am not satisfied that this requires his evidence as a whole to be downgraded as “unreliable”.  The Defendant’s proper interests are suitably protected by close attention to individual assertions made by Dr Delgado on a case by case basis.  Similarly, although Dr Delgado frequently made statements in his reports which appear to be opinions on causation that are outside his proper sphere of expertise, the limitations of his expertise are clear and the Court is well able to identify evidence that is outside its proper limits without applying a wholesale downgrading of his evidence as “unreliable”. </p>

His concerns were because of the adverse effects of overgrazing and lack of recovery time for the pasture, and they were not mentioned in his report in relation to LC39.

This on its own would only explain the loss of claimed loss of pig production until he had time to build a new pen.  Dr Delgado gave as an additional reason (which would explain a continuing loss of annual pig production) that “the current water source that he uses for domestic consumption and for the pigs does not have sufficient availability of water to sustain the same number of pigs, so he can only keep 1 or 2 pigs, which he currently uses for personal consumption.”  This explanation was inconsistent with what Snr Velez told him in interview, which was that his pigs had roamed loose, to which Dr Delgado’s reaction had been that pigs that are loose walk about and drink water “from wherever they feel like it” {H24.2/301.2/1432}; nor did Dr Delgado mention that Snr Velez had told him in the same interview that he now kept the same number of pigs as before the pipeline {H24.2/301.2/1437}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Claimants’ overarching attack on Dr Avila had three strands.  The first was based upon the similarities between his Supplemental Report {H21.9/13/1827} and the First Supplemental Report of Professor Montenegro {H4.9/10/1710}, to which I have already referred at [502] above.  The similarities in structure, format and parts of the content make inevitable the finding that Dr Avila must have been provided with at least the framework that is common to the two reports.  The fact that Dr Avila’s report refers to Dr Obando, who was relevant to Professor Montenegro’s report but not to Dr Avila’s, strongly suggests that Dr Avila received the framework after it had been worked on by or with Professor Montenegro, rather than the other way round.  However, with one exception to which I will return, the substance of Dr Avila’s report was evidence that was within his expertise and not the expertise of either Professor Montenegro or of the lawyers: it is the similarities in form and the reference to Dr Obando upon which the Claimants primarily rely to support their submissions.  The reference to Dr Obando is sufficient evidence to support my finding that the framework was provided to Dr Avila after it had been worked on by others.  Beyond that, however, it is merely evidence of uncharacteristically sloppy preparation.  The reference is out of kilter with the substance of the rest of the report, which makes clear that the reference should have at least been edited to refer to Dr Delgado rather than Dr Obando.  It does not of itself either suggest or demonstrate that Dr Avila was prepared to express opinions that were not his own or to present information without verifying it himself. </p>

With questions of impeccable clarity Dr Avila was asked whether he had written all of his reports himself.  He answered with equal clarity that he had {Day50/75:10}.  He was evidently non-plussed when confronted by the obvious similarities between the two reports and the congruence of their paragraphs 2.4, and gave a series of explanations that were obviously wrong, including a suggestion that there had been an error of translation (which, demonstrably, there had not) or that the similarities were pure coincidence (which I have found to be an impossible explanation).  When, after a passage of crossexamination that was notable for its fairness and effectiveness, Ms McGregor gave Dr Avila a final opportunity to recognise that part of his report had been drafted by the Defendant’s lawyers, he was again adamant in his answer “No. No. No part of my report was written by the lawyers of the defendant.

Making all allowances for the fact that I was listening to his evidence in translation, the closest possible attention to Dr Avila as he gave the evidence did not leave me at the time with the impression that he was lying.  Re-reading the evidence in its entirety, placing it in the context of his evidence as a whole, remembering the manner in which he gave the evidence, trying to audit my reaction by reference to the different conclusion I reached in relation to Dr Tobon, and taking the Claimants’ clear submissions fully into account, I remain unpersuaded that Dr Avila was knowingly not telling the truth.

The example cited in support is in a section of the Supplementary Report where Dr Avila is commenting on Dr Delgado’s methodology.  After pointing out that Dr Delgado did not appear to have made use of aerial photographs, he then wrote (at [5.8]): “I also note that, whilst Mr Delgado refers to having reviewed “various” parts of the Environmental Impact Assessment disclosed by Equion, he fails to identify those sections (or indeed the versions) which he has reviewed.

When cross-examined about this reference, Dr Avila at first said that he could not remember whether his [5.8] arose from commentaries received from the lawyers {Day50/83:8} and then said in answer to the question “Is it possible that paragraph 5.8 is not something that you had entirely written by yourself?” that “Well, that is the conclusion that I was reaching when I saw what Dr Delgado had written on the basis of the analysis he had read in the Environmental Impact Assessment.  So that is the conclusion I reached after reading what he had said, and when drawing his own conclusions.”  On the basis of this answer, which they correctly submit is inconsistent with the fact that Dr Delgado did not mention the Environmental Impact Assessment in the body of his report, the Claimants submit that “the nature of his argument in writing, and the complete misstatement of that argument when asked to explain in oral evidence, both point to this material not originating from Mr Avila’s own mind.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">This is, to my mind, a minor storm in a very large teacup that does not justify the time that has been invested in it.  Certain things are obvious to anyone familiar with this litigation.  First, the parties have attempted to leave no stone unturned in their attempts to secure legitimate forensic advantage.  Second, one of the features of that diligence has been that each side has gone through the other side’s reports with a very fine toothcomb.  Third, one of the things that has routinely been done is to analyse whether the opposing expert has material to justify the opinions he expresses.  This can be seen in the reply reports on both sides.  For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to Sections 5 of Dr Avila’s and Professor Montenegro’s supplemental reports.  Section 5 of Dr Avila’s report is headed “Comments in relation to Mr. Delgado’s report” and lists 15 topics which Dr Avila duly covers in detail.  Those topics include “(ii) the document review carried out by Mr Delgado; (iii) Mr Delgado’s review of the academic papers; ...” {H21.9/13/1851}.  Professor Montenegro’s Section 5 is headed “Response to Dr. Obando’s Report” and is similarly detailed, though his structure is different in not itemising the topics to be covered in advance.  The first topic, however, is “documents reviewed” and contains a detailed analysis of the documents that Dr Obando had or had not reviewed in the course of preparing his report {H4.9/10/1727}.  Leaving aside the similarity (but not congruence) of approach, there is no reason to assume either that Professor Montenegro (or, for that matter Dr Avila) worked on these sections of their respective reports unaided, or that they did not.  What is apparent is that the Defendant had taken the decision to analyse in great detail whether a documentary justification for the opposing experts’ views existed.  In that context, it is not surprising that Dr Avila picked up that Dr Delgado had not used aerial photography or that Dr Delgado had said that he had reviewed relevant (or various) parts of the Environmental Impact Assessment but had not identified which they were.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The third strand of the Claimants’ submission is an alleged concession about forage availability testing.  In his first report Dr Avila took samples of vegetation in order to assess the suitability of pasture for cattle.  He set out his approach at [6.13]-[6.19] {H21.4/4/857}.  As he there made clear, he selected samples from both on and off the ROW with a view to creating composite samples.  The end point of the exercise was that once the samples had been weighed that would provide “an indication of the productivity of the site when these figures were averaged across the sampling sites and extrapolated across the total area of pasture.  This would be used to calculate the number of animals that can be properly fed in such an area (the “load capacity” of that pasture).  By calculating the weight per square metre, this measure can be compared against the typical weight for the same variety of grass, known as the “forage standard” {H21.4/4/858} at [6.19]. </p>

The results were consistently presented in a table giving values for his on ROW samples, his off ROW samples and his chosen standard; and he would offer a commentary.  His tables were typically entitled “Comparison of forage availability of [Carimagua/etc] samples compared to the forage standard”, which is consistent with his explanation in [6.19].  In most cases, his commentary would be a comparison of his samples against the standard.  For example, writing about LC39 at {H21.5/5/1077} his commentary was “As can be seen from the table, the amounts of forage present both inside and outside the right of way are well below the 8.0 tonnes per hectare expected in properly managed pastures. ...”  There was in the case of LC39 no commentary on the relative values for his On ROW and Off ROW samples.   </p>

On this property Dr Avila wrote “[12.37] As noted in paragraph 6.19, forage sampling allows us to compare the availability of forage within a specific area.  This is distinct from the overall coverage of the pasture ... and its nutritional properties... .  [12.38] If I compare the samples of forage which I took (i) on the right of way, and (ii) outside the right of way ... it is clear that there is similar forage availability both inside and outside the right of way.  This forage availability corresponds to the forage production standard (the weight of forage that would be expected of such pasture in a good condition).  [12.39] The results of this testing indicate that there is no material difference between the availability of forage within the right of way and outside of it.  This is despite the fact that there is a greater availability of forage in the rainy season than in the dry season.”   </p>

That is what Dr Avila expressly did in every case where he took samples by the presentation of his results in standard format as described above.

Animal agriculture is frequently blamed for adverse effects on the environment.  However, the positive role of livestock in environmental conservation is rarely emphasised to the same extent.  The extent of impact from livestock on the environment, and whether the interaction is negative or beneficial, depends on the nature and level of management of the livestock concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">Viewed overall, the FAO report supports the view that taking tropical forests into cattle production is likely to cause erosion and loss of soil fertility.  The warning that pastures may only be sustained for short periods, up to ten years, if no fertilizer is used is stark and is indicative of the fragility of the land: on the evidence in this case, campesinos using the traditional extensive production system seldom use fertilizer – see, for example, [861.i)] below.  The report makes clear that adverse effects can be minimised by good management and husbandry, and that there may be some environmental benefits as well.  It also supports the view that there is a tension between the needs of production and the impact on the environment which requires careful management.  That is consistent with the view expressed in a paper by Mahecha and others {H20.6/34/2037} (of which more later) which lists among the limitations to achieving development in Colombian cattle farming “the extensiveextractive production, poorly defined production systems, inappropriate use of production technologies, <span style="font-style:italic">conflicts regarding water and soil use, poorly managed organic and inorganic waste</span>, … low business acumen of cattle farmers…” {H20.6/34/2046}.  In context, the words I have emphasised are a clear reference to the potential adverse impact of farming on the fragile environment.  This is made clear later in the paper where the author states: “Taking as a starting point the concept of the soil as a building block for agricultural and livestock activities, its use as an indiscriminate recipient of waste, without taking into account its dynamic, leads to a loss of its ability to regenerate and recycle organic products.  This can be seen in the progressive processes of erosion and compaction, as well as loss of hydric balance, salinisation, loss of fertility, nutrient excess, presence of heavy metals, and the alteration of the microbiological conditions, amongst other aspects.  Erosion is mainly caused by the high pressure exerted by grazing, by overgrazing and the development of cattle farming on unsuitable land, while compaction is directly associated with loss of structure and a drop in the water retention capacity” {H20.6/34/2044}. </p>

Large swathes of the mapped area are categorised as Red, which signifies “Soils specially fit for conservation of the wildlife and/or protective vegetation: where the topographic and edaphic conditions so allow, cattle raising can be carried out with practices of soil protection management and conservation.”  This categorisation covers LC74 and, probably, LC50.  The next category is blue / dark green, which signifies “soils fit for extensive and semi-intensive cattle raising and agriculture and protective producing vegetation.  In the areas where the erosive processes are more evident, soil conservation works must be implemented, as well as in sections with greater incline and erosive processes.”  The next category is orange, which includes LC39 and LC54 and signifies “soils fit for extensive cattle raising, subsistence agriculture in the areas where the relief is less strong and protection coverage in more inclined and/or degraded areas, where soil conservation works must be implemented.”  The best category is green, which signifies “soil fit for extensive and semi-intensive and intensive cattle raising and agriculture in the best drained sections.  It is necessary to develop adaptation activities such as drainage in the [areas] susceptible to flooding and waterlogging.”  Each of these categorisations carries with it the implication that care will be required to be taken in conducting cattle raising or other agriculture; and the lower three categories (which make up the majority of the mapped areas) refer to the greater vulnerability of sloping, degraded or eroded land, to the extent that land categorised as red indicates that, where topography </p>

That is consistent with all of the other evidence in the case about the nature of the soils and topography which are the subjects of this litigation.  It does not mean that cattle farming cannot be carried out on the land – plainly it is carried out extensively.  Nor do I find the use of the word “unsuitable” helpful except in relative terms: what all the evidence establishes is that the challenges of cattle farming on a sustainable basis increase with the fragility and lack of fertility of the soils.  Those challenges are further increased where the farming is carried out on sloping rather than flatter land.  Viewed overall, the challenges are liable to lead to the deterioration identified in the FAO Report and Mahecha and, where they do, farming on the deteriorated land will become progressively less sustainable. </p>

It is also common ground that herds will contain animals of different maturity, the exact mix of which will vary from herd to herd depending upon that herd’s rates of reproduction and the farmer’s management of his cattle, including his decisions about what animals to sell at any given time.  Dr Avila agreed as broadly correct Dr Delgado’s estimation of differing load capacities depending on the age and weight of the cattle {H20.5/11/1052} {H21.9/13/1841}.  He did not adopt Dr Delgado’s estimate that a herd would be composed of adult cattle without calves (40% of adult cattle) adult cattle with calves (60% of adult cattle), calves (same number as adult cattle with calves) and heifers (unspecified in numbers), preferring to rely upon direct evidence from the farmers as to the composition of their herds {Day50/161:14}.  His qualification was justified, though it is not always possible to identify the agedistribution of a particular Claimant’s herd, not least because it will fluctuate with time.

Dr Delgado’s estimate of relative weights (which was broadly accepted by Dr Avila) was: adult cattle without calves (350kg) 1 UGG; adult cattle with calves (525kg) 1.5 UGG; heifers (175kg) 0.5 UGG.

Mahecha’s paper was submitted in 2001 and accepted in 2002.  The table is described as an adaptation carried out by the authors of the paper, based upon a 2000 contribution to an FAO online conference by Gomez and others, a 1994 paper by Balcázar, and an (undated) interview with Professor Restreppo of the University of Antioquia.  None of these sources is in evidence before the Court.  Dr Delgado said at one point that what has been described as the revolution brought about by introducing new strains of more productive grasses, typically strains of Brachiaria, had not yet taken place by the time of Mahecha’s report {Day50/9:14}.

However, Dr Delgado later dated the revolution from when Brachiaria arrived in Colombia, with the smaller producers following the lead of larger producers in changing their grasses {Day50/67:15}.  That was clearly before 2001, as appears from the fact that Brachiaria was used for reseeding at least two of the Lead Claimant properties after the Ocensa pipeline, LC50 and LC54 {K52/534T/11} {K52/534T/25}. </p>

First, she did not refer to the “improved grass strains” in relation to the traditional extensive system: her reference to introduced grass strains described them as “low productivity grassland”.  Second, her description of the improved extensive system did involve the use of the new improved grasses - “improved grass strains are relied on alongside native or introduced legumes.”  The experts did not suggest that the improved grass strains being referred to in this context were other than those such as Brachiaria.  Despite evidence from Dr Avila to the contrary {Day50/169:18}, it would not be right to interpret Mahecha as meaning that her improved extensive grazing system only uses old, native and unimproved grasses.  Her description could cover the situation where there was a mix of old and improved grasses or exclusive use of improved grass strains under the improved extensive grazing system.  Based upon the evidence of use of Brachiaria grasses when revegetating Lead Claimant properties, which confirms that the arrival of Brachiaria grasses was well before 2001/2002, and the explicit description of the use of improved grasses in the paper, I reject the submission that Mahecha assumes the use of native grasses throughout. </p>

It is also common ground that improved grass strains, typically Brachiaria, have a greater carrying capacity than unimproved native grasses, such as Uribe, Carimagua and Panameña.  Although not expressed as an expert agreement, I find that the descriptions of the systems described by Mahecha and adopted by the experts are not set in stone and that each categorised system may comprehend a range of farming practices: for example, although Mahecha does not refer to the use of improved grasses in the traditional extensive grazing system, there is no reason why a farmer who is generally to be described as within the traditional extensive grazing system should not sow some improved grasses.  This is implicitly recognised by the Defendant in its detailed submissions about the load capacity of Brachiaria grasses in the context of the traditional extensive grazing system {C4/4.7/567}.  There are therefore two points of interest: the theoretical difference made by introducing Brachiaria in place of unimproved native grasses, and the likely productivity and load capacity of farmers adopting the traditional extensive grazing system or the improved extensive grazing system respectively.  The points are not the same, because the productivity of particular grasses within a particular system will depend upon the other variables to which I have referred at the start of this paragraph. </p>

He did not specify what system he was referring to, though the reference to 0.8 to 1 UGG/ha/year suggests that he was referring to the traditional extensive system in each case.  He returned to the subject in his Supplementary Report, justifying his view on the basis that Brachiaria pasture “is more stable during the greater part of the year (10 months) and they only go into decline for a period of two months.” He qualified his opinion by saying that “this is an approximate estimation since the load capacity varies depending on climatic factors, the production system, and other factors such as whether supplementary feed is used in the diet of cattle” {H20.5/11/1041}.  This clarifies that his estimate of 1.8-2 UGG is not specific to the traditional extensive grazing system and that the estimate may involve supplementary feed in the diet of cattle, which is typically a feature of the improved extensive grazing system: see the Mahecha description set out above. </p>

In the course of describing the animals and data, Vergara states that cows were rotated on pastures composed primarily of Brachiaria grasses with a stocking rate that ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 animals per hectare.  Cattle were provided corn silage and either sorghum or guinea grass during the dry season.  The greater weight of the cattle on this farm (400 kgs or more) suggests that the same system would support a stocking rate of 2.6-2.9 350kg cattle (2.3-2.6 x (400/350)).  As is recognised by the Claimants, the venture being studied by Vergara is of a different order from the farming ventures of the Claimants, not least because “the Claimants do not fertilise their pastures in the way that such an exploitation does” {C4/3.5/512} and the widespread use of silage and other feed supplements is not evidenced in the present case.  In his oral evidence Dr Delgado acknowledged that the farm being studied by Vergara was “managed technically, with improvement programmes, with genetic improvement and supplements” and that “the production [levels that could be achieved by LC39 and LC74] is very far below this kind of production levels mentioned in the paper” {Day 49/114:11}; </p>

When read in context, it is plain that the load capacity figures of 0.8-1.0 head/ha, 1.2 animals/ha and 3-3.5 head/ha for the traditional extensive, improved extensive and supplemented semi-intensive are not immutable or rigid findings, even where a range is given.  For the purposes of simplicity Mahecha has given her figures (or, in the cases of the traditional extensive and the supplemented semi-intensive systems, her limited range) to provide indicators of typical load capacity under those systems.  The paper does not purport to provide maxima and minima or to cater for all the variables that may affect the productivity of a given farm.  I therefore accept the submission that her figures are an indication of typical load capacities for typical (or “normal”) examples of each system to which she refers.  As such, they are not the figures that would necessarily apply in the case of the best managed, or the worst managed, farms; nor do they assume the best quality of land, or the worst quality.   </p>

This seems to me to be a realistic approach to the realities of typical campesino farming as disclosed in the course of the trial and, with suitable modifications, a similarly realistic approach should apply when considering what is a typical example of the improved extensive system.  It does not suggest a farm that is entirely weed-free or entirely covered by pasture that is in very good condition.  It therefore seems clear that there may be examples of each system where the load capacity will be above or below the figure or limited range that Mahecha gives.  That said, Mahecha supports the view that the improved extensive system will typically be more productive than the traditional extensive system by between 20% (1.2/1) and 50% (1.2/0.8); and that the supplemented semi-intensive system will typically be more productive than the improved extensive system by a factor of between about 2.5 (3/1.2) and 2.9 (3.5/1.2).  These differences are not solely attributable to the types of grass being used, as Mahecha’s categorisations set out above make clear: but the use of improved strains in the improved extensive system and the intensive management of high yield pastures (which implies the use of improved strains of grass) in the supplemented semi-intensive system are important contributory features.  It is, to my mind, of more than passing interest that Mahecha’s figures suggest that the supplemented semi-intensive system will typically be more productive than the traditional extensive system by a factor of between about 3 (3/1) and 4.3 (3.5/0.8).  That is at least consistent with the Corpoica data-sheet references to Brachiaria humidicola supporting an animal load of up to 4 animals/ha and supports the inference that the reference to that level of animal load is referring to the use of the grass in an intensive system rather than an extensive system. </p>

Despite this qualification, his acceptance of Dr Delgado’s figures as reflecting the highest possible load capacity for a traditional extensive farm implies that the use of Brachiaria instead of grasses such as Uribe and Carimagua may, all other things being equal (i.e. assuming the most favourable traditional extensive farm characteristics) double the load capacity of the farm. </p>

However, it leaves open the question why the difference in the load capacity suggested by Mahecha as between the traditional extensive and the improved extensive systems is no more than 20-50% rather than at least 100%.  Two answers suggest themselves. The first is that Mahecha’s figures assume either (a) the use of some improved grasses in the range of traditional extensive farms, or (b) that improved extensive systems do not use exclusively improved grass strains, or (c) a mixture of both.  The second is that the figures in Mahecha are (a) approximate, or (b) based on a more limited use of improved grasses dating back to 1994, the date of one of the sources for the table, or (c) a mixture of both.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The question remains whether Mahecha’s figures are a reasonable estimation of load capacity for typical or average farms adopting a particular production system.  The figure of 1.2 animals/ha for the improved extensive system is a surprisingly modest increase on the figures for the traditional extensive system, given that the introduction of improved grass strains is only one of the features of improvement that are included in the improved extensive system but absent from the traditional extensive system.  The source of Mahecha’s figures of 0.8-1 and 1.2 animals/ha is not obvious from the paper.  All that can be said is that they do not simply reflect the ratio of head of cattle to area occupied: that would lead to a load capacity of 0.95 (14/14.6) for traditional extensive and 1.44 (6.5/4.5) for improved extensive.  However, the figure of 1.2 UGG/ha for improved extensive is supported by another published text (Arboleda 2003 {H20.6/25.1/1468.10}) which Dr Delgado referred to as authoritative on other issues; and Arboleda provides a figure of 1 UGG/ha (rather than Mahecha’s range of 0.8-1.0) for traditional extensive {H20.6/25.1/1468.8}.

That figure may vary depending upon the quality of the particular farm and pasture in question.  Given that switching from typical traditional extensive production to typical improved extensive farming leads to an uplift in load capacity of c. 20% (1.2/1) or possibly more, Dr Delgado’s evidence that the load capacity of an improved extensive system farm could be 1.8-2.0 UGG, an uplift of 50-66% over Mahecha’s typical figure, seems extreme.  On all of the evidence, an uplift of about 40% (i.e. to about 1.7 UGG) would seem the likely maximum.  A similar uplift to the figure of 1 UGG for traditional extensive farms would lead to a likely maximum of 1.4 UGG. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">After a period of grazing, pasture needs a period of rest during which to form new webs of roots, leaves and stalks, and to accumulate biomass, protein, energy, minerals and vitamins before being grazed again.  The recommended rest periods for pastures in the humid tropical forest are between 35 and 45 days in the rainy season and 50 to 60 days in the dry season.  There is usually no growth in times of drought {H20.3/3/429}.  A failure to allow sufficient rest periods leads to overgrazing.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.5in">The main environmental impact of overgrazing is the degradation of pasture and consequential deterioration to soils and surrounding water courses.  There may also be effects of trampling of hooves, which can cause soil erosion and over-compaction.  Overgrazing removes protective vegetation which would otherwise trap and stabilise the soil, while the cattle hooves trample the exposed soils.  These then become vulnerable to erosion by water and wind, which removes the nutritional content of the upper layers of the soil.  This renders the soil unable to support new vegetation.  Overgrazing therefore limits further vegetation growth, further reducing the amount of pasture available to cattle and therefore exacerbating these difficulties {H21.4/4/846} {Day49/76:5}.  The papers cited by Dr Avila at [5.23]-[5.26] {H21.4/4/797} amply support his evidence and I find that overgrazing is a prevalent problem in Colombia. </p>

He also based his opinions on his own observations.  The Claimants make trenchant criticisms of Dr Avila’s approach, including that it is too complicated to be applied in practice and that it contains errors (for example, by producing large variations in calculated load capacity on the basis of small changes in underlying data) which, in combination, undermine his exercise {C4/3.5/513}ff.  These criticisms serve to emphasise that the actual load capacity of a given farm from time to time and the reasons for that load capacity are both case specific, and I deal with the evidence as necessary when addressing the Lead Claims individually.  In general terms, I consider that a relatively broad brush approach to the calculation of load capacity is appropriate because of the uncertainties and imprecision about (a) the pasture and how it has developed in terms of fertility and vegetation and (b) the loads that have been imposed on it from time to time.  In reaching this conclusion I take into account that overgrazing may be localised on a given property as a result of failure to rest particular pastures, or that it may be prevalent because of generalised overloading of the pastures that are available to the farmer. </p>

It depends on the level of mismanagement.”  I accept that the level of mismanagement will affect damage that may be caused by overgrazing.  However, that is not of itself a reason for rejecting Dr Delgado’s referenced evidence, which was that in all his extensive experience of farms in the area dedicated to livestock production, where there would be slash and burn and deforestation, he hadn’t found the type of damage on other farms that he saw on the Claimants’ farms that were alleged to be affected by the pipelines.  That is admissible evidence in support of the Claimants’ case and requires to be tested by reference to the alleged damage on each farm.  It is not susceptible to a generic finding at this point.  </p>

As a result, the Claimants’ criticism in closing is that “there is a risk that Mr Avila’s samples were unrepresentative because he took an insufficient number of samples” {C4/3.5/520} and that although “this does not mean his samples are wholly compromised, … it raises concerns about whether they are sufficiently representative” {C4/3.5/521}.

This was based on a photograph at {H21.10/15/2415}.  Dr Avila agreed that the most recommendable practice was to ensure that he did not sample grass below 5 centimetres from the soil {Day50/122:22} but did not accept that the subject of the photograph (who is his son and assistant) was cutting at a height less than 5 cms.  It is not possible to form a valid assessment of the height of the cut from the photograph, though it looks close to the ground from the angle of the camera.  However, given Dr Avila’s clear understanding of the need to cut at or above 5 cms, and his close involvement in the process, it would be surprising if there had been frequent cutting at a point that was lower than recommendable.  The Claimants do not allege the existence of evidence to suggest that cutting too low was systematically done but submit that the photograph “adds to the concerns about the reliability of the values obtained in these samples” {C4/3.5/523}.

The Claimants allege that the on- and off- ROW samples taken by Dr Avila were not necessarily taken at the same stage of growth.  They rely primarily upon Dr Avila’s answers to questions pursuant to CPR 35.6 at {H21.6/10/1487} and, in particular, that in the cases of LC50 and LC74 the on-ROW sample was not being grazed at the material time but the off-ROW sample was.  Both of these will be assessed in greater detail on a case by case basis, but it is immediately to be noted that LC50 is a special case because the ROW was on a ridge and any off-ROW samples would have to come from a distance away.  Dr Avila responded to the criticism that he may have selected samples of grasses that were at different stages of the grazing cycle at {H21.9/13/1837}.  In general terms, Dr Avila’s answer was that he had tried to select sites that looked comparable, without knowing precisely what stage the grasses were at {Day50/132:12} and that where he found two grasses with similar compositions, it means that the grasses have got the same conditions or very similar stages of development {Day50/133:15}.  Although Dr Delgado did not answer the question directly, he did not dispute this as a proposition {Day49/140:16}, and he accepted that where samples of grass taken relatively close together and on the same farm showed roughly similar NDF, it is possible (his word) that they are at a similar stage in the grazing cycle {Day49/142:24}.  I therefore accept that, where there is reason to suspect that samples were taken that were at different stages of growth, comparisons between them are to be treated with caution.  But, where they can be shown, I find that the Defendant is entitled to rely upon similarities in the biomass produced and similarities between NDF results as between samples as evidence that samples were taken at a similar stage in the grazing cycle.  The need to exercise caution in some cases does not invalidate Dr Avila’s bromatology testing as a whole. </p>

It is common ground that the ingestion of polythene bags could have these effects.  The Claimants make two submissions.  First, they submit that cattle will eat foreign objects whether or not they are suffering from mineral deficiencies.  On this point I accept Dr Delgado’s evidence that cattle are an indiscriminate breed that will ingest foreign bodies including objects such as feed sack bags (or other similar objects such as polythene bags) whether or not they are suffering from mineral deficiency {H20.6/35/2052}.  If they are suffering from pica that may increase the likelihood that they will try to supplement their diet, but it is not a precondition to their doing so.  The second point is in part related to the first.  The Claimants submit that the ingestion of foreign objects including bags left during construction is not a consequence of the Claimants’ management of their cattle.  I am not prepared to make a generic finding to that effect.  It is part of a cattle farmer’s normal husbandry to ensure that his livestock are not exposed to danger.  On the Claimants’ relatively small farms, if polythene bags were left for any great length of time, they could and should have been seen and picked up.  If nothing was then done to pick up and remove the bags, the farmer would have a measure of responsibility, at least in terms of proper husbandry.  This conclusion is consistent with Claimants’ submission that the ingestion of foreign objects is common behaviour among cattle and that is why farmers are careful not to leave any objects within their pastures which might be ingested by cattle {C4/3.5/529}. </p>

Behind this remarkable and apparently trivial dispute lies a more serious intent because the presence or absence of noise from a cow that is stuck might alert the farmer who would otherwise be unaware of its plight.  I accept Dr Avila’s evidence that, given the small size of the farms and the close involvement of the Claimants (or in some cases those who work on their farms), a farmer should usually be aware that one of his cows was stuck in a swamp before it remained there for 12 hours, even if it was mute, since farm-hands and managers on small farms ought regularly to be checking on their cattle by visiting the pastures where they are grazing at least twice a day to ensure that their cattle have not got into any difficulty {H21.4/4/839}.  Serious questions should be asked about the competence of a farmer who did not adopt so basic a practice of livestock husbandry.  I also accept Dr Avila’s evidence (ibid) that trapped cattle would generally draw attention to themselves by lowing.  The noise made by distressed calves is particularly loud, calling out to their mothers.  I do not accept that calling out by cattle or calves in distress is limited to circumstances where a cow is separated from its calf and I reject Dr Delgado’s evidence, first raised in crossexamination, that cattle of the types kept by the Claimants will make no noise when stuck in the mire. </p>

As was made painfully clear in the course of his cross-examination, he was no such thing, not least because he had never been the project manager of a construction project during his career {Day52/106:2}.  His report, as originally provided and subsequently amended, was largely used as a vehicle to rehearse the Claimants’ case; but it did not advance it.  By the end of a further immaculate crossexamination by Mr Lewis, there was nothing left that could properly be called expert opinion evidence from Mr Willis upon which the Claimants could properly rely.  The Claimants implicitly recognise this in their closing submissions, in which the only observation they make is that Mr Willis had referred to BS6079: 1996.  As Mr Willis and the Claimants recognise, this British Standard was a guide and not a code of practice {Day53/20:4}, being informative rather than prescriptive {Day53/21:18}. </p>

The objective evidence before the court is to the effect that these margins were not achievable.  Ms Navas identified published data relating to Antioquia indicating that the costs of milk production account for 86.4% of the sale price of a litre of milk and that the costs of production of cattle represent approximately 79% of the market value of the animal {H17/1/54}.  Those figures related to more technically advanced operations.  Snr Perez was not in a position to give an opinion on the relative rates of return for campesino cattle farmers as opposed to more technological farms {Day51/73:4}.  Nor was Ms Navas, but her argument was that it would make no sense for commercial producers to invest in technology and upscaling of operations if they could in fact obtain such greater returns without it {Day51/139:5}.  This argument requires some qualification, because the benefits of scale may not simply be driven by improved margins; and there are distinct differences between commercial and campesino operations that work in the campesino’s favour, such as the use of unpaid labour, non-payment of tax, and (possibly) reduced transportation, administration or insurance costs.   </p>

In particular, Dr Velez’ interview with LC74 (Snr Velez) at {H24.2/301.2/1443} is not reflected in the written evidence of Dr Delgado or Dr Velez.  In it Snr Velez makes clear that arrangements under which cattle belonging to others are raised on his land with the sale proceeds being split leave him with no profit.  He makes the point that it is better to lease the grass but that is not what the cattle owners will accept.  This is a different model from breeding and raising his own cattle on his farm, but it supports the notion that cattle raising is unlikely to generate the profits projected in the Schedules of Loss. </p>

This submission is based on twin assumptions, namely (a) that the reduced levels of production release family labour to an extent that make it feasible for the person so released to seek remunerative employment elsewhere, and (b) that there would be remunerative employment available for the person to obtain.  Both these assumptions are highly questionable.  First, where the claim is (for example) that damage to a Claimant’s farm has rendered it less productive so that he can maintain (say) three fewer head of cattle, it is not obvious that the presence of three fewer animals would release labour so as to enable someone to go and seek remunerative work elsewhere.

It follows that even if a person on a given farm had the time during which he could undertake remunerative employment there is no basis for assuming that such employment would be available.  While Ms Navas’ analysis of opportunity costs {Day51/140:23} would have a practical logic in other economic circumstances, I am not satisfied that as a general approach it is realistic in the current circumstances.  A more realistic approach is that work by family members (particularly by women) tends to be unpaid and not readily transferable to other employment; however, the need to feed the family remains the same in the face of reduced productivity.  While I accept that this is an issue to be considered again where raised in relation to the Schedules of Loss, I accept the evidence of Snr Perez that “for men, work as a jornalero (day labourer) is only an occasional job, and while women work on their own farms it wouldn’t be possible for them to find work as day labourers on other farms” {H16.2/4/379}.  I have not ignored the fact that LC39’s original Schedule of Loss asserts that the three male members of the family who previously lived on the farm now earn a living elsewhere as farm labourers in order to support their families {B4.1/8/73} and that Schedule 4 gives credit for earnings from labouring over a period of 10 years {B4.1/8/76}.  Irrespective of whether this assertion is accurate, it is not a sufficient basis for a finding that alternative remunerative employment was available as a matter of course in the event of reduced production on any or every farm. </p>

That was a legitimate (albeit hearsay) exercise which did not involve the giving of expert evidence; and it is admissible.  In general, Snr Lozano’s prices tend to be lower than those provided by UMATAS, reflecting the fact that the producers who provided him with information were operating at a level similar to that of the Claimants, at the lower end of the supply chain.  Ms Navas agreed that prices which were lower than those reported in official sources were likely to be a good approximation {Day51/114:5}.  Where the UMATAS prices are lower than those from Snr Lozano, that may suggest in the absence of an explanation to the contrary that error has crept in to Snr Lozano’s pricing; but that cannot simply be asserted as a general conclusion.

She accepted that in a price series where the latest (2012) price estimate is the most reliable and the price series increased over time at a rate faster than inflation, that would imply that the historical prices in the series could be an underestimate.  It is to be noticed that, while logically impeccable, this point implies likely inaccuracies in all historical prices as generated by Snr Lozano and Snr Perez since their methodology was the same for all historical series and there was a similar absence of documentary evidence to support the producers’ recollection.  This is not of itself a criticism of the process; rather it is a note of caution against taking the prices that have been obtained as being entirely reliable or precisely accurate. </p>

In their Amended Schedules of Loss the Claimant quantify their claims by reference to the cost that would have been incurred if the Claimants had gone to market in Medellin and then adding 15% to that market price, which is described as a merchant’s handling fee, in order to find the average consumer purchase price per kilo in Caucasia {H16.1/2/185} {Day51/31:12}: these have been described as town prices.  By contrast, the Defendant submits that the appropriate measure by which to quantify the loss would be the price that would have been obtainable by the Claimant if the “lost” production had been sold at the farm gate or payable if a replacement purchased from a neighbour at “farm-gate” prices. </p>

My starting point is that if there were evidence that a Claimant had in fact gone to market in Medellin (or elsewhere) and paid town prices, that would be the appropriate measure of damage for the Claimant to recover.  However, as the extract from the Schedule of Loss set out above recognises, that is not what happened.  As a general statement, there is no evidence that Claimants incurred town prices to replace lost production that would have formed part of their domestic consumption.  Instead, the more likely outcomes are that the quantity and quality of the Claimants’ diet was reduced by the absence of the lost production, or that the Claimants may have bartered with or bought from neighbours to the extent that they made good the deficiency by obtaining replacement products.   </p>

It is in theory possible that in some cases a farmer might change his diet so to compensate for the lost production by using some other type of food produce from his farm that he might otherwise have bartered or sold.  As a further possible complexity, it is alleged in some cases that the damage to the productive capacity of the farms caused people to leave, which may be associated either with loss of basic domestic consumption or loss of what was previously a surplus that could be traded or both, or with other reasons entirely.   </p>

On this area I accept the evidence of Snr Quevedo at {Day12/161:1} as typical and generally applicable in the absence of contrary evidence and find that, except when in possession of a glut that they could not otherwise get rid of, neighbours might help each other out to a limited extent, but they could not afford to subsidise each other to a great extent and so would charge, whether in money or by barter. </p>

To my mind, it is indicative and typical of the tough, rugged, rural communities that they simply got on with the lives that they were used to and made do with what they had for domestic consumption, supplementing it locally where appropriate rather than making the journey to town or market and replacing like with like.  In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the appropriate measure of damage is to apply town prices.  There is no real analogy to be drawn with urban life in a crowded island such as England and Wales where the natural reaction if food produce is lost would be to go to the nearest town or supermarket and replace it at the prices ruling there.  There are, however, two reasons for favouring farm-gate prices.  The first is that <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>the Claimants chose to replace lost produce they are more likely to have done so locally, where farm-gate prices would rule.  The second is to imagine what would have happened if the “lost” produce had not been lost but the Claimants had chosen to sell it rather than consuming it domestically.  This possibility is neither outrageous nor outlandish given that, in many if not most cases, the “lost” domestic consumption is not alleged to have caused malnutrition or ill-health.  <span style="font-style:italic">If </span>the Claimants had chosen and been able to sell the “lost” production, they would have recovered farm-gate prices and not town-prices. </p>

The Claimants attempt to justify this {C4/3.5/553} by saying that the animal (say a pig or a chicken) would have had to be sold at some point anyway so that the income from the sale is income they could expect regardless of when they sold the pig.  This is wrong for two distinct reasons.  First, there is a difference between a pig (or hen) sold early and a pig sold later, which should reflect in the value obtained on the sale: an aged pig sold after the end of its reproductive life has value only for food; but a young and still fertile pig has value as a future producer of piglets as well as the residual value it will have when its reproductive life ends.  The same is true for the chicken and the egg.  Second, even if the price of a young and productive pig were to be the same as an aged and infertile one, the Claimants have had the benefit of accelerated receipt of the sale proceeds.  The need to give credit is implicitly acknowledged in the Claimant’s elegant sentence: “[pigs and chickens] have the disadvantage of mortality, <span style="font-style:italic">although they do return high profit margins</span>” {C4/3.5/554}.  </p>

She came to be cross-examined when the Court, the cross-examiner and the witness were under severe time constraints.

Ms Navas’ evidence, which I accept, was that these were the rates to be paid by the primary buyer on issuance but that the relevant rate was that on the secondary market, which would be higher {Day51/154:17}.  But after further consideration she gave as her opinion that a real rate of return of 2.5% would be “a bit low” for an investment in a Colombian government bond and that volatility in the secondary market because of people’s perception of risk and the Colombian Government’s ability to pay its debt would affect the expected rate.

While I strongly suspect that it is rationally based upon Colombian economic conditions, I do not know what the logic may be.  What is clear on the basis of Ms Navas’ evidence is that, if the Colombian court were to be acting on the same factual information as is available to this court, the practice of the Colombian Court must be based upon a different logic.  I would not agree with the Claimants’ submission that the lack of explanation makes the Colombian court’s universal practice irrelevant; but it would be wrong in principle to follow that practice where the application of English principles to evidence before this Court leads to a markedly different answer. </p>

If a farmer is lucky, a trader may come to the farm and buy the entire crop, but this is not the general experience and often farmers will receive nothing for crops that they have grown.  Even when fruit has been given away to neighbours, there is likely to be much left over that goes to waste: see the evidence cited at {C4/4.7/601}ff.

Given the nature of the ODC pipeline works, that was a mantra that should have been questioned rigorously by the experts instructed for the Claimants.  In some cases the alarm bells should have rung for all of Claimants’ advisers, both technical and legal.  For example, the suggestion that Snr Velez had suffered no significant damage from the ODC pipeline is evidently highly dubious even without any reference to technical experts because of the terms of his multiple settlements with ODC.  Yet, far from investigating the historic impact of the ODC pipeline, the technical experts appear to have accepted the mantra of the lay witnesses without question and to have set out to support the mantra as being correct.  That was, in my judgment, a fundamental failure in the preparation and presentation of the Claimants’ cases.  Even if it were a sustainable opinion that there were places where the ODC pipeline was not over-worked by the Ocensa pipeline and no material damage was observed, that could not and did not mean that a general assumption could be made that the ODC pipeline works were benign.  There was compelling evidence that should have caused the Claimants’ experts to reconsider their unqualified support for the Claimants’ cases, at least by the time of trial.  To take just one example, knowing that the ODC ROW on LC50 had been laid in about 1991 but was bare of vegetation in September 1995 demanded a reasoned analysis by the Claimants’ experts of the consequences of that state of affairs.  There was none; and it was not until crossexamination that Dr Card acknowledged that the ODC ROW would have been a continuing source of erosion during that time.   </p>

At present, because of the destruction of Dr Card’s calculations in his fourth report, there is a complete absence of reliable quantitative evidence such as the Court would normally expect to see in relation to both the ODC and the Ocensa works.

The Claimants jointly became the registered owners of the property as a whole (La Fe 1 and 2) in April 1991, pursuant to INCORA resolution 1097. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Claimants are intelligent and educated people, neither of whom showed any signs of being overawed by the process or intimidated or disadvantaged when giving evidence. Sra Arango is an accountant.  Snr Mesa is a successful businessman.  As one of his lines of business he has for a number of years acted as a cattle farmer and trader.  He intended to sell off blocks of La Fe over time, and sometimes he would help other people sell land or cattle in return for a commission.  He keeps minimal records and pays no tax on the profits from his farm at La Fe.  His wife confirmed, and I accept, that his record keeping is rudimentary at best.  He was vague to the point of being evasive on the profitability of the farm until it became clear that documentation could be obtained which would show the basis of the tax returns he says he submits.  At that stage he settled on about COP 20,000,000 (c. £5,000) as the profit he had made in the last year that was declared for tax purposes {Day6/1:6}.  I do not accept that evidence as reliable either as an estimate of the profitability of the farm or as being what he declared to the tax authorities.  Some of his evidence is uncontroversial, but on a number of topics (of which the fish pool and lameness of cattle are two) the true picture did not emerge from his evidence until crossexamination and then only after detailed (and justified) probing.  These features do not require the wholesale discounting of his evidence, but they require me to maintain my critical faculties when assessing his evidence.  Sra Arango gave evidence impressively by video-link.  She maintained that she was more frightened of what might happen with the water than about what the guerrillas might have done after the pipeline {Day7/105:14}.  I do not doubt her courage in the face of danger, but I am satisfied that she was deterred by the security situation just as her husband was {D6/100/1179}.  I did not find her evidence to the contrary to be convincing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Two other lay witnesses gave evidence about LC54. Snr Herrera was the Claimants’ farm manager for many years including at the time of the Ocensa pipeworks.  He struggled to give coherent evidence.  This did not appear to be because he was in any way intimidated but was because his cultural background combined with his advancing years resulted in a poor memory and difficulty in giving clear and coherent evidence.  Two examples of his difficulty are illustrative: he did not remember the works carried out by the Ocensa pipeline workers on the fish pool on W1, and his estimates of cattle numbers on La Fe were internally inconsistent and, when suggesting that there were as many as 800 cattle on the farm, wrong by a large margin {Day7/139:6}.  Snr Ramirez is a butcher who has been buying about 150 head of cattle per year from Snr Mesa for 15-20 years.  He did not appear to be overawed, though the surroundings in which he gave his evidence by videolink would have been unfamiliar to him.  When he realised that he did not understand a question he asked for it to be repeated {Day7/125:5}, but normally his responses showed that he had understood what was being asked. His oral evidence about lame cattle was less clear and certain than the apparent clarity of his witness statement.  I formed the impression that the lack of clarity or conviction in his oral evidence was the result of a genuine lack of recollection rather than an inability to do himself justice in the witness box. </p>

By the conclusion of the trial, the claim had reduced to COP 177.6 million (c. £66,000) plus moral damages and damages for loss of amenities.  Claims made in 2008 for the reduction of the Claimants’ herd from 200 to 50 cattle, the abandonment of a programme of artificial insemination, and for loss of ability to produce eggs, maize, plantain and yucca had been abandoned.  I find as a fact that the Claimants did not know what was being claimed on their behalves in 2008; and I accept that Snr Mesa’s complete astonishment at the size of the claim (which he immediately thought must be for a group – or the group – of claimants) was genuine.  If the later iterations of the Claimants’ schedules of loss were either provided or read to them, they did not give them sufficient attention to enable them properly to state in their witness statements that the schedules provided a precise description of their losses.  On present information I am not in a position to tell whether that state of affairs involves a failure on the part of the Claimants’ lawyers, the Claimants themselves, or both. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">When La Fe 1 was first acquired the Claimants’ two children (who were born in 1983 and 1987) were either very young or not yet born.  One of the features that made La Fe attractive was the quality of the water.  In the early days, there were pools on the main stream (W2) in which the family would swim.  When it was not the rainy season the water from W2 was clean and the family would drink it {Day7/37:20}; but in the rainy season they got water from a neighbour who had a good well as well as making a well themselves {Day7/39:3}.  From the beginning the water in the streams would become murky when it rained {Day7/117:17} and the family had always boiled their water before drinking it.  The cattle on the farm would drink from the streams and from time to time would defecate in them, which contributed to the contamination of the water.  Sra Arango gave evidence that the water quality deteriorated after the pipeline was installed, including times when the water was not merely murky but “swampy” {Day7/96:7}, meaning that when they turned on the taps, bits of marsh land and earth would come out {Day7/118:10}.  Her evidence at one point appeared to be that she first noticed murkiness in the water about a year after the pipeline had been installed {Day7/114:20}, but that would be inconsistent with her evidence and that of her husband that it had been murky before the pipeline, which I accept.  What appeared clearly from her evidence was that there was a long period of progressive deterioration until they got to the stage that, when they flushed the toilet, what came out was “just marsh land, …just brackish water.”  I will return to this evidence later, to see how it matches the technical case that has been advanced on the Claimants’ behalf.  For present purposes I note that her description of a progressive deterioration in the water supply is consistent with Snr Mesa’s evidence that the water was normal during the construction of the pipeline and that sediment only reached the water during the rainy season, with abnormalities not being noticed until well after the construction of the pipeline {D6/100/1210} at [154].  I accept that evidence. </p>

Most of La Fe 1 is relatively flat, with gradients typically in the region of 8-11%.  At the northern end, the slope increases up to and beyond the northern boundary of La Fe.  I do not accept Dr Card’s evidence that the slope towards the northern end of La Fe has a gradient of or approaching 40% {H1.1/1/185}. Dr Savigny recorded one measurement in the region of 17-18% at the very northern end of LC54 {H2.6/8/1455}.  This appears to be something of an outlier, both in terms of being at the very northern end of the property and because it does not sit easily with the evidence of the many photographs of the property and the spread of gradient measurements set out by Dr Card at {H1.6/24/1320} and {H1.6/24/1452}.  Taking all of the evidence into account I conclude that Dr Savigny’s measurement of 17-18% may be an over-estimate and that, if it is correct, it only affects a very short stretch on LC54. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Ocensa ROW passes across La Fe 1 generally from south to north.  There are no substantial cross-gradients across the ROW as it passes through LC54.  Of the four trial cases, LC54 has the least complicated topography for the laying of a pipeline.  The ROW crosses three watercourses.  Each is concave while on La Fe 1, as its gradient gradually decreases.  W1 is the most northerly of the three.  It has two sources, each of which is beyond the northern boundary of La Fe. The first is a pair of embankment dams with reservoirs behind, the lower of which provides a modest seepage of flow during the dry periods {H2.3/3/784}.  The second is a modest source emerging from woods further to the west.  For most or all of its path across La Fe 1 it is a small stream which may be dry or virtually dry for part of the year {H7.4/4/902} at [1.2.3].  Although on the Claimants’ case the stream is now sedimented in a way that it was not before the Ocensa pipeline, that sedimentation has not materially altered the volume of water that has fed into W1 or the variations in the volume of its flow with the seasons.  I find as a fact that W1 was routinely dry or virtually dry in the dry season long before the Ocensa pipeline.  Downstream of the ROW there was at one point a fish pool, of which more later.  Further down, W1 historically meandered until its course was changed by the Claimants digging a canal which straightened the course for the flow of the water.  The original route of W1 and the canalisation works are shown on {L6/841/856}.  It flows under the driveway to the house and between the house and the highway until it meets the other two streams near to the highway.   </p>

The first is the pair of embankment dams that form one of the effective sources for stream W1.  Some photographs (e.g. the 2012 Satellite image as reproduced at {H2.3/3/782} show the dams retaining some water, while others (e.g. {H2.3/3/793}) suggest that they are or may sometimes be ineffective. There is evidence, which I accept, that the dams have been breached on at least one occasion {H2.3/3/794}. The second feature is a nearby area of erosion known as E1.  It is the Claimants’ case that a substantial part of the sedimentation of W1 came from area E1.  Dr Savigny accepts that some, but not all erosion from what he called the E1 polygon would travel towards and into the embankment dams and that some would flow to the south west of the ROW towards stream W1 {Day37/38:8} ff.  It is the Defendant’s case that sedimentation of stream W1 was significantly contributed to by the breaching of the embankment dams.   </p>

Further clearance took place between 1966 and 1978, by which time the forest was largely cleared both on La Fe and (so far as can be seen in the images) to the north of the Claimants’ land, which forms the drainage basin for the streams.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">At first sight these photographs are consistent with the Claimants’ case that sedimentation from the ROW and Area E1 caused sedimentation of the streams leading to overflowing, flooding and swampiness caused by deposit of sediment on the flooded lands.  However, they are important for two particular reasons.  First, because they show dark, sediment-laden waters in areas that cannot have been affected by the Ocensa pipeline, particularly in the upper reaches of W2 {Day27/77:16}.  Second, flooding such as is seen in the photographs (and worse) was an almost daily occurrence on La Fe before the construction of the Ocensa pipeline as well as after it.  {Day6/143:21}, {Day7/70:13}.  Although the waters did and do subside quickly, the land would stay wet and muddy for several days {Day7/71:4}.  Snr Mesa acknowledged that there had always been deposits of material from the higher ground (i.e. the drainage basin for the streams), but he drew a distinction between what he regarded as beneficial organic deposits before the pipeline and later deposits of “sedimentation” {Day7/71:21}, a point to which I will return.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">On the basis of this evidence, I find that in times of heavy rainfall the streams on La Fe 1 have at all material times since deforestation of their basins carried significant quantities of sediment from their respective catchment areas (ignoring any contribution from the Ocensa pipeline works).  I also find that in times of heavy rainfall W1, W2 and W3 have, since well before the Claimants acquired La Fe, overflowed their original banks before the points of their confluence, with the flooding extending to a greater extent than depicted in the flooding photographs.  As the velocity of the water flow reduced, with decreasing gradients and as the water spread from its original channels, sediment would be deposited and would accumulate over time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">One of the effects of digging the canal has been to prevent W1 repeatedly overflowing its previously meandering banks, with the beneficial effect that there is no longer a swamp in that section, at least until W1 reaches the area affected by its confluence with W2 and W3 {H7.4/4/903} at [1.3.4], {H7.4/4/908} at [1.5.10].  The Claimants have not removed sediment from any other stretch of the streams crossing La Fe 1.  While Dr Tobon’s view (based upon Dr Card’s estimates) was that W1 would have refilled with sediment ({H7.4/4/909} at [1.6.1.7]) that is not borne out by experience in the canalised stretch; and it is Dr Tobon’s view that if sediment had been cleaned from the stream channel of W2, it would not display an accumulation of sediment and the swampy area would not exist {H7.4/4/921} at [2.6.1.6].

On this evidence I find that the banks of W2 were not materially eroded or significantly damaged at the ROW intersection.  His report does not evidence any reduction in the natural width of W1 or W3 at the ROW intersection.  I am confident that, if there had been any material alteration in the width, he would have noted it.  Consequently, I find that the banks of W1 and W3 were not materially eroded or significantly damaged at the ROW intersection: see [720.ii)].  That being so, there was no need for revetments to preserve the banks at the ROW intersections, and none was installed.  The absence of damage to the banks may have been because the use of boring techniques meant that they remained undisturbed: see [976]. </p>

The property also had some fruit trees on it.  Snr Mesa did not buy the property for its fruit trees, but he was approached by traders who would buy the produce of a tree at a low price, leaving enough on the property for the family and, when they got tired of eating fruit, they would give some away to neighbours  {D6/100/1174} at [44]ff.  The general impression given by Snr Mesa and his wife is that cattle farming was the commercial purpose behind the purchase of the farm and that the presence of fruit in season was a bonus during family holidays and when, on occasions, Snr Mesa would take some home to Medellin. </p>

Since the operation involved breeding, the herd had cattle of various ages at different times.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Over time, this process was contributing to sedimentation on La Fe 1.  In 1991 the ODC Environmental and Geotechnical Protection Manual described land in the area (but not specifically in relation to LC54): “Alluvial plain soil are largely well drained, but with some sectors subjected to floods and swamping” {K2/2T/84}.  The 1994 Bateman Report (again, not farm-specific) describes the geomorphological features in the area as including “light to moderate water erosion, diffuse runoff, fissures and small landslides” {K14/102T/131}.  The process is evidenced by Dr Savigny’s attribution of certain areas as wetlands in his Land Use Maps for 1966, 1978, 1985 and 1995 {H2.8/10/2107}, which were not contradicted by Dr Gundlach and can be taken as general indicators of the existence of the process and the changing state of the ground from time to time.  In particular, the Land Maps evidence the development of wetlands in the area of the confluence of the streams at and about SW2 and also in the areas of SW1 and SW3.  I accept the evidence of Dr Savigny and Professor Monsalve that the history and topography of the area provides a ready explanation for the development of swampy areas.  First, as just described, erosion and sedimentation from the basins above LC54 was a regular occurrence before the pipeline was laid.  Second, the undulating slopes flattened on LC54 progressively so that by the confluence of W2 and W3 the land was a flood plain.  Third, the regular flooding of LC54 was liable to deposit sediment as it drained and dried.  On this evidence I find that Dr Savigny’s Land Maps correctly identify that there were swampy areas in the general areas now described as SW1, SW2 and SW3 before the laying of the Ocensa pipeline.  Their areas may not be precisely marked on the map, and may have fluctuated with time; but the general progression over years led to the formation and development of swampy areas in those parts of LC54.  To the extent that Snr Mesa gave evidence that the development of swampy areas was progressive, I accept it; to the extent that he said or implied that there were no swampy areas before the laying of the Ocensa pipeline, I reject it: see {D6/100/1203}ff. </p>

The consideration was at the rate of COP600 per m², equivalent to COP6,000,000 per hectare (although Snr Mesa had tried to negotiate the price upwards) and COP4,140,000 in total, calculated by reference to the area of the ROW.  Snr Mesa and his wife both read and signed the document {Day6/87:14}.  The Annex setting out the damages recognised in the negotiation described them as “Damage to improved pastures, 4-line barbed-wire fences with wooden posts”.  These were specific references to improved pastures and fences on the proposed ROW.  I accept Snr Mesa’s evidence that he did not think there would be damage outside the ROW and that the people with whom he was negotiating said that, if there was damage outside the ROW they would pay the same price {Day6/89:9}.

First, it was intended to regularise a change in route because the Ocensa pipeline was now to go over La Fe 1.  This had the effect of increasing the overall length of the ROW that would pass over the Claimants’ land from 276 metres to 402 metres.  Yet the second ROW Agreement again referred to the land as being 68 hectares in total (i.e. La Fe 2). The intention of the parties to reflect the diversion of the planned route from the ODC ROW to passing over La Fe 1 is made clear by the agreement referring only to a length of 126 metres in Clause 5, which is explained by the note in the Annex that “the settlement is made on the basis of 126.0 m. which is the excess in meters resulting from the diversion made in said property.”  The Annex provided a description of the recognised damages that was identical to that in the first ROW Agreement.  Second, where the parties to the first agreement had been the Claimants and the Defendant, the parties to the second ROW Agreement were the Claimants and Ocensa.  Both ROW Agreements were signed on behalf of the contracting Company by Alexander Rojas, an employee of the Defendant who worked on the Ocensa pipeline project.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There is an issue about when revegetation works were carried out.  Snr Mesa was contracted to carry out the works.  His workers started at or near La Fe and covered a 25km stretch.  His evidence originally was that the work was carried out in the dry season and that it took about 5-6 weeks to do the work {D6/100/1193} at [127].  In evidence he repeated that it had been very dry and that the rains had not established themselves, which caused him to suggest watering the ground – a suggestion that was not taken up.  When pressed, he said he thought it had been before April, finally plumping for March or April 1997.  Snr Herrera said the replanting had taken place in the rainy season and that sometimes the rain was heavy {D6/111/1289} at [19].  Snr Cardenas estimated that revegetation was taking place on the sector in which LC54 is placed during the week of 19-25 May 1997 on the basis of the entry in the weekly report for that week under the heading “Revegetation” {K45/471/2}.  The weekly reports for 21-27 April ({K44/464/3}), 28 April-4 May ({K44/466.1/3}) and 5-11 May ({K45/468.1/2}) report on Revegetation in the same format but none evidences revegetation works occurring in the vicinity of La Fe or near it.  The weekly reports for the periods from 9 March to 20 April 1997 do not have entries specifically for Revegetation.  The weekly report for 12-18 May 1997 is not available. </p>

There is evidence, which I accept, that both lime and fertiliser were used both generally and on LC54’s property.  Snr Mesa agreed that lime was used {Day7/8:13} but said that fertiliser had not been provided by Dinosaurios {Day7/9:5}.  However, he told Dr Velez that fertilisers were applied {H5.4/5/874}, in addition to which Snr Herrera said that fertiliser had been used during revegetation {D6/111/1289} and there is more generalised evidence of the use of fertiliser when revegetating from the Claimants’ witnesses ({D2/45/466} {D3/68/680} {D11.1/153/1852} {D11.2/171/2071}).

He does not expressly say that there were cattle in the affected fields at that time, though his evidence carries that suggestion.  He says that during the construction process he rented pasture for 35 animals for 6 months, “roughly speaking” {D6/100/1188}; but it is evident that he had cattle on La Fe 1 in the area of the pipeline early on because he claims (and I accept) that a cow died when it got stuck in W2 where the bridge had been damaged by the works.  The letter of complaint which he sent in April 1997 is not clear as to the date of the loss of the cow, meaning either that the death occurred or that it was was first complained about in December 1996 {M/133T/476.1}: on either view this would have been within about three months of the ROW being opened, little more than a month after reconformation, and very close in time to the carrying out of longterm geotechnical works.  Later in his statement he refers to cattle getting onto the revegetated ROW some three months after sowing {D6/100/1193}.  On this evidence I am not persuaded that Snr Mesa took his cattle out of the affected fields for six months or anything approaching that length of time.  I find that he kept cattle in the affected fields for most of the time after the reconformation of the ROW, though I am not able to determine how many cattle or precisely where on affected parts of La Fe 1 he kept them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">For whatever reason, the revegetation works carried out by Snr Mesa’s workforce were not satisfactory.  As a result, he was not paid the full contract price.  His evidence suggests that in the three months after his work was done, the money was withheld and Dinosaurios fenced off the ROW with an electric fence to keep cattle off it; and that, after this had happened, the rainy season came {D6/100/1193} at [129]ff.  That would put his works on La Fe back to about February 1997.  On the basis of the evidence I have summarised above, and particularly the evidence of the weekly reports, I reject that possibility.  The conflict in the evidence is between the weekly reports and the evidence Snr Herrera, which would support a finding that Snr Mesa’s works were done in mid to late May, and Snr Mesa’s evidence, which would support a finding that they were done earlier.  No explanation has been provided for the absence of the mention of Revegetation in the earlier weekly reports.  On the other hand, it seems unlikely that no Revegetation work would have been carried out at all on Spreads A and B before the week of 21 April, given the onset of rainier weather before then.  Conversely, I formed the impression that Snr Mesa’s evidence about carrying out the work when it was still dry, and asking for facilities for watering, was based on genuine recollection.  I accept his evidence that the initial germination on La Fe was only partially successful, with some plants taking root and others not.  If that had been because the unsuccessful planting had been washed away (rather than failing to germinate because it was still dry) I would expect him to have remembered that.  I have therefore concluded that his workforce carried out their work on La Fe in March, carrying on elsewhere in early April 1997.  On that basis, the weekly report entry for the week of 19-25 May 1997 is likely to have been a reference to Dinosaurious’ remedial works.  Whether that finding is correct or not, the soil would have been poorly covered by the end of May. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The evidence does not enable me to make precise findings about when or how heavily it rained on LC54 during the period, though there is a broad similarity between the numbers of days in the month with rainfall recorded at Cacaoteras Del Dique and the pattern of frequency shown by the (incomplete) records from the camps at Caucasia to the North and Zaragoza to the South.  The difficulty in drawing more precise conclusions from the data is shown by the fact that the very heavy rain in Zaragoza on 19/20 April 1997 clearly passed Cacaoteras Del Dique by.  The most that can be said is that there is no evidence (either from the records or from the lay witnesses) of particularly heavy rain while the trench was open; and there will probably have been a number of occasions of heavy rain on LC54 between the stripping of the ROW and the carrying out of revegetation.  Accepting (as I have done) the evidence that LC54 flooded during the rainy season on a regular and almost daily basis, I conclude that it did not need particularly heavy rain to cause flooding on LC54 either before or after the Ocensa pipeline was installed. </p>

The description that he was given by Snr Herrera is consistent with the general procedure described at [302] above ({D6/100/1187} at [100]ff).  His evidence is that he arrived about 15-20 days after work had started and could not see how the construction had been done, and I find he arrived after the trench had been refilled.  His description is that he saw “the right of way with the soil uncovered, with no protection, no vegetation, and no fences to prevent the cattle from walking on the soil.”  He gives no evidence of any significant piles of soil.  His evidence is that when he came, what was on top was not the topsoil because the earth had a reddish colour.  That would be correct on his evidence that he arrived 15-20 days after construction started because reconformation had not happened by then.  His evidence is that he did not see wooden structures or other kinds of geotechnical works or biomats, but it is not clear when this evidence is referring to.  He was told by a friend and neighbour that the crossing of water sources </p>

There is nothing in the documentation available to the Court to indicate that there were any major difficulties on or near LC54, but this is of limited assistance since the available documentation is not comprehensive.

I accept that when the topsoil was stripped it would have had to be stored, but the topography at LC54 means that it cannot be inferred that substantial stockpiles, such as contemplated by the Claimants, were formed.  After the works were completed, the Claimants entered into a settlement agreement with Ocensa in relation to sobreanchos; but that does not prove the existence of stockpiles.  On some properties there is objective evidence of where soil had been placed off the ROW; but there is no such evidence on LC54.  The absence of evidence of substantial stockpiles from Snr Mesa is telling: if there had been stockpiles even approaching the size of those contemplated by the Claimants, he would have seen and remembered them or at least have been told about them.  After the trench had been backfilled on 3-4 October 1996, there would only have been modest windrows of stripped earth. Reconformation happened at the beginning of November 1996 after which there would have been no significant piles of earth exposed to the elements. </p>

No erosion matting was installed on LC54 {D6/100/1188} at [109] and {H1.1/1/188} at [15.2.6].  Dr Card confirmed in cross-examination that he did not criticise the long-term geotechnical works on LC54 apart from his concern about the absence of longitudinal drains, subject to the reservation that he thought his only criticism “might be about erosion control mats”; but he agreed that any criticism in relation to matting was minimal even by his standards because of the gradients on the property being 9-11% {Day24/146:8}.  I have found (at [933] above) that, if the maximum gradient at the very northern end of LC54 was in the region of 17-18% as measured by Dr Savigny, it is over a short stretch of the ROW, the exact length of which has not been established.  If there was any area of LC54 where erosion matting should have been laid because of the gradient on the strict application of the original design, it was minimal.

That being so, LC54 is effectively a section that is “Right of Way Parallel to Natural Slope” on the RECS technical drawing at {K14/95/1}, which does not indicate longitudinal drains and does not support the Claimants’ case.  The effect of installing longitudinal drains would have been to increase the disruption of the Claimants’ land and to concentrate the flow of water into watercourses or other discharge points instead of allowing it to flow more diffusely across and off the ROW onto the surrounding land.  In such circumstances longitudinal drains were not a requirement of good practice: see [329.vii)].  Similarly, I do not accept that good practice required the installation of energy dissipation structures off the ROW: see [329.viii)]. </p>

[985](ix) alleges a failure to maintain the ROW throughout those periods.  The Claimants found their case upon the selfevident proposition that the longer the ROW remained partially or completely unprotected and un-revegetated, the greater the likelihood of erosion of materials off the ROW onto surrounding land.  In relation to LC54 they rely upon the fact that in July 1996 the Sectoral Environmental Division of the Ministry of the Environment carried out a follow-up regulatory visit to Spread A and had noted “the effort made by the project for the environmental management of the site is recognized, but here, the delay in replanting and building the final geotechnical structures, with respect to laying and covering, is even greater [than in the Southern sector].  This sector is favored by the ground conditions; however, this is no reason for the delay in the final reshaping activities” {K41/432T/10}.  Three points may immediately be made.  First, this observation was made in July 1996, and therefore cannot have applied directly to LC54.  Second, the passage recognises the favourable ground conditions in the northern sector, which I take to be a reference to the less challenging topography of which LC54 is an example.

This was recognised by Snr Loeber who agreed that final geotechnical work should start immediately after the recomposition of the ROW has been concluded because soil in a naked condition is more likely to erode {Day19/8:7} ff.  It is also (inevitably) recognised by the Defendant in its closing submissions {C4/4.7/318} at [190].  The Claimants also rely upon Snr Loeber’s positive answer to the question: “Do you agree that, in respect of [the period between November/mid-December and about mid-April] it would have been possible to have long term works and recomposition at the same time if you had in fact increased the density of the works?” {Day19/12:9}. </p>

The question to be addressed now is whether the Claimants have demonstrated that all or part of those periods were due to negligence on the part of the Defendant.  This is not a question that can be answered simply by reference to Snr Loeber’s answer about increasing the density of the works.  Delay is of course undesirable in any major civil engineering project, not least for those responsible for carrying it out: it almost always has adverse financial consequences and is a fertile ground for dispute and litigation.  It is a commonplace for anyone familiar with such disputes that the causes of delay may be many and varied and that even contractual fault does not necessarily (or even probably) imply a failure to exercise reasonable care.  Simple reliance upon Snr Loeber’s answers does no justice to the complexity of what was being undertaken in the Ocensa Pipeline Project.  Two pieces of evidence illustrate why not.  First, Mr Allison was right to qualify his acceptance of the general principle by saying that “you want to stabilise the Right of Way as quickly as possible and then you want to revegetate it <span style="font-style:italic">at the right time of the season, if you can.</span>”(Emphasis added) {Day15/105:20}.  The difficulties that Snr Mesa described in his witness statement that arose from doing revegetation works in the dry season are testament to this {D6/100/1193} at [127].  Second, for public policy reasons, Article 21 of the environmental licence required Ocensa to give priority to hiring the inhabitants of the area: see [341] above.  This was not necessarily conducive to immediate and unlimited supplies of suitable human resources. </p>

Dinosaurios took the decision to fence off the ROW and installed a fence made from stakes and an electric fence.  He says that the fence lasted about 5 months because Dinosaurios did no maintenance and the cattle knocked it down {D6/100/1193} at [130], {Day7/56:5}.  However, his evidence on this point was not consistent.  Snr Herrera had said in his witness statement that Snr Mesa directed his workers to fence off the ROW after their revegetation work and that they did so {D6/111/1290} at [23].  When cross-examined, Snr Mesa agreed that he had given those instructions but gave confusing evidence that he only fenced “a bit of the Right of Way to protect it”, saying that Dinosaurios didn’t provide him with wire and so it was personal work {Day7/10:3}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It is not clear whether the alleged negligence is said to lie in not erecting the fence until three months after Snr Mesa’s works (which would have been about one month or so after Dinosaurios re-did them) or in erecting a fence which failed after 5 months.  In either event, the criticism is misplaced.  Leaving aside the fact that it would have been open to Snr Mesa to erect fencing himself at any stage so as to manage the farm competently balancing the needs of his cattle and his pasture, the considerations that I have outlined mean that it is not self-evidently careless for Dinosaurios not to fence the ROW immediately.  The Claimant has not proved that he had his cattle on the affected fields either when he did his revegetation works or when Dinosaurios did theirs, and his claim for additional pasture suggests that he may not have.  Snr Mesa says that he had suggested fencing off the ROW before Dinosaurios did so, but does not say when.  On this scant evidence I am not satisfied that it was negligent not to install the fence sooner.  Turning to the failure of the fence, the fact that cattle damage an electric fence after 5 months does not of itself imply negligence in its construction: cattle damage fences and electric fences are typically less robust than barbed wire ones, not least because they may be used in circumstances which may require them to be moved.  Dinosaurios could not reasonably be expected to maintain a permanent presence on site after erecting the fence, and cannot reasonably be expected to know if and when cattle damage it.  The obvious, simple and immediate solution (if desired) is for the farmer to reinstate the fence by knocking stakes back in or re-attaching the wire.  If, as the allegation implies, the farmer did nothing to reinstate the fence, subsequent damage would be the consequence of his decision not to reinstate.  There is a complete absence of evidence about the nature of the damage or about how or when Dinosaurios were or should have been aware of it that is a necessary prerequisite to a finding that they were negligent in failing to reinstate.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">For present purposes, it is notable that there is no lay evidence that begins to support Dr Card’s exorbitant estimates of erosion from the ROW.  It will be remembered that Dr Card’s estimate in his fourth report was that an average of about 100 tonnes per day, or 825 tonnes per week, or 11,350 tonnes during the period of 13.8 weeks would have flowed from the ROW on LC54 (i.e. excluding any contribution from the features beyond the Northern boundary of LC54).  Even his revised estimates predicted that hundreds of tonnes would have flowed from the ROW during that period: see generally [504.iv)]ff above.  While acknowledging that Snr Mesa was not at the farm all of the time and that Snr Herrera now has an extremely fallible memory, it is inconceivable that such quantities flowing from the ROW would not have been noticed and remembered by those who were there.  The lay evidence gives no support to a case asserting very large quantities flowing from the ROW during the period of construction.  There is no lay evidence of substantial flows of sediment across land and I have accepted the evidence that there was no immediate impact on the water during construction and that sediment only reached the water later with abnormalities first being noticed long after construction: see [931] above.  If there had been substantial damage to the streams on LC54 due to the deposition of substantial quantities of sediment in them during or immediately after the construction period, that would have been observed by those working and living on the farm; and I would have expected it to be reported and remembered.  Furthermore, on my assessment of Snr Mesa, his understanding and his willingness to claim if he thought he had suffered damage, I consider it highly improbable that he would not have complained vociferously if anything as dramatic as suggested by Dr Card had actually happened.  The absence of evidence is therefore at least some evidence of absence of substantial quantities of sediment being deposited during or immediately after the construction period.   </p>

In expressing that opinion, his original report supported the close temporal connection that was a central feature of the Claimants’ case, as summarised above.  His expressed opinion was that there had been erosion which caused sedimentation during the period of construction and, in particular, during a period when he assumed that there had been significant stockpiling.  This immediacy was a necessary plank of the Claimants’ case because it would support the opinion expressed by Dr Tobon that the reason for sedimentation of the streams was that it arrived from the ROW at such a rate as to overwhelm the stream’s ability to purge itself.

This is the only time that the sediment reaches the water sources” {D6/100/1200}.  According to Snr Mesa, there were no problems during construction but “with the arrival of the rainy season, about 3 months after the construction of the pipeline, the earth on the [ROW] crumbled.

Returning to the expert evidence, however, it does not support the case being advanced by the Claimants of an overwhelming flow of sediment at the time of construction.

To similar effect, and commenting specifically on the state of the soil at {H3.5/5/1029} he said “in some areas light to moderate erosion is presented and frequent to moderate mass movement, principally so-called cow hooves, and very localised landslides.”  In providing his detailed analysis at {H3.5/5/1032} he wrote “Hydric erosion, and the risk of hydric erosion:  I observed various processes of localised erosion on the ROW, where ridges were probably built, because I found evidence of these structures in an advanced state of collapse.  I also observed small eroded areas with poor vegetation coverage at the southern extreme of [LC54].”  This is, by Dr Obando’s trenchant standards, very mild; and he attributed the cause to poor vegetation coverage, which he considered to be a consequence of soil degradation rather than specifically of erosion {H3.5/5/1039}.

I reject the evidence (primarily from Dr Card and Dr Tobon) that there was rapid and substantial erosion at the time of or soon after the opening of the ROW and find that erosion such as they have suggested did not happen.  I accept that the rate of erosion from the ROW per unit of area will have been greater than the background rate until Snr Mesa’s revegetation took hold, but there is no direct observational evidence of substantial or continuing erosion from the ROW on LC54.

Snr Herrera gave Snr Mesa a description of the processes that is largely consistent with the evidence of the videos.  First of all people with chain saws cut down vegetation and removed fences that had been on the ROW.  Then bulldozers cleared the ROW, removing all the grass and vegetation that was left.  A labourer told him that the bulldozer tore out all vegetation and churned up the earth. Then a digger excavated the trench, piling the earth by the trench where it was left for 1 or two days {D6/100/1187}.  I accept this as a general account of what happened.  Tearing out all vegetation was what the bulldozer was meant to do and some churning of the earth was inevitable and well evidenced on the DVDs.  It is not evidence that the limited supply of topsoil had not been separated out: there is ample evidence on the DVDs of bulldozers tearing out vegetation, churning the soil as bulldozers do, and separating out the topsoil at the same time with both the skill and the limitations to be expected of doing such an operation by bulldozer.  By the time Snr Mesa came to the farm, reconformation had not happened so that topsoil would not have been re-spread. </p>

At [4.2.2.3.3] he expressed the opinion that mixing and/or inversion of soils had occurred along the whole length of the ROW; and that there was over compaction of the soils along the whole length of the ROW “because of the observation and touch of soils at intervals along the whole length of the ROW, compared with the observation and touch of soils outside the ROW” {H3.5/5/1035}.

I do not consider that the differences in colouration between the various photographs provide independent support for an allegation of mixing: to my eyes, and in the light of the expert evidence that was given to assist the Court, the photographs of the holes dug on the ROW, when compared with their off-ROW comparators, are equally consistent with the retained presence of different horizons rather than the opposite.  What can be seen is that photographs LC54.12 and LC54.14 show only a narrow band of Horizon A, though the thickness of the horizon cannot accurately be assessed even by reference to the presence of Dr Obando’s dagger.  The thinness of the Horizon A supports the allegation of damage and reduction of the thickness of Horizon A at the point of the </p>

Because he selected sites that were intended to show observable damage, the absence of other reliable evidence that the band of Horizon A on LC54 was generally similarly thin precludes extrapolation to make such a general finding.  Furthermore, there is reliable evidence from Professor Montenegro, which I accept, that the observed state of the soils where he examined them was not consistent with serious mixing or inversion.  </p>

Instead of acknowledging that these results were adverse to his opinion that there was increased compaction on the ROW, Dr Obando tried to explain it away with the suggestion that the Claimants’ cattle did not feed (or, by implication walk) on the ROW {H3.5/5/1035}.  This speculative explanation was unjustified and contrary to the evidence of photographs {H5.4/5/872} and to the Claimants’ evidence that cattle do feed on the ROW, and I reject it as a matter of fact.

Revegetation was problematic, as already explained.  The Agroforestry Report in late 1997 identified that there was 60% coverage on the ROW, which was a combination of pasture and weeds: the weeds were indicated as being 40% though it is not clear whether this means 40% of 100% of the ROW or 40% of the 60% coverage.  To the left and right of the margin the coverage was 80% with a mixture of pasture and weeds (in unspecified proportions).  The most noteworthy species to the left and right of the ROW was said to be Brachiaria; on the ROW the most noteworthy species were said to be Brachiaria, poppy, sage and chilinchil.  The nutritional and sanitary condition was said to be fair to the left and on the ROW, and good outside the ROW’s right hand margin.  There was said to be a requirement for substantial quantities of fertiliser and planting of new herbaceous plants {K52/534T/25}.

Dr Obando’s first report said that the dominant vegetation on the ROW was generally carimagua and brachiaria decumbens grasses.  In degraded grasses shrub-like weeds proliferated. Vegetation cover on the ROW was generally good, though of poor quality {H3.5/5/1036}.  In his oral evidence Dr Obando went much further, stating at one point that there was no grass on the ROW, only pajon (meaning a number of types of dried weed {H3.5/5/1028}), which he said the cattle would not eat {Day31/48:24}.  He later appeared to limit this assertion to a sector in the north of the property {Day32/165:9}.  Dr Delgado’s evidence was that the vegetation off the ROW was more homogeneous, with the vegetation on the ROW being less dense and having a greater presence of weeds {H20.3/3/557}.  Contrary observational evidence came from Dr Uribe who said that the ROW is not distinguishable from the ground or the air {H6.1/1/241}, Dr Avila who considered that the pastures along the ROW and to its sides were in a very similar or consistent condition {H21.5/5/1185}, and Dr Card who said that there is no discernible difference in vegetation cover between that seen on the ROW when compared with that on the neighbouring adjoining land {H1.1/1/185}, and Dr Velez, whose evidence was that there were no significant changes to vegetation cover in the ROW and its area of influence, the main vegetation cover being weedy pastures {H5.4/5/873}.  Dr Card confirmed in his oral evidence that there was no discernible difference in the coverage at the time of his first visit, by which time the Claimants had re-seeded and fertilised the ROW {Day24/91:6}.   </p>

I am not persuaded that Dr Obando’s photographic evidence supports a finding of mixing in the holes he dug and, even if it did, it would not be safe to extrapolate to general conclusions because of his site sampling methods.  Taking into account the features to which I have referred above, the organic content readings do not support a finding of significant mixing.  Dr Obando supported his opinion on mixing by asserting that it had produced a drastic decline in the quality of the soil.  That assertion is not borne out by the chemical analyses that were undertaken.  Nor is it supported by the observational or the objective evidence on the coverage and quality of pasture on LC54: to the contrary, the fact that there is no material difference between the coverage and quality of pasture on and off the ROW strongly militates against a finding of substantial mixing.  On the basis of the evidence available to the Court I find that there was no significant or widespread mixing of soils on LC54; </p>

The absence of documentary records (particularly in the absence of Ocensa’s documents) means that the Defendant cannot show that specific attention was given to each of the streams by reference to records.  However, I infer that specific consideration was given to the watercourses on LC54 which led to the decision to use boring techniques to cross them: see [976].  There is a similar absence of any documentary or direct evidence of monitoring of the watercourses on LC54 or about what steps, if any, were taken to protect the watercourses from the consequences of erosion from the ROW.  No sediment traps were provided, but I do not consider that to have been negligent given the benign topography and lack of stockpiles or other reason to foresee excessive erosion that could feasibly be diverted into sediment traps.  I reject Dr Card’s evidence that revetment was necessary for the watercourses on LC54 to stabilise the banks and to prevent scour erosion over the trench backfill material {H1.4/22/973} because of the use of boring techniques.  The justification for the absence of revetment lies in the fact that the banks of the streams have not proved to be unstable at their crossing with the ROW: see [720.ii)]. </p>

The gradual nature of the build-up of sediment is evidenced by the fact that Snr Mesa neither fenced it off nor lost a cow in it until 2006.  Had there been a significant deposit of sediment from the ROW that made a material change to the size or swampiness of SW2, he would have noticed and done something to protect his cattle before 2006.  On this basis alone I would reject the Claimants’ case and expert evidence on the mechanism of how SW2 was formed, since it was Dr Tobon’s evidence that he would have expected W2 to transport sediment quickly and for sedimentation damage to have been noticeable around the area of the culvert quickly {Day28/114:7}.

On the basis of evidence which I summarise at [1064] I find that Snr Mesa carried out the canalisation works between 2002 and 2009, probably in the latter half of that period. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In his reports, Dr Card’s opinion was that “soil loss from temporary construction stockpiles located either side of the Ocensa ROW are the prime cause of sediment deposition in the fish pool …” {H1.6/24/1366} and see [1002.i)] above.  He attempted to sustain that opinion in his fourth report on the basis of his flawed assumptions and calculations; and he continued to maintain it in his oral evidence {Day25/155:1}.  In re-examination, he was given a summary of Snr Mesa’s evidence that flooding was a frequent occurrence and that he had continued to fish in the fish pool for two or three years and asked what effect that would have on his conclusions about sedimentation of the fish pool.  His answer was “that would change my conclusions slightly from that it was soil erosion coming from uphill from erosion point E1 and the failure of the ditch diverters and long term erosion control measures.  So a slight change of emphasis [as] to the cause ….” {Day27/96:22}.  Leaving on one side that this could not reasonably be described as “a slight change of emphasis”, the substance of this answer was that he recognised that the theory that he had espoused until then was untenable.  I agree and have no hesitation in rejecting the basis upon which the Claimants had previously advanced their case: there was no sudden deposit of sediment from the ROW which caused the sedimentation of W1 or the fish pool. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Two questions arise in relation to E1.  The first is where eroded soils would go.  By the end of the trial there was a measure of agreement between Dr Gundlach and Dr Savigny and I find that the blue arrows on his figure 2-5 on {H22/10/555} provide a reasonable summary of the lie of the land and the consequent tendency of sediment flows under the pull of gravity.  I accept Dr Savigny’s evidence that erosion from E1 or just to the north of it would flow towards E2 (described by Dr Gundlach as the holding ponds).  Further to the North some would also flow to the west, as illustrated by the most northerly blue arrows pointing to the left in both parts of figure 2-5.  I accept that sedimentation flowing out of E2 (the holding ponds) would flow in the direction of W1 towards LC54.  Also, in theory, sediment going west from the ROW on the adjoining property might follow a circuitous route that, in theory at least, might lead back to the source of W1 in the woods to the west of the ROW.  However, that would involve a significant distance over land and there is no evidence that satisfies me of any substantial quantities from E1 or the ROW near to it getting into W1 by that route.  I also accept that the flow line on the slope between the northern boundary of LC54 and E1 would tend to be down towards where W1 flows across the slope and towards LC54.  However, there is no evidence to justify a finding of significant increased sedimentation reaching W1 from the ROW on that slope in the medium to long term after revegetation was established.  Equally, there is nothing in either the dimensions of E1, its current state, or the flow lines that sediment from E1 would have followed to support an allegation of sudden and overwhelming sedimentation of E1.  There is no reliable evidence upon which to make a quantitive assessment of the contribution of E1 or even of its relative contribution to the sedimentation of W1.  At a more general level, the evidence does not establish that sediment from E1 flowing into W1 significantly changed the nature of W1 initially or with time.  It may have had the effect that W1 has become sedimented at a faster rate than would otherwise have been the case.  There is, however, no claim for the costs of more frequent removals of sediment from W1 or anything of that nature, so that an incremental rate of sedimentation is not significant unless it caused damage or expenditure that would not otherwise have been incurred.  Taking that as the touchstone, the increased sedimentation from E1 to W1 was not material. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The second question on E1 is why is it still poorly covered?  I accept that initially the laying of the pipeline through the area of E1 was a significant factor.  However, I accept Dr Savigny’s evidence that its present condition is a consequence of the congregation and passage of cattle over time, which is the responsibility of Snr Mesa’s neighbour and has prevented satisfactory revegetation as illustrated in the images to which I have referred. {H2.3/3/782} illustrates what are reasonably described as myriad livestock trails and I accept Dr Savigny’s explanation of the state of the area at {H2.3/3/791} at lines 1129-1140, supported as it is by Snr Mesa’s evidence at {Day6/71:1} ff.  It is not caused by any deficiency in the carrying out of the pipeline works as such. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dr Savigny’s opinion is that the sedimentation of W1 has been increased by breaching of the embankment dams at E2.  As is clear from my description of E1 and its effects, the embankment dams will have acted as collecting pits for sedimentation both from E1 and from the other surrounding land that was criss-crossed by cattle trails.  I accept Dr Savigny’s opinion that the embankment dams have been breached on a number of occasions and that the breaching of the dams would have caused sediment (some of which may have come from E1) to flow into W1.  The direct flow of sediment from E2 into W1 is to be contrasted with the indirect flow from E1 into W1 (which will have left some of any sediment from E1 on the land before it reached W1). However, the evidence does not enable me to reach any quantitative conclusions about the sediment from E2.  As with sediment passing from E1 into W1, it will have contributed to the processes that had been going on for years.  My assessment, based upon the opinion evidence of Dr Savigny, is that the effect of sediment from E2 is likely to have been greater than the effect of sediment from E1 on W1.  Beyond that it is not possible to go. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">For these reasons, I find that SW3, which predated the laying of the Ocensa pipeline as a result of natural processes unconnected with the pipeline, was not caused or materially affected in the short term by the pipeline works.  In the longer term, erosion from the ROW during the period before revegetation took hold, will have increased the rate of sedimentation of W1 but not to such an extent as to change materially the size or nature of SW3.  Erosion from E1 is now caused by the congregation and passage of cattle there.  While some sediment from E1 will have found its way across land to W1 and may have contributed to the sedimentation of the stream, any difference it has made has not been proved to be material.  It could have been excavated above the fish pool as happened below it, but the Claimants have chosen not to do so.   </p>

The second point of recital identified the damage caused by Ocensa as the destruction of “a bridge … located in the right of way and not paid in the initial negotiation [COP] 2,500,000.”  The third point of recital recorded that Snr Mesa had claimed COP4 million as payment for the damages caused in the plot identified in the second point of the recital, for “damages and temporary loss in transfer to pastures”, meaning that Snr Mesa had claimed COP 4 million on the basis that the destruction of the bridge had caused him to be unable temporarily to transfer cattle across it to pastures that he would otherwise have used. The fourth recorded that Ocensa thought that too high and assessed the value of the damages at COP2,000,000.  The first clause of the settlement contained the agreement that Ocensa would pay Snr Mesa COP2,500,000 “as the full and sole value of the damages caused to the plot identified in the First point of the recitals… .”  Snr Mesa explained that “they” had promised to rebuild the bridge immediately but had not done so.

Having recorded that Ocensa was fully paid up “for all damage, losses or compensation resulting caused or resulting from any legal, contractual or non-contractual relationship in the course of the contract of Easement of pipeline and Transit legally constituted for the purposes of carrying out the construction works of the pipeline …” Snr Mesa renounced the right to present any form of claim against Ocensa “regarding their obligations, agreements, loss and damage to the pastures, crops or movable property <span style="font-style:italic">inside the corridor</span> of the line [“por dentro del corridor”], or the alteration in the economic exploitation of the plot during the construction of the pipeline”.  It will be noted that both of the LC54 Paz y Salvos referred to the 1367 square metres of sobreanchos.  If the Ocensa Paz y Salvo is read in isolation, the effect appears to be to treat the sobreanchos as an additional width of the ROW and to settle the claim for sobreanchos as an extension of the landowners’ right to payment for additional land as contemplated by Clause 7 of the ROW Agreements: see [369].  However, whether that was the reason or whether the fact of the sobreanchos was recorded in each Paz y Salvo as a form of “belt and braces” approach, the over-riding intention of the Paz y Salvos to settle potential liabilities both inside and outside the ROW was clear.

He may have had that knowledge and understanding by March 1997 when he entered into the settlement agreement with Ocensa; he probably had it by the end of April 1997 when he sent his complaint to Saipem; and he certainly had it by July 1997 when he entered into the settlement agreement with Saipem and by August 1997 when he entered into the two Paz y Salvos on the same day, one with Ocensa and one with Saipem.  I am also in no doubt at all that he knew that the intended effect of the Paz y Salvos was to bring an end to any possibility of making further claims arising out of damage caused by the Ocensa pipeline, whether on the ROW or beyond it.   </p>

The area on either side of the entrance road had been an area of wetland before the Ocensa pipeline was laid {H2.8/10/2110} and had been subject to flooding for many years: see [943] above.  During the same period, but before resorting to digging the canal, he imported some loads of material and dumped them on the entrance road to replace materials that had been lost by the flooding.  He repeated that exercise when the loads he initially dumped were washed downstream by the periodic flooding: this continued until the excavation of the canal cured the problem of the wetlands and the flooding in that area. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There is no truth in the alleged factual basis for this claim.  Quite how it came to be made and pursued in this form is not a matter for this judgment.  It is sufficient to refer to the findings that I have already made at [951]-[952], [1040] and [1063].  In summary, Snr Mesa had an operative fish pool that was big enough to offer the prospect of commercial production from the end of 1996 to about the end of 1999 or early 2000.  It was achieved by simple excavation and the placing of a dam situated on the course of W1, which has always had limited flow rates and may be dry or virtually dry in the dry season.  It was therefore not capable of providing the levels of oxygenation necessary to maximise fish production in the way discussed at [804].  I do not accept that the evidence advanced on behalf of the Claimants as to the numbers of fish farmed or their weights while the fish pool was operative is reliable.  Snr Mesa maintained that he had harvested approximately 1000 fish every six months from 1992/1993.  I do not accept that he had any memory of this level of fish production either from 1992/1993 or at any stage.  I reject the implicit suggestion that a stream with the limitations of W1 either could or did sustain such quantities of fish: to the extent that the claim is based upon theoretical calculations it is therefore unreliable and to be rejected.  I also am unable to accept that Snr Mesa invested the level of interest or organisation that would have been required to farm fish on that scale.  The reality, I find, is that he took the opportunity to have a bigger hole dug while the pipeline workers were on his farm, but did not at any stage thereafter attempt to manage a commercial fish farming organisation.  That is evidenced by the fact that he took no steps to keep the pool clear of the sedimentation that was gradually accumulating in the pool.  In his witness statement he said that “the fish pond can be re-built, but the truth is that I do not have the spirit anymore to do it” {D6/100/1209}.  I agree, provided that it is not being suggested that Snr Mesa’s spirit was broken by anything to do with the pipeline works.  I formed the clear impression as he gave his evidence and find that Snr Mesa’s interest in LC54 was as a cattle venture and holiday home which, he hoped, might provide the possibility of selling off plots of land over time.  If he had wanted to re-establish the fish pool, he could have done so {Day45/115:13}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The development of the claim for lame cattle is traced at {C4/4.9/965}.  The claim was first raised in the June 2012 Schedule of Loss {B4.1/23/272}.  It is maintained in the same terms in the Re-amended SOL {B4.4/3/124}.  The substance of the claim is that “the sedimentation of three streams on the Property led to the formation of swamp areas in or around the pastures. … The wet or humid conditions caused by the swamp areas had an adverse effect on the cattle’s health, notably leading to a loss of weight.  Every year, on average 11.5 cattle became lame as a result.  Señor Mesa sold lame cattle as soon as the illness was noticed and purchase a healthy replacement.  However, Señor Mesa incurred an expense in the 30% shortfall between the sale price of lame cattle and that of healthy cattle.”  The claim is made in respect of the period from 1996 to date and continuing for the future. </p>

Snr Herrera’s evidence was that the problem occurred in the summer, which is counter-intuitive: his evidence was otherwise so vague as to be of no assistance on this topic {D6/111/1294}.  Snr Mesa’s only reference to lameness in his witness statement, apart from his general endorsement of the Claimants’ Schedule of Loss, was to say of cattle that got stuck in the mire but did not die “There are cows that become lame; they have to make more effort in their legs to find water and because it is a continuous effort, they will start to have problems with their hoofs and this causes limping” {D6/100/1204}. Even assuming that this means that making effort in their legs when finding water (which is not clear) this is insufficient to establish a causal link between the alleged effects of the pipeline and the onset of lameness.  In his oral evidence  Snr Mesa made clear that he did not know the reason for the lameness {Day7/61:6}.  Neither Snr Ramirez nor Snr Herrera were in a position to give reliable or useful evidence on the cause of lameness.   </p>

Neither of these things happened.  The only evidence of any contact with a vet was elicited in re-examination, when Snr Mesa said that he he had spoken to a vet who had been unable to diagnose the cause of the lameness {Day7/62:6}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dr Delgado did not examine a lame cow and was therefore unable to put forward a reliable diagnosis.  He appeared to recognise this in his first report when he said “it is feasible and reasonable that the damages to the water sources and the resulting formation of the humid areas of the La Fe 1 property are responsible for the hoof problems that the Claimants report; therefore it is possible that the number of animals reported by the claimants fell sick” {H20.3/3/566}.  Feasibility and possibility are insufficient to establish causation, particularly when the expert has not examined an affected animal.  His underlying suggestion in support of the feasibility and possibility was that cattle had to place their hooves in muddy areas in order to access drinking water and that their hooves are therefore damp.  The theory continues that the skin and the hoof remain moist during most of the day and therefore become soft so that when the cow moves around the pasture in search of grass their hooves can be injured by rocks or pieces of wood due to their fragility.  It is not clear where on LC54 it is suggested by Dr Delgado that the cattle would be having to put their feet in muddy areas.  Since the lameness started, SW2 has been fenced off except when it has been dry enough for feeding cattle; and the swampy areas on W1 and W3 are limited.  Dr Delgado’s underlying analysis was challenged by Dr Avila, whose evidence was that cattle would not stand in the swampy areas for long periods unless they got stuck there (which, notably, was not the theory being propounded by Dr Delgado).  I accept Dr Avila’s evidence on this point.  However, it is not strictly necessary to make a finding as Dr Delgado’s evidence is (in scientific terms) mere speculation with nothing to support it by way of observation of the cattle in the field or examination of a lame cow.  Nor is it necessary in this judgment to accept the challenge laid down by the Defendant in its closing submissions by asking why Dr Delgado had supported this claim {C4/4.9/973}.  </p>

Before the June 2012 Schedule of Loss there were claims that Snr Mesa could no longer maintain the same number of cattle on LC54, but there was no claim for renting additional pasture as such.  From the 2012 Schedule of Loss until the January 2015 Re-amended Schedule of Loss the claims stated that Snr Mesa rented additional pasture for which he paid rent.  Thus “For the six months during the construction of the pipieline, Señor  Mesa had to rent pasture for a futher 35 cattle, as the construction works reduced the availability of pasture on the Property. … In 1996, the cost of pasture rental was COP 3,000 per cow and per month.  Accordingly, Señor  Mesa had to expend a futher COP 630,000 to accommodate his cattle during the construction of the pipeline”; and “Following the construction of the pipeline, Señor Mesa had to rent additional pasture to accommodate his cattle due to the damage to the Property. …  Señor Mesa already rented pasture for 90 cattle, but had to rent for 3 more cattle during 12 months of the year as a result of the damage to the Property’s pastures and water sources.  For the period of 1997 to 2002, the average cost of pasture rental was COP 4,000 per cow and per month.  The additional yearly expense in pasture rental during this period therefore amounts to COP 144,000”; and “From 2003 … Señor Mesa still has to rent additional pastures for 6 cows that he would not otherwise have needed to rent for 4-5 months of the year during the dry season.  For the period of 2003 to 2012, the average cost of pasture rental was COP 6,000 per cow and per month.  The additional yearly expense in pasture rental during this peiod therefore amounts to COP 162,000” {B4.4/3/124}. </p>

In answer to a question from the Court suggesting that such an approach would be inappropriate Snr Mesa confirmed that “you never look at the size of the farm in itself, when you want to go and rent more land you look at the size of the pasture fields and then you calculate how many cows you can put on it. Besides, they have pasture fields reserved, really, earmarked, and then they say, they distribute the cattle, I am going to put 30 here, 20 here, et cetera.  So they have pasture fields in reserve for when they don’t have enough space left on one, they put them on another.  All properties are divided into pasture fields.” {Day6/156:14}. So the amount paid out for rent would be determined substantially by the pasture fields that were available for rent, onto which the renter might put a number of cattle up to the maximum that the field would sustain.  Snr Mesa made clear that the numbers of cattle he would put on rented pasture would depend upon the numbers he decided to buy {Day6/151:5}.

Such a formulation would not work either because it presupposes that Snr Mesa always maximised the number of cattle that he could maintain.  This presupposition is inconsistent with the vaccination certificates produced by Snr Mesa which show fluctuating numbers.  It is also inconsistent with the evidence of Dr Velez, to which I have referred at [1024] above, that the management of LC54 was not a technical operation geared to the loading capacity of each paddock and of the farm.  In the light of that evidence in particular and of all the evidence about the operation being conducted on LC54 it would be wrong to assume or find that a reduction in the theoretical load carrying capacity of LC54 would result in (a) any or any proportionate reduction in the numbers of cattle maintained on the property, or (b) any or any proportionate reduction in the number of cattle maintained overall by Snr Mesa, or (c) any or any proportionate increase in the numbers of cattle placed on rented pasture off LC54.  In the light of my finding that there was no material reduction in the load bearing capacity of LC54 once revegetation had taken hold, these questions are hypothetical.  If they were not, and it had been shown that there was some relatively modest reduction in load capacity (such as in theory might lead to the need for additional pasture for 3 or 6 cattle) I </p>

It would of course have been understandable if he had moved cattle off LC54 during the works, but it is not self-evident that he would have rented additional pasture for some or all of them given the availability of CF54 and the fact that, as I find, he routinely rented additional pasture in the years before 1996 in any event.  In addition, it is evident that he kept at least some cattle on La Fe 1 during or shortly after the works because that is how the cow that died near the bridge came to be there.  It is therefore necessary to examine the claim and the supporting evidence with particular care.  The following material points emerge: </p>

I conclude that there probably was a relatively short period when Snr Mesa took cattle out of the fields through which the pipeline was being laid.  I am not satisfied that it was for materially longer than 2 months in all, and I am not satisfied that Snr Mesa cleared all the affected fields for all of that period.  Nor am I satisfied that he took 35 cows off to pasture belonging to other people.  I find that he probably put at least some of any cows that he moved from La Fe 1 onto La Fe 2.  If he did place some additional cattle on rented pasture, I am not satisfied that the exercise involved renting additional pasture as opposed to putting cattle on pasture he was already renting.  Finally, I do not accept that he made payments for the additional pasture.  I find that the figure claimed is a construct of what might have been paid rather than being based on any recollection or other reliable basis.   </p>

This way I did not lose any milk from the cattle on the rented pastures on other farms” {D6/100/1178}.  Even in the absence of this evidence I would have rejected as incredible a suggestion that a farmer such as Snr Mesa, who had long notice of the coming of the pipeline, would have put lactating cows onto rented pasture where he could not milk them, leaving them to suffer the pain of enforced drying off (not to mention his own loss of income) that would inevitably follow from such a course.  </p>

It is alleged that the Claimants repaired the gravel path repeatedly.

For the most part, the ROW passed through pasture with occasional non-fruit trees also being present.  Despite that, I accept that some fruit trees were felled during the construction works, but I am not satisfied that it was in the numbers alleged.  Had there been that many trees on the ROW or in positions that meant they were liable to be cut down, I consider that Snr Mesa would have ensured that they were noted on the ROW Agreements as specific damages, which he did not do.  Alternatively, if that number of trees had been felled which had not been noted on or covered by the ROW Agreements, I consider it probable that he would have claimed for them when making his claims in 1997, which he did not do.  Snr Mesa knew at the time that the Paz y Salvo for the ROW covered the damage that had been caused on the ROW, including fruit trees {Day6/114:12} so that it was his understanding that he could not later bring a claim for them, despite the fact that they had not been mentioned in the settlement agreement or the Paz y Salvo itself {Day6/131:18}.  I will consider the legal significance of the Paz y Salvo separately: but it is relevant here to the question whether there were the numbers of fruit trees on the ROW that are now claimed.  The fact that he did not raise them separately as items of claim in 1997 supports my conclusion that there were fewer trees than now alleged.

This is different from the original assertion that <span style="font-style:italic">the land</span> was arid.  Dr Obando supported this claim on the basis that “according to [Snr Mesa’s] statement, the sedimentation caused prolonged flooding in the areas with pastures, crops and trees.  This prolonged flooding caused the death of several plant species that are susceptible to oxidative stress. …” {H3.10/20/2325}.  He was supported in this analysis by Dr Velez {H5.7/12/1747}.  The view of both experts was predicated on the formation of the swampy areas being caused by sedimentation from the ROW, which I have rejected as the correct explanation for the flooding, progressive sedimentation and formation of swampy areas on LC54.  It follows that I reject the suggestion that fruit trees off the ROW were killed in the way alleged by the Claimants or for any reason attributable to the pipeline works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Assessing quantum on the basis of four unidentified fruit trees cut down during the works on the ROW is not straightforward, for two main reasons.  First, the value of fruit trees to the Claimants varies according to type, with the annual net income from mango being higher than the annual net income from lemon or guava.  Second, the Claimants have subsequently planted new fruit trees around the house, which their closing submissions accept can be taken into account as mitigation of any loss {C4/3.7/1091}.  There was no reason why replacement trees could not be planted at any stage after the pipeline works had finished.  If replacements were not planted, it suggests that the remaining fruit trees were sufficient to the Claimants’ needs and additional product would have been surplus to requirements.  I conclude that the Claimants have not shown any continuing loss for a period of more than about 10 years, during which time replanting and effective mitigation could have been achieved. Because it is not possible to identify the type of fruit trees, I adopt a figure that is loosely based upon the annual claimed production for lemon trees, which are the middle-ranking trees in terms of net income according to the Re-amended Schedule of Loss.  At {B4.4/3/131} the Claimants allege that the net annual income </p>

Four lemon trees for 10 years would therefore equate to COP276,000.  Allowing for the possibility that one or more of the trees may have been a mango tree, I would round that up to COP500,000 (or approximately £185). </p>

Snr Mesa’s first settlement with Ocensa alone was made on 6 March 1997.  By then any damage to the ROW was done, though the unsatisfactory results of the initial revegetation may not have been apparent.  He then complained to Saipem on 30 April 1997 reiterating complaints he had been making since December 1996 and entered into a settlement with Saipem and Ocensa on 5 July 1997.  He then signed Paz y Salvos for Ocensa and Saipem respectively on 11 August 1997, which expressly excluded the claim for the cow that had died because of the lack of the bridge on or near the ROW.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Velez is a tough and canny campesino farmer who can neither read nor write.  He did not show signs of being overawed, and was quite able to hold his own in crossexamination, which he did with courtesy at all times.  He was firm in much of the evidence he gave.  Often, as I find, he was unjustifiably firm in giving apparently clear and certain answers that were wrong.  Those representing him submit that this misplaced certainty was a cultural response, particularly when being asked about dates.  I accept that his grasp of dates as such was limited and that he sometimes found it easier, when trying to give an account, to give it by general reference to whether something happened before or after other events rather than by saying specifically (by date) when it happened or how long before his narration it took place.  To that extent I accept the Claimants’ submission summarised at {C4/3.7/1227}ff that he had difficulty recollecting dates, sometimes appeared to use a period of “three years” as a default expression for variable periods, and that he could be suggestible as to dates.  Although I accept that he found it easier to deal with dates by general reference to other events, it does not follow that his evidence when given in that way was any more reliable than when he tried to be more specific as to dates or periods.  Overall I find that he was not a reliable witness about when things happened, even on those occasions when he gave an account in his evidence in a manner consistent with an account he had given previously.  This is a particular disadvantage for the Claimant and the Court given the fact that, as with many campesinos, Snr Velez did not routinely keep documentary records. </p>

Documents have been disclosed which show Snr Velez to be a man who has always known how to complain and would do so if he thought that some wrong was done to him; and that he was ready and able to mobilise others (such as a notary {M/186T/747.3}, the local ombudsman {M/186T/747.9}, and groups of complainants {M/186T/747.14}) to work on his behalf if he thought appropriate.  I rely upon that demonstrated ability in support of my initial description of Snr Velez as tough and canny.  He told the Court that he had earned respect in his region because he had stood up to guerrillas {Day5/85:3}, which I accept.  The disclosed documents also demonstrate beyond argument to the contrary that LC74 sustained damage as a result of the laying of the ODC pipeline, that Snr Velez claimed in respect of such damage and that he was compensated for it.  The precise significance of that damage will be considered later; but the general thrust of Snr Velez’ evidence, that he did not anticipate that the Ocensa pipeline would cause problems because the ODC one had not caused many problems {D8/125/1495} is unsustainable and wrong. </p>

He was, in my judgment, a poor historian whose evidence could not generally be relied upon on any matters of detail or on some of the more general strands of his evidence.

In his witness statement he said that he started to experience problems in about 2002 or 2003; but in oral evidence he said that the problems started in 2009 {Day5/134:1} ff.  That provides a sensible chronological explanation for his decision to remove his cattle soon after, in 2010, and I accept it.  The second, Snr Jaramillo, helped Snr Velez build his new house – of which more later.  On the Defendant indicating that it did not wish to cross-examine him in the light of Snr Velez’ evidence, his statement was admitted in written form. </p>

At the northern end of the Ridge there is a marked change, with a steep slope [“the South Slope”], down which the ROW passed into and across a small valley before climbing up an almost equally steep slope on the other side [“the North Slope”] to its exit from LC74.  Where the Ridge has an average gradient of about 9%, the South and North Slopes have average gradients of about 30% {H2.3/3/891}, with parts being steeper than that: see the summary of readings at {H1.6/24/1454}.  Flowing through the valley between the South Slope and the North Slope is the main watercourse on LC74, known as W1 (or, sometimes, as “El Coco”), which flows through the valley from west to east.  The area where the ROW crosses W1 is known as the Quebrada Crossing.  In rough terms, the distance from the ROW’s southern entrance to LC74 to the northern end of the Ridge is about 150 metres (from 428+071 to 428+220); the distance from the northern end of the Ridge (roughly where the South Slope starts to take over) down to the Quebrada crossing is about 120 metres (from 428+220 to 428+340); and the distance from the Quebrada crossing to the top of the North Slope and exit is about 160 metres (from 428+340 to 428+500). </p>

When the ODC and Ocensa pipelines were laid, Snr Velez and his family lived in a house in the valley to the west of the Ridge, near to which they had various other structures including a pig pen and a chicken hutch.  Stream W1 rose in the valley below and to the West of the Ridge towards the south of LC74.  It joined another stream, W2, which rose not far away.  Snr Velez got water for the old house and his animals by gravity from stream W1 at a point after it had merged with stream W2.  There was another small water source, emerging from a spring known as SP5, which rose on the same western side of the Ridge, about half way along the length of and 50 metres below the Ridge.  Water from SP5 and any other water from its small catchment valley would run into W2 at a point upstream of where W2 merges with W1. </p>

That is now fed with water that is pumped from W1 near to but further upstream than the point from which he drew his water for the old house.

A number of features stand out prominently.  The Ridge itself looks in reasonable condition to the untrained eye.  The main western slopes below the ridge appear to be almost triangular, falling down from the line made by the Ridge from its entry point to the gate above the old house.  There is a line of exposed soil going down from the gate towards the old house.  To the south of that line it is just possible to see the lie of the land within the triangle, which provides a small catchment area including SP5 in its middle.  It is not clearly apparent from this photograph, but I find on this and other evidence that the exposed area coming down from the gate runs either on or just beyond a ridge that forms the northern limit of that catchment area.  </p>

Its particular value is in showing the triangular area to which I have referred (which is described as AF2) and the flow of the stream down from SP5, which passes by the old house to join W2 before W2 in turn joins W1.  Although not clear from the photographs, as Snr Velez got his water by gravity from W1 after it had joined W2, it follows that the merged streams were above the level of the old house at that point. As delineated on this annotated image, the clear erosion below the gate from the Ridge is just outside AF2, which is correct because of the presence of the ridge on which the erosion is found.  And it highlights the fact that the clear erosion is directly above the old house. </p>

It shows the topography of the Ridge itself to be uncomplicated.  {H5.4/5/956} is a general view of the ROW looking south from near the gate that is above the old house.  {H5.4/5/957} provides the reverse view from near the entry point of the ROW towards the new house and pens, with SP6 being off to the right in an area with no more than gentle slopes.  These two photographs were taken for Dr Velez’ original report during the dry season.  A similar view is given by {H7.4/4/1007}, taken by Dr Tobon in November 2011.  These photographs show the ROW reasonably well vegetated along the Ridge.  {H8.13/13/3376} is a similar view of the ROW looking south along the Ridge taken on 24 June 2010 (during the wet season).  Dr Obando was grudging in his acceptance that it shows dense unweeded pasture in good condition {Day32/28:11}, which it clearly does.  Dr Card’s reaction to the state of the Ridge as shown in {H2.4/4/905} (which was taken on 19 July 2012, also during the wet season) was not grudging: he agreed that the Ridge was in “splendid” condition {Day26/97:24}.  To similar effect, {L7/847/862} shows the Ridge looking north towards Snr Velez’ new home and corral, with grass that appears to be abundant and in good condition. </p>

The channel in which SP5 rises can be seen clearly at {H7.4/4/1000}, which also shows the significant slope up to the left of the channel towards the ridge that I have described as coming down from near the gate on the ROW.  The area of erosion coming down from the gate on the ROW is directly above the old house, as is clearly shown by {L7/848/863}, {L7/850/865}, {L7/852/867} and {L7/853/868} and {H2.4/4/908}.   </p>

There are exposed areas of soil where cuts were made to the east of the ROW at the side of the South Slope and heavily trafficked paths up and down each slope.  {H5.4/5/958}, taken in January 2012, provides a similar view and illustrates the exposed area where the cut was made to the east of the South Slope and the relative lack of vegetation on parts of the South Slope.  {L7/849/864} shows the South Slope and its relationship with the Ridge, the gate on the ROW at the top of the slope and the area in which the old house is situated.  {H2.4/4/909} provides a view of the longitudinal channel to the east of the South Slope, also seen in a more general view of the South Slope showing the bare track down the slope as it was in February 2011 {H5.4/5/969}.  {H1.1/1/215} shows scouring and erosion at the bottom of the longitudinal channel, where water is funnelled back onto unprotected soil. </p>

The position of soil cement sack and gabion walls is indicated on the lower reaches of AF1, near to and above the position of SP1-SP4. Towards the top of the North Slope the profile becomes complicated, as illustrated by {H2.4/4/942} and {H2.4/4/943}.  Looking straight up the North Slope and working from left to right, there is a cut at the left hand side (which I find was made in the course of the ODC works and call “the ODC Cut”), then a relatively flat area before a further fall (less steep than the ODC Cut) caused by another cut (which I find was made in the course of the Ocensa works and call “the Ocensa Cut”) and another relatively flat stretch to the right hand side of the ROW.  The ODC Cut is approximately 5 metres in slope length and falls at an angle of about 42º below the horizontal: it is therefore about 3.3 metres in vertical height from top to bottom.  The Ocensa Cut has a short section of similar steepness to the ODC Cut but is in general less prominent and steep {H2.4/4/944}.  Apart from the evidence that the two cuts are attributable to the ODC and the Ocensa works respectively, the precise boundaries of (and overlap between) the two ROWs cannot be identified. </p>

Dr Savigny assesses that the cut slope to the east of the South Slope is 90-100% exposed soil, which I accept as a reasonable general assessment.  The image also shows that the slope immediately above the old house is subject to erosion with what Dr Savigny described as a “channelized erosion scar” {H2.3/3/894}.

As elsewhere, the soils are fragile and susceptible to erosion, with steepness of slope being a factor that increases that susceptibility.  Also, as discussed elsewhere, the process of deforestation will have led to increased rates of water run-off and erosion.  It is material that, in the case of LC74, the ODC and Ocensa pipelines were running through land most of which had been deforested within the last 10 or 15 years and that, in the case of the Ocensa pipeline, where its ROW overlapped with that of the ODC pipeline, it was running through land that had already been subject to major and recent disruption. </p>

I have set out the Agreement in detail at [256].  Clause 3 identified that “within the property, the works necessary for the construction of the … Pipeline with buried pipes of 24” (inches), affecting a section of the land of Twenty Meters (20 mts) in width by 424 Meters in length for a total of 8,480 Square Meters … [sic].”  Clause 6 provided that “as compensation for the easement right and the Damages and injuries caused, [ODC] shall pay [Snr Velez] the sum of $798,000 as follows: 1) 70% of the total sum … once this document is executed… . 2) The remaining 30% … by way of easement to the granting of the respective Public Deed.  PARAGRAPH: the total value of this compensation, …, contains, pursuant to Article 5 of Decree No. 1886/1954 not only the rights of transit, occupancy and use of the area described in Clause Three, but also the injuries or damages caused during the construction performed in the property and particularly, those related to the attached list, containing an inventory of goods that will be affected during the works, in accordance with the estimates made by the parties.”  Clause 11 stated that the legal easement of the pipeline was subject to the rules of the Civil Code, the Petroleum Code, Decree 1886/1954 and to the Mining Code, where pertinent.  The inventory of goods referred to in Clause 6 was annexed and, under the heading “Description of Damages” stated “Destruction of 8,400 [sic] m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> of Uribe grass, 480 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>of mountain, 40 meters of fence of 4 threads.”  It is apparent that the destruction of 8,400 (in place of 8,480) m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> of Uribe grass was the surface of the ROW.

First, it is clear that there were gullies in the ROW which had a depth of 18m and were 4m wide.  Second, the gullies had been produced by rainfall waters.  Third, 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>of grassland is going to be destroyed. And, fourth, the grassland is going to be destroyed “because the hill is going to be used to cover the gullies.”  What is not specifically stated is the exact location of either the gullies, the hill or the 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>of grassland.  The only reference to location (apart from the general identification of La Nieve) is the reference to km 108+400.  No submissions were addressed to this point.  I note however, that in the letter of 14 January 1996, to which I refer below, La Nieve was said to be “located at kilometer 109”, with another farm (El Tajo) being said to be “located at kilometer 108” and a third farm (Monterey) said to be “located at kilometers 108 to 109”.  I do not know how any of those locations, or the location of the gullies referred to in the First ODC Settlement Agreement, were settled on or whether any or all of them are accurate.  </p>

In the absence of any direct witness evidence about where the gullies were, I consider it to be highly probable and find that they were on the steep slopes of LC74 because there is no reason to suppose that ODC would either have wanted or have been allowed by Snr Velez to destroy 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> of his grassland in order to remedy gullies on someone else’s land: ODC would have wanted to minimise the distance they had to transport the materials, and Snr Velez would have been keen to protect his topsoil.  I bear in mind that 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> is equivalent to a strip about 70 metres wide running the whole 150 metre length of the Ridge.  This illustrates the significance of the area in question, though there is no internal or witness evidence to indicate precisely where the area in fact was apart from the reference to “the hill”.  It is to my mind inconceivable that Snr Velez would not have remembered the stripping of such an area for use on someone else’s land.  As it is, I was not convinced at the time he gave his evidence and, on review, am not convinced now that Snr Velez had no recollection of what this settlement agreement was about.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">On this evidence and for these reasons I find that the First ODC Settlement came into existence because ODC needed to destroy an additional 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> of grassland on LC74 in order to carry out remedial works to large and deep gullies that had formed on either the North Slope or the South Slope or both slopes as a result of heavy rainfall.  I reject Snr Velez’ evidence that he had no recollection of what this settlement agreement was about.  Although there is no evidence about the carrying out of the works contemplated by the First ODC Settlement; there is no reason to suppose that they were not done, as Snr. Velez was compensated for them. Despite the absence of witness evidence, it seems most likely (and probable) that the First ODC Settlement related to and involved the stripping of soil which came from Field AF3, and I make a finding of fact to that effect, relying in part on Dr Savigny’s analysis of the state of AF3 in 1995 to which I will return. It also seems probable that it was those works that formed the subject of the First ODC Settlement that the Claimant had in mind (if he himself applied his mind to it at all) when mistakenly alleging in his 2012 Further Information that such stripping works were caused by Ocensa.  Having reviewed all of the evidence relating to the allegation of stripping Field AF3 as set out above and the other evidence (and lack of evidence) presented in relation to that allegation, I record the finding of fact at this stage that the stripping of soil from field AF3 alleged in the 2012 Further Information was attributable to the ODC works and not the Ocensa works. </p>

Snr Velez’ complaint in the letter was that he had “suffered damages on one of his farm’s pasture fields, below the pipeline.  The land along the line has blocked the passage of a water current, thus forming a huge puddle of about 50 meters long and 20 meters wide.  In addition, backhoes have been crossing my property, leaving in their wake a slope about 50 meters long, which has damaged my land without paying me any compensation.

The first is Snr Velez’ assertion in his letter that “the land along the line” had blocked the passage of water.  On its own that is consistent with a blockage on the line of the ROW causing a puddle upstream of the ROW.  The second piece of evidence is the statement in the settlement agreement that what formed was “a lake with sediments”, which suggests disturbance of W1 by, or at least including, a process of sedimentation.  The third is Snr Velez’ evidence in the course of cross-examination which, as it seemed to me at the time and still seems on review, settled on an answer </p>

The fifth is Snr Velez’ evidence, to which I refer in more detail below, that the lost ODC cheque was related to the need to do further work because a piece of his land was being carried downhill to the stream, a large amount of mud had come down in that area and that a channel with cement was the proposed remedy.  This evidence supports the finding that the Second ODC Settlement was concerned with sedimentation from the South Slope, where subsequently a cement channel was installed: see generally [1328] below.  In reaching this last conclusion I have taken into account the fact that the First Ocensa Settlement was reached soon after the conclusion of the Second ODC Settlement, and my review of the First Ocensa Settlement at [1317] below. </p>

The Agreement refers expressly to sedimentation; and the fact that Dr Savigny did not identify the swamp as such in the 1995 image is not determinative of the position then because of the limitations of his exercise.  In any event, the Second ODC Settlement was concluded some 8 months after the 1995 aerial photograph was taken on 30 September 1995, so that both conditions on the ground and the parties’ description of what they were settling may reasonably have changed, just as the dimensions referred to changed between the letter of complaint and the date of the Settlement. </p>

The Annex described the damages in conjunction with photographs that are of such poor quality as to be useless: “Damages in an area of 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> due to current breakers and strong rainfall in the region.

But he said it related to the Ocensa pipeline, not ODC {Day4/90:24} ff.  By the time of the Third ODC Settlement, the Ocensa pipeline had been laid; and there is no documentary or other evidence that determines when the problem that led to it first arose.  The Claimants submit that a portion of the ODC ROW was re-worked and re-graded by Ocensa and that this is therefore irrelevant to the present litigation {C4/3.7/1148}.  What matters, to my mind, is that responsibility for the problem was accepted as resting with ODC, who settled the claim.  This settlement agreement is therefore evidence (and I find) that heavy rain caused damage and erosion, which caused the ODC pipe to become exposed for reasons that were not attributable to Ocensa and therefore remained the responsibility of ODC.  The damage, erosion and exposure of the ODC pipe necessitated substantial works to cover the pipe again and caused lasting damage that affected 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>of Snr Velez’ land.  In the light of Snr Velez’ evidence, I find that the erosion and exposure of the ODC pipe occurred on the North Slope and was sufficiently wide and deep to cause a soldier to fall and break his ribs.  It is to be noted that the combined area of AF1 (3,308 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>) and SW1-SW3 (3,740 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>) is significantly less than the 10,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>for which Snr Velez was compensated under this Settlement.   </p>

In his witness statement he maintained that the ODC pipeline "didn’t cause many problems” {D8/125/1495} at [54].  In his oral evidence he accepted that some damage was caused by the ODC pipeline, including sedimentation of water courses, but he maintained that it was less severe than the damage caused by the larger-bore Ocensa pipeline works because Ocensa had failed to take necessary protection measures {Day5/18:9}, and he continued to maintain that the ODC pipeline works did not block water sources {Day5/15:6}. </p>

Allowing for the acknowledged lack of precision inherent in the exercise (so that any percentages are approximate), I found his analysis to be both careful and compelling, and I accept it. </p>

Dr Savigny considered that the photograph evidenced a recent change in the course of the channel of W1, which he considered had happened between 2009 and 2010. Elsewhere, it was his view that the mainstream channel passing by the disturbed area downstream of the crossing showed less evidence of recent instability, which he considered to be consistent with the evidence that the disturbed area had impacted the mainstream channel sometime earlier - in his view, shortly before the aerial photograph was taken in September 1995.  On that basis he formed the view that the disturbed ground had in some way obstructed the original stream course thereby causing flooding and forcing it into a new channel a short distance south of the crossing.  Dr Obando disagreed with Dr Savigny’s analysis.  His opinion was that the picture showed a colluvial zone, not a flooding zone.

Furthermore, I find that his evidence about the relative damage that was caused by the ODC and Ocensa pipelines respectively is fatally undermined by his inability to give any reliable evidence about the state of his property before Ocensa works started.  This does not entail wholesale rejection of his account of how the Ocensa works were carried out, but it means that I place no weight on generalised assertions from Snr Velez about the relative damage caused by the two sets of pipeline works.  </p>

In particular, there had been substantial erosion damage to both the North Slope and the South Slope and protracted and serious sedimentation from those slopes which had compromised the land in the area of the crossing of W1 and the area identified by Dr Savigny as disturbed in 1995 for about 100 m below the crossing. I find that the sedimentation was sufficient not only to block the flow of the stream so that a huge (if temporary) puddle was created upstream from the crossing but also to cause chronic sedimentation of the area downstream which would in turn have caused or contributed to overflowing. To this extent I find that both Dr Savigny and Dr Obando were partially correct in their analysis of what was shown by Dr Savigny’s figure LC74-11: although that photograph post-dates the Ocensa works, I am satisfied and find that the stream at and below the crossing was subject to repeated sedimentation and flooding in the period before Ocensa started its works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In his witness statement at [82] {D8/125/1496} Snr Velez maintained that he never went to a notary to sign documents.  That was wrong, as he accepted in his oral evidence {Day4/98:7} and as is supported by documents he signed which were notarised.  It is also apparent from the documents and from his evidence that he had considerable dealings with Snr Alfonso Medina from the time of the Ocensa ROW Easement to when negotiating settlements with Ocensa (as outlined later).  Snr Medina was described in a letter from Snr Velez to Ocensa in September 1998 {M/186T/747.1} as the Land Negotiation Engineer of Ocensa in the municipality of Puerto Berrio, which explains why he would have been the person dealing with Snr Velez.  I accept that description as accurate.  Snr Velez described him as “very correct in his dealings” and said he had no complaints about him {Day4/98:9}.  Attachment A to the PCMA {J13/52/49} lists a Carlos Alfonso Medina as a member of the Defendant’s staff who was to be assigned 100% to the Ocensa Project, under the heading “Land, ROW &amp; Legal”.  That is consistent with the Snr Carlos Alfonso Medina listed in the Attachment to the PCMA being the Snr Alfonso Medina who had dealings with Snr Velez for Ocensa, and I find that they are one and the same.  I have seen nothing to suggest either that Snr Velez would have been or was overawed or intimidated in his negotiations with others or that Snr Medina acted other than properly in his dealings with Snr Velez.  I accept and adopt Snr Velez’ description of Snr Medina as very correct in his dealings; and I find that (making all allowance for his inability to read or write) Snr Velez would have been able to hold his own in negotiations Snr Medina and others, just as he was able to hold his own in crossexamination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Velez said that, before the Ocensa pipeline was laid, he was told that “the pipeline wasn’t going to affect anything, that they would be doing maintenance work all the time and that any damage, for example if an animal died, would be paid for” [55]; and that “they said that the land wasn’t going to be damaged” [60] {D8/125/1496} and that it was on this basis that he was happy for them to build the pipeline on his farm.  I am confident that, if anyone had said this to Snr Velez after the ODC works had been carried out, he would not have believed them because of the damage he had already suffered and was suffering.  It is therefore possible that he is entirely confused and that this conversation, if it happened at all, was with representatives of ODC before the ODC works were carried out.  However, Snr Medina is recorded as having said in an interview that “one tells the owner that it will recuperate, but it’s impossible; it’s impossible to do it 100%.  The mark left by the pipeline when it is laid [interruption] is permanent damage; meaning, you sell the idea, speaking with owners, telling them about the revegetation techniques.  But, if I was an owner I would kick up a fuss because one knows what it implies” {L1/229.5T/2}.  There is also a strand of consistency in the evidence of the Lead Claimants that they were given comforting assurances in the course of negotiations that all damage would be made good.  This evidence is consistent with what Snr Medina is reported to have said and with the tone of the negotiators’ manual which required negotiators to maintain good relations with affected landowners, declared that the philosophy of the Legal Department was that of </p>

But I find that the negotiators would have given him generalised assurances that damage would be made good, in accordance with the normal practice as identified by Snr Medina and the negotiators’ manual.  I do not accept that the assurances were the basis upon which Snr Velez was happy for the Ocensa pipeline to be laid.  After his ODC experience he would have known or at least assumed that the pipeline was going to come whether he liked it or not, that it was likely to cause additional damage to his land, and that he would have the ability to claim if that damage went beyond what he was to be compensated for under his ROW Agreement.  Some or all of this may have been said to him at some stage, but I make no further findings of fact about what precisely was said to him or whether it was said by representatives of ODC before the initial pipeline or by those negotiating with him before the Ocensa pipeline or by both.  </p>

The difficulties that were being experienced on Stretch B at about this time were confirmed by an Ocensa Audit for June-August 1996 which reported for the omitted stretch that “delicate situations continued in this segment and the rainy season has created the following problems: gullies and contribution of sediments to the springs and watercourses near the ROW, deterioration of preventive protection works provoking saturation, colmatation and overflow of the trenches, erosion and undercutting in the crossings of watercourses both in the beds and in the lateral slopes” {K36/366T/35}. </p>

By order of Bogota, Spread B was effectively suspended during the week and also because of the public demonstrations in Remedios, toward the end of the week.  The military and the heads of the Ocensa and Saipem camp suggest work should continue on spread B and that it would not [sic] be advisable to suspend work opposite Remedios because of both the topography of the area, and the danger of having machinery and army personnel concentrated in this area” {K37/370T/2}.  In relation to the omitted stretch it said that “all damage caused by the sediment discharge, erosion and excavation of the ROW must be corrected and repaired as these continue to deteriorate as a result of the hard rain falling in the area” {K37/370T/9}.  There was more the next week.  The report for 22-28 September 1996 reported that “the project’s situation has greatly deteriorated due to public order problems (strike in Remedios), which is a general issue across the country due to the terrorist crisis during the week.  There is some uncertainty from Saipem-Ocensa regarding the continuation of the work on spread B, which must be determined quickly” {K37/377.01T/2}.  The following week’s report indicated that Saipem were reluctant to restart works because it would be on a short stretch and then they may be put on indefinite standby.  It noted that “performance has not been good due to public order and physical security issues” {K38/381T/2}.  Security problems continued to be reported for 6-13 October 1996: “Separately the army is very concerned about the elevated exposure of troops to a guerrilla attack.  According to Ocensa security personnel, risks to troops looking after the trap equipment are much higher, and they are more vulnerable to attack, than if they were constantly moving.  This gives guerrillas more time to carefully plan an attack” {K38/386T/2}.  It recorded that the week’s (limited) progress had included some final geotechnical works and final cleaning. </p>

Mr Allison accepted that in normal circumstances reconformation of the stretch should have been done by 4-10 August 1996 {Day15/116:1}; but it appears that no local firm was engaged until much later.  Mr Allison did not know why no one was engaged sooner {Day15/120:7}, save to point out that it appeared that the whole job had been shut down because of security concerns {Day15/111:15} {Day15/124:9} and that concerns such as those referred to in the reports to which he was taken would seriously restrict their ability to work in the area {Day15/118:5}.  I accept Mr Allison’s evidence that LC74 was in a “hot” area where they had security problems which required them to helicopter in foremen and others each day because they could not otherwise get access {Day15/111:24}; his evidence on this point is consistent with that of Snr Velez (which I also accept on this point) who said that workers were escorted by the army and didn’t let him come close to the construction area {D8/125/1498} and with various photographs showing that, much later, expert inspections were undertaken under armed guard on LC74.  The heightened level of security risk evidenced by the contemporaneous reports would provide an explanation of the need to keep the opening and reconformation fronts close together.  More generally, I accept Mr Allison’s interpretation of the reports that were put to him and his explanation of the impact of the security concerns identified in the various reports. </p>

There was then a period of about three months until the end of February 1997 when revegetation works were undertaken. The weekly reports between December 1996 and February 1997 indicate that revegetation was suspended because it was the dry season {K40/421T/6} {K41/425T/6} <span style="font-size:11pt">{</span>K41/427T/6} {K42/439T/6}.

Snr Cardenas’ suggestion was that, although revegetation had taken place at the end of February, further works remained necessary either as maintenance or otherwise {Day19/157:1}. There is no direct evidence about the period of revegetation.  On this limited material I find that revegetation works were carried out on LC74 at the end of February 1997 but that some maintenance was subsequently required up to and including June 1997 in the section of which LC74 formed part.  In the absence of further evidence I am not able to make any further finding save that not all of the maintenance or all of the period would necessarily have involved LC74 though some may have done. </p>

LC74 is 93 km south of the Zaragoza camp and 175 km south of the Caucasia camp. These distances mean that their readings cannot be taken as reliable evidence of what happened at LC74.  The geographical variations are shown by the fact that the (incomplete) records from Zaragoza show 310 mm falling on 7 days in April 1997 on and after 18 April, with the heaviest daily fall being 115 mm at night on 19 April: this compares with 202 for the whole month and 71 being the maximum for April 1997 as recorded at Palma de Coco. </p>

Several times they had to stop the work for one or two days because the condition of the land prevented them working” {D8/125/1500}.  First is the rainfall of over 1000 mm in May and June 1996 as recorded at Palma de Coco.  Second, Snr Gasca had a memory that it rained so much that they had to stop the works and set up a group putting in more works because the terrain in the stretch of LC74 was complicated and they had to stop more frequently.  He also remembered that the steepness of the terrain in that area meant that they had to take out an increased amount of material and that the amount of work required of their machinery was greater {Day16/17:21}.  He also accepted that, on the assumption being put to him that it was raining in the days before and during opening, there was a risk that protection measures that had been installed might be destroyed {Day16/19:20}.  He had a recollection that there were cases in which part of the <span style="font-style:italic">trinchos</span> or protection barriers failed, though this was not specific to LC74 {Day16/19:25}.  His willingness to accept that, if it rained on the exposed surface after it had been opened up, material would be washed from the surface and from stockpiles and fall into watercourses was refreshing and entirely realistic when talking about slopes such as the North and South Slopes with watercourses running through their valleys {Day19/22:5}. </p>

These references extend beyond the times when actual work was being done on LC74 and are in any event seldom, if ever, specific enough to enable the conclusion to be drawn that they are referring to interruptions of work on LC74 itself.  But they contribute to the evidence that leads me to find that the ROW on LC74 was subjected to heavy rainfall on many occasions between when the ROW was opened in late May 1996 and the onset of the dry season.  Even during the dry season there would have been (and I find that there were) occasions of heavy rainfall on the ROW on LC74, continuing on to June 1997 when heavy rains would have fallen on the newly recomposed ROW. </p>

I accept the general submission that Ocensa had in place managerial and reporting structures to identify where problems occurred and to remedy them promptly when possible.  It is, however, clear that there were delays in proceeding to reconformation on the stretch including LC74 and subsequently in proceeding to re-vegetation and that difficulties affecting the state of the works along the stretch were being reported in the second half of 1996 but were not swiftly addressed: see [1203]ff above.  One knock-on effect of those delays is that, by the time of reconformation, it was the dry season and revegetation was suspended.   </p>

The same cannot be said for the gradients and challenges on the North and South Slopes.  I accept that the stills from video footage taken between the Rio San Bartolomé and the Rio Nechi at {C6/20} and {C6/21} provide an indication of the challenges presented by steep slopes such as the North and South Slopes and the impracticability of maintaining the same level of order and tidiness that would be possible on easier terrain.  Those stills show heavy machinery working on what appears to be dry ground and illustrate the inevitability of some mixing and possible inversion on such terrain, over and above what will happen on the flat {Day42/3:12}.  The difficulties of working on steep slopes would be compounded when the ground was wet to the extent that sometimes work was impossible and had to be halted, as happened on LC74 during the Ocensa works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Over and above the generalised evidence as to system there is little evidence about the actual carrying out of the works on LC74.  Snr Velez was frank in accepting that his memory of the process was not very good, although he had watched what the workers were doing as closely as he could {D8/125/1498}.  For the reasons I have already outlined, I have treated his evidence about what he says happened on the Ocensa works with caution; but some of his evidence I find to be reliable, even though it may in parts have been equally true of the ODC works.  Some of his evidence I will consider in relation to specific allegations, but I deal with some here.  I accept that the trench digger came at almost the same time as but after the bulldozers that had cleared the ROW [65]; while I do not accept that no efforts were made to segregate topsoil and other soil (e.g. trench spoil) I accept that soil was stored on both sides of the ROW, that it was not protected or covered, and that when it rained, earth was carried downhill by the rain [65].  After the trench was backfilled, the soil for reconformation was left uncovered and on both sides of the ROW [66].  At some point (to which I will return) gabions were installed on the North Side of the Quebrada crossing, as if to form a barrier between AF1 and the springs and stream below, but by then a lot of earth had already been washed downhill (I add, as a result of the ODC works and, subsequently, as a result of the Ocensa works) [67].  During the time the earth was left exposed next to the ROW it was carried down directly by the rainwater to the water sources. The earth at the sides had been left without any protection, and therefore it was washed straight down to the streams [69].  After reconformation of the ROW and before sowing grass on it they built the cortacorrientes made of sacks filled with soil [75].  When they revegetated they used fique matting on the steeper slopes (which I take to be the North and South Slopes) [77].  The ROW was fenced off to enable the grass to grow.  Snr Velez removed the fence and gave his cattle access to the ROW when he saw that the grass had grown evenly [80].  Machinery was stored on his neighbour’s land and not on La Nieve [81] (though this did not prevent him finding some machinery to impound when he was in dispute about payment: see [1322] below). </p>

I do not accept his evidence of timing as precise or reliable and there is no other evidence that clearly establishes when it was installed.  ODC had provided a longitudinal channel on the east side of the South Slope, which is visible in the 1995 aerial photograph: see [1160.iii)] above; and Dr Savigny accepts that it was appropriate to install one there because of the cut slope above it {H2.4/4/952}.  There is one other potentially relevant reference to placing a concrete channel: that is in Snr Velez’ account of negotiations occurring at about the same time as an episode with a lost cheque, which I consider at [1327].  However, in that evidence Snr Velez asserts that it was Snr Vargas (who represented ODC) who had said, in response to Snr Velez’ complaints that his land was going down the hillside, that “they” (unspecified) would come back to make a channel with cement in that area. So it is not clear that he is there reliably referring to the need for Ocensa to install a channel at all; and if Snr Velez is right in his reference to Snr Vargas, ODC installed its channel in or before September 1995.  Though the aerial image does not show that it was lined with concrete at that stage, that would have been a normal method of construction.  I am not aware of any photograph taken between about late 1996 and mid-1998 that shows the South Slope without a longitudinal drain: the 1998 overflight video is of insufficient quality to tell one way or the other.   </p>

I am far from convinced that he was able to distinguish between the need for a longitudinal drain after the ODC works or the after the Ocensa works when giving this evidence.  What his evidence does reinforce, in my judgment, is the evidence to which I have referred elsewhere that there was a serious problem of erosion and sedimentation from the South Slope from the time of the ODC works onwards.  I accept that the provision of a longitudinal drain became a bone of contention for Snr Velez.  I find that it was a bone of contention between Snr Velez and ODC; and that he is now confused and unable to give reliable evidence about whether, when or with what results it was also a problem with Ocensa.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In re-examination {Day27/111:16} Dr Card gave as his opinion that the longitudinal drain was installed “as maintenance” at the same time as additional ditch diverters were installed.  In doing so, he aligned himself with Dr Savigny’s first report, where Dr Savigny had said that the longitudinal drain was “in all likelihood constructed as part of maintenance” {H2.4/4/950}, an opinion expressed on the basis of his assessment of Snr Velez’ evidence rather than any specifically engineering expertise {H2.3/3/899}.  The basis for Dr Card’s revised opinion (which he had apparently formed overnight) was that, because there was a lack of erosion control matting, the originally installed ditch diverters (which he suggested were installed to the wider spacing appropriate to be used in combination with erosion matting) failed, causing Saipem to go back and install ditch diverters to the narrower spacing that can now be observed.  He added that he thought the longitudinal drain was installed at the same time as those maintenance works.  I am unable to place weight on this revised opinion.  First, there is no evidence that the ditch diverters were originally installed at a wider spacing and then replaced with others at a narrower spacing, and I do not accept that they were.  Second, I reject the suggestion that no erosion control matting was used on the North and South Slopes, though I accept that it was not installed until revegetation: see [1237]ff below.  Third, it remains inherently unlikely that Saipem would have omitted the longitudinal drain as part of the original works when ODC had already placed one on the South Slope in at least roughly the same position as the one installed by Saipem. </p>

They are shown in detail by Dr Velez’ photographs 4-LC74 and 5-LC74 at {H5.4/5/951}. It seems probable, and I find, that their installation was related to the Second Ocensa Settlement, which was dated 16 August 1996 and was between Snr Velez, Ocensa and Saipem: see [388] above where it is set out in detail and [1322] below.  There is no document evidencing precisely when they were installed, and I bear in mind that no reconformation works were carried out before November/December 1996.  In his witness statement Snr Velez says that the gabions were installed “during the filling of the trench and afterwards” {D8/125/1499}.  Later, he says that “concrete steps” were installed 8 or 10 years after the construction of the pipeline, but does not make clear whether this is referring to the same structures {D8/125/1516}.  In 2010 he told Dr Savigny that the gabion and sack walls were constructed about 6 months after the Ocensa construction spread had passed due to complaints from Snr Velez that sediment had infilled his ponds and the creek channel on the floodplain {H2.4/4/939}.  Given the history of his complaints to both ODC and Ocensa as set out elsewhere, and the terms of the Second Ocensa Settlement, I think it very unlikely that he allowed 8 or 10 years to pass; and I conclude that his reference to concrete steps being installed that long after is wrong if it is intended to be a reference to the gabions.  I find that his estimate (as given to Dr Savigny) of about 6 months after the work front had passed is likely to be nearer the mark.  However, I think that the most natural meaning of the Second Ocensa Settlement is that the dump and gabions have already been placed and that the Settlement is in relation to their installation and (at least in the case of the gabions) continued presence.  The precise principles underlying the detailed design is not entirely clear, but I accept Snr Velez’ evidence that the gabions were installed at or about the time of the backfilling of the trench (i.e. c.16-22 June 1996) though their installation may have continued for a short while after that, and that they were meant to prevent excavated earth from falling down.  I find that the problem being addressed affected land off the ROW (hence the involvement of Saipem in the Second Ocensa Settlement) and that, given the position of the gabion walls, they were intended to prevent the flow of eroded material to the east of the ROW on the North Slope, across </p>

First, the Claimants have not been able to specify precisely where it is said that retention structures should have been installed; and, second, there was a risk, which Snr Gasca acknowledged, that retention structures that were initially adequate may have been destroyed – and that risk would have increased because of the undoubted delay with associated heavy rain between the opening of the ROW and reconformation {Day16/19:15}.

However, given the limitations in his evidence generally, I am not satisfied that there was a wholesale failure to provide retention structures.  For reasons that I will return to later, I consider that his specific evidence about soil on the Ridge not being retained or protected on the side nearer to SP5 and AF2 is probably right, at least to some extent.  What is not so clear, however, is whether or where there was a substantial stockpile in that area which should have been retained where the relatively flat Ridge gave way to the steeper slopes of AF2 and above Snr Velez’ old house.  Turning to the allegation of inadequacy, for reasons to which I will return, I am satisfied that substantial quantities of eroded materials came from the North Slope, across AF1 and were deposited in the area referred to as SW1-SW3.  Some of that will have come over or through the gabions.  To that extent the gabions may be said to have been ineffective.  However, there is no expert evidence that would justify a finding that the design of the gabions (or the sack wall near them) was negligent; and I do not accept that Snr Velez’ criticisms are a sufficient basis to find that their inadequacy involved negligence {Day4/111:18} {Day5/27:8}.  As will appear, I am satisfied that there was erosion from the ROW on both the North and the South Slopes, but the evidence does not show that, as a general proposition, the erosion from the ROW (as opposed to erosion from collections of soil) was caused or materially contributed to by either the absence or the inadequacy of retention structures. </p>

The Ridge presented no unusual difficulties, but the North and South Slopes were much more challenging: see [1214] above.  Snr Velez’ witness statement said nothing about the presence, size or placing of stockpiles.  He merely said that “they placed the earth [that had been stripped] on both sides of the [ROW], with the vegetation they had removed earlier” {D8/125/1498}: that evidence was essentially repeated again on the following page.  This is a surprising omission given the centrality of stockpiles to the case as pleaded and as now developed by the Claimants and their experts.  In crossexamination Snr Velez said, referring to the mention of the dump of 2500 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> in the Second Ocensa Settlement, that he did not remember where they were going to put the soil {Day4/113:20} though he remembered the gabions being put in after soil had “accumulated”.

Snr Velez then took the opportunity to say that there were big piles put on the hillside above the watercourses.  “It was a big pile of earth, 3 metres, 2.5 metres in some parts” {Day5/110:12}.  He then said that it had been placed on the side away from the ODC pipeline and gave further evidence about the hillside being covered with sediment and passing by the gabions, which makes plain that he was talking about a pile on the east side of the North Slope near to the top of the slope {Day5/113:1}.  He was then taken to {L7/851/866} and was pointed to the area of brown close to the gate from the Ridge above his old house but did not initially identify that as a place where soil had been piled {Day5/113:18}.  After more general evidence he said that soil had been placed on the Ridge and affected SP6 {Day5/114:19}.  In a passage of evidence that was not easy to follow, his evidence was that sediment that had affected his house was basically from (a) the brown gash (caused by cattle trail erosion) which ran down from the gate on the Ridge, passed to the left (as depicted on the photograph) of a tree and then broadened out and (b) from the edge of the Ridge for a distance to the south of the gate {Day5/119:7}.   </p>

The lack of clarity, precision and certainty could in part have been because of the need to try to elicit it for the first time in reexamination, by which time Snr Velez had been giving evidence for the best part of two days.  But if, in addition to the pile on the North Slope, there had been the other huge stockpiles that the Claimants (and Dr Card in particular) have been suggesting, I find it almost inconceivable that Snr Velez would not have remembered them and been able to give clear evidence about their position and size.  His evidence about what was or was not stored on the Ridge does not give much support to an allegation that there was a substantial pile of soil on the West of the Ridge near to the gate. </p>

The terms of the Second Ocensa Settlement support his evidence that it was on the North Slope; and the fact that Saipem were involved in the settlement suggests that the dump was off the ROW.  His evidence is also consistent with that of Dr Savigny at {Day37/88:17} ff that a wedge of soil would have been cut from the west side of the Ocensa ROW and the soil used to even the gradient across the ROW by filling, with the excess being deposited to its eastern side.  Taking this evidence and the evidence of Snr Velez together, I find that there was a substantial stockpile on the North Slope as a result of the Ocensa works, which was the subject of the Second Ocensa Settlement.  It was off the ROW to the east and affected an area of about 2500 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>.  The dimensions of the dump are otherwise unclear.  There is no evidence that it was more than 3 meters high apart from Dr Card’s calculations, which I reject.

Of most potential relevance, to my mind, is Dr Obando’s reported finding illustrated by photographs LC74.14 and LC74.15 at {H3.5/5/1121}, which he described as showing “Horizon A buried by mixed materials from the excavation and piling up of the soil in areas adjacent to the ROW.”  There is conflicting evidence about where these photographs were taken. Despite the reference to piling up of soil “in areas adjacent to the ROW”, Dr Obando’s first report identified photograph LC74.14 as being taken at point 102 on the CAI and also as being taken on the ROW {H3.4/4/781}.  Point 102 is off the ROW, though its precise position is not clear from the CAI.  The Claimants have marked it on {C6/27} at a point about 50 metres South West of the gate from the Ridge {Day41/80:23}{Day60/75:21}, though that is not where it is shown on the CAI.  On this conflicting evidence I accept that the photographs were taken a short distance from the ROW and to the South West of the gate on the Ridge.  The significance of the photographs is that (despite Ms Thornton’s best efforts in cross-examining Professor Montenegro) they show 2 inches or 5-6 centimetres of excavated soil deposits {H3.10/20/2324} {H3.10/20/2326}.

Although I reject without hesitation his almost formulaic assertion that the deposits of soil he saw on LC74 were consistent with the calculations of stockpile losses in Dr Card’s Fourth Report, I accept and find that the photographs show deposits of excavated soil about 5-6 cms or 2 inches deep at a point just off the west side of the ROW a short way south west of the gate off the Ridge.  I am not satisfied that they were as far as 50 metres from the Ridge, since that would be about level with SP5: the mark on {C6/27/1} is at a higher level than the level of SP5. </p>

That is important because the same engineering and construction principles that would have caused Ocensa to store excess soil at or near the top of slopes or on ridges would have </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">applied equally to ODC on LC74 where ODC had to cope with the soils from the cut on the western side towards the top of the North Slope and the cut on the eastern side towards the top of the South Slope. And there is force in Professor Montenegro’s observation that the ODC ROW was the one that was closer to the slopes falling from the west of the Ridge.  This is not simply a question of physical proximity: Ocensa would, where practicable, avoid direct trafficking of heavy machinery over the ODC pipeline.  Dr Card’s fourth report included his new analysis of disclosed documents to which I have referred at [513] above.  Amongst the documents he highlighted were some which identified the line of the ODC pipeline as a high risk area for Ocensa.  Although there are references which suggest that on occasions machinery did cross the line of the ODC pipeline (see for example Weekly report for 1-8 June 1996, 9-15 June 1996 {H1.6/24/1382}) other entries suggest that a consequence of this was that (in one case 50% of) excavation soil was being used to increase the thickness of the cushion between the ODC tube and the surface transit area (16-22 June 1996 {H1.6/24/1383}).  Dr Savigny referred to this as padding, which might be 0.5-1.5 metres deep; and his expectation was that extra care would be taken in its management {Day37/150:17} ff.  Although I accept that as a reasonable expectation, there are references in the weekly reports (not specific to LC74) to procedures not being followed.  However, it is not clear why Ocensa would have wanted to transit extensively on or near the line of the ODC pipeline on the Ridge, given the availability of ample space to the east, which contrasts with the falling away of the slopes to the west.  Nor has any reason been advanced to explain why they would have wished to transport excess soil from the cut to the <span style="font-style:italic">east </span>of the ROW on the South Slope to the <span style="font-style:italic">west </span>of the Ocensa/ODC ROW on the Ridge; and there is no direct evidence that they did so. </p>

I find that excess soil was stored on the Ridge roughly in the area of the ellipse shown by Dr Savigny; but that was generally at a distance from the western edge of the Ridge.  I accept that there may have been some soil stacked in the area near to the gate from the Ridge, but am not satisfied that it was in anything like the volumes for which the Claimants contend.  If there had been a dump like the one on the North Slope, Snr Velez would have remembered it but, on his evidence, I am not satisfied that he has any such recollection that could safely be attributed to the Ocensa works.  I conclude that some excess soil is likely to have been spread in the direction of the western edge of the Ridge in the manner described by Dr Savigny in his oral evidence, thereby reducing the amount remaining to be stockpiled.  Any stockpiles, properly so called, on the Ridge that were formed by Ocensa were generally some way from the western edge of the Ridge. </p>

There is no evidence that would justify a finding that there was a negligent failure of design: see [546] above.  On the evidence that I have outlined above, the Ocensa works were subjected to protracted exposure and to heavy rainfall from the time of opening the ROW.  However, it should have been obvious to Ocensa and Saipem that (a) any substantial stockpile on the North Slope would need significant protection to prevent the escape of soils down the slope, (b) the North Slope had already been subject to serious erosion as a result of the ODC works and was therefore fragile, (c) the area near and just below the Quebrada crossing on the north side of the stream was already seriously compromised and would be liable to be affected by further escapes of soil from a large stockpile on the North Slope to the east of the ROW.  In these circumstances there was a clear need to take particular care to prevent the escape of soils.  The fact of the Second Ocensa Settlement suggests that the need for additional works (in the form of the gabions) was a response to the failure of any original retention structures to retain the soils.  So far so good.  But there is no evidence at all about what actually went wrong.  Although the failure to retain soil appears to have been substantial it does not seem to me to be appropriate to make a finding of negligence on such inadequate evidence; </p>

Although there may have been some soil stored near to the western edge of the Ridge it was not a substantial stockpile as contended for by the Claimants.  Most of the soil was deposited in the watershed for AF3 and SP6 {Day37/154:7} though some would have been on land that sloped towards AF2.  It is possible that some material was deposited during the Ocensa works so that it fell down the slope to the west of the Ridge, but it is just as likely that some soil deposited off the Ridge on that side was deposited there during the ODC works.  It is not possible to tell whether the deposit identified by Dr Obando in his photographs LC74-14 and LC74-15 was the product of the ODC works or of the Ocensa works.  It is theoretically possible that the deposits (or any similar deposits nearby) came partly from each set of works.  It is, however, impossible to discriminate further.  The deposits there shown are likely to have been deposited mechanically, either accidentally or on purpose, rather than having eroded in the course of rainfall, though it is possible that they rolled down in </p>

On the North Slope this means that most soil not placed in the big dump would have been and was stored on the east side of the ROW, which was the side adjacent to AF1.  On the South Slope, because of the constriction imposed by the cut to the east on the upper part of the slope, a greater proportion of the soil that was not moved to the Ridge would have been and was placed on the ROW at or beyond the western side of the Ocensa ROW.  However, these collections of soil would not have been significant stockpiles.  The Ridge itself, with its more benign terrain, would not have generated substantial stockpiles of soil; </p>

The soil from the South Slope was in an area that was not subject to steep slopes and had a tendency to slope towards AF3, in which SP6 was positioned.

I find that they stalled initially because the reconformation spread had got behind and was more than 12 kms behind the pipeline laying front.  There has been no analysis by the Claimants of why that happened, either from Dr Card {Day27/55:21} or any other expert, and it is far from self-evident that the slippage of the reconformation spread was due to negligence.  As a matter of fact, it seems likely (and I find) that security problems held up the reconformation spread and caused the initial intention to engage a local firm, as appears from the reference to the need to get a local firm who did not require special army protection.  The available documentary evidence shows that the security situation remained extremely difficult from then until November 1996: see [1205]ff above.  On the basis of the available evidence I find that Ocensa was well aware of the detrimental effects of the delays in carrying out reconformation and final geotechnical works.  There is no evidence to suggest that the detrimental effects were a matter of indifference to them.  I find that there was a shut-down of the works in the area because of the security situation and that the effective reason why nothing was done to progress the works with a local firm until November 1996 was the security situation, which caused the direct involvement of Bogota and liaison between Saipem and Ocensa and the taking of advice from the army in the decision making process;   </p>

In other words, the mere fact that the reconformation spread had slipped is not of itself evidence of negligence vis-à-vis affected landowners or other interested parties.

I have at [550] rejected the general proposition that stockpiles and other exposed earth should always or usually be covered as a matter of routine practice.  So the fact that the soils on LC74 were not initially covered was not of itself negligent.  I would accept that circumstances could arise where the contractor knows that there will be a substantial delay so as to give rise to the need to take special precautions before the delay occurs.  Here, however, although security problems were foreseeable, it has not been shown that Ocensa or Saipem should have known or anticipated when doing the stripping and pipe laying that there would then be a long gap before reconformation.  Thereafter the adverse security position provides a reasonable explanation for not deploying workers to cover the soil where that would otherwise have been feasible.

The GDS for LC74 is not available and it is therefore necessary to look for other evidence about whether the provisions of the RECS were complied with, generally or specifically in relation to erosion matting.  Dr Card accepted that the spacing of the ditch diverters on the North and South Slopes complied both with the RECS and (albeit rather equivocally) with the more demanding requirements of the EMP/ODC curve, which required smaller spacings if no erosion control matting was used {Day26/98:2}.  In his first report Dr Card said “there is evidence of the use of black plastic erosion matting and also fibre matting in parts but it has not been placed over the full width of the ROW or the length of the [South] slope” {H1.1/1/213}.  Snr Velez’ evidence, to which I have referred above, did not say or suggest that matting was only put on part of the steeper slopes.  Bearing in mind the bio-degradable nature of fique matting, the fact that Dr Card did not find it over the full width of the South Slope does not mean that it was not laid.  In the absence of any suggestion from Snr Velez that significant portions of the steep slopes were omitted, there is no evidence that they were; and there is no obvious reason why Ocensa should have omitted some material parts of the slope while placing matting on others.  While accepting that it is possible that there were areas of omission, I am not satisfied on this evidence that material areas of the North and South Slopes were omitted, and I find that they were not. </p>

For that reason, Snr Gasca was correct to agree that it was very important to ensure that revegetation took place at the same time as (or, I would add, soon after) the installation of the long term geotechnical works {Day14/53:19}.  In times of rain between December 1996 and February 1997 the absence of erosion matting will have led to increased erosion from the surfaces of the North and South Slopes, which will only have been impeded by the ditch diverters.  The Claimants submit that the failure to lay erosion matting sooner took place “in circumstances which amounted to negligence” based upon Snr Gasca’s acceptance of the need for prompt installation and the consequences of a lack of matting {C4/3.7/1122}. </p>

It is also evident that there was a deliberate decision to suspend revegetation during the summer season.  To characterise that as negligent requires appropriate expert evidence on the pros and cons of the decision and general standards of good practice in such circumstances, which is absent either generally in this litigation or specifically in relation to LC74.  If I had held that the delay in the period to November/December 1996 had been negligent, that might have laid the foundation for an argument that the delay between December and February was a consequence of that negligence.

There was no diffusion mechanism at its base, as a result of which there has been severe localised erosion at the discharge point, with the depth of the erosion scour being 0.9 metres when measured by Dr Card {H1.1/1/213}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Dealing with the South Slope first, the experts are agreed that it was appropriate for there to be a longitudinal drain down the East side of the South Slope.  Dr Savigny’s reason was that the existence of the cut to the East side of the slope prevented water from the ROW being distributed widely across natural terrain.  There was no such restriction to the west of the slope and water from the ROW that has been diverted off the west side of the ROW has passed onto the adjacent slopes.  I find that to be a reasonable distinction and prefer Dr Savigny’s evidence that the west side of the South Slope did not require a longitudinal drain.  It is notable that the slopes immediately to the west of the ROW on the South Slope have not suffered substantial damage, which provides a measure of retrospective support for the decision not to install a longitudinal drain there.  I accept the general thrust of Snr Velez’ evidence that, until the longitudinal drain was installed, there was uncontrolled passage of water and materials from the ROW down the east side of the ROW towards W1.  In the absence of the concrete channel I accept that the passage of water would itself have caused erosion and scour.  I also accept that the absence of any diffusion mechanism at the bottom of the longitudinal drain has caused or contributed to a concentration of water with scouring effect as noted by Dr Card.  On the basis of Dr Card’s evidence, once the longitudinal drain was installed there should also have been silt retention fences or sediment traps would have been required to prevent the passage of eroded materials into W1 until the revegetation of the ROW restored its condition and reduced run off and erosion from it to acceptable levels.  None was provided by Ocensa.  There is no evidence that any such precautions had been taken by ODC either. </p>

Furthermore, on the findings I have made about the consequences of the ODC works, both the North and the South Slopes had been subject to substantial erosion with protracted and serious sedimentation from those slopes that had compromised the land in the valley below.  Of all the areas that the Court has considered in the course of this trial, the steep slopes on LC74 and the valley below were as vulnerable and as much in need of protection as any.  The existing state of the slopes should have been obvious to Ocensa and Saipem.  It is possible that Ocensa left some limited areas of the ODC ROW undisturbed; but it is probable that it used most of the ODC ROW and extended it to the east to accommodate its works.  In those circumstances the lessons from the ODC works should have been clear. </p>

It was not without problems: for example, the absence of a longitudinal drain on the east side of the North Slope meant that eroded materials would flow onto and across AF1.  But the installation of a longitudinal drain, while it may have minimised or prevented the diffused flow of materials onto AF1, would have concentrated them into the drain and carried them directly into the valley through which W1 flowed.  Diffusing materials onto a wider expanse of natural vegetation could reasonably be thought to have been a better option, particularly given the already compromised state of the area downstream of the Quebrada crossing.  I prefer the opinion of Dr Savigny on this issue for the reasons he gave and for the reasons explored with Dr Card in cross-examination and am therefore not satisfied that the decision to omit additional longitudinal drains was negligent. </p>

However, I accept Dr Card’s criticism of the failure to make provision at the bottom of the drain to prevent scouring by further energy dissipation measures.  Given the sensitivity of the slope both generally and in the compromised and fragile state in which it had been left by ODC, I am unable to see any reasonable justification for not protecting the area below the drain.  The area of damage was limited and the consequences of the erosion were not very great when viewed in the context of all else that happened in the valley; but it was avoidable and no real explanation for the absence of further protective works has been provided. </p>

First, all the conditions were ripe for erosion: the soil was left exposed for months including during periods of heavy rainfall before the installation of long term geotechnical works or revegetation; and the steeper slopes had already been damaged by the ODC works.  Second, the weekly reports for spread B provide evidence of seriously detrimental consequences flowing from the delay in completing the works.  There is no reason to think that LC74 was immune from those consequences and good reason (namely the fragile state of the slopes) to support a finding that it was not.  Third, the First to Fourth Ocensa Settlements provide compelling corroboration for Snr Velez’ evidence that the Ocensa works caused substantial damage to his land over and above what had been contemplated or comprehended in his ROW Agreement with Ocensa.  In particular, they provide corroboration for his descriptions of soil that had been left by the ROW being carried down by rainwater to water sources {D8/125/1498}.  Third, although I have found that it was compromised in 1995 as a consequence of the ODC works, the state of the area below the Quebrada crossing is now significantly worse than it was then, which I find is best explained by further sedimentation generated in the course of and since the period of the Ocensa works.  The precise extent and implications of the damage caused by the Ocensa works is difficult and remains to be worked through in the rest of this section of the judgment; but there can be no doubt that the delay in bringing the works on LC74 to a conclusion caused an increase in erosion and sedimentation on the steeper slopes that was substantial and was the subject of complaint from Snr Velez both in 1996 and thereafter. </p>

Dr Card gave no evidence specific to this area in his First Report.  In that report he made the entirely general statement that “a significant volume of soil was lost from the stockpiles to the extent that additional soil needed to be brought in to make up for loss and complete backfilling” {H1.1/1/216}.  He said in evidence that this was based upon a conversation with the Claimant during a field inspection {Day26/102:17}.  No such evidence appears in Snr Velez’ witness statement.  The only documentary reference to taking additional soil is in the First ODC Settlement.  I do not believe that Dr Card simply made up the statement in his First Report and I accept that Snr Velez may have said something of the kind to him during a field inspection.  If he did, however, I infer and find that it was an example of Snr Velez referring to something which was in fact attributable to the ODC works but which has been recycled to form part of the case against the Ocensa works.  As I have not seen any contemporaneous note or other record of the conversation and Dr Card’s reference in his report is so short, it would be wrong to infer too much on the basis of what is reported to have been said.  However, in the light of the First ODC Settlement and the complete absence of any properly evidenced reference to a need to import additional soil to make good the Ocensa works, I take the reported conversation as some additional evidence of the problems that occurred with the ODC works.  The reported conversation and the First ODC Agreement are consistent with ODC having suffered soil losses, though the duration of the <span style="font-style:italic">force majeure </span>delay and the overall time taken to complete the works and the precise scale of the soil losses cannot be known.  </p>

On the basis of his evidence that much of it would have been stored in the watershed of AF3 and SP6, I accept that some may have found its way down the relatively gentle slope onto AF3 or to SP6, as may some from the ROW in its exposed condition.  However, the evidence does not satisfy me that the Ocensa works made a material difference to AF3 or to SP6.

Third, not least because the Claimants’ experts did not address the possibility of a contribution from the ODC works (and because of the unreliability of Dr Card’s Fourth Report calculations) there is no expert evidence on which to found a finding that any damage caused by the Ocensa works made a material difference to AF3 or SP6.

His second report at {H1.4/22/1001} responded to Dr Savigny’s observations on AF2 {H2.4/4/912} in which Dr Savigny had given as his opinion that there was a trend of deterioration before and after the Ocensa works and that sediment from the eroded livestock trail (i.e. the gash) is directed straight at the old house.  Dr Card challenged Dr Savigny’s opinion that cattle were the cause of the erosion on the gash.  He then reviewed Dr Savigny’s LC74-15 (the diagram of the ROW on the North Slope) and LC74-16 and LC74 – 17 (which showed erosion on the steep slopes) and challenged Dr Savigny’s interpretation.  He then referred to the First, Second and Third Ocensa Settlements and other documents which he said recorded the movement of considerable quantities of soil downhill due to the delay in completion of reinstatement and re-vegetation works on the property.  Apart from his expression of opinion on the cause of the gash, this either referred to slopes other than AF2, or was his interpretation of Settlement Agreements and other documents which (as I find) did not relate to AF2.  His second report is therefore of very limited relevance to AF2.  It does not provide any objective scientific evidence of sedimentation; nor do his subsequent reports. </p>

His evidence was that on his field visits it was not possible to observe pastures affected by sedimentation because it was no possible to identify sediments at a glance and required test pits to examine the soil profiles {H5.4/5/970}.  He said very little about AF2 but said that “it was possible to observe the type of vegetation and the state of growth and development of the grasses located in AF1, AF2 and AF3 that were affected by the flow of sediments from the ROW.  Currently the areas where the flow of sediments may have been more intense by virtue of the steep gradient of the plots, such as AF1 and AF2, with gradients of 25-50% and above in some sectors, is found under predominantly low barbecho coverage (see Photo 5-LC74), where there is grass it is of poor quality and development, and in some areas there is no coverage due to the damage caused to the soil’s chemical physical and biological fertility” {H5.4/5/970}.  His Photo 5-LC74 was taken on AF1.  Although the slope immediately to the west of the Ridge exceeded 25% in places, the area above and in the region of the old house has not been shown to be that steep; and the vegetation shown in photo 5-LC54 looks markedly different from that shown in Dr Velez’ photos and the dry season video of AF2.  He reported seeing sediment in the streams from which the old house had taken its water, which he attributed to sedimentation from the ROW {H5.4/5/974}.  Once again the major problem of sedimentation that he identified was in the area between the steep slopes.  He deferred expressly to Dr Obando for “current evidence of sedimentation off the ROW” {H5.4/5/983}.  And he supported Snr Velez’ decision to build the new house on “Dr Conrado Tobon’s evidence of the damage to the availability and quality of water in stream W1, which would have been worse in the period during and just after pipeline construction” {H5.4/5/983}.

The exact positions of the holes are not identified; no analysis of the holes has been presented by the experts; and without expert assistance it is not possible for the Court to reach a conclusion on, for example, the depth of the holes (as neither a measure nor a dagger are shown) or what they show or, for example, whether the last hole shows something significantly different from the previous ones, as suggested by the notes.  All that can be said is that, to the untrained eye, it is not obvious that any of the holes show a discernible differentiation between Horizon A (if it is there) and other horizons.  The experience of this case is that the untrained eye normally needs and benefits from expert assistance - a view presumably shared by the parties given the resources that have been deployed to that end.

Dr Velez’ photographs R2-LC74 and R3-LC74 {H5.4/5/980}, which were taken during the dry season in February 2011, show the remains of the old house.  One can see the division of rooms, marked by very low walls, and the cement floor of the house is visible.  Although the old house is evidently abandoned, the photographs do not show (and Dr Velez does not evidence) the floor being submerged by sediment.  This is of limited value, though it provides slight support for the Defendant’s case that the reason why Snr Velez moved out was not that his house was then being submerged with mud.  Photographs of the area around the house (such as N2-LC74 {H5.4/5/962}) do not assist in identifying sedimentation of the area. Those photographs do, however, show fruit trees growing close by the old chicken pen, which itself was close to the old house. </p>

Dr Obando’s evidence of observed proliferation of weeds and poor grasses supports the Claimants’ case but no comparison has been made between the quality of the vegetation in the area alleged to have been affected (AF2) and an equivalent area that is said to be outside the area of influence.  In addition there is his evidence based on his photographs LC74.14 and LC74.15 to which I have already referred.  In the light of my finding that there was no major stockpiling to the western side of the Ridge by Ocensa there is nothing in the carrying out of the works themselves to suggest that there should have been major sedimentation flowing from the relatively flat and uncomplicated Ridge, though whatever potential for sedimentation existed as a result </p>

His explanation for the delay was that he could not afford the move with the money he got from the pipeline and had to get a loan from the bank, which took time.  As set out below, the Third and Fourth Ocensa Settlements were in 1998.  The evidence about getting a loan because the monies from Ocensa were insufficient therefore supports the house move being at a later date, in addition to which is the clear acceptance that it happened in about 2007/2008.  The Claimants’ response to this is that (as I have found) Snr Velez had difficulty in recalling dates and was suggestible.  That said, the difference between the case that has been advanced that the move happened within one or two years of the Ocensa pipeline works and the <span style="font-style:italic">much </span>more recent time indicated in interview is troubling: it is not suggested that Snr Velez has no understanding at all of time or lengths of time.  Furthermore, the effect of the Claimants’ submission is that, without more,  I can place no more reliance upon Snr Velez’ assertion that he moved house 2 years after the pipeline than upon his statement to Dr Velez that he moved in about 2008.  </p>

I do not underestimate the difficulties of communication and evidence gathering in this case; but the Court has made very considerable efforts to accommodate real difficulties and would have done so if real difficulties had been experienced on this point.  As it is, the Court has no evidence or information to suggest that any steps at all were taken to try to clarify the position in relation to the documents, let alone any information that steps were taken and difficulties encountered.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The reason why this is so profoundly unsatisfactory is that I can conceive of a way in which the documents could honestly have been produced even if the house move took place in or about 1998.  Given the possibility that Snr Velez would default to “three years”, it is conceivable that he might have gone to his old suppliers in 2011 and that the dates may have come about because the suppliers asked him how long before he had moved house, to which it is conceivable that he could have replied that it was three years before.  However, I cannot proceed on the basis that that is what happened for a number of reasons.  First, there is no evidence to support it.  Second, all that is known about the documents is that Snr Velez’ daughter (who has an education {Day5/98:2}) was involved in their production to Leigh Day and there is no reason to suppose that (if Snr Velez moved in 1998) she would either have allowed the 2008 date to be written in the first place or would not have noticed it.  Third, if the providers of the documents were the people who had provided the materials, there is no reason to believe that they too would default to “three years” or would have been unaware that Snr Velez had built his house long before. If they had no memory or record of the transactions, there is no reason to suppose that the documents represent an accurate or reliable record of what Snr Velez bought in the first place: at best they would represent what Snr Velez said he had used, which adds nothing to his other evidence on the point.  Fourth, it was not being suggested as even plausible that the document dated 15 April 2008 was not created on that date.  </p>

However, I accept Snr Velez’ evidence that there was a time when his original point of collection was affected by sediment and he started taking water from further upstream, initially by collecting it in large containers.  This is consistent with there having been some sedimentation ultimately coming from the ROW, but does not require the quantities of sedimentation that are now alleged.  It is also consistent with sedimentation from other causes over time, as evidence by the opinions of Dr Savigny and Professor Monsalve.  I also accept that, whenever he moved from the old house, he continued to take water from the new source, even though it is further from the new house than the old source.  I do not find this persuasive one way or the other, as it is consistent with Snr Velez having lost confidence in his old source even though it was in fact providing just as good quality water as the new; and the additional distance to the new source is not great. </p>

Dr Savigny accepted that construction practices in all likelihood accounted for some or all of the Claimants’ observations of mixed soil horizons on the Ocensa and ODC ROWs {H2.4/4/913}.  Although he was not specifically referring to the steeper slopes, his evidence is particularly applicable to those slopes because of the greater technical demands and the need to shift larger quantities of earth that they presented.

My reasons for doing so have included the absence of objective evidence of substantial sedimentation.  That absence of evidence also tells against a finding that the sedimentation of SP5 or the upper reaches of W1 was caused by any substantial erosion from stockpiles or from the ROW.  I do not exclude the possibility that some sediment from the ROW found its way to SP5 or the upper reaches of W1, but it was not of the order of magnitude alleged by the Claimants. </p>

Any failure to investigate or sample pales into insignificance in comparison with the problems of sedimentation from the ROW on the North and South Slopes down into W1 at and below the Quebrada crossing.  The reasons for this sedimentation have been considered above: overwhelmingly they were the consequence of the delays which I have held were attributable to the security situation and not to negligence on the part of Ocensa.  The scale and duration of that sedimentation would have overwhelmed any sediment traps; and soils which escaped into W1 during construction were not removed, nor were flow conditions reinstated to their pre-construction condition.  There is no evidence that either ODC or Ocensa took any steps to reinstate the affected area of and around W1.  Instead they entered into agreements for compensation with Snr Velez.  I will return to consider the relative contributions of the ODC and Ocensa works when considering the heads of damage below.  I will also consider the impact of the settlement agreements elsewhere. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It seems probable (and I find) that Snr Velez is referring to the First Ocensa Settlement at [94] of his witness statement {D8/125/1506} where he says that he complained to Snr Alfonso Medina that land “had been washed towards the pasture fields next to the right of way by the rain during the pipeline construction and had damaged those fields.”  Snr Velez says that, after consulting “the company, [Snr Medina] told [him] they were going to give [him] another $5m. pesos, on top of what they already had paid for the right of way.  They told [him] that they wouldn’t pay more than that.  That payment wasn’t fair, because that value doesn’t take into account the area of land that was damaged and the time [he] couldn’t use the area.”  The alternative explanation is that [94] of Snr Velez’ statement refers to the Third Ocensa Settlement, described below.  That explanation has the advantage that the settlement consideration was stated to be COP 5million; but I have no confidence that Snr Velez has an accurate recollection of the exact amount to which he was referring in [94].  In the end, it may not matter whether Snr Velez was referring to the First or the Third Ocensa Settlements at [94] as his description in his witness statement provides no further detail of the damage being described. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In cross-examination, Snr Velez professed difficulty in orientating himself on photographs, but the gist of his evidence was tolerably clear: it was that the First Ocensa Settlement came about because substantial quantities of land and sedimentation came down the west side of the South Slope (that being the side down which the concrete channel was later placed) into the Quebrada Crossing causing sedimentation {Day4/102:2}-{Day4/112:5}.  He confirmed that the Settlement was in respect of 1.5 hectares and said that he did not consider the compensation to be a fair price {Day4/110:6}.  On the basis of his evidence I find that the First Ocensa Settlement was in relation to the flow of land and sediment down (predominantly) the western side of the South Slope into W1 at and about the Quebrada Crossing and that the area affected (which was approximately 1.5 hectares) included the area on the northern side of the stream, which in turn included the area described as SW1-SW3.  </p>

I therefore infer that the 1.5 hectares for which Snr Velez was being compensated included the affected area of the South Slope.  I find that he knew the essential terms of the Settlement, including that it was for rendering that area permanently unfit for cattle breeding and raising activities and the amount of compensation he was to receive.  I also accept his evidence that he thought at the time that the compensation was not fair because of the area of land involved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">One of the most remarkable features of the First Ocensa Settlement is the speed with which it came about.  The meeting that led to its conclusion occurred within a week of the opening of the ROW.  That of itself suggests three things of which the third is evidentially the most important.  First, Ocensa had people and systems in place to deal with damages claims and they were on LC74 or at least accessible to Snr Velez very soon after the works commenced.  Second, Snr Velez made a claim very soon after the Ocensa works started.  Third, the terms of the Settlement suggest that something dramatic had happened within a week of the Ocensa works starting, because Snr Velez was complaining that 1.5 hectares of his land had been rendered permanently unfit for cattle breeding and raising activities, for which he was claiming COP 8million.  While the Settlement records that his assessment was disputed, the fact remains that Ocensa agreed to pay him nearly 65% of what he was claiming.  Another indicator of the magnitude of the problem is that the sum paid by Ocensa (COP 5,150million) was 20% more than the payment it made to Snr Velez under his original ROW Agreement (COP 4,285million).  If the agreement had come about because Ocensa had gone beyond the previously agreed ROW, Saipem would have been involved and a sobreanchos payment made, as happened with the Second Ocensa Settlement.  The non-involvement of Saipem supports the view that the First Ocensa Settlement came about because something happened on the ROW which caused serious problems for Snr Velez.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The second notable feature about the First Ocensa Settlement is the relative coincidence in timing between it and the Second ODC Settlement, which arose out of the complaint made in January 1996 and was concluded in May of that year.  On the findings I have made, the two settlements were related by more than just the timing of their conclusion: each concerned the damage to the area at and downstream of the Quebrada crossing and Snr Velez’ complaint in relation to each was that significant quantities of soil had come from the South Slope and into the stream affecting an area which included SW1-SW3.  One interesting and potentially material difference between the two sets of works is that, by mid-1996, the ODC works had long been completed, but the Ocensa works were still unfinished.  I return to the significance of these features when considering the relative impact of the ODC and Ocensa works elsewhere.   </p>

An interesting insight into Snr Velez’ toughness is given by [89] of his statement which, in relation to the sobreanchos agreement, says that when he had signed a document he was told there was no money.  So he erected a fence around some of the machinery still on LC74 and said he was going to stop the machines until he was paid.  He was paid in cash the next day {D8/125/1504}.  I accept that evidence.  Quite when that happened is not clear (and does not matter), but his evidence of delay in payment (which I accept) is supported by a letter sent on 9 October 1996 from Snr Bartolucci of Saipem to Snr Daza of Ocensa {M/192T/778.1} in which Snr Bartolucci said that Snr Velez was claiming for payment for certain rocks used in the construction of gabions.  It was said that this payment had been taken into account when discussing sobreanchos and damages outside the ROW and that “the payment of this negotiation is being processed by Ocensa.” </p>

I accept submission (a) but not submission (b).  The reference to 1.5 hectares of Brachiaria grass in the Fourth Ocensa Settlement is unspecific as to the location of the damaged grass, as was the reference in the First Ocensa Settlement to permanent damage having been caused to 1.5 hectares of used for cattle farming.  The most that can be said is that (assuming he did not claim twice in respect of damage to the same area) Snr Velez made claims in respect of 3 hectares of land said to have been damaged, 1.5 hectares of which was the subject of the First Ocensa Settlement and the rest of which was the subject of the Fourth.   </p>

There is no doubt that such an episode occurred and that Snr Medina assisted Snr Velez, although even in 1998 Snr Velez appears to have been confused in thinking that the cheque was from Ocensa (rather than ODC): {M/186T/747.3}, {M/186T/747.1}.

At some stage (presumably mid-1998) Snr Velez complained to Snr Vargas that a piece of land was being carried downhill to the stream.  Snr Vargas said that “they wouldn’t pay for the damage, and that they would come back to make a channel with cement in that area.”  According to Snr Velez, Snr Vargas said that if he would not let “them” carry out the work, he would bring in the army. “Then he went to his helicopter and left.”  Snr Velez refused to let “them” come and repair anything without paying him.  His account is that Snr Medina told him he had been compensated already, which led to enquiries being made that showed the cheque had been cashed but that the signature had been forged and the name on the cheque was Ricardo Vargas.  The cheque itself is at {M/186/737} and was apparently originally drawn on 24 November 1997 {M/186T/747.7}.  The main area of clarification achieved during his oral evidence was that the cheque was in respect of compensation for earth being washed downhill and that he thought COP 5million was fair compensation for that {Day5/140:5}. </p>

It also chimes with Snr Velez’ evidence that Snr Vargas’ arrival in his helicopter (which I infer was on behalf of ODC as before) provoked the start of the episode and Snr Medina’s subsequent involvement, and that it related to land being carried downhill to the stream and a large amount of mud having come down; </p>

What can be said is that Ocensa settled a claim being made by Snr Velez without involving Saipem, which is evidence of acceptance of responsibility for an adverse state of affairs not previously covered by their ROW Agreement or the previous Ocensa Settlement Agreements.  Whether or not that acceptance of responsibility would have been acceptance of sole responsibility for an area of damage or acceptance of having made a contribution to an area also affected by the ODC works cannot be determined from the Settlement or the evidence relating to it.  The reference to the permanent geotechnical works being present reinforces the impression that the settlement related to a stretch of the ROW.  On all of this evidence I conclude and find that it related to damage to one or both of the steeper slopes. 1330.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">The Fifth Ocensa Settlement</span> {M/188.1T/754.3} states that it was for “damage to fences due to a helicopter landing and frightening livestock.

It related to damage caused during an inspection years after the conclusion of the works.

It is possible that it is the product of reconstruction rather than true memory at a time when it suited him to limit the scope of any Paz y Salvo to damage on the ROW but not off it.  But the general prevalence of Ocensa (as opposed to Saipem) Paz y Salvos suggests that Ocensa would have wanted to conclude one with Snr Velez who was a determined and persistent claimant from the very early stages of Ocensa’s involvement with LC74.  His evidence is also consistent with his remark elsewhere that Snr Medina was very correct in his dealings.  I therefore conclude and find that his evidence is probably correct and that, separately, he concluded a Paz y Salvo with Ocensa, which would have been in its standard form.  I find that it is most likely to have been concluded in 1998, by which time he had entered into four settlement agreements with Ocensa and, on the evidence, was not pursuing any further complaints. </p>

In addition, the Ocensa works will have meant that there was rather less topsoil spread on reconformation than would have been there immediately before Ocensa started its works, as would also have been the case when ODC carried out its reconformation.  I refer to the Ocensa works setting the slopes back because they had not recovered from the ODC works, so that the impact of the Ocensa works was to increase the flow of sediment from the ROW beyond the flow that would still have been happening in any event as a result of the ODC works.

Ocensa probably also extended the area of operations to some extent on the east near the top of the South Slope where ODC had already left a cut face.  It is likely that the Ocensa ROW generally extended onto new ground to the east of the ODC ROW as well as using some or all of the width of the ODC ROW as necessary for its works.  Comparison of the 1995 aerial image with later photographs does not demonstrate that this extension to the east was substantial. </p>

By the time of the Ocensa works, the ODC works had already caused the damage that I have described and, because the ROW had not recovered, was a continuing source of erosion and damage.  The contribution of the Ocensa works was two-fold.  First, the works re-disturbed parts of the already damaged and fragile ODC ROW, setting them back and increasing the amount of erosion from the area of what had been the ODC ROW to the extent that I have described.  Second, they caused new damage such as, for example, where the Ocensa Works extended beyond the area of the ODC ROW.  It is not possible to measure the incremental effect of the Ocensa works on particular slopes or overall with greater precision. </p>

I accept that both of these are important features to bear in mind at all times, and I have attempted to do so.  But, as I have explained above, the difficulties run much deeper than those identified by the Claimants in their submission.  The Court has ample material on which to assess losses if they are proved to have occurred as a matter of fact; and the Court is always determined to find a kernel of truth buried within unreliable evidence if it is there to be found.  The real difficulty in the case of LC74 is the fundamental failure on the part of Snr Velez and those assisting him in the formulation of his claim to recognise the importance of the ODC works.  His assertion that no real damage was caused by the ODC works was accepted with far too little professional rigour and reproduced by his experts time and again as if it were established fact.  The extreme time pressures of the trial process meant that, even at the end of the trial, the importance of the ODC works had not been fully analysed either by those who were presenting the claim for Snr Velez or the Court.  It was apparent at the end of the trial that Snr Velez could not be relied upon to discriminate between what happened during the ODC and Ocensa works respectively, but the full implications of that unreliability and the failure to recognise it by the Claimants’ expert advisers have been profound and largely account for the length of this section of the judgment.  While it is essential that the Court looks for kernels of truth, it is no part of the Court’s function to sanction claims which are not justified on the evidence. </p>

It is alleged that SP5 became completely sedimented, making the water unsuitable for consumption.  “The lack of available water prevented Snr Velez from keeping pigs on the property and his herd had to be sold in large part.  As a result of damage to his house and water source described above, Snr Velez had to build a new house and water supply system.  However, the new water supply was insufficient to meet the needs of the same number of pigs.  Snr Velez has since maintained only 1 or 2 pigs … .” </p>

There are no access roads through or by La Nieve {H5.4/5/964} so that large-scale theft of animals by humans is unlikely.  Although Dr Delgado suggested that there was a risk of predators or flash floods {H20.6/23/1414}, this was not a reason relied upon by Snr Velez.  Dr Delgado’s suggestion was also weakened by his saying in oral evidence that the ocelots he had identified in his report as potential predators did not exist in Colombia and offering tigrillos as a substitute {Day49/164:5}.  His suggestion that there may have been flash floods, though not taken up by Snr Velez, would have been applicable before and after the various pipeline works.

I also accept that the area on the ROW on the North and South Slopes is less productive than it would have been if no pipelines had been laid and that the quality of pasture on the steep slopes of the ROW is less good than on the more benign slopes of the Ridge.  It remains fragile and susceptible to erosion by cattle, as Dr Savigny’s photographs demonstrate.  Both the ODC and the Ocensa pipeline works contributed to this state of affairs on slopes that were already fragile before any disruption occurred.  The period of exclusive contribution from the ODC works was from late 1990/early 1991 to May 1996, which included the prolonged period of the ROW opening and which had only recovered to the extent identified by Dr Savigny by September 1995.  The period of maximum exacerbation by the Ocensa works was from May 1996 until revegetation took hold.  By the time of the 1998 DVD the prominent cut at the east side of the South Slope still had 90-100% exposed soil {H2.4/4/901}.  By the time the experts visited, the steep slopes were still not fully recovered.  On all the evidence it is probable that the Ocensa works inflicted further damage to the already compromised and fragile steep slopes, but there is no reliable evidence on the basis of which I could conclude that they were generally in a much worse state than they would have been as the result of the ODC works alone.  </p>

More to the point, I am not satisfied that Snr Velez has kept 2 fewer cows on LC74 than he would have done if the Ocensa works had not happened, for two reasons.  First, except in the early stages after the Ocensa works, I am not satisfied that there has been a reduction in theoretical carrying capacity that can be quantified in this way as a result of the Ocensa works.  Second, the evidence does not satisfy me that the numbers of cattle on LC74 (or, more generally, La Nieve) have been determined by carrying capacity.  The observation made by Dr Velez about LC54 is equally apposite here: the Claimants’ management practices have been done without technical criteria and without regard to the loading capacity of each paddock and the farm: see [1024] above.  For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the incremental damage to AF1, the North and South Slopes and the valley in between has caused any actual reduction in the number of cattle that Snr Velez has kept on his farm proportionate to any notional reduction in capacity. </p>

No cattle got stuck and died before then because the area was not so dangerous for cattle and Snr Velez kept cattle out of the area in the wet season, as he said in his statement.  The removal of the temporal link asserted as part of the basis of the claim for loss of cattle raises considerable difficulties of causation which, in my judgment, the Claimants have not overcome.  Although I have accepted that the Ocensa works contributed to the state of the area near to the Quebrada crossing, the long gap between the works and the first death provided the occasion for additional incremental sedimentation that was not attributable to the Ocensa works (from unaffected steep slopes above the crossing) and repeated flooding of the area, which had first occurred before the Ocensa works, as evidenced by the Second ODC Settlement.  I am unable to conclude that the overall state of the area or the precise position (which has not been identified or established) where the three cows died would have been materially different but for the Ocensa </p>

Snr Velez was adamant that the reason why he stopped using the fish ponds was because of sedimentation caused by the pipeline works, which he attributed to Ocensa.

The evidence given at trial does not establish that Snr Velez or other members of his family have gone hungry, nor is there evidence that they suffered significant adverse changes in their diet.  As I have noted at [1136] Snr Velez is a man who has the respect of his community: there is no evidence that he has suffered any actual loss of status or respect as a result of the Ocensa pipeline works. </p>

The cattle getting stuck in the Quebrada crossing is different for two reasons: first, although it was inevitable that the ROW would cross it, it was not inevitable that it would be turned into something capable of causing the death of cattle; and, second, the claim is for the death of the cows not the state of the crossing itself.  I would treat the death of cattle at the Quebrada crossing in the same way as it appears that the death of the cow on the ROW in LC39 was treated.  It was an additional incident which was not either expressly or by implication in the contemplation of the ROW Agreement.  Not only was it not mentioned but it formed no part of the calculation of compensation in the ROW Agreement (for obvious reasons).

If, therefore, subsequent damage was caused by later Ocensa pipeline works (whether in the form of subsequent erosion from the South Slope into the Quebrada crossing or more generally), it would become necessary to identify whether those later works caused material further damage (whether by making the condition of the Quebrada crossing, the area around and the 1.5 hectares which was the subject of the First Ocensa Settlement materially worse or more generally).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Claimant is Snr Jose Francisco Sequeda Tirado.  He has been married to his wife, Inés, for over fifty years.  The Court was told that he is now in his 80s {C4/3.6/771}.  It is therefore understandable that, after a long and hard-working life, he is of an age where manual labour is becoming more difficult for him.  He lives on his farm, La Gloria, with his wife and other members of his family, though they have other children who are fully independent of them and have moved away.  The Court was told that he is well respected in his community and I accept that evidence {D4/83/872}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Sequeda learnt to read and write fairly recently, and his reading and writing skills are limited: he would certainly require assistance if attempting to read and understand a complicated commercial contract.  He gave evidence with dignity and showed real emotional attachment to his land and way of life, as well as real concern for his livestock as a result of having to leave his farm to make his statement or to travel to Medellin to give evidence.  As will appear, there are a number of factual issues in this case that have to be decided, and Snr Sequeda was cross-examined thoroughly, properly and at length.  He had difficulty at times in understanding the questions that were being put to him: sometimes that could be put down to the formulation of the questions, but on other occasions it was evidently a difficulty on his part that more sophisticated or better-educated (and, possibly, younger) witnesses would not have experienced.  To that extent he was undoubtedly a witness who was in danger of being at a disadvantage and vulnerable in the trial process.  In other respects he showed considerable determination in resisting the suggestions that were being put to him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In many important respects I am not able to accept that Snr Sequeda’s evidence is reliable.  It was, however, a considerable and unwelcome surprise when the Defendant’s closing submissions on LC39 opened with the assertion that his only vulnerability was “the vulnerability of a witness who came to court ready to lie in order to advance a claim, and whose lies are slowly and surely exposed through the forensic process” {C4/4.8/615}.  This allegation had not been put to him, as it should have been if it was to be made or pursued, and it was a grave error of judgment on the part of the Defendant to advance and develop it without having done so.  On being required to review the terms of its closing submissions generally the Defendant has withdrawn the allegation of lying, though it maintains the submission that Snr Sequeda’s evidence was unreliable and wrong in a number of respects.  The allegation of lying was one that should not have been made in the original closing submissions and which was rightly withdrawn.  For the avoidance of any doubt, had I been required to rule on the point, I would have rejected any suggestion that Snr Sequeda was dishonest in the giving of his evidence. </p>

Claims relating to the lack of pasture during and after the works (including pasture rental, loss of milk products while cattle were off La Gloria, loss of calves, the cost of a new herd and losses associated with recuperation of pastures) amount to approximately COP 9 million (c. £3,300).  Claims from lost or sick cattle amount to approximately COP 13 million (c. £5,000).  The costs of establishing and maintaining fencing are claimed at approximately COP 1.5 million (c. £550).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">La Gloria, which is the property through which the ODC and Ocensa pipelines run, is approximately 46 hectares.  The pipelines ran roughly from south to north, the distance from the Ocensa pipeline’s entry to its exit at the other end of LC39 being about 725 metres.  The property is roughly rectangular in shape and is rather less broad (from east to west) than it is long (from north to south).  It is on Spread A and is about 66kms south of Caucasia and 15kms north of Zaragoza in the municipality of Zaragoza.  It is situated on and immediately to the west of the main Zaragoza to Caucasia road.  The Ocensa pipeline followed the same route as the ODC one until the northern end of La Gloria, where their routes bifurcate: the ODC pipeline continues north after passing out of the northern boundary of LC39 but the Ocensa pipeline kinks to the right and passes under the road.  The gap between the two pipelines where they follow the same route is between 19.65 and 23.15 metres {K58/564/1}.  It appears from the photographs that the Ocensa ROW extended slightly to the east of the ODC ROW, but the extent to which it did so cannot be determined with accuracy.  There are no significant areas of cutting or filling.  </p>

La Gloria is the most easterly of the three; then comes El Consuelo to its west; and then Villa Rosa.  Incora granted El Consuelo to Snr Sequeda’s wife.  Much later, in 2009 Snr Sequeda sold the 49 hectares of Villa Rosa to one of his sons for COP 9,000,000 (c. £3,500).  As with La Gloria and El Consuelo, Villa Rosa is largely forest and pasture land {Day10/12:2}.  The overall area of the farm and its division into the three plots is shown at {H2.9/12/2331}.

During a particularly bad period recently Snr Sequeda’s son-in-law, who lived in front of Snr Sequeda’s house, was killed for no apparent reason.  It was impossible to go from Zaragoza to El Bagre.  Snr Sequeda lived in fear and tried not to leave the farm.  Many people left the area. Snr Sequeda and his family “felt unprotected because at any moment one could be killed.”  Snr Sequeda speaks eloquently of the dangers of not knowing who the bad people are and says “if somebody owes me money and doesn’t pay me, I prefer to keep quiet, because if someone makes trouble, you never know what will happen to you” {D4/71/792}.  This evidence is not directly relevant to the damage that Snr Sequeda says he has suffered; but it is relevant background evidence in giving an English court insight into the land and social environment in which the Claimants live and those laying the pipelines had to work.    </p>

Snr Sequeda’s new house (of which more later) can be seen by the road.  The undulating nature of the land is clear.  The vegetation about the banks of W3 appears to snake from the middle of the photograph to the right (south).  At the bottom left corner of the photograph is the edge of the forest that covers part of La Gloria, El Consuelo and Villa Rosa.  El Consuelo is in the foreground of the picture, showing pasture that is evidently less extensively grazed than La Gloria.  {L8/9/882} is a similar view but taken from further to the north.  It shows W3 emerging from the forest and what looks like a horizontal belt of erosion on the slopes between the ROW and the road. {L8/8/881} is taken from the east side of the road looking west (i.e. in the opposite direction to the previous two photographs) and shows (at bottom right) the exit point for W1 and W2 at the culvert under the main road.  These photographs were taken in September 2010 and show some ponding just to the west of the culvert.  {L4/816/831} shows most of La Gloria and part of El Consuelo looking north-east.  At the right-hand side is a clear view of Snr Sequeda’s new house by the road.  The photograph shows the snaking vegetation of W3 flowing down to the bottom righthand corner.  It also shows numerous well-defined cattle trails and signs of erosion on slopes above the route of the ROW in about the middle of the photograph.  {L4/817/832} shows a similar view but from a slightly different angle.

To the north of AF3 and AF4 is SW2.  The area can be seen in {L8/9/882}.  Dr Savigny has marked AF3 and AF4 on {L4/830.1/847} which gives a clearer impression than the CAI.  The same underlying image has been annotated by Dr Savigny at {H2.3/3/607} showing the route of the pipelines.  Taking his two annotated images together shows that W4 flows downhill (but up from the bottom of the image) to where it crosses the ROW before joining W3.  W3 is downhill from the ROW in this area, including the point of confluence of W3 and W4.  {H2.3/3/614} shows the same area (but now looking from south to north along the pipelines).

It covers the passage of the ROW from the crossing of W3 (538+630) to the top of the slope that climbs away from the crossing (538+750).  Much of this area can be seen in two images from Dr Savigny which show Point 11.  In {H2.3/3/625} the ROWs pass from right (south) to left (north) crossing W3 and then passing above Point 11 and, further north (in the area described as Fields 1 and 2), below eroded areas of hill identified by Dr Savigny as a cattle trail.  In {H2.3/3/627} the ROWs pass from top centre (south) to bottom right (north) and point 11 can again be seen.  {H7.3/3/855} shows Point 11 to be at a lower level than the ROW, which passes above it.  As marked on the CAI, Point 267 was on or close to the banks of W3 just downstream of where the ROWs crossed it.  The route and an indication of the slopes affecting the ROW from south (bottom right) to north (top left) in this section of the pipelines are also shown on {L4/830/845}, starting with the pipelines to the west side of (and above) W3, then crossing it and going up the hill (above the stretch of W3 including Point 11) to an apparent ridge where it then heads north above the headwaters of W2 and to the northern section of LC39.  Dr Savigny agreed, and I find, that from the ROW in the area of the ellipse marked on {H2.3/3/625} there would have been a downhill slope along the ROW back towards the crossing of W3 and a component consisting of a cross-gradient downhill slope to the side of the ROW in the direction of the well at Point 11 and to the stretch of W3 on either side of it {Day36/74:6}.  In other words, there was a cross slope as the pipelines climbed away from their crossing of W3 so that eroded material would flow towards the crossing and towards the stretch of W3 to its north.  Precisely where the cross-gradient ceases to be effective as the pipelines go up the hill is not clear: but I find that soil from about the area of the ellipse on {H2.3/3/625} could find its way to Point 11 and, more generally, that eroded material from the ROW as it climbed away northwards from its crossing of W3 could find its way to Point 11 and the stretch of W3 on either side of it.  There are now two fences in this area.  One runs from W3 westwards crossing the ROW at about 538+600.  The other, known as Fenceline B, runs more or less parallel with the ROW going south from the first fence and crossing W4.  The purpose of these two fences appears to be to delimit the area for cattle to graze west of W3 and north of W4.  Its southern limit is not clearly established and cattle trails run to the west of it, the main one being what Dr Savigny has described as Trail 4 {H2.3/3/607};    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">Fields 1 and 2: this is described by the Claimants as including AF1(a) and (b) and AF2, W1 (La Enix) and W2, SW1 and Flooded Area FL1.  It broadly equates to the passage of the ROW from the hilltop at 538+750 to the exit from LC39 at 539+027.  AF1(b) spans the ROW to east and west with gradients that fall away from the ROW on each side and lies to the north of what has been described as Fenceline A.  Fenceline A crosses the ROW at about 538+835, generally at or near the top of a ridge.  AF2 lies immediately to the south of Fenceline A, to the east of the ROW and slopes downhill from the ROW towards the road.  W2 gradually converges on the ROW and is below it, with the ROW sloping downhill to the point where it crosses the stream.  AF1(a) is to the north-west of W2, in the area bounded by W2 and La Enix.  SW1 and FL1 are in AF1(a).  The southern end of this general area is shown in {H2.3/3/625} with the route of the pipelines added. The central area of AF1(b) is shown on {H2.3/3/638} with the pipeline running from top right (south) to bottom left (north) and shows the basin for W2.  The entire area is shown on {L4/816/831}.  It is also shown with the various fields that are alleged to be affected and the pipelines usefully annotated at {L4/830.1/846}.  The northern end of the passage of the ROWs on LC39 is roughly illustrated at {H2.6/8/1627}, though the annotation is incorrect in suggesting that the Ocensa ROW went through the culvert: in fact it crossed to the north of W1 before diverting off to the east to cross the line of the road.  As the pipelines approach W2 and La Enix, they are on a downhill slope towards the area of the streams.  The gradient of the ROWs down to the streams and the state of vegetation (including vegetation barriers) on and off the ROWs is shown by {L4/820/835}, which is taken from the west and has the road visible in the distance.  So it is alleged that erosion from the ROW travelled down the slope into W2 and La Enix as well as passing to east and west across AF1(b).  A similar mechanism is alleged to have affected AF2, largely to the east of the ROW.  Field AF1(a) is not now alleged to have been directly sedimented in the same way, but it is said that Snr Sequeda’s ability to rotate crops in the northern area was removed by the damage to AF1(b), which left barely enough land on AF1(a) for Snr Sequeda to cultivate for his own domestic consumption {Day2/89:2} {H5.7/12/1745}. </p>

By 1976 land clearance had begun at the southwest end of La Gloria.  The route subsequently taken by the ODC and Ocensa pipelines was still under forest.  The modern Caucasia-Zaragoza road had not been built {L1/78/78} {H2.2/2/592}.  By 1995 La Gloria was largely cleared, the road had been built and the ODC pipeline had been laid.

Parts of the ROW look quite well covered, but towards the northern end there are areas that look more like exposed soil.  Dr Savigny agreed (and I find) that the slope immediately to the south of Fenceline A was virtually bare of vegetation; immediately north of Fenceline A is better covered {Day35/149:18}.  The ROW looks even more raw on the other side of the road beyond LC39’s northern boundaries {L1/234/234}.  Stills are at {L3/809/816}; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The original Schedule of Loss {B4.1/8/71} alleged that the Ocensa pipeline was constructed across the water sources on LC39, disrupting them completely.  They were previously channelled by Snr Sequeda to feed his fish pool, which was alleged to be no longer useable.  It alleged that Snr Sequeda was left without a domestic water supply and had to build a well to ensure a continuous supply of water for his home.  Six of his cows ate though synthetic sacks of soil-cement which affected their health.  As a result the cows had to be sold at a price significantly below their market value.  As a consequence of the destruction of the water sources and the erosion caused by the movement of earth during construction, Snr Sequeda’s land is alleged to have become unsuitable for growing crops and the pastures dried up.  The large volumes of soft earth that were created during the pipeline construction process were carried towards Snr Sequeda’s trees by rainwater.  It alleged that the trees became suffocated by the earth and that the majority of them died, and that Snr Sequeda lost five cows that were buried in the soft earth.  The overall claim was for COP 414,313,924 (c.£125,000) of which approximately half was for past losses and half for the future, based on a continuing annual loss of COP 25,248,115 (c.£7,600).  </p>

Having moved to the area of Pato in 1963, Snr Sequeda acquired his land, including La Gloria, in about 1966.  He formally became owner of the property by virtue of Incora Resolution 13069 on 22 August 1969 {M/71/234}.  There was a house on Villa Rosa but the land was covered by forest.  From the outset, Snr Sequeda cleared areas of forest on which he would initially sow and plant crops.  After about 15 years of this process of clearing and crop growing, he decided to move house after having problems with his neighbour, and built the old house on La Gloria at Point 189.  It had a zinc plated roof, a wooden fence and an earth floor.  It stood on an area of about 25 x 25 metres.  The house occupied about 9x5 metres, and Snr Sequeda planted fruit trees around it. </p>

I accept that, when he moved onto La Gloria (which would have been in about 1981 or soon thereafter) he cleared the natural vegetation from some of the land he had previously rented out, which had returned to fallow, built his old house and started growing crops there.  He also planted some fruit trees near the old house.  Snr Sequeda marked the area that he first cleared and built his old house on {C6/7/1}, and I accept his marking as being broadly accurate, though it suggests an area of rather less than the 4 hectares he said he had cleared. </p>

His evidence, to which I will return, was that he had a 9 hectare area on which he used to cultivate crops on a three year rotation, thus using 3 hectares each year. He cleared this area in the first years after moving onto La Gloria.  He marked this area on {C6/7/1} in the north-eastern section of La Gloria, to the south of La Enix and roughly on the area now described by the Claimants as Fields 1 and 2, though the area </p>

I make this finding on the basis of the opinions of Dr Savigny and Snr de los Rios that AF2 was laid to pasture by the time of the 1995 aerial photograph and Dr Savigny’s opinion that the 1995 aerial photograph shows extensive sheet erosion and soil loss: see below.

His written evidence was that by the time the pipelines arrived he had about 20 cows and a bull on La Gloria in an area of approximately 12 hectares which he had cleared gradually over a number of years.  In his oral evidence he said that he first kept cattle after the first (ODC) pipeline {Day10/27:1} but this seems unlikely given his account of progressive clearance and the importance of livestock for his farming method.  He would clear an area, take one year’s crops from it, and then sow pasture.  He milked the cows primarily for domestic consumption, selling the excess to a man who came past along the road to Zaragoza.  He would also sell milk to neighbours who asked for it {D4/71/788}.  He kept two breeding sows and various other pigs.  The pigs were watered from a well near the old house and fed with cassava and maize which Snr Sequeda had grown {D4/71/789}. He had chickens, which he fed with maize that he grew.  He would sell their eggs at El Bagre, keeping some for domestic consumption {D4/71/789}.  I accept his evidence about his keeping of livestock, though I do not accept that his numbers are precisely accurate.  I understand his evidence about pigs to mean that at any time he had two breeding sows and such of their offspring as had not yet been killed or sold.  I accept that evidence though it would mean that his numbers fluctuated.  I accept that he kept quite a large number of hens, though not precisely 60, at any one time. </p>

This was a typical small-scale campesino farming operation, although Snr Sequeda had the benefit of more land than La Gloria, namely El Consuelo and Villa Rosa, which he could and did use as the need arose.

His wife and daughters took care of the pigs and hens, though it was Snr Sequeda who would feed the pigs with the cassava he brought from the fields.  When his sons worked for him, Snr Sequeda paid them as he would any other worker.  As they grew up, they got jobs that took them away from the farm; and when his daughters grew up they got married and went to live with their husbands.  Shortly before the pipelines were laid, the operation was supporting Snr Sequeda and his wife, two daughters, one son and a grandson {D4/71/793}, and there was some surplus production for other family members {D4/71/790}.  On the basis that Snr Sequeda was 80 in March 2015 {Day56/48:19}, he would then have been approximately 60.  The operation now supports Snr Sequeda, his wife, and three other family members.  At one point he ran a shop out of his house, selling items of basic need.  His evidence was that he is not selling anything at the moment as he barely has the money to buy things with {Day10/17:23}.

The ODC ROW passes through grassland and other low vegetation.  It shows a mottled, light brown tonal pattern, which indicates a graded and sparsely vegetated condition.  It shows largely 50-90% soil exposure: see also {H2.8/10/2059}.  A short way up the slope there is an area where the ROW has the appearance of extending to the east, marked with an ellipse on LC39-12 {H2.3/3/620}.  I am not satisfied it is evidence of a landslide and consider it more likely that it was the site of a temporary store of graded material or an access point onto the ODC ROW.  Eroded material from that part of the ROW would have tended to flow longitudinally down the ROW back towards the crossing with W3, but it would also be subject to the cross-gradient so that it would flow down the side slope toward Point 11 and the stretch of W3 to either side of it.  There are signs of impoundment of water to the west of the ODC ROW along the tributary into W3: see LC39-12.  Dr Savigny considered that there was evidence of remedial works to the western side of the ODC ROW within Area E2.  I am not convinced, and it is not necessary to make a finding, that it is the consequence of remedial works: I accept that it is correctly identified in the position stated by Dr Savigny and that it is 90-100% exposed soil at the time of the 1995 aerial photograph.

Those issues were, first, when he moved house and, second, whether he was still growing crops in the area at the north of La Gloria.  The date of the house move is significant because Snr Sequeda says it was provoked by the sedimentation of his well so that he had to get and carry water from a neighbour’s property.  The question whether he was still cropping the northern 9 hectares is significant both because he says he was prevented from cropping by damage caused by the Ocensa pipeline and also because it forms the basis for far and away the largest part of his claim.  Resolution of these two issues may also cast light upon the reliability or otherwise of Snr Sequeda’s evidence and case that he suffered no material damage from the ODC ROW. </p>

He described noticing damage to his water sources and how his first concern was to obtain clean water for the family’s consumption.  He and his sons started to look for a water source and his sons found water on his neighbour’s land where he dug a well.  He found that well very quickly so that the family was never without water.  With the permission of his neighbour’s sister, Snra Inés Martinez, he made a very rudimentary well.  However it took him and his wife the whole morning to carry water to their old house.  The well on the neighbour’s land was 200 metres away from the old house but the ground was steep, whereas the old well had been 80 metres away and the area was flat {D4/71/813}.  He continued: “My wife carried a pot of water on her head and I carried 1 or 2 jerry cans of 20 litres each.  However, it was very difficult because the way back to our house was uphill.  We had to do this for about 3 years.  This water was for our own consumption and for the chickens (I had already sold the pigs).  The other animals </p>

Because of the problem with the water supply, I had to move the house, so that it would be closer to the neighbour’s well.  Ever since the water source had been damaged, I thought of moving the house, but I couldn’t do it immediately because I lacked the resources.  I had to wait for a while and when I managed to get some money, I constructed the other house” {D4/71/813}.  The divergence between the two time periods mentioned in his statement (one and a half years after the laying of the pipeline as opposed to carrying water for three years) was not explained. </p>

Snr Vilaria said that he knew that Snr Sequeda’s old well filled with earth when the pipeline was laid and was totally damaged so that Snr Sequeda dug another well on his neighbour’s farm; and that one day he came and asked Snr Vilaria to help change the location of the house to take it to a place that was closer to the well on Snra Martinez’ property.  He said he remembered Snr Sequeda saying to everyone that he had to change the site of his house because “after the pipeline was laid, his water had been damaged and he needed to be closer to the well on his neighbour’s farm” {D4/74/835}.

In closing, the Claimants suggest that he may have had a temporary structure such as a shop on the site before the house was moved there.  There is no evidence to support that suggestion.  The only reference to a shop in evidence was in a question where it was suggested that “you have a shop in your house …”, to which Snr Sequeda replied “No, I don’t sell anything at the moment” {Day10/17:23}.  A little further on, the questioner returned “I think you might have told [Dr Velez] I think you did tell him that you had a shop, so you did have a shop in the house a little time ago, did you?” To which Snr Sequeda replied “yes, yes, a while ago, yes. …” {Day10/18:12}.

His identification of his house was evidently and unequivocally of a structure in the position where his new house is now located.  It was apparent as he gave his evidence (and review of the passage confirms) that he was confident in his orientation and identification of his new house.  The Claimants’ first response is to say that the new house was not identified as such by Dr Savigny on the 1995 aerial photograph.  That, to my mind, is a point of no substance given the clarity of the image showing a structure in the place pleaded as the location of the new house, the clarity of Snr Sequeda’s identification of his new house, and his evidence that there had been nothing there until he put the new house there.  The Claimants’ second response is to say that the Claimants’ old house is still visible on the 1995 image but is no longer visible on the 2002 image.  I accept that there is a mark on the 1995 image where the old house had been, but the removal of the old house would leave a mark, and the mark has not been identified by evidence as signifying a house.

In the absence of any explanation at all from Snr Sequeda or others, the settlement sum with Saipem suggests something basic.

Some of the produce he would keep as seed for the following year.  His evidence is that he would sell most of his cassava and about half of the rice.  A lot of the maize was kept for domestic consumption and what was left over was sold.  He would transport the products he was going to sell on three mules to the River Nechi.  From there they would be transported to El Bagre by river {D4/71/787}.

His witness statement said that when it rained for the first time after the pipe was covered on 13/14 January, the earth that the machines had dug “was carried downhill to where [he had] his maize, rice and cassava crops.”  He said it began to cover everything and that W2 was completely covered.  The cassava turned yellow and hard and could not be eaten.  “The only thing I thought then was that I had lost all the work I had put into these crops.”  His reaction was that nothing would grow in the affected area and that when he tried to cultivate an area between La Enix and W2 some years later, it didn’t yield anything.  His son tried to sow plantain between La Enix and the road, sowing about 50 plants.  Those plants exist but produce little and what is produced is in small bunches and good for nothing.  He was left without crops for a year and after that he started to cultivate them again on El Consuelo.  He said that because El Consuelo is very far from his house and it is difficult to maintain the same level of crops there as he had before, he now only cultivates what is necessary for family consumption, about a hectare of cassava, rice and maize {D4/71/810}.  He is now old and cannot work as he used to.  For example, he has to go as far as El Consuelo to grow crops and that is why he only grows the minimum needed to support his family.

However, the accuracy of that evidence was successfully challenged during cross-examination when he accepted that perhaps this observation was not based on when he was working there but on some other time when he was in the area {Day11/54:24}.  He too would have been on LC39 for no more than about two days and I have no confidence that he has any memory of seeing what he describes while he was working there.  I had the clear impression at the time (which review of his evidence has confirmed) that his suggestion in cross-examination that he may have seen this happening at some other time when he was in the area was an immediate attempt to shore up his evidence and was not based on any actual memory.  I reject his evidence that he saw what he described in his witness statement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">One troubling aspect for the Court when trying to determine the truth of what happened about growing crops in the north of LC39 is the remarkable lack of precision about where crops were growing at the material time.  I have accepted that at some point Snr Sequeda was cropping north of Fenceline A.  He was operating on a rotation system, and on the northern section of La Gloria would plant one hectare of maize in April, 1 ½ hectares of rice on a different part of the cropping land in May and cassava from June, which he would plant between the maize and the rice.  Accepting that the purpose of rotation was to leave the areas that were not being cropped fallow, it follows that there would have been more than one area in the northern section which would have been used in rotation for cropping.

This is not an idle point as it is now common ground that sediment from the ROW would not have passed onto Field 1(a).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There is a second consideration which I bear in mind in my approach to this claim. It has two elements.  First, given the Defendant’s case, I look for reasons why Snr Sequeda would have abandoned his northern cropping area before 1995.  It was reasonably placed for his old house and, on his evidence, he had worked that piece of land for a number of years.  One possible reason would be that, as part of the normal process of converting his land to pasture, he decided that it was time to move on and to lay the area down to pasture for the future.  I have no reason to reject Snr Sequeda’s evidence that AF2 was at some stage part of his cropping area to the north of La Gloria.  I am also satisfied on the evidence of Dr Savigny and Snr de los Rios that he had given that field over to pasture by September 1995<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="31">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> This appeared at one point to be common ground {Day56/63:3}, but apparently is not {Day59/138:7}. </p>
	      </authorialNote>; but Fenceline A remained in place and I am not satisfied that Snr Sequeda was using the area north of it for pasturing his cattle before September 1995.  That leads to the second element: if he was abandoning the northern cropping area (for whatever reason) why did he not lay down an equivalent area to crops elsewhere, whether on La Gloria or (to a greater extent than he did) on El Consuelo or Villa Rosa?  On his case in this litigation, the reduction in cropping deprived him of his pigs and most of his hens, which were integral to his wellbeing and income, in addition to removing his ability to sell surplus crops.  In short, on his case, it has reduced him to bare subsistence.  Yet, on his case and evidence, he did not clear or start to use an equivalent area elsewhere on his three properties, even to replace AF2.  Non-replacement of AF2 would suggest a decision to contract.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The only reason that is put forward for not replacing cropping land is that it is a long way to El Consuelo or Villa Rosa and that it would be a long way to carry heavy loads.  That is an understandable submission for Snr Sequeda now, in his eighties; but it requires further consideration when applied to the period of the arrival of the pipelines, when he was approximately sixty and had the assistance of at least one of his sons.  The assertion in the Original Schedule of Loss that “the three male members of the family who previously lived on the farm now earn a living elsewhere as farm labourers in order to support their families” {B4.1/8/73} carried the implication that they had moved away because of the damage to La Gloria.  That is not consistent with Snr Sequeda’s evidence that “when [his] sons grew up, they got jobs outside the farm: in the army, in mines and in trade; …” {D4/71/793}.  I reject the implication of the Original Statement of Loss and accept Snr Sequeda’s evidence on this point.  It carries no implication that the sons left because of damage to La Gloria and contradicts the assertion that they left to become farm labourers elsewhere; to the contrary, it suggests the natural fragmentation of the family as sons made their own way in the world.  The effect, though, would have been and was to reduce the supply of family labour available to Snr Sequeda on the farm.   </p>

Both experts identify AF2 as pasture.  There is reasonable consistency between the experts; and neither identifies the area as having crops.  Dr Savigny was pressed hard in cross-examination about AF1(a) and AF1(b).  He accepted that he would not be confident (“comfortable”) with the classification of land as cultivated unless it had a geometric pattern to it, and that he could not identify geometric patterns on the photograph; but he also maintained his evidence that he could see pasture-like signatures and evidence of land that was in transition to pasture.  Although Snr Sequeda’s description of how he planted his crops does not refer to geometric patterns, it was Dr Velez’ evidence that rice, maize and cassava would be grown in patterns and at set intervals in a manner that would give rise to geometric patterns, and there is no evidence that Snr Sequeda did not act in that way.  To the contrary, his evidence of interplanting (so far as it goes) is more consistent with regular patterns of planting than anything else.  There is also force in the Defendant’s submission that there would have been up to 3 hectares of cassava in the cropped area (and nothing in the fallow areas): yet neither expert identified any discrete area as being different in appearance from the others; </p>

My assessment is different.  The paragraph in his statement was in more or less standard form for witness statements produced by the Claimants and I have no confidence that he would have used the same words or volunteered the same sentiments if left to his own devices; and I do not find it surprising that a campesino farmer of Snr Sequeda’s age and upbringing should vary in his ability to deal with aerial images during the course of a long and trying period giving evidence.  On a number of occasions he either put on, or took off, his glasses in an attempt to work out what was going on.  Doing the best I could when viewing a witness over a videolink, I formed the view that his occasional difficulties were genuine.

The Ocensa ROW Agreement {M/75T.1/251.10} simply referred to “trees, pastures and general vegetation” and a fence with three lines of barbed wire.  The terms of the documents, taken on their own, are consistent with the Defendant’s case, but no more than that.  True, Snr Sequeda clearly identified not only that his crops were going to be affected by ODC but also the need to keep his accesses clear; but there is no satisfactory evidence about the formulation of the Ocensa ROW Agreement that would justify the finding that, if there were crops in the way of the ROW, they would have been mentioned: see [1486] below.  None of the ROW Agreements for LC50, LC54 or LC74 mentions crops, and no analysis of those or other Ocensa ROW Agreements has been done to demonstrate that, where crops were affected, they were always mentioned.  Thus, without more, the documents do not positively support the point.  However, in crossexamination Snr Sequeda said that he didn’t think that the works would damage the crops because he didn’t think the ROW would go through where the crops were but would go by the side of where the crops were {Day10/55:6}.  My initial reaction on hearing this evidence was that Snr Sequeda was making it up as he went along, under pressure from the crossexaminer.

Even if the damage was not immediately apparent while the work was still continuing, he had subsequent dealings with Ocensa and Saipem as a result of which he entered into Paz y Salvos with each.  I observed Snr Sequeda to be a man who appeared to be show gentleness and humility in his dealings with others.  I have no doubt that he is tough and may be stubborn in many ways but, for example, I do not assess him as having the same willingness to complain and ability to press his case as Snr Velez of La Nieve.

That must be wrong.  On his account, the Ocensa works caused damage after Recomposition of the ROW in March 1997, and on any version of events they cannot have caused damage before January 1997, by which time his maize and rice had been harvested and were not there to be damaged.

Furthermore, the Claimant’s pleaded case is that 3.6 (9-5.4) hectares in the northern block remained undamaged {B4.2/4/180}: that figure remains the same if AF2 is left out of account on both sides of the equation.  No evidence has been put forward to explain why Snr Sequeda did not either (a) use the undamaged part of the northern block, or (b) use other land that had already been cleared or (c) clear more land.  His only evidence in his witness statement is, as summarised above, that he cultivates sufficient land on El Consuelo to meet the family’s needs, but no more.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant’s ninth point is to highlight the changes in the formulation of the claim with time.  The Original Schedule of Loss said that “as a consequence of the destruction of the water sources and the erosion caused by the movement of earth during construction, the Claimant’s land became unsuitable for growing crops and the pastures dried up.  The large volumes of soft earth that were created during the pipeline construction process were carried towards [the Claimant’s trees by rainwater.  The trees became suffocated by the earth and the majority of them died.  … The Claimant’s farm is now completely dry and the few crops that are grown are solely for domestic consumption.  The farm no longer produces sufficient crops to provide feed for livestock” {B4.1/8/72}.  The general thrust of these passages is that trees were destroyed by movements of earth and that the loss of crops was because of destruction of watercourses.  It is capable of being read as including the allegation that the land became unsuitable for growing crops because of the destruction of water sources and by erosion, but is not happily phrased if that was the intention.  The 2011 Further Information pleaded that “during and immediately after the construction of the Ocensa pipeline [the cropping area of 4-6 hectares] was affected by the flow of sediments downhill from the ROW and was no longer suitable for growing crops.  The Claimant harvested the crops the year of the construction and sowed yucca again.  However, this did not grow properly and no crop was produced” {B2.1/11/88}.  This is broadly consistent with the present case apart from the suggestion that Snr Sequeda replanted yucca, which is not.  The February 2012 Further Information {B2.2/33/362} for the first time identified that AF1(a) was affected indirectly by the sedimentation of La Enix and W2, where previously it had been alleged that it had itself become sedimented.  I accept that the technical case being advanced has changed; but the changes do not of themselves support a conclusion that no crops were being cultivated or that no damage was sustained north of Fenceline A; </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant’s tenth point is the lack of expert evidence in support of this claim.  I deal with aspects of this point later, but at this stage I note two aspects of Dr Velez’ evidence.  In his first report Dr Velez said that (a) where vegetation is on hillsides with gradients above 7.5% the impact of sediments is short term and lesser because the action of the rain drags sediments down toward the lower lying areas; and (b) if cassava plants were in the initial stages of growth the damage from sedimentation might be considerable, even affecting the leaves, but if they are in their productive stage, the effect might be smaller provided the flow of sediments does not occur as an avalanche {H5.3/4/611}.  By January to March 1997 Snr Sequeda’s cassava would have been ready for harvest.  Its precise height is not known but Dr Velez accepted that cassava can grow to over a metre high {Day33/115:18}.  When asked in his oral evidence about the possible impact of sedimentation on Snr Sequeda’s crops, Dr Velez concentrated exclusively on the early stages of growth, concluding that when cassava is 4 or 5 centimetres high, the effect of sedimentation could affect even the leaf development of the crop {Day33/116:2}.  That is a very far cry from what would have been the position with Snr Sequeda’s cassava in January to March 1997.  What is more, the general gradients around the ROW on AF1(b) were in excess of 7.5% except as they approached and crossed the streams.  Taken in conjunction with Dr Uribe’s evidence (which I accept) that, with cassava of 1 metre high, even 1-2 cms of soil from Horizon B would not adversely affect fertility or the environment where the roots of the cassava were currently growing, Dr Velez’ evidence does not support the proposition that sedimentation from the Ocensa ROW would have caused the sort of damage to an existing cassava crop so graphically described by Snr Sequeda.  The Defendant’s point is substantially reinforced when consideration is given to the amount of sediment that could have flowed from the ROW onto his crops in AF1(b).  As a rough indication, even if I were to accept Dr Card’s estimates of soil loss from his fifth report (which I do not, for reasons given elsewhere), his estimate for the whole of the LC39 ROW from completion of backfill to completion of reinstatement works was 134 tonnes/hectare, and from completion of reinstatement to 15% vegetation cover was 9 tonnes/hectare {H1.6/25/1519}.  The stretch of the ROW that could have affected AF1(b) was 267 metres.  Allowing for sobreanchos of 9 metres, Dr Card’s soil loss figure for this stretch between completion of backfill and completion of reinstatement works (taken by Dr Card as 15 January 1997-13 April 1997) would be of the order of 121.6 tonnes, or 76m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>.  If all of that quantity had been spread evenly over the 23,694m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> of AF1(b) alleged to have been affected, it would have provided a layer of sediment 3.2mm deep.  While recognising that (a) Dr Card’s figures are unreliable for the reasons set out previously (b) not all of the amount would have gone onto AF1(b) and (c) it cannot be assumed that the sediment would in fact have spread itself evenly over AF1(b), these figures taken in conjunction with Dr Velez’ evidence to which I have referred provide evidence that Snr Sequeda’s account of what happened is unreliable; </p>

For the purposes of writing this judgment I have re-read the whole transcript of the interview.  It is consistent with Snr Sequeda cropping in the northern section of La Gloria before the Ocensa pipeline came through: see, in particular, {H24.2/207.2/1015.79} to {H24.2/207.2/1015.94}; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant’s twelfth point is that the claim for loss of crops is exaggerated.  If it had remained the Defendant’s case that Snr Sequeda had been advancing his cropping claim dishonestly, the existence or scale of exaggeration might have been of value in deciding whether there was any substance at all in the claim.  Now that the allegation of dishonesty is not pursued, I do not find this point persuasive on the question whether or not Snr Sequeda had been cropping north of Fenceline A at all; </p>

The evidence was sometimes self-contradictory, but I did not consider at the time (and, on review, do not consider now) that the answers he gave which accepted that he had been cropping on El Consuelo and Villa Rosa before 1996 were the result of confusion or misunderstanding.  The interview with Dr Velez, Dr Delgado and his solicitor contains evidence relevant to this point too.  It suggests that Snr Sequeda was cropping the northern area of La Gloria intermittently, using a three hectare area every five or six years: see {H24.2/207.2/1015.92}.  This was not explored in evidence or closing submissions and I am therefore cautious about placing too much weight upon it.  But it is consistent with and supports the answers that Snr Sequeda gave in crossexamination where he appeared to accept that he had been cropping on El Consuelo and Villa Rosa as well as La Gloria before 1996. </p>

The Defendant’s case is that the northern area of La Gloria, if and to the extent that it had ever been a cropping area, had been abandoned by September 1995, so that no damage was caused to crops in January to March 1997 and no loss of crops was suffered in the northern area in either the short or the long term.

AF2 is south of the fenceline and had been abandoned as a cropping area before 1995.  I do not know when it was abandoned.  I accept that Snr Sequeda abandoned it because it had deteriorated; but that was not caused by the Ocensa pipeline and the evidence does not satisfy me that it was abandoned as a result of anything that happened relating to the ODC pipeline, though it could have been.  I therefore make no positive finding on the cause of the deterioration that led him to abandon it. </p>

I accept the evidence to which I have referred above that he was cropping on El Consuelo and La Gloria before the Ocensa pipeline.  I reject the evidence that Snr Sequeda was cropping the northern part of La Gloria on a three year rotation.  That would have been at the limits of what was sustainable, and Snr Sequeda had no need to work his land so hard given the large area he had at his disposal.  I find that, as evidenced by the interview, he was working on a five year rotation on the northern part of La Gloria.  That explains why he was also using land on El Consuelo and Villa Rosa.  Also, since he was using about three hectares at a time, it means that in some years there would be no crops on the northern area of La Gloria: this is consistent with the account he gave in the interview that he had had crops on the northern area about five years before the Ocensa pipeline went through and again at the time of the Ocensa works.  It would also explain why neither Snr de los Rios nor Dr Savigny could identify the presence of crops north of Fenceline A in September 1995 and why that area provides a relatively homogenous appearance: there were, as I find, no crops on that area in October 1995. </p>

There is no longer a contradiction between the absence of crops on the northern area in September 1995 and Snr Sequeda’s evidence that he planted crops there the following year.  Furthermore, it is consistent with and provides some explanation for the evidence that he waited a while before trying to use the northern area again for crops – he had other areas to use; and for why he did not complain about the damage in the northern area – although important, it was not the life threatening event that has been subsequently portrayed.  The evidence from the interview (which I accept) that the loss of the northern area for cropping did not lead to a reduction in the amount of crops that he had before and after the pipeline (other than perhaps in the short term) provides the answer to the questions that I have posed earlier: he didn’t abandon it before 1995, and he did not have to lay down an equivalent area to crops elsewhere immediately after any problems from the Ocensa pipeline because he already had other areas that he was cropping.   </p>

I accept that he is now old and cannot work as he used to, to the extent that his children want him to stop working altogether.  That would have affected his ability to work and caused a progressive reduction in the amount of crops he would have grown over time even if he was still using the northern section of La Gloria as part of his cropping area.  On my finding that he used the northern area intermittently even before 1995, he would have been doing at least a large proportion of his cropping on the further fields in any event.  I reject the suggestion that the additional distance in each direction to the further fields over and above the distance that he would have walked to the northern section of La Gloria was or is either the reason or a materially contributing reason for growing fewer crops than he would have done otherwise.

More generally, the ODC ROW was largely 50-90% exposed soil along the stretch above W3 and leading to the crossings of W3 and W4, with the area near the visible sedimentation or impoundment being 90-100% exposed soil.  That exposed soil, together with background erosion from the W4 drainage basin will have contributed to sediment in W3 and W4 in this area.

The Claimants CAI identifies points 266 and 267 as being near to the well, but does not identify a position for the well itself.  Dr Tobon asserted in his first report both that the well was on the streambed of W3 and (on the basis of a personal communication from Snr Sequeda) that it filled with sediment originating on the ROW and transported by W3 and that “this occurs especially during rainfall when stream water overflows from its bed due to silt and inundates the entire area around the well which consequently had to be abandoned” {H7.3/3/872}.  Elsewhere, however, he said that at least part of the sediment came from above the well, from near point 266 {H7.3/3/872} {H7.3/3/855}.  Dr Card identified Point 266 as being an area of soil sheet erosion which was causing widespread erosion of soil and sedimentation downslope into W3 {H1.1/1/158}.  On Dr Savigny’s understanding of the position of the old well, it was above the level of the stream and could not have been sedimented by waters from the stream: the cause of sedimentation would have been the headwaters of the tributary to W3 that are near to Point 266 {Day36/84:11}; </p>

If and to the extent that there was also substantial sedimentation from W3 (which appears to be the Claimants’ case on the basis of Dr Tobon’s evidence) it suggests that the ODC ROW caused substantial sedimentation of W3 further upstream.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.10in">The condition of the ODC ROW in September 1995 provides all the necessary conditions for continued erosion from the exposed stretch of the ROW and sedimentation of the water course below.  Although the ODC ROW was narrower than that subsequently used by Ocensa, there is no evidence to suggest that the differences in absolute volumes of soil that was stripped, stored and replaced would have rendered the ODC ROW immune from erosion on a similar scale when subjected to the rigours of the climate that subsequently affected Ocensa’s works as well.  Dr Savigny’s opinion that there are signs of impoundment of water to the west of the ODC ROW along the tributary into W3 also supports a finding of sedimentation coming from the ODC ROW.  On the basis of Dr Savigny’s evidence I find that there had been and continued to be erosion and sedimentation from the ROW and that it was the cause of the impoundment that he suspected he could see; </p>

As I have explained in [1423](ii), as it climbed away from the crossing of W3, there was a cross-gradient as a result of which soils being eroded from either the ODC ROW or the Ocensa ROW would have flowed to the place of the fish pool at point 11 and into W3 to either side.  Snr Sequeda attributes the sedimentation of the fish pool to the Ocensa pipeline; but in September 1995 the ODC pipeline on the slope away from the crossing with W3 largely showed 50-90% soil exposure and there was suspected impoundment behind an obstruction in the unnamed reach of the westward tributary of W3 close to Point 11.  There is no evidence of any longitudinal drains or other geotechnical devices to prevent sediment from the ROW entering W3 or a fish pool at Point 11.  No fish pool can be seen on the 1995 aerial image to identify its position or condition with any greater certainty; </p>

I accept that he dug a fish pool at some point in the manner he describes, but am not confident that he has an actual recollection of when that was in relation to the arrival of the pipelines.  If he had dug the pool approximately one year before the Ocensa pipeline works, that would have been approximately the end of 1995.  In the light of Dr Savigny’s evidence and my findings about the state of the ODC ROW and surrounding areas in September 1995, it would have been an odd time and place for Snr Sequeda to dig a pool, as it would have been obvious that it was liable to be affected by the sedimentation which had already happened and was continuing to happen from the ODC ROW.  That suggests that he dug the pool before the ODC pipeline, which is consistent with his evidence that it became silted up before he moved his house. </p>

The significant features for present purposes are that the ODC ROW has recovered better than in much of its more southerly passage, that W2 and La Enix both flow freely across their junction with the ODC ROW and that both streams had areas of wetland, largely at some distance upstream from the ODC ROW. </p>

Revegetation works were being carried out on a stretch that includes LC39 during May 1997 and were completed by the end of May {K45/471T/1} {K46/478T/3}.  The Claimants submit that this indicates there was a delay between long-term geotechnical works and revegetation works.  This cannot be resolved on the basis of the documentary records alone as they are insufficiently precise.  However, there is also evidence from Snr Perez Bracamonte, of whom more later, which suggests that there was no significant gap between long term geotechnical works and revegetation.  His evidence is that he worked on long term geotechnical works at the same time as the seed sowing team {D11.2/171/2070}.  Taken together with the evidence of Snr Loeber about the lack of precision in the dates and descriptions in the weekly reports, this evidence suggests that they should be interpreted as meaning that revegetation on the stretch including LC39 was probably taking place in May 1997 but that they do not exclude some works being carried out before then.  Equally, the evidence of Snr Perez should probably not be taken as meaning that long term geotechnical works and revegetation were always being carried out by the same people at the same place at the same time; but it does suggest that the same gangs of workers were working closely on long term geotechnical and revegetation works.  Taken overall, the evidence does not require or justify a finding either that there was a gap of as much as a month between the conclusion of long term geotechnical works or that there was no gap at all.  On the evidence, I find that revegetation works happened within about a month of the long term geotechnical works, on dates which I am unable to specify with any greater precision. </p>

The lack of better coincidence with the results from the weather station is likely to be because the results are incomplete.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Sequeda gave little evidence about the manner in which the Ocensa works were carried out {D4/71/798}ff.  He did not pay close attention when the bulldozer stripped the ROW but said that branches, stones and vegetation were dumped outside the ROW on his property.  Once the pipe was brought onto La Gloria, it was left with gaps between sections so that cattle could pass through.  He said that when the digger opened the trench “the excavated earth was thrown on to both sides of the trench on the [ROW]” [85].  He then says (at [86]) that “the excavated earth was being piled up on one side of the trench, at a certain distance so that the machines wouldn’t pass over it.”  His statement that excavated earth from the trench was piled on one side of the trench is consistent with the normal procedure and there was nothing that required a different procedure to be adopted on La Gloria: see [308]-[310] above.  I find that trench spoil was placed on one side of the trench for the short time that it was out of it; but either topsoil or graded material could have been placed on either side of the ROW as he describes.  He did not describe substantial stockpiles of soil either in his witness statement or in his oral evidence.  Apart from costales, he said that he did not see any other type of land protection [111].  He did not see how the pipeline was constructed across the streams [113].   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Sequeda’s evidence about lack of land protection was contradicted by Snr Perez Bracamonte, whose evidence was that his work included making cortacorrientes, gabions and barreras germinadoras for streams, and that he installed cortacorrientes and gabions and planted grass on La Gloria.  His evidence was that “the stream” was badly damaged due to the earth that had been deposited in it, and he said that “this earth was either side of the [ROW] and ran down towards the stream” {D11.2/171/2071}.  He said that when working on the farm he saw that the land and streams became more and more covered with the earth which had been moved by the machinery and which he said was deposited on the sides of the ROW and ran into the streams which became blocked {D11.2/171/2072}.  However, when cross-examined he gave contradictory evidence, first accepting that there were no mounds of earth at the side of the ROW {Day11/20:5}, then saying that he had seen that earth deposited on the sides of the ROW ran into the streams which became blocked {Day11/20:14}, then suggesting that maybe because it was a harsh winter the earth had already gone into the stream by the time he got there {Day11/20:20}, and in re-examination saying that there was a little bit of earth at the sides {Day11/29:1}.  The nature of his work means that the ROW had already been recomposed by the time he got there, as he confirmed {Day 11/15:6}.  While it is possible that he might have seen after-effects of soil making its way into streams, I reject his evidence that he actually saw soil from the sides of the ROW running into the streams on La Gloria.  He referred to two streams on La Gloria, one of which he identified as La Enix and the other as being in the middle of the farm (which suggests he was referring to W3).  His evidence was that they built gabions and that one of the streams (which he thought was the smaller one) had a blockage cleared {Day11/23:1}, which involved removing a great deal of weed growth {Day11/31:3}.  I had the impression at the time that his description of clearing a stream on La Gloria of weeds at a blocked crossing was based on recollection and I find that what he described did happen, and happened at a crossing of W3. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Pedro Blanco was a pipebender who worked on the spread including LC39 and worked on LC39 for about a day and a half {Day11/41:21}.  His witness statement contained a number of statements about the general conduct of the works {D11.2/180/2144}ff, but when cross-examined it became clear that he was not reliable as a witness and that his evidence had to be treated with considerable caution to determine whether, and if so where, it could be relied on and where it could not.  Thus, for example, his evidence about what he said happened to Snr Sequeda’s cassava crop was not based on recollection and I have rejected it: see [1461](iii) above.  Similarly, I do not accept that his evidence about Snr Sequeda’s fishpond at [25] of his witness statement was based on any actual recollection, and I reject it.  There is, however, some of his evidence that I am able to accept.  He clarified, and I accept, that it did not rain during the day while he was working on LC39 but said that it rained at night {Day11/53:7}.  I accept that he saw costales installed, but not that he had any recollection of seeing them carried away by rain, on Snr Sequeda’s farm.  He gave evidence that he saw fique matting in some places on the ROW on Snr Sequeda’s farm, which I accept; and I also accept that he did not see on LC39 pipes that were installed to reroute the flow of streams where the ROW crossed them.  I do not find his evidence that “the streams no longer flowed along the original channels because of all the soil that had been stirred up” to be based on reliable recollection of what he saw on LC39.  He did not see soil actually being carried down to the stream, as it was not raining when he was there; but, although I reject the evidence as given specifically in relation to LC39, I accept that there may have been times when he saw channels of streams that had been disturbed by the works.  I also accept his evidence that, in general, topsoil and graded materials from lower levels were stored separately along the ROW.  He did not remember seeing trinchos, but that may have been a failure of memory rather than because they were not there and I place no weight upon it.  I reject his evidence that he saw earth that had been piled up on LC39 being washed downhill, but I felt at the time he gave his evidence and, having reviewed his written and oral evidence for the purposes of this judgment, I maintain the assessment (and find) that his evidence, though exaggerated and unreliable in the form in which he gave it, was based on a recollection that one or more stream crossings on Snr Sequeda’s land showed signs of disturbance and of soil having made its way into the water at or near the crossings.  His evidence was put into proper perspective in reexamination: when asked how much of the soil was carried away from the ROW by rain as he had been describing he said “I couldn’t say exactly how much [soil] was taken when it rained”, and on being further pressed as to whether it was a little bit, a lot, most of it, or none of it, replied “a little” {Day11/62:6}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Antonio Navarro was a labourer who worked on lowering the pipe into the trench.  Given the rate at which the front progressed, he too would have been working on LC39 for about 1 ½ days or so.  His evidence confirms that the general practice was for soil from the trench to be placed to one side {D11.1/153/1851}.  His witness statement stated that there would be collapses of soil into the excavated trench, which then had to be removed before the pipe could be laid in the trench.  I do not accept that he has any recollection of this happening on LC39 or that it did so {Day12/29:24} {Day12/33:17}.  The other aspect of his evidence on which the Claimants rely is his general evidence that, on the properties where he worked, “especially when it rained soil ran downhill towards the lower parts where the streams were” and that it “eventually went into the water, which changed appearance; it became cloudy.”  I do not accept that he had a specific recollection of that happening on LC39, though I accept that he had a general recollection of stream waters becoming cloudy where soil had gone into them.  Similarly, I do not accept his evidence that there was too much soil in trinchos, with the result that they sometimes overflowed, was more than a general recollection of something that could happen.  It is not a specific recollection of what happened on LC39, though I accept his evidence that there were trinchos installed on Snr Sequeda’s property {Day12/18:18}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Alberto Antonio Perez did not give evidence but his witness statement was the subject of a Civil Evidence Act Notice {D11.1/156/1871}.  He worked on the pipe before it was lowered into the ground, applying rubber after it had been soldered together.  He says he worked on LC39.  There are three reasons to treat his evidence with caution.  First, it has not been tested in cross-examination.  Second, where the statements of his fellow workers have been tested in cross-examination, it has been shown that the statements purport to go well beyond what the witness can and will say if the evidence is tested.  Third, given the nature of the process on which Snr Perez was engaged, he would have been on La Gloria during the first half of January 1997, probably for a couple of days at most.  January 1997 was at the height of the dry season and, as summarised above, the records at Zaragoza record rain on three days in January 1997.  Yet Snr Perez asserts that “when [he] worked [on the Ocensa pipeline] it was the rainy season and it rained especially hard at night.”  This error goes to the heart of the evidence on which the Claimants wish to rely, namely his statement that he “saw that a lot of earth ran into the small streams and this wasn’t a good sign, it occurred especially when it rained”; and also that La Enix, which he describes as a large stream, is “full of earth where the pipeline passes” and is “silted” {D11.1/156/1878}.  He does not say expressly that he saw these things happening while he was working on LC39, but the Claimants wish to rely upon his statement in support of findings that they did.  For the reasons I have set out, I do not consider that it would be right to place any weight at all on the evidence of Snr Perez in support of a finding about what happened on LC39.  If he worked on LC39 at all (on which I make no finding one way or another) his statement indicates that he has no reliable memory of his time there or what happened while he was working on the property. </p>

There is no satisfactory evidence that there were substantial stockpiles on LC39 during the Ocensa works.  Neither Snr Sequeda nor any of the witnesses who were on LC39 between the stripping of the ROW and recomposition describes substantial stockpiles.  Had they been there I am confident that Snr Sequeda would have remembered them and given evidence about where they were; but he did not.  The closest he came to describing substantial stockpiles was when he said in his evidence that when the trench was dug “they threw the earth to each side, mounted up, piled up, and then this machine came down to put the tube into the trench with a crane…” {Day10/69:19}.  He later said that when or after covering up the pipeline they were “tossing earth all over the place, all over in the [ROW].”  This is not an adequate evidential basis for a finding that there was a negligent placing or shaping of stockpiles or that they were too high or of too great volume.

I do not doubt that the diggers worked fast and that sometimes they will have seemed to be tipping soil rapidly; but that is in the nature of such projects and machinery and, to my mind, is quite different from what is required to prove the case being advanced by the Claimants, which is that there were substantial and inappropriately placed stockpiles from which came the erosion suggested by Dr Card and complained of by the Claimants.  I note that Dr Savigny’s analysis of the 1995 aerial photograph identified an elliptical area which could have been the position of a store of graded material during the ODC works: see [1449](iv) above.  No such area has been identified in relation to the Ocensa works and, for the avoidance of doubt, I reject Dr Card’s evidence about the existence and size of stockpiles, and their being the source of extensive erosion, as being both unscientific and wrong.   </p>

The findings that the Claimants seek are that there were none, or that they were inadequate.  In the light of my findings that there were some trinchos and that there were no substantial stockpiles on LC39, the evidence does not justify a finding that there should have been retention structures that were not provided.  Equally, in the absence of any satisfactory evidence identifying where installed retention structures failed in their intended function, there is no basis for a finding that retention structures were inadequate or that there was a failure to review, maintain, replace or rectify retention structures on LC39.   </p>

His table 13.3, which was said to be a summary of his findings, identifies that the slope gradients that he recorded were steeper (up to 48 or 49%) than those in the GDS, which would imply that there should have been reduced spacings between the ditch diverters.

This is at least partially explained because Dr Card found no physical evidence of erosion matting and did not analyse the GDS requirements for its use.  For reasons set out elsewhere, the absence of current evidence of erosion matting is not evidence that it was not used in the first place, because it is bio-degradable.  However, I am left with the position that, for the reasons I outlined at [569]ff, the mere fact that matting was omitted on slopes between 10% and 20% (if proved) would not automatically negligent; and I have no evidence from Dr Card or elsewhere that satisfies me that any deficiency in the provision of erosion matting was on a slope with a gradient that made its omission negligent. </p>

In his oral evidence he said that this evidence applied to LC39 and that the force of the water on the type 1 cortacorrientes (which were staked into the ground) took out the stakes or broke them and took the soil sacks down the slope to the larger stream on La Enix.  His evidence was that his supervisors sometimes went back to do the works that were affected and that sometimes they were left as they were; and that sometimes he had to go back and re-do works where the cortacorrientes had been pulled out in the way he described.  He did not remember how often that happened and was not involved in the work performed by Community Action about two or three months later {Day11/18:10}.  His witness statement implied that the damage he was describing had happened while he was on site doing his work; but it later became clear that was not the case and that he was talking about something he said he had seen some two months later {Day11/35:10}, which would have been in about May/June 1997.  His evidence on when he went back was inconsistent, because elsewhere he referred to going back about two weeks after he had first been there and that his return visit had been in December {Day11/24:9}.  I am certain that he was confused about the months in which he was on LC39 and place no weight on his references to December.  I accept that he went back to LC39 on maintenance work once, some months after he had first been there.  I accept his evidence that he saw damage to one or more cortacorrientes, one or more of which had been displaced by severe weather conditions causing erosion; but I do not accept the general picture he gives of widespread failure of cortacorrientes or of multiple sacks rolling (or having rolled) into La Enix.  Nor do I accept that some displaced sacks on LC39 were replaced or repaired in the course of his maintenance work but not others.  His evidence about only some sacks being replaced or repaired seemed to me to be entirely general and not based upon recollection of actual events on LC39 and that is what I find it to have been; </p>

Applying the principles there set out, I do not accept that longitudinal drains were required either by contract or by the application of good practice on LC39.  While positioning a longitudinal drain on, for example, the west side of the ROW as it climbed away to the north from W3 would have prevented the flow of water and any sediment onto the slope that ultimately went down to W3 on either side of the fish pool, it would have had the effect of concentrating the flow of run-off down towards where the ROW crossed W3, with the clear potential for exacerbating problems there.  It was in my view a justifiable and correct decision to allow waters to flow relatively diffusely onto the vegetated slope rather than to concentrate its point of discharge lower down.  Similarly, as a matter of engineering judgment, there was an obvious trade-off between allowing any water and sediment from the ROW to be dispersed onto AF1(b) rather than funnelling it all down to La Enix.  I therefore reject the submission that longitudinal drains and associated energy dissipation structures and sediment traps were required on LC39 and prefer and adopt the opinion of Dr Savigny that they were not. </p>

As before, there is no expert analysis of the reasons why events took place when they did, and no analysis of any period that is alleged to involve culpable delay.  The absence of such evidence is particularly telling in relation to LC39 where the longest period (December 1996 to March 1997), though it involved occasions of heavy rain, was during the dry season.  March 1997 was remarkably dry.  By the time that long term geotechnical works were carried out in early April 1997 the season was changing, though the majority of April’s rain fell in the second half, and revegetation took place (as I have found) less than a month after the long term geotechnical works.  In the absence of any analysis of the reasons for the execution of the works when they were done it is, in my judgment, insufficient to recount Snr Loeber’s acceptance that soil in a naked condition is more likely to erode and that the consequences of erosion could be and sometimes were severe on stretch A {Day19/9:1}; and any reliance on that acceptance must in any event be tempered by the terms of his following evidence, which was that erosion was very unlikely because they were in the dry season {Day19/12:19}.   </p>

He complained to Ocensa that his pasture on El Consuelo was not sufficient for his cows and that he was losing pasture on La Gloria that he could have used for his cattle.  When he complained, the contractors told him that they were going to fence the areas where they had sown the grass and that they did so, telling him to collect (i.e. remove) the wire after the grass had taken root.

It is wrong to suggest that he was instructed to take down the wire when he did, though I accept that he waited until it seemed to him that the grass had taken root, which was in accordance with the advice he had been given.  I also accept that by a combination of trampling and grazing, the cattle on their return caused damage to cortacorrientes in unspecified locations south of Fenceline A, which would have had the twin effects of reducing or preventing altogether the effectiveness of the cortacorrientes that were damaged and providing an additional source of (now) uncontained material from the sacks.

Where pathways for sediment flow existed on and from the ROW, the fact that there were incidents of heavy rainfall while the ROW was exposed and vulnerable provides support for the Claimant’s case that erosion occurred, as it would have done during the period of the ODC ROW’s exposure and vulnerability up to and including the time of the September 1995 aerial photograph and, I infer, thereafter.</p>

Dr Savigny accepted that soil washed down the ROW during and after construction would have been a source of sediment flowing into La Enix and W2, recognising the gravitational pathway along the ROW and down the slope {Day36/30:20} {H2.3/3/641}.  He also recognised that at the time of his inspections sediment from the northern slope was being carried downslope to W2, which implies acceptance that erosion generated on the ROW would find its way downhill towards W2 {H2.7/9/1769}. I agree.  The tendency for any sediment to pass down the ROW towards the streams would have been reduced by the long term geotechnical works that were provided and by increasing vegetation; but in the absence of longitudinal drains, the ditch diverters would have diverted water and any sediment to the slopes on either side.  Any damage which involved breaching of ditch diverters would increase the tendency of water and sediment to flow longitudinally downhill unless and until it reached an effective diverter lower down.  In addition, water and sediment diverted to the side of the ROW would then be subject to the gradient down towards the streams.  There are therefore pathways from the ROW to the slopes on either side and down into the streams.</p>

Further south, he accepted that there would be a flow of sediment longitudinally down the ROW towards the crossing with W3 {Day36/72:23} and, as I have already indicated, down the cross gradient towards the fish pool and the stretch of W3 on either side: see [1423](ii) above.  It appears also to be common ground that erosion from E1 would have made its way to the fish pool {H2.3/3/624} {C4/3.24/1515}.  I have previously described the topography of the stretch of the ROW south of the crossing of W3 at [1423](i) above.  It is plausible that erosion from the ROW could have made its way downhill into streams W3 and W4, particularly at the points of crossing. It is also possible that sedimentation of AF3 and AF4 could have been caused by pipeline construction because of their proximity to the Ocensa ROW {H8.11/11/2756}.</p>

The image {H3.4/4/940} shows a layer of organic material about 3 cms thick at a depth of 30-33 cms, below what appears to be horizons A and B above it.  Professor Montenegro raised the question whether this was a case of inversion as such or of burying of soil.  I am not sure that the distinction matters, given his acceptance that the layer at 30-33 cms depth is a layer of organic material that would normally be expected to be at or near the surface.  What is more material, to my mind, is that this is the only example of such a phenomenon that has been found, and that it was found in an area where no material damage is alleged to have been suffered by Snr Sequeda.  It is not evidence of soil inversion along the whole of the ROW.  At best it is evidence that soil inversion or burying can happen, which I accept. </p>

Beyond that, however, the direct evidence of the conduct of the operations does not support a finding that topsoil was not separated and stored separately, and Snr Pedro Blanco’s evidence, which I accept, is against such a general finding: see [1496] above.  Professor Montenegro’s evidence, which was supported by his data, was that he had found no evidence that Horizons A and B were mixed on the ROW.  For the reasons I have given earlier, his site selection was no more representative overall than that of Dr Obando, but that is not unreasonable in the present context of an allegation that there was mixing along the entire length of the ROW.  His evidence was supported by that of Dr Uribe, whose data did not support a finding of significant deterioration on the ROW as opposed to off it {H6.3/3/684}. </p>

Once his results are gathered together comprehensively {H4.13/17/4005} it can be seen that the chemical analyses do not support the contention that there was mixing or inversion along the entirety of the ROW.  Organic matter decreases with depth on the ROW and does not show clear pattern of material deficiency when compared with off-ROW samples on a like-for-like basis.  Adopting Dr Obando’s approach to average Organic matter content on- and off-ROW {H3.10/20/2330} shows the smallest relative difference (4.11/5.2) of any of the Lead Claimant properties.  His exchangeable aluminium and iron results demonstrated natural variability that preclude the drawing of reliable conclusions {H3.9/18/2141} {Day31/114:16}.  It is neither necessary nor desirable to spend time on why he excluded from the discussion in his first report the iron result from his third inspection, which was clearly favourable to the Defendant’s case, save to say that his suggestion that it was excluded because it might be anomalous is not one that I am able to accept: see [740] above.  For the same reasons, the concern that I expressed at {Day31/116:10} at his omission of a manganese result that was clearly favourable to the Defendant’s case was not resolved by Dr Obando’s response {Day31/118:8}.  It is sufficient for present purposes to record that his results when viewed fairly and in their totality support his assertion that the manganese results on the ROW are lower than off the ROW.   </p>

For reasons given elsewhere, I am unable to place reliance on Dr Obando’s sustainability exercise: see [741] above.  It is notable that, when Dr Obando’s subjective criteria are rejected and Lal’s remaining criteria are applied, there is no difference in result between on- and off-ROW: see [748] above. </p>

On LC39 the absence of any proper protection of La Enix by revetment is established on the evidence.  That suggests a failure to consider the stream crossings properly or, alternatively, to implement proper protection if it was considered.  The evidence of Snr Bracamonte is to the same effect, in that the need to remove material from the crossing of W3 suggests a failure to protect it in the first place.  The Defendant submits that his reference to well-established weeds indicates that this may have been a residual problem from ODC times.  For reasons I will return to later, I think it likely that the ODC ROW had left residual problems; but, on the limited evidence I have outlined, I am left with the overriding impression of a lack of care being taken over the stream crossings on Snr Sequeda’s land.  I have expressed reservations about the reliability of much of the evidence from Snr Sequeda and from those who worked on LC39; but there is a recurring theme that the Ocensa works caused significant damage to his streams which, despite the reservations I have expressed, I find has some substance.  It does not on its own enable me to make precise findings about where or when the damage occurred, and I bear well in mind the findings I have already made about the fish pool and the house move; but despite all reservations, I give it some weight as supporting evidence for my conclusion that, following recomposition, soils which had found their way into the streams were not removed and flow conditions were not reinstated to their pre-construction condition.  Whether this resulted from failures of good practice in the original carrying out of the works or in a failure of good practice in making good is impossible to say with precision or confidence, but the end result was a consequence of a failure to protect the streams in accordance with good practice.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In the light of the findings I have made already, the most convenient way to address the impact of the Ocensa pipeline in detail is by reference to Snr Sequeda’s heads of claim.  In broad outline, however, I am satisfied that there would have been and was erosion on and from the Ocensa ROW which affected La Enix, W2 and W3.  I reach this conclusion on the basis of the topography, the established pathways by which water and sediment could find their way downhill, my findings about lack of protection of streams, and the fact that the ROW was vulnerable and was exposed to heavy rainfall events.  It was by no means the sole source of erosion or sedimentation in the short or the longer term.  For similar reasons, I am satisfied that there would have been some flow of water and soil from the ROW onto AF1(b) and AF2, off the long uphill slope of the ROW from the crossing of W3 and, to a limited extent, further south. The consequences of these impacts from the Ocensa ROW fall to be considered in the context that there had already been an impact from the ODC ROW, as discussed above, and the other contributory causes to erosion and sedimentation.   </p>

As before, the expert evidence does not permit a quantitative assessment of the volumes of erosion from the Ocensa ROW or from the ODC ROW; nor does it permit a quantitative assessment of the incremental contribution that the Ocensa ROW may have made over and above what would have been the position if it had not been super-imposed on the ODC ROW.

On the findings I have already made, the claim for a permanent loss of crops must fail.  Whatever the reason for any permanent reduction in the amount of crops that he has since cultivated, it is not a consequence of having inadequate or inappropriate cropping land because of the Ocensa pipeline works.  Even if I had found that he reduced his crops long term after abandoning the land north of Fenceline A, I would have held that the reduction in the long term would have been attributable to his decision not to use additional land that was always available to him.  It might have required him to clear additional forest; but that remained part of his working life in any event and he continued to clear other lands after 1995, as is shown by the aerial photographs.  It would not, in my judgment, have been reasonable to allow the sort of losses that are claimed to continue when additional land was readily available to make good the deficiency.  As it is, my finding that he sold the same number of crops after abandoning the land north of Fenceline A carries with it a finding that he had sufficient land and used it. </p>

Two points arise.  First, it seems unlikely that Snr Sequeda would have even attempted to crop again if his field had been submerged in sediment in the way he describes.  Second, he says that he tried cropping between La Enix and W2.  That is an area which he alleges includes SW1 (1,809 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> alleged to have been rendered a swamp by movement or deposit of eroded or excavated materials or by overflowing or and/or sediment carried in W2) and FL1 (c. 6,000 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> alleged to be flooded and which merges with SW1 and to be caused by sedimentation of la Enix and consequent overflowing).  This suggests either that his recollection about where he planted a crop is faulty or that the area between La Enix and W2 was not then so extensively in the condition of which he now complains.  I prefer the latter explanation because I accept his evidence that he attempted to grow another crop north of Fenceline A.  The crop may not have been successful but I am not persuaded that it failed because of the Ocensa works. </p>

Nor am I satisfied that the area north of Fenceline A became unsuitable for crops.  AF1(a) is now said to be marooned so that its area of 2.3 hectares is not used; and there is photographic evidence of the continued cultivation of plantain between La Enix and the road, as mentioned by Snr Sequeda.  For the balance, there is evidence of laminar erosion on the slopes, e.g. {H6.3/3/684}, but no satisfactory evidence of heavy sedimentation from the ROW on the surrounding slopes and no other satisfactory evidence that they had been rendered infertile for crops.

Because of my finding that AF2 was taken out of cropping before September 1995 and the absence of any other claim directly related to the condition of AF2, it is not necessary to provide here a detailed review of the evidence from Dr Obando’s trial and observation pits on that field other than to comment on his photographs LC39.10 and LC39.11 {H3.4/4/938}.  They are of observation holes dug at an unspecified location on AF2, which Dr Obando said was 50 metres from the ROW.  They show 2 inches (or 5-6 cms) of “excavated soil deposits” on top of the pre-existing Horizon A.  It is common ground that the photographs show original soil buried by soils that probably came from the ROW {Day42/77:13} {Day42/80:1}.  As happened in the case of LC74 Dr Obando drew a distinction between soil covered with sediment and soil on which excavated soil had been deposited during construction {H3.10/20/2323}.  His description of what he found on AF2 as “excavated soil deposits” meant that excavated soil had been moved by machinery or fell from stockpiles rather than sedimentation being carried in suspension in water, which could travel further and would tend to end up in water sources.  It follows that Dr Obando’s photographs LC39.10 and LC39.11 are not evidence of widespread covering of AF2 by sedimentation flowing over it from the ROW: it is consistent with a localised deposit of soils.  I reject Dr Obando’s evidence that the deposits of soil he saw on L39 were consistent with the stockpile losses descried in Dr Card’s Fourth Report {H3.10/20/2323}.  In relation to that evidence, I refer to [735] above.  It follows that the photographs provide no evidence in support of a case that the land north of Fenceline A was subject to extensive sedimentation either.  </p>

If that is the real reason now (as to which I make no finding) it is a consequence of Snr Sequeda’s advancing years: as he said, his now old and gets tired carrying things on his back {Day11/87:16}.  I do not accept that it would make a material difference if he was still cropping north of Fenceline A: he would still have to transport the same quantities of food, giving rise to a need for a mule or mules, and the shorter distance would not make the critical difference for a man of his advanced years between being able to manage and not.  Equally, his oral answer does not provide a good reason for not keeping pigs in the past, when he was younger and could have transported foodstuffs for his pigs from El Consuelo without difficulty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Sequeda’s evidence was that when the pipe was on the right of way his animals were still on the property; that he was told to move them so that they did not fall into the trench of the pipeline; and that he moved them onto El Consuelo.  The pleaded claim is that “from the onset of construction, Snr Sequeda was not able to accommodate his cattle on [La Gloria]” {B4.4/1/27} and that this was “during and immediately following” the construction works: see above.  The claim in relation to the sale and repurchase of his herd is advanced on the basis that he sold his herd after renting pasture from his neighbour for three months and then acquired new cattle 9 months after the start of construction, which would be in about August/September 1997 {B4.4/1/27}.  So it appears to be alleged that he was without cattle for about five months.  However, elsewhere in his statement he says that he had to move his cattle to the back of El Consuelo after the installation of the cortacorrientes because they could not graze on the ROW while revegetation was taking hold {D4/71/803}.  If that were right, he moved his cattle to El Consuelo in about April 1997.  If he kept them there for one month and then on his neighbour’s land for a further three months, he would have sold them in about August 1997, only a month before purchasing a new herd.  I find that Snr Sequeda’s evidence about timings as given in his witness statement cannot be treated as reliable.  Further confusion is added by Snr Sequeda’s evidence that, when he was told to take the cattle off La Gloria because of the re-vegetation of the ROW, it was fenced off and he later took the wire down to let his cattle back onto the area about five months later. </p>

His neighbour was Snr Quevedo, whose evidence was that the cattle broke down the fence between El Consuelo and his land in their search for better forage {D4/77/848}.  I accept that evidence.  I am not satisfied that either Snr Sequeda or Snr Quevedo had a recollection of how long Snr Sequeda’s cattle were on Snr Quevedo’s land.  Both men said in their evidence that Snr Sequeda had paid for the pasture but neither could remember how much he had paid: {Day12/76:21} {Day12/160:6}.  Having heard them and having had the opportunity since trial to review their evidence, I am not satisfied that money changed hands.  I am influenced in this conclusion by my view of the claim that Snr Sequeda sold his herd and then purchased a new herd soon after, to which I now turn. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I do not think that Snr Sequeda simply made up that he sold his herd and bought a new one a while later.  The question therefore arises: why did he do so?  I find it incredible that he would sell his entire herd for want of rental money to pay to his neighbour for a relatively short time before he could put them back on La Gloria.  I accept that the generosity of campesino neighbours is necessarily limited because of their need to protect their own interests, but the Claimants’ version of events makes no sense.  It is alleged that the cost of renting pasture from Snr Quevedo was COP 3,000 per head per month and that Snr Sequeda then had 10 adult cows, one bull and 10 calves.  It is claimed that the overall rent was COP 63,000 (c. £23) per month.  On this basis, the sale of one cow for COP 244,000 would have paid for almost four months pasture rental for the rest of the herd.  Selling the entire herd requires a different explanation. </p>

Since neither man volunteered this explanation, I approach it with some reticence: but it fits with Snr Quevedo’s evidence that Snr Sequeda’s cattle first came onto his land by breaking down a fence, rather than being admitted in the light of some agreement; and it fits with neither man having any recollection of what was paid; and it provides a credible explanation for why Snr Sequeda sold his cattle when he moved them of Snr Quevedo’s land – he had no available pasture on La Gloria because of the ROW going through the middle of his land.  To my mind, it also fits with Snr Sequeda taking down the wire around the ROW and putting cattle back on La Gloria when he thought the revegetation of the ROW was established. </p>

If it is his case that he sowed dominicola in 1997 on the area of the ROW which had been fenced off by the contractors to let the revegetation grow, it would appear that, when he took the wire down and put his cattle back onto the ROW, it would have had both the contractors’ grasses (of which he is critical as summarised at [1526] above) and his own grasses.  It is also quite unclear what the impact of his 12 cans of weedkiller would have been on the grasses that had been sown, amongst which he says that weeds had sprouted.  More troubling is the apparent assertion in [156] – [158] of his witness statement, as summarised above, that the sowing of dominicola in 1997 was north of Fenceline A in the area he had previously cropped.  On all of the evidence, I am satisfied that he did sow pasture grasses in the area north of Fenceline A until after 2002: the 2002 aerial image shows that grazing was then going up to Fenceline A and not beyond and the land had the appearance of secondary forest, not pasture {H2.3/3/602} {H2.8/10/2072}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The claim for sowing 7 hectares of dominicola in 1997 is not made out.  On the basis of his oral evidence the area was only 2 hectares.  If he had re-sown the entire area of the Ocensa ROW and sobreanchos, it would only have amounted to about 2.5 hectares (725 x 35 square metres) and his evidence does not suggest that he did anything like that amount of re-seeding.  I am satisfied that he did not sow pasture grasses north of Fenceline A.  I suspect that he may have sowed some dominicola grasses in or about 1997, since that was his preferred grass; but the evidence is inadequate to support a finding of where or over what area he sowed the seed.  In particular, the evidence does not support a finding that he sowed seed inside the area that had been fenced off as he describes, or outside it, or partly in and partly outside it.  The evidence is so inadequate that I cannot fairly make any estimate of the area that he may have sown.  Snr Sequeda’s evidence made no mention of hiring people or paying days wages to them and I am not satisfied that is what happened.  In the result, although I suspect that he may have sowed some grass in 1997, I do not know where, when or at what cost he did so and the evidence does not justify my making a guess. </p>

By no stretch of the evidence was the whole of La Gloria’s pasture affected by the Ocensa and ODC works.  On the other hand, there is substantial evidence that, although La Gloria might in theory have supported a herd of about 20 cattle, Snr Sequeda was struggling on his existing pastures.  In his interview with Dr Velez and Dr Delgado, his pattern of using and resting pasture gave his experts cause for concern that he was over-working his pastures {H24.2/207.2/1015.114} {Day11/126:7}.  There is no reason to suppose that the answers he gave to his own experts and solicitor were not true and, if they were, he was overgrazing his fields and exercising very poor pasture management {Day49/85:21}.  </p>

Yet, for perfectly sensible reasons, Snr Sequeda appears to have formed the view that dominicola would be preferable grass cover for all his pasture, whether it had been affected by the ROWs or not.  (I refer to ROWs in the plural lest it be forgotten that, to the extent that pipeline works caused a deterioration on La Gloria, that deterioration was not attributable to the Ocensa works alone.)  I strongly suspect that he would have formed this view at about the same time in any event, irrespective of the laying of the pipelines, and there is no good reason to find that he would not have done so.  The scar left by the pipelines and continuing erosion from parts of the ROWs may have provided an added stimulus, but I am not satisfied that he has incurred additional expenditure in re-seeding that he would not have incurred anyway.  The poor quality of the evidence in support of these claims is a major contributor to my decision, but it also rests on my assessment of Snr Sequeda </p>

The original cost of the fence is claimed as COP 43,000 (c. £16).  It is alleged that Snr Sequeda expends four days of labour maintaining the fence in good repair, which is claimed at COP 53,143 (c. £16.56) per annum {B4.4/1/24}.  The suggestion that it takes four full days of labour to maintain 100m of post and wire fence is, to my mind, absurd, not least when the annual cost is set against the original cost of installing the fence.  The most that would be required would be the occasional replacement of a failed fence post and possibly tacking or adding a stretch of wire where it has come loose.  I am far from convinced by the evidence that Snr Sequeda would be required to spend more than half a day a year, which would be equivalent to about COP 6,650 (or c. £2); and I am not convinced that this is genuinely an annual cost.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant makes the point that Snr Sequeda’s evidence about where he put the fence is extremely vague.  I agree.  Dr Avila saw fencing round the largest swampy area near W3.  It is clear from photographs that cattle graze on AF3 and AF4: see {H2.3/3/614}.  In the 2012 Further Information it was pleaded that the fence was placed at Point 196, which is just to the north of AF3 and AF4.  That is where it is shown on the CAI and indicated on the key at {C4/3/354}.  However, it seemed reasonably clear from his re-examination that the fence to which Snr Sequeda was referring is some way north of AF4 and north of the intersection of the ROW with W3, running along or near the east bank of W3 {Day12/108:20}: his description was not consistent with the fence being at Point 196.  Despite the uncertainties in the formulation and evidencing of this claim, I accept that Snr Sequeda installed a fence in about 1998 and that he did so to protect cattle from going into a swampy area or areas.  His evidence was that since he had built the fence, no more animals have died {D4/71/816}.  I accept that evidence. </p>

By contrast, the Claimants’ aggregation of residual value (COP 2,808,000) plus loss of calves (COP 4,734,000) plus loss of milk (COP 4,082,400) leads to an aggregate claim for six cows of COP 11,624,400, which is equivalent to COP 1,937,000 per cow.

The points identified for the deaths of the cattle in the RARSL are points 195 and 27, which are in Field 3 where the ROW crosses W3.  Despite that, the 2012 Further Information stated that “5 of the Claimants’ cattle died as a result of getting stuck in swampy areas and soft mud on affected streams … (see Image/27, 28, 195 and 197)” and the key to the CAI asserts that “cattle” died at point 28 in 2010 {C4/3/354}.  Point 28 is on La Enix close to the culvert.  The 2012 Further Information also asserts that “3 cattle died from ingesting the synthetic sacks used by the constructors for the Ocensa works” {B2.2/33/364}.  There was no attempt in Snr Sequeda’s witness statement to clarify the points where his cattle got stuck; and he merely said that 6 cows got sick after eating the costales, without saying where that happened. </p>

On the findings I have made so far, W3 and the land around it was already seriously compromised before the Ocensa pipeline was laid: see [1480] above.  The combined effect of the ODC ROW and other sources of sedimentation from the slopes above W3 had been to cause sedimentation of the fish pool sufficient to cause it to be abandoned, impoundment of water in the tributary to W3 close to the fish pool, sedimentation of W3 from a point upstream of the fish pool down to point where the ODC ROW crossed it, and sediment being carried downstream from the crossing with W3 which added to sedimentation from the slopes to the east of W3 (above point 266) which made its way into the stream.  </p>

On the case being advanced by the Claimants, the relevant period is up until the winter and wet season of 1998.  Irrespective of its quality, the 1998 overflight DVD shows that the soil on the ROW was clearly visible and is evidence (which I accept) that the ROW was not substantially or successfully revegetated by then.  Dr Savigny’s estimate was that the light colour of the ROW included exposed soil and revegetation at about a 60:40 ratio {H2.2/2/594}.  That implies, and I find, that the areas that are evidently least covered by vegetation would have a ratio of more than 60% soil.  There is a consistent theme that emerges from the aerial photographs both before and after the Ocensa works, which is that the vegetation, including revegetation of the ROWs, is less abundant south of Fenceline A than it is to the north of it.  I accept the submission that this is because the area south of Fenceline A was used by Snr Sequeda for pasturing his cattle, but the uncertainty about precisely when he returned cattle to La Gloria and when they caused damage to the geotechnical works makes it quite impossible to make more specific findings </p>

On my assessment of Snr Sequeda, it would be quite contrary to his concern for his livestock for him to have ignored a potentially fatal swampy area and to have left it unfenced after he had lost a cow there.  General support for that view came from Snr Quevedo who agreed that an experienced farmer, such as Snr Sequeda or himself, would immediately fence off a swampy area so as to avoid risk to his cattle unless he did not have the materials with which to do so {Day12/164:12}.   </p>

I find it much easier in the circumstances of this litigation and his case to envisage that this kernel of truth has become inflated into a claim for five cows, but I am not persuaded that this has been deliberate exaggeration by Snr Sequeda.  On my assessment of him as a man and a witness and the processes by which his claim has been constructed, I think it possible either that he did not fully appreciate what was being claimed or did not understand that his original memory was becoming inflated and unreliable.   </p>

I have found that Snr Sequeda erected a fence around the swampy area near W3, not least because Dr Avila said that he saw it.  The erection of the fence could, on Snr Quevedo’s evidence, have been because Snr Sequeda saw a risk to his cattle before any had died, but it is consistent with Snr Sequeda’s evidence that he erected it after a cow had got stuck and died.  At the end, I am satisfied and find that a cow got stuck and died and that it was to prevent the risk of further deaths that Snr Sequeda erected the fence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The question remains whether the contribution of any erosion from the Ocensa ROW made a difference to the outcome.  Applying the tests of causation that I have set out at [192] above, the critical question of fact to be determined is whether Snr Sequeda would have been in a better position if additional sedimentation attributable to the Ocensa works had not happened.  In the light of my findings about the state of the area before the Ocensa works, it would be wrong to attribute the death of the cow solely to the effect of the increased erosion caused by the Ocensa works: other contributing causes were accumulated background erosion and the impact of the ODC ROW, which (with any other contributing causes) had already led to sedimentation and abandonment of the fish pool, sedimentation of W3, impoundment of water and the development of SW2.  Those causes would all have continued to contribute to continuing deterioration even without the superimposition of the Ocensa ROW.  For reasons discussed elsewhere in this judgment, there is no sound basis for making a quantitative assessment of the amount of sediment from the Ocensa ROW that would have reached the area where the cow died (wherever, precisely, that may have been), or of the amount by which it exceeded what would have come down in any event, or of the precise effect on the swampy area.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I come back to my assessment of Snr Sequeda and my expectation that, if the area where the cow had died had been a long-standing risk to his cattle, he would have fenced it off sooner.  The evidence is unsatisfactory for the reasons that I have already outlined, but it suggests that Snr Sequeda was caught out and taken unawares by a significant deterioration of the area where his cow died – otherwise he would have fenced it off sooner.  I find some support for a finding that the Ocensa ROW made a material difference to the condition of the stream below in the evidence of Snr Bracamonte that he was engaged in clearing a blockage on W3.  The fact that he had to clear a blockage does not of itself prove that the creation of a swamp was materially affected by erosion from the Ocensa ROW, but it is evidence that there was substantial erosion from the Ocensa ROW that the stream on its own could not purge.  However, for the reasons I have set out, I conclude that the Ocensa ROW made a material contribution and difference to the formation of a swampy area which made it dangerous for cattle and that the state of the swampy area (to which the Ocensa ROW made a material contribution) was the direct cause of the death of the cow.  On these findings of fact, the Colombian test for what in England might be called causation in fact is satisfied.  I accept that, without the contribution of the Ocensa ROW, the area may subsequently have become a risk to cattle and might have led to a cow getting stuck if Snr Sequeda had not fenced it off in time.  That, however, is not the question and it does not affect the application of the proper test at the time that the cow died. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Turning to the claim for cattle that ate plastic sacks used for costales, I accept that there were such sacks on La Gloria after the Ocensa works and that cattle might ingest plastic from such sacks, but I have no confidence that it is well-founded for a number of reasons.  First, my recent experience with the numbers claimed in respect of cows becoming stuck suggests a risk of numbers being inflated on this claim as well.  Second, as outlined above, the claim has shifted between being that three cows died and that six cows became sick.  Although Snr Sequeda in his witness statement specifically supported the claim that cows had become sick {D4/71/815} and confirmed his evidence at trial {Day11/139:5} I do not accept that his evidence of numbers as set out in his witness statement are based upon accurate recollection or that they are reliable.  Third, there is little detail about when or where the cows are alleged to have eaten the costales or become sick.  At [120] of his witness statement, Snr Sequeda said of the reinstatement works carried out by maintenance contractors at two yearly intervals “They [i.e. the maintenance contractors] would remove the remains of the costales that already had disintegrated and throw them away on my property.  I had to collect them and burn them afterwards to prevent the cattle from eating them.  Nevertheless, there were some cows that managed to eat these costales and they got sick.  Some of them died or had to be sold at a bad price because they wouldn’t fatten up” {D4/71/806}.  Snr Sequeda says that he now keeps a watch out to make sure his cattle do not eat plastic sacks; but he gives no evidence about whether this problem occurred once, or after successive visits from the maintenance contractors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant takes the additional point that the plastic sacks about which Snr Sequeda complains were placed later by maintenance contractors and are therefore not the responsibility of the Defendant {C4/4.8/761}.  The Claimants submitted that Snr Sequeda’s evidence might have been mistaken or that he may have been misled by the form of the questions he had asked {Day56/116:21} ff.  In his witness statement, Snr Sequeda drew a distinction between costales that were placed as part of the original works and those that were placed later by maintenance crews returning at two year intervals: see {D4/71/779} at [95] (original) and [119] (replacement during subsequent maintenance works).  The maintenance contractors used nylon costales: see [119]; but so did those doing the original works: see [100].  However, the passage in his witness statement at [120] that I have just set out is clear in attributing his problem to sacks that were discarded by reinstatement contractors coming back later.  When cross-examined he was asked whether the barriers with the nylon costales which his cattle had eaten had been “put in” by the maintenance contractors referred to at [119] of his statement.  He agreed that they were, and also that they were the maintenance contractors who came back every two years or so {Day11/139:23}.  That marked a departure from what he had originally said about sacks being discarded (to which he was not referred in cross-examination), which could if viewed in isolation be seen as a potential source of confusion for Snr Sequeda.  But nothing that was said in oral evidence casts doubt on the evidence he originally gave at [120] of his witness statement that it was the actions of the maintenance contractors who caused his cattle to eat nylon sacks.  I accept the general thrust of his evidence in [120] of his witness statement and find that, to the extent that there was a problem with a cow or cows eating plastic sacks, it was a problem created by the maintenance contractors and not the original carrying out of the Ocensa works.  What is not clear is whether the maintenance contractors were Ocensa’s maintenance contractors finishing off the construction works or maintenance contractors subsequently acting for Citcol as the operators of the pipeline, in which case the Defendant’s involvement would have ceased. </p>

Third, although the claim is given an air of precision by refrring to vitamins, intravenous rehydration, nutritional supplements and/or antibiotics, I am not satisfied that all or any of these are purchased on a regular basis or at all because of cows getting stuck for reasons attributable to the Ocensa works.  While fully accepting the documentary limitations to be expected of a campesino farmer such as Snr Sequeda, it is surprising that no documentary support for this claim exists if it is real, given the involvement of solicitors for so long.

Snr Sequeda’s case is that a combination of narrowing of the stream of La Enix caused by failure to provide revetment or other protective works and an accumulation of sediment from the ROW is what prevented the continued migration of fish.  It is common ground that the size of a stream’s channel and the flow rate of water influences migratory fish {H23.5/16/1292} {Day47/21:1}; and also that sedimentation of streams and, in particular, spawning beds may have an adverse impact on fish stocks and migration {H13/3/1}.  A sudden increase in sediment which blocked the pores of the gravels and the sands, filled the leaf litter banks and smothered plants could give rise to a catastrophic fish loss {Day47/16:12}.  While there had been a regional decline in fish stocks, it does not explain a complete and sudden loss of all fish stocks in La Enix {Day46/153:17}. </p>

He repeated this opinion at {H7.3/3/840}: “due to the fact that no soil erosion is displayed in the areas adjacent to the stream, the [ROW] or outside in the fields, which have good grazing cover, the accumulation of sediment around 20m below the [ROW] in [La Enix] must be connected to the sediment deposited on the streambed during construction of the pipeline … and them being dragged by the water … . Its accumulation at this point, at the bridge entrance, is due to the fact that water is dammed there, before entering the tunnel, so accumulation of the materials carried by the water is facilitated”.  He concluded that “most damages to this water source occurred at the time land was excavated and until pipeline works were buried in this part of the farm”; and that “another important aspect of this stream is that neighbouring areas, on either side of the stream, are flat areas, with very gentle slopes, which means there is no soil erosion, and there is good coverage (between streams W1 and W2).  As a consequence there is no addition of fresh sediment to the streambed as occurs in other streams” {H7.3/3/841}. </p>

Flooding of the areas surrounding W2 and La Enix to the west of the culvert are shown in Dr Savigny’s image SR4-12 {H2.6/8/1627}.  The Claimants submit, and I accept, that the exit point of the tunnel on the discharge side of the culvert is not filled completely by the water flowing through.  That does not show that the culvert is not providing some blockage: it merely shows that water to the depth of the water standing to the west of the culvert does not generate a flow velocity or volume that completely fills the discharge points to their full height. </p>

Its design may well have been different and, on the basis of Professor Monsalve’s evidence, the likelihood would be that the tendency would have been to increase the capacity of the culvert in 2007 rather than to reduce it {Day40/40:17}.  This evidence does not justify a finding that the creation of the new culvert in 2007 made a material difference to the situation one way or another.  That being so, the fact that the sediment was cleared out when the 2007 culvert was built but that “within months of the clear up the pond area quickly became sedimented again” {B2.2/33/366} </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Defendant also draws attention, relying upon the evidence of Professor Monsalve, to the size of the drainage basin of La Enix (c. 214 hectares) and its progressive deforestation since 1961, which will have caused and continues to provide a background source of erosion and sedimentation {H8.22/26/5716}ff.  Despite the attacks on Professor Monsalve’s methodology and quantification, his evidence supports the conclusion (and I find) that there has been continuing background erosion throughout the period both before and since the laying of the Ocensa pipeline.  If I had any residual doubt that there is continuing background erosion (which I do not) it would be dispelled by the photographs of the logjam carried downstream on La Enix {H2.3/3/640}.  Log jams have been a repeated feature of life on La Gloria both before and since the Ocensa works {Day12/61:13}.  Dr Atencio suggested that such log jams did not obstruct the stream {Day46/70:15}.  That is contrary to the evidence of Snr Sequeda and Dr Savigny and I reject it, though I do not suggest that the obstruction of the stream is total.  However, I refer to it and rely upon it as a marker of the ferocity of the climate and its ability to pull materials off the drainage basin and drag them to La Enix. </p>

Even now there is evidence of continuing erosion from the slopes on and to either side of the ROW.  However, sedimentation from such erosion went downhill until it encountered W2, which acted as a substantial sediment trap preventing its further passage into La Enix.  The land between W2 and La Enix is essentially flat and would not itself have generated substantial quantities of erosion even during the period that the ROW was exposed; and, to the extent that there was erosion of its surface, the absence of slope means that there is no basis for a finding that substantial quantities flowed into La Enix during or in the vulnerable period after the construction works were carried out.  I find that there was no substantial flow of eroded sediment from the ROW into La Enix during or in the period after the Ocensa construction works.  By “substantial flow” I mean a flow that the stream was unable to accommodate or purge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">However, a number of strands of evidence point to the conclusion that things went wrong where the Ocensa ROW crossed La Enix.  First, there is no evidence of any narrowing of the stream before the works.  Second, Ocensa omitted revetment or other protective works which should have been installed to protect the banks of the stream: see [1550] above.  Third, the narrowing of the stream at the point of the ROW crossing is unlikely to be coincidental.  On this issue, despite the substantial reservations that I have expressed about his evidence in other respects, I accept the opinion of Dr Tobon that the narrowing of the stream occurred at or about the time of the Ocensa works and was caused by them.  The narrowing of the stream of itself does not prevent La Enix from purging sediment from the area of the ROW crossing, but it is indicative of a wider failure to protect the banks and of an incursion of foreign materials that caused the physical narrowing.  I find that some sediment found its way into La Enix when the Ocensa works took place and that it contributed to the sedimentation of the natural pond by the culvert.  I also find that W2 did not materially contribute to the sedimentation of the natural pond or other parts of La Enix; and that the additional sedimentation of La Enix attributable to the Ocensa works was a one-off event.  Specifically, erosion from the slopes above W2 did not cause continuing sedimentation of La Enix and the narrowed channel was not itself a material source of continuing sedimentation of the area downstream, though it continued to act effectively as a conduit for sediment that was in the stream from other sources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There were therefore two sources of sedimentation of La Enix.  The first was background erosion.  This had always been sufficient to require Snr Sequeda to clear it from the natural pool from time to time, at a frequency which is not established.  It was also the cause of the wetlands identified by Dr Savigny upstream from the ROW crossing in 1995.  There was also the one-off additional sedimentation caused by the failure to carry out protective works at the ROW crossing, which failure led to the narrowing of the stream at the crossing and the depositing of some sediment in La Enix.  That sediment did not block the narrowed channel at the ROW crossing and the flow of La Enix carried it downstream as explained by Dr Tobon.  The slopes above W2 have not contributed material quantities of further sedimentation of La Enix.  Since well before 2007 the sediment load that has been in La Enix has been the background erosion load. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">What are the implications of these findings for the claim for wild fishing in La Enix?  They are that the background erosion rate causes sedimentation which is sufficient to prevent the migration of fish within a few months of existing sedimentation being cleared, as shown by the experience of 2007.  The claim for lost fishing is predicated on the assertion that it is not feasible or possible to clear the sedimentation to the west of the culvert sufficiently frequently to keep the wild fish migrating so that fishing can continue.  Assuming that to be correct, it means that the background erosion rate combined with the damming effect of the culvert is the effective cause of the absence of wild fish to the west of the culvert.  No mechanism has been offered which could link the one-off increase in sedimentation in 1997 to a continuing inability to clear the sedimentation attributable to background causes.  I accept that Snr Sequeda may now believe that his fishing was unaffected by sedimentation before the Ocensa works and was gone thereafter, but the evidence as a whole persuades me that his periodic clearing of sedimentation was a sign of a battle that he was losing as the drainage basin was cleared and background erosion became established.  It is <span style="font-style:italic">possible </span>that the battle had not been completely lost by the time of the Ocensa works, but the evidence does not satisfy me that there was a material period when fish were prevented from migrating by the deposit of sediment from the Ocensa works or the narrowing of the stream channel when otherwise they would have migrated in sufficient numbers for Snr Sequeda to catch them in any numbers. </p>

In other words, I prefer the opinions of the Defendant’s experts that the effective cause of the loss of migratory fish on La Gloria is a combination of background erosion and the damming effect of the culvert, which causes sedimentation to accumulate on its west side. </p>

La Gloria has suffered some damage as a result of pipeline works and has deteriorated in other respects which are not attributable to either pipeline (e.g. the deep cattle trails now evident on the property as on CF39); but the RARSL portrayal makes no concession to the contribution of the ODC pipeline or other causes of deterioration.  The evidence given at trial does not establish that Snr Sequeda or other members of his family have gone hungry, nor is there evidence that they suffered significant adverse changes in their diet.  As I have noted at [1411] Snr Sequeda is a man who is well respected in his community: there is no evidence that he has suffered any actual loss of status or respect as a result of the Ocensa pipeline works. </p>

To the extent that crops on the ROW were damaged and destroyed by the stripping of the surface, I would hold that they fall within the damage contemplated by the Annex and the ROW Agreement.  They would therefore be covered by the invoking of Article 5 even though the ROW Agreement did not expressly mention the precise crops on the ROW when the Ocensa works were carried out.  Damage necessarily caused to La Enix where the ROW crossed it would also be covered, but not damage caused elsewhere because of the carrying out of the Ocensa works in or near to that stream.

There is no evidence of a separate settlement with Ocensa but there are Paz y Salvos with Saipem and, separately, with Ocensa, each of which is dated 7 August 1997: see [1554].  Although at one point in his evidence Snr Sequeda said that he had not known who to go to in order to make a claim {Day10/63:13} he understood it was Ocensa that was carrying out the works {Day10/140:3} and went to the offices of Ocensa and Saipem when he entered into the settlement agreements {Day10/57:18}; and he knew in general terms that a Paz y Salvo meant that nothing more was owing {Day10/75:18}.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Viewed objectively, Snr Sequeda’s conduct in claiming and receiving payment from Saipem and Ocensa and entering into the Paz y Salvos amounted to tacit acceptance of the assignment of the ROW Agreement by the Defendant as assignor to Ocensa as assignee.  That has the effect that the Defendant could no longer rely upon the ROW Agreement as excluding liability by invoking Article 5: as in other cases of assignment it was then a stranger to the contract and, in relation to the Claimants, both a stranger and a tortfeasor by virtue of the dangerous activities doctrine.  In any event, as the ROW Agreement was concerned with the area on the ROW, it would have provided no protection against claims for damage off the ROW, which make up the majority of Snr Sequeda’s claims.  The 29 June 1997 settlement with Ocensa and Saipem effected a settlement of all claims off the ROW (present and future) as between Snr Sequeda on the one hand and Ocensa and Saipem on the other.  In doing so, it also effected a novation by substituting the new contractual rights and obligations under the settlement in place of any existing or future obligation in tort.  As a result, any liability which the Defendant might otherwise have had to Snr Sequeda for damage off the ROW which is attributable to the Ocensa works was extinguished.  That includes the claims for the loss of the cow and the protective fencing which I have found, as a matter of fact, to be attributable to the Ocensa works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In the absence of any settlement with Ocensa relating to damage on the ROW, extinction of liability would rest on the terms of the Paz y Salvo with Ocensa.  It is specific and clear in renouncing “the right to present any type of reclamation, action or judicial or extrajudicial claim against the company, regarding their obligations, agreements, loss and damage to the pastures, crops or movable [property] inside the corridor of the line, or the alteration in the economic exploitation of the plot during the construction of the pipeline”: see [392].  The applicable principles are set out at [190] above.  The Paz y Salvos constitute clear expressions that Snr Sequeda no longer wants to pursue any rights he may have or bring actions with regard to such rights.  Adopting Professor Castro’s formulation, the renunciation is clear, unequivocal and precise.  Snr Sequeda may not have contemplated that, at some later date, English lawyers would come and offer the prospect of bringing an action in this jurisdiction.

He started his working life in Segovia as a day labourer.  He was forced off the first land he bought by violence in the area and later was unable to make his second farm pay, due to economic difficulties.  He then occupied an area of land which is now called La Alborada.  He started by clearing a small area for crops and making a hut in which he lived with his wife and 10 children.  By the time the pipelines came his four older children had left.  Until he met Snr Manco, Snr Buitrago worked the farm on his own, occasionally with the help of a labourer.  He is a campesino farmer who neither reads nor writes.  Although now quite elderly, there is evidence that he was able to stand up for himself during the period when the pipelines were laid: he managed to negotiate a higher settlement sum than was originally offered to him by Saipem {D5/91/1032}.  He was brought up working in the fields and lived off the land in an unsafe area until he finally felt he had to leave the countryside because of the violence in 2002.  The violence had a direct impact on his ability to work on La Alborada.  After the ODC pipeline was laid, guerrilla activity was rife and the army was active in hunting them down, including on La Alborada.  At one point the army formed the view that Snr Buitrago was a friend of the guerrillas, which meant that he had to leave the farm for periods at a time and return to live in Segovia until things were calmer {D5/91/1024} {Day9/121:11}.  I accept the evidence of Snr Manco that the violence is like an incurable disease.  At the time of making his statement in 2012 Snr Manco had had to leave the area and was living in Medellin as he was being threatened {D5/88/948}. </p>

The most graphic illustration of this was when he came to start his evidence and clearly had no recollection of having given a statement or telling his lawyers what had happened {Day9/82:19}.  I do not have details of how the witness statement was taken, but I accept that it had been read to him shortly before he gave evidence.  Despite that, it was necessary for it to be read to him again before he could start to give his evidence in chief at all.  Although he then said that he remembered what happened during the building of the second pipeline, the episode demonstrated the difficulties that were likely to have been encountered in preparing a statement for Snr Buitrago and the caution which needs to be exercised by the Court when confronted by apparent certainty either in his statement or in his oral evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">As with other witnesses, by the time he came to give evidence Snr Buitrago was convinced that all the troubles on La Alborada were attributable to the Ocensa pipeline.  His witness statement says nothing about the ODC works or how they were carried out, except that they caused no damage {D5/91/1028}.  When describing the Ocensa works his statement was clear in saying that “when the bulldozers came, they cut down the rastrojo and the trees…” {D5/91/1029}, evidence which he repeated orally and with equal certainty {Day9/98:20}.  Yet it is common ground that any trees on the ROW had been cut down for the purposes of the ODC ROW {B2.1/14/92}, though I note that Snr Buitrago entered into a settlement agreement with Saipem in August 1997 that referred to cutting down timber trees: see [1744] below.  A further example of his misplaced certainty was that he said in his witness statement that an army camp had been built after the Ocensa pipeline had been laid {D5/91/1031}.  There is incontrovertible evidence that it was built well before the Ocensa works, as it is visible in the 1995 aerial photograph {L1/170/170}.  A third was his evidence that the secondary road which now runs along the southern boundary of La Alborada had been built as part of the Ocensa works {D5/91/1034}.  It was in fact built before or at the time of the ODC works.  I mean no disrespect to Snr Buitrago in concluding that I can place no reliance upon his evidence about chronology. </p>

I accept Dr Velez’ description that Snr Manco is someone who has invested his earnings from mining in order to purchase the farm and to pursue various production projects.  Snr Manco’s evidence also indicates that he is not at heart or by upbringing and profession a campesino farmer looking to pursue a subsistence existence from farming the land: “Let’s see, how shall I put it, how can I put it.  I like the farm.  I don’t know if it is an investment, as such.  I like the farm and I like animals, and in order to keep animals you need to have a farm.  I think that is the way it should be, or it is” {Day8/14:11}.  That supports Dr Velez’ view (which I accept) that Snr Manco “does not have a farmer and rancher history.

He is said to have worked for Snr Manco on the farm until 2011.  He made his statement in 2012.  The Civil Evidence Act Notice dated 1 August 2014 said that he “resides in a remote region of Colombia.  Several attempts have been made to contact this witness through Mr Manco … but such attempts have not proved successful.  [Snr Manco] currently does not know Mr Echevarria’s whereabouts and has been unable to locate him or speak to him directly.  It is not expected that he could be relied upon to give evidence” {C4/2.3/33.27}.  Snr Manco’s evidence at trial, less than three months later, was that he had spoken to Snr Echevarria by telephone about twenty days before because Snr Echevarria had been ill and was in the city of Medellin and that he had a landline telephone number for Snr Echevarria which a neighbour had given him {Day8/74:10} {Day9/38:18}.  His evidence is not strictly inconsistent with what had been stated in the Civil Evidence Act Notice, but it makes clear that contact had been made with the prospective witness.  No further explanation was given of what steps, if any, had been taken to try to find him.  On this evidence I am not in a position to make a finding that he could and should have been traced and called to give evidence or that he could not or should not.  I give his evidence limited weight because it has not been tested by cross-examination and because in some respects it appears to be inconsistent with other evidence to an extent that suggests it is unreliable.  I will refer to it if and to the extent it becomes necessary to do so later on. </p>

The longitudinal gradient of the ROW varies, becoming steeper as it gets further north.  The land on La Alborada to the east of the ROW was mostly forested when the pipelines were laid.  Within that forested area four streams rise (W1, W2, W3, W4) which flow down the hill until they converge to provide the main stream running down the centre of the property from west to east.  There are other water sources that rise in the north-eastern quarter of the property.  The ROW does not cross any of streams W1 – W4, but they rise a relatively short distance below it.  Where they merge, there is an “alluvial fan” of sedimentation where the gradient of the slope decreases and sediment that has been transported downhill is deposited.  About 30 metres downhill and downstream of the point of conflux is an area described as SW1, which is a swampy area alleged to be c. 26,800 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>{C4/3/361}.  As will be described later, SW1 features large in the claim for lost cattle.  On the northern boundary of SW1 is the place where it is alleged that the fish pools were dug, which form the basis of the loss of fish production claim.  At the eastern end of SW1 the stream continues eastwards towards a bridge near to the house and on beyond, running roughly parallel to the secondary road.  These features are conveniently marked on {L8/3/876}.  There is an area of wetland near to the house which is not alleged to be caused by the Ocensa ROW.

The east end of the property is not included in the photograph, but the area near the house has an area described by Dr Savigny as pasture and a more diffuse area which he interprets as wetland near the house.  Snr Buitrago’s evidence, which I accept, is that he had 1-2 hectares of open field when the Ocensa pipeline was laid {D5/91/1022}.  That is consistent with the 1995 aerial photograph and with his evidence that he only started keeping cows after the ODC pipeline paid him some money.  As a generalisation, the area where the streams converge, SW1 and the continued passage of W3 to the east towards the house are all covered by primary or secondary forest such that it is not possible to the untrained eye to identify the course of W3 to the east of SW1.

There are exceptions, such as recent forest clearing near the secondary road in the south-west corner of the property {H2.7/9/1885}.  What can be seen clearly even by the inexpert eye is that there has been general clearance of the area from the house to the west until it meets the remaining area of forest cover on the steep slopes below the ROW, except for the trees in and around W3 as it flows towards the house and SW1 {L2/417/417}.  These wooded areas are identified by Dr Savigny as wetland {H2.8/10/2091}, which provides an explanation for why they have not been cleared of trees and converted to pasture.  In addition, the aerial photographs show that the slopes to the north of SW1 and where the fish pools are said to have been located have been cleared, which they had not been in 1995.  Roughly this state of affairs can be seen in {L8/3/876}, which was taken in 2014.  The position as disclosed by the 2009 aerial photograph and subsequent photographs taken in the course of this litigation is consistent with Snr Manco’s evidence (which I accept) that he expanded the areas that were cleared for pasture after the Ocensa pipeline was laid and put his larger herd of 25 cows on about 20 hectares of cleared land in 2002 and continued to clear more land thereafter {D5/88/942} {D5/88/946}. </p>

The bottom of the slope was, when he observed it, heavily sedimented {H12.4/4/882}.  It was completely covered by forest in 1995 and would have required the felling of a number of trees to make the place for the ponds {H12.4/4/875}.  The slopes above and to the north are steep, as shown at {H12.4/4/884}.  Dr Rodriguez was shown the point in the stream from where it is said that water was taken for the fish ponds and found a piece of hose unconnected to a pipe nearby {H12.4/4/883} {H12.4/4/885}.  Dr Atencio was shown and photographed the same location for the fish ponds {H11/2/221}.

At 02:13 there is a sequence which shows the slopes to the north of SW1.  It is common ground that there is evidence of sedimentation from those slopes {H7.5/26/1229}, though the Claimants point out that there is no evidence in the video of deep erosive features on the slopes and they appear to be reasonably well covered.

Loose earth and sand was left exposed to the elements and during the rainy season the sediments would be carried downhill by rainwater, which would in turn be channelled towards the streams, of which it was alleged that there were five.  Sediments were carried down to the dam 800 metres from the house so that it now has to be cleaned every other day.  The Claimants’ crops were completely covered in earth and were destroyed. During the rainy season rainwater is no longer channelled through the streams but instead floods the surrounding area causing it to become very soft and swampy.  “Some of the Claimants’ animals have strayed into the soft earth and become buried.  Since the pipeline was laid at a higher level than and close to the Claimants’ fish pools, sediments washed down from the right of way were carried into the fish pools causing them to become silted.  Both pools ultimately became completely filled up with sediments and were rendered unusable.”  “The Claimant’s farming activities also suffered as a result of the construction of the Ocensa road.  Since the Claimant is unable to distinguish between the damage caused by the road and that caused by the pipeline, for the purposes of this schedule all loss of income from farming activities has been reduced by 50% to reflect the damage caused by the construction of the road.”  The current position was said to be that the fish pools became completely silted and unusable.  To compensate for the loss of income the Claimant was forced to sell all of his poultry and thereafter did not earn any income from poultry for approximately four years.  In order to compensate for the loss of income from fishing the Claimant invested in the recuperation and improvement of his pastures so that he would maintain more cattle.  This required him to employ additional labourers, purchase new pasture and construct a new dam to ensure an adequate supply of water for his animals.  After allowing for a 50% reduction to account for the contribution of the secondary road, the claim amounted to COP 138,336,080 (c. £51,000), more than twice the sum now being claimed. </p>

[Shortly after the construction of the pipeline, in the summer season of 1997, the Claimants dug out two fish pools on the property (CAI Point 10).  The fish pools were built near to the main stream, which supplied water to the fish pools by means of a hose.  “The Claimants stocked the fish pools with 1100 fingerlings of tilapia and cachama per cycle.  The Claimants expected to sell their production of fish when they were fully grown within 4 to 6 months.  The fish pools produced 300 kgs of tilapia and cachama per production cycle, there being two production cycles in one year.  The Claimants sold 90% of their production and kept 10% for domestic consumption.  With the onset of the first wet season following the construction of the pipeline, the fish pools began filling up with sediment carried down a steep slope from the ROW.

Payment receipts and internal documents recording requests for payment indicate that ODC regarded the sum of COP 1,450,000 as split between consideration for the right of occupancy (COP 217,500) and damages (COP 1,232,500) {M/89.1T/298.16}.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Untangling the dates of the receipts is not entirely straightforward.  There are two potentially material facts.  First, Snr Buitrago signed receipts that released and held ODC harmless from future liability {M/89.1T/298.13} {M/89.1T/298.14} {M/89.1T/298.15} {M/89.1T/298.19} {M/89.1T/298.22}.  Second, it appears that the first payments to Snr Buitrago were a payment of COP 355,250 (being 70% of the initially agreed consideration), for which Snr Buitrago signed a receipt on 1 September 1990, and a payment of COP 507,500 pursuant to the 1991 Amendment, for which Snr Buitrago signed the receipt on 21 September 1991 {M/89.1T/298.19}.  The balance of payments making up the COP 1,450,000 due to Snr Buitrago were paid in 1994.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The sums paid to Snr Buitrago are relevant because he says that he bought his five young cows and a chain saw out of the monies he received from ODC.  Leaving aside the chain-saw, that would suggest a price of not more than COP 300,000 per cow.  If he bought the cows with the initial two payments, it would suggest a price of under COP 200,000 per cow.  The later ODC payments were in smaller sums and were paid in 1994.  The Claimants’ submit that Snr Buitrago bought his heifers in 1994.  There is no documentary or other objective evidence to help.  Snr Manco’s evidence was that Snr Buitrago had “a few cows” when he started working for him in 1992 or 1993 {D5/88/941}. That seems to me to be something that Snr Manco is likely to have remembered.  On the basis of Snr Manco’s evidence and the size of the cheques paid to Snr Buitrago by ODC I find that Snr Buitrago bought his five heifers and put them on La Alborada in about 1992. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The Claimants allege that two of Snr Buitrago’s cows got stuck and died in 1997.  I deal with this claim in detail later.  In summary, I accept that he lost two young cows in the pond near to his house and subsequently sold his three remaining animals.  However, my acceptance of the evidence that he bought the five heifers in 1992 has certain implications.  Snr Buitrago said that his cows were still “young” cows which “were still not breeding” {D5/91/1036}.  If, as he says, he lost them in 1997 they would by then have been at least five years old, which is inconsistent with their being described as still young and would raise questions about why he had not yet bred from them.  Once again, there is no documentary or objective evidence to help.  On this occasion I consider that Snr Buitrago is likely to remember that his cattle that died were still young and were not breeding.  That recollection, however, casts doubt on his present recollection that he lost them after the Ocensa works.  I am not satisfied that he lost his two young cows in 1997 and think it more likely that he lost them before the Ocensa works took place.  Because the state of the pond by the house was not in any event attributable to the Ocensa works (even if the loss had been in 1997 or later), the main significance of this mis-attribution of date is as another pointer to the unreliability of Snr Buitrago’s memory of chronology. </p>

I assume that, if their purpose in asking for the documents (or the purpose in producing the documents) had been to enable a claim to be made against Ecopetrol arising out of the ODC works, Leigh Day would have made that clear in the light of what Snr Manco had been asked and said in cross-examination.  I therefore infer that the request was made in relation to the proposed claim arising out of the Ocensa pipeline.  On that basis I think it likely that Leigh Day asked Snr Manco and Snr Buitrago to provide documents evidencing the course of their dealings, including their partnership, and that Snr Manco and Snr Buitrago, having no such document, responded to the request by going to a notary and attempting to set down a formal record of what had happened.

Furthermore, even in 1995 most of SW1 and the eastward course of W3 remained primary forest and Snr Manco’s push to the west to clear additional pastures had not yet happened.  As the Claimants put it, the 1995 aerial photograph “is clear in showing that the relevant area to the east of the ROW right down to the area near to the house which Dr Savigny designates as wetland was densely forested mostly with well-defined tree crowns” {C4/3.6/860}.  So the focus of agriculture was to the east of the property – “the ODC ROW … was of course located well away from any farming activity undertaken by the Claimants,…” {C4/3.6/861}.  There would have been no call for the Claimants to go regularly into the area that has subsequently been designated SW1 or the lower reaches of W3 and there is no evidence that they did so.  This fact, combined with the demonstrable unreliability of important parts of the evidence about chronology and the fact that both men are now convinced that their problems only began with the Ocensa pipeline mean that I am unable to treat absence of evidence from them about what was happening to the west of the property as evidence that nothing was. </p>

For some reason which is not explained, he signed another one on 2 November 1994, which was in identical terms apart from describing La Alborada as being in the municipality of Segovia rather than Remedios {M/92T/321.1}.  Also on 2 November 1994 he entered into the ROW Agreement with the Defendant {M/93T/332.1}.  It was in the Defendant’s standard form as set out at [369] above.  Snr Rojas acted on behalf of the Defendant.  La Alborada was declared to be just over 79 hectares.  Clause 5 said that the pipeline and complementary works would pass through La Alborada “in a 25-meter wide and 740-meter long strip of land, for a total of 18,500 square metres …”.  Under Clause 9, the price of the easement rights and the damages caused by the construction of the pipeline was COP 400 per square meter for a total of COP 7,400,000.  The Annex described the damages as “Damages in: Pastures, trees and fences”.  The rate of COP 400 per square meter compares with the aggregated rate of COP 100 (1,450,000/14,500) paid by ODC under the various agreements outlined above.  It is not far short of the c. COP 8,000,000 paid by Snr Manco to Snr Buitrago for the farm. </p>

The Ocensa ROW was opened on about 6 November 1996.  No detail is available about what, if anything, was done before the opening of the ROW, but there must have been some activity because Snr Buitrago entered into a settlement agreement with Ocensa and Saipem on 6 November 1996 {M/99T/354.1}.  It was in the standard form of settlement contract as set out at [388] above.  It referred in Clause 5 to “utilisation of a 7,400 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> access, at the rate of $280 x m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>” and in Clause 6 to Snr Buitrago having claimed “$4,000,000 as compensation for the damages caused to the property, identified in the preceding clause, considering that they have caused him losses such as: throng of unauthorized people passing through this access.”  Clause 7 recorded that Saipem believed the real value of the damages caused on account of access to be $1,000,000 and Clause 8 recorded that the parties did not agree about the actual value of the damages.  The settlement terms were that Saipem would pay Snr Buitrago COP 2,070,000 within thirty days.  That settlement sum equates to the rate of COP 280 per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>for the 7,400 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> mentioned in Clause 5. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It is possible that this is the settlement to which Snr Buitrago refers at [76] of his witness statement {D5/91/1033}.  The receipt recording payment of the damages on 25 November 1996 {M/98.2T/351.2a} is consistent with his evidence that he remembers being paid in cash, as there is no mention of a cheque.  There is, however, no explanation in the evidence of the reference to a throng of unauthorized people and I am not able to make any finding other than that the settlement appears to have been for sobreanchos and to have been reached before (or, at the latest, on the day of) the opening of the ROW.  To that extent it shows a willingness and ability on the part of Snr Buitrago to make a complaint even before the Ocensa works were carried out.  He entered into a second settlement after the works had been completed, to which I will return when setting out what happened after construction. </p>

Reconformation of the ROW was carried out on about 4/5 December 1996 {K45/476/108} {K45/476/107}.  The long-term geotechnical works were carried out by about 12-14 December 1996 and the revegetation works completed by about 21 March 1997.  The revegetation works may have been commenced before then but it is not possible to identify specific dates {Day19/157:1}.  Snr Manco’s recollection that the revegetation works started in the same month as the Recomposition of the ROW {D5/88/952} is suspect (for reasons outlined earlier when considering his evidence generally) but supports the Defendant’s submission that revegetation was at least commenced at about the same time as the installation of long term geotechnical works.  The evidence does not justify a finding that there was a clear gap between the long term geotechnical works and revegetation works or that there was a gap from December 1996 to March 1997. Brachiaria grasses were used for revegetation {D5/88/952}. </p>

Records would have been kept as the walk throughs affected payments to Saipem; but no records are available to the Court {Day19/43:24}.  An inspection on 6 June 1997 recorded as the only items on LC50 “casing setting on ditch and cracks” {J24/74T/40}.  Snr Loeber explained, and I accept, this to mean that the tube had settled in the ground giving rise to gullies.  Precisely where this happened has not been identified and neither party has linked it to particular problems that are relevant to the loss and damage alleged by the Claimants.  By 18 November 1997 most of the punch list items had been cleared satisfactorily, but it is not possible to tell which ones were outstanding {J24/80/1}.  What can be said of the original punch-list is that it and the other walk throughs should have picked up significant problems if they were present and that there is no sign that they did.  Also, in contrast to the position on LC74, the daily and weekly reports recorded no serious problems that can be linked to LC50 or its surrounding area, though they do refer to adverse weather conditions, as I summarise below. </p>

The annual rainfall for 1997, the first full year after stripping of the Ocensa ROW, was 72% of that average: I bear in mind that I have left November and December 1996 out of account. </p>

It is not possible to tie particular references to the works being conducted on La Alborada, but they give a flavour of the typical weather conditions experienced on this spread.  On 8 November 1996, two days after the ROW was opened on La Alborada, bad weather made it impossible for inspectors to visit work spreads {K39/400T/2}.  Between 10 and 30 November there were references to rain hindering progress on five days {K39/401.1T/2} {K39/408.1T/2}.  There were references to rain during the night saturating the ground on 3 December and slowing progress on 5 December {K40/413.1T/3}.  During the period after reconformation on about 4/5 December 1996, rain reports are incomplete.  The Zaragoza camp was some 40 kms away and its records are incomplete.  The data is therefore partial and of limited assistance.  The highest daily rainfall recorded at Zaragoza between January and 21 March 1997 is 54 mm on 18 January 1997 {K41/429T/4}. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Buitrago gave little evidence about the carrying out of the works and such evidence as he did give has to be treated with caution for the reasons I have already given and because I am not satisfied that he was able to distinguish after so many years between what happened with the ODC works and the Ocensa works.  As he had neither crops nor animals near the ridge, he “would go there from time to time” {D5/91/1029}.  His evidence was that the earth that was dug up was not protected and was simply piled up on the sides “while they dug out the ditch”.  He says that they did not put up trinchos.  He said that earth from the trench was piled on earth that had previously been stripped and that it was left at the side of the ROW.  His recollection was that costales were installed after revegetation and that in some areas (presumably at this later stage) they built “walls or trinchos” with the sacks to stop the earth going down to the water sources.  He cut wood for them to use for trinchos over a period of two weeks.  He made a complaint in Remedios that there was a stream which was being contaminated by mud from the ROW and that the stream, now full of mud, fed into the stream that came to the house: when it rained the earth would come loose from the ROW and came down to the stream and was adversely affecting the water.  His concern at the time was that the damage was going to be very great because the water was going to be contaminated.  He described a negotiation where “they” said the damage was minor and would not continue.  Initially they did not agree on the level of compensation; but at a subsequent meeting fifteen days later he was offered an increased sum on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and he accepted what he was offered.  According to Snr Buitrago, he was paid in cash. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Snr Buitrago’s description of mud coming off the ROW is important because of the link between rain and its effects on the land below.  Thus “after the Ocensa pipeline was laid, when it rained earth started to be carried down toward the water channels and it got stuck just before the meadow where I kept the cattle. … When heavy rain finally fell and the pressure built up, the earth that had been stuck was washed away </p>

The meadow became a deep swampy lagoon. … Every time it rained more and more swamp formed. …” {D5/91/1035}.  When speaking of the sedimentation of water sources he said that “it happened little by little, first the stream about which I complained during the construction was contaminated.  This stream definitely started to be contaminated as soon as they started construction.  Later other water sources and the pool were contaminated little by little each time it rained” {D5/91/1036}.  His evidence about erosion on the ROW was that “a lot of earth had come down from the [ROW].  The cortacorrientes and the barriers that they installed did not hold back the water and the whole lot went down into the water channels.  Every time I went to look when it was raining, the erosion had got worse and more and more earth was going down into the water channels” {D5/91/1037}.  On the Claimants’ case, by the first winter, mud was flowing to the lower reaches and into the fish pools, of which more later.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There is a considerable danger of over-interpreting Snr Buitrago’s evidence, but it is to be remembered that when the Ocensa pipeline was laid, the meadow in which he was keeping his cattle was the area of 1-2 hectares near the house and the forest to either side of W3 further to the west had not yet been cleared.  His description of earth getting stuck “just before” the meadow where he kept his cattle is therefore a description of earth making its way past the area of SW1 and further down W3 to a point close to the house.  Similarly, his description of “the meadow” becoming a deep swampy lagoon most naturally refers to the meadow around the house.  The case advanced by the experts concentrates on SW1 and the wetland close to W3 and does not support a finding that the general area of meadow around the house where Snr Buitrago was keeping his cattle in 1997 was turned into a deep swampy lagoon, though the area he cultivated included an area of pre-existing wetland and the pond, from which water was drawn for human and animal consumption {D5/88/955}.  The pond where (as I find for reasons given elsewhere) Snr Buitrago’s two heifers were lost was near the small bridge below the house and was described by Snr Manco as very deep, swampy and full of mud {Day8/69:18}.  While I accept as possible that water coming down stream W3 to the house may have been discoloured in times of heavy rain after the Ocensa works, I do not accept that the state of the pond when the heifers died was of recent origin or attributable to the Ocensa works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">One aspect of Snr Buitrago’s evidence that was quite wrong was that he says he complained (in the context of the Ocensa works) that the link road (which from his description means the secondary road) was causing him a lot of damage {D5/91/1033}.  I accept that he complained that the secondary road was causing him a lot of damage but, as I have already said, it was nothing to do with the Ocensa works and was either before or during the ODC works.  I infer and find that he complained about the impact of the secondary road before the Ocensa pipeline was laid because he perceived that it was causing significant damage to his land. </p>

During the Ocensa works he would go up to the ridge once a week, but he only looked “in passing” because it was a militarised zone and people were not allowed to watch because of the security risk.  His evidence was that the soil from the trench was placed on either side of the ditch, within the ROW and unprotected.  Excess soil after the trench had been backfilled was spread and compressed; but his evidence was that this soil was washed away towards where the streams were.  His statement indicates that he saw the water carrying away the soil and that this was before revegetation took place.  His evidence is that barriers made of fibre costales were put up in rows along the ROW and that they made some walls with fibre costales along the edge of the ROW; but they didn’t use matting.  He remembered the building of gabion walls made from fibre costales containing soil; but he says they have disintegrated and no longer exist. </p>

The first rainy season after the Ocensa pipeline was laid would have started in about the second half of April 1997.  He described that the water gradually filled with more and more sediment and that “with the slightest hint of rain, this water becomes undrinkable”, even in summer {D5/88/955}.  In his oral evidence he said that, before the Ocensa pipeline there wasn’t a swamp at SW1 and one could walk there easily but that now land comes down from the crest and gets stuck there so that it gathers more and more mud each year {Day9/74:1}.  </p>

In addition excavated trench soil stood on the ROW for up to five days between 25 and 30 November 1996 before the trench was backfilled.  There would then have been modest windrows of excess soil.  That soil would have been spread on reconformation on or about 4/5 December 1996 with long term geotechnical works being installed a minimum of seven days and a maximum of about 10 days later on 12-14 December 1996.  After Recomposition there would have been no significant piles of soil exposed to the elements. Revegetation commenced on a date that I am not able to specify, but there was no clear gap between the long term geotechnical works and the start of revegetation works, which were in any event concluded by March 1997: see [1698] ff above. </p>

The existence of the gabions indicates that sediment was coming off the ROW – but that cannot seriously be disputed in the light of all of the evidence about sediment being found on the slopes below the ROW and making its way to the lower slopes.

I am not satisfied that Snr Manco’s evidence is based on recollection or that it is reliable on this point.  The GDS are uninformative because zig-zag lines were not used to indicate matting on Spread B or, if they were, were not used consistently {E1/2.1/118.2}.  It is therefore not possible to conclude that the remnants found by Dr Card had been placed as part of remedial works carried out later.  TQ61 applied and therefore it is unlikely that matting was used on the ROW where its gradient was less than 20%.  This would have caused the rate of erosion to be higher on those slopes than if it had been used; but no analysis was presented by reference to the individual slopes and, for the reasons given at [569] ff above, the decision not to use erosion matting on those slopes cannot automatically be held to be negligent.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The real dispute between the experts at trial was whether there should have been a longitudinal drain down from the ridge to the southern end of the ROW near where it entered LC50.  Dr Card proposed a longitudinal drain running from the north to the south end of the property where all run-off from the ROW would be discharged at a safe velocity into one stream, the flow of the run-off having been controlled by energy dissipation structures on the way down {Day26/168:10}; and he referred to the longitudinal drain on LC74 by way of supporting analogy {Day26/167:17}.  When he returned to the subject in re-examination the next day (at the Court’s request) {Day27/114:16} his overnight order of magnitude calculations indicated that a series of 10 linked ditch diverters (covering roughly 140 metres of the ROW) would generate up to 260 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> of flow per hour.  The effect of running a longitudinal drain for the whole length of the ROW to channel flow down to the lower lands and from there into a stream (which is what Dr Card had suggested the evening before) would be to require a drain that could cope with many multiples of 260 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> of flow per hour, whether the relevant stretch of the ROW is treated as c. 725 metres or c. 1000 metres in length.  This confirms my initial impression that a longitudinal drain to take all runoff down to the lower slopes was an impractical suggestion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Perhaps in recognition of the impracticality of taking all run-off down to the lower land by a single longitudinal drain, Dr Card modified his suggestion.  By the time of re-examination, he was suggesting that the longitudinal drain should discharge to a natural drainage system every 140 metres {Day27/116:16}.  The question then arose whether it was better to concentrate the run-off from the ROW to discharge into a natural drainage system on the slopes above LC50 and W1-W4 at the end of each ditch diverter or, as Dr Card was suggesting, about every 10 ditch diverters.  Dr Card’s opinion was that it would not be satisfactory to allow the flow from individual ditch diverters to cascade over the side of the ridge down the slope, not least because there is little vegetation cover below the forest canopy {Day27/128:15}.  His opinion was that such uncontrolled cascading would generate vortexes, gulleys and erosion leading in some cases to landslip. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I have considered the general criteria that may inform a decision whether or not to provide longitudinal drains at [578] ff above.  I reject Dr Card’s initial suggestion of a longitudinal drain taking all of the run-off from the ROW down to the southern lowlands as impractical for two main reasons.  First, I find no support for such a concept in the materials to which I have been referred.  Second, however substantially the drain was engineered, and with whatever energy dissipation structures incorporated, the volume of material that would be discharged at the bottom of the drain would be highly detrimental both by concentrating the potential erosive effect of the discharge in one point and by loading all water and any sedimentation into one area.  Dr Card’s second suggestion is more finely balanced because of the lack of vegetation below the forest canopy which distinguishes the slopes below the ROW from those adjacent to the ROW on other properties which were more fully vegetated (e.g. to the west of the South Slope of LC74).  The impact on the adjacent slopes would of course be determined by the success of the revegetation programme, to which I return later, but some erosion and concentration of flow by the use of ditch diverters was inevitable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I am not satisfied that it was negligent of Ocensa not to install longitudinal drains as ultimately suggested by Dr Card because it has not been shown that concentrating run-off onto the (relatively un-vegetated) slopes at intervals would be less damaging than the solution that was adopted.  The periodic concentration of discharge from longitudinal drains would inevitably mean that the flow and potential for damage at the point of discharge would be higher than if the flow were dissipated across a wider area.  It might be theoretically possible to mitigate the effect of that concentration, but the proposal means that the same quantity of run-off is to be channelled onto the slopes adjacent to the ROW whether at concentrated points along the longitudinal drain or more diffusely.  Once that is accepted, the building in of mitigating measures would merely adjust the point on the slopes where diffuse flow occurs.  In the absence of any properly worked proposal or expression of engineering opinion on the relative merits and demerits of the alternatives, I would not be justified in holding that it was negligent not to adopt the solution ultimately proposed by Dr Card in re-examination and subsequent questions from the Court on Day 27.  While acknowledging the relative lack of vegetation at ground level, I also take into account the evidence of Dr Velez that I have set out at [1719] above.  Overall, I prefer the evidence of Dr Savigny that longitudinal drains were not called for {H2.3/3/733} {Day36/102:18} {Day36/178:16}.  </p>

The general evidence of system and the evidence from other Lead Claimant properties demonstrates that fertiliser was used during the revegetation process: see, for example, [970] above.

There is no evidence of consideration being given to the presence of W1-W4 below the ridge.  There is no direct evidence of material quantities of soil escaping into water sources so that their flow conditions were adversely affected during construction.  The Claimants’ case is that the streams became sedimented and contaminated when it rained {D5/91/1032}.  Snr Manco’s evidence is that muddy water was not noticed until the following rainy season, though this needs to be balanced against the Claimants’ expert evidence which suggests that there should have been a noticeable impact as soon as it rained heavily on the exposed Ocensa ROW.  Snr Manco’s evidence also implies that water had not turned muddy after the ODC and before the Ocensa pipeline.  That evidence needs to be tested against all the other available evidence; and it needs to be brought into the balance when testing that other evidence.  Contamination of water courses was the subject matter of the settlement reached with Saipem in August 1997: see [1744] below.   </p>

Clause 5 recorded that the damages to the property consisted of “700 meters in length, with additional land as follows: 2.5 x 100 = 250 m 2 and 1 x 600 = 600 m 2 for total additional land of 850 m 2, value of additional land $200.  $200 x 850 m 2 = $170,000, and payment of damages caused by Bronco, knock down of 50 timber trees for parapet $125,000, destruction of special parapets $150,000 and contamination of water source and land corridors by Saipem $255,000, for total damages of $530,000 and a total amount payable of $700,000.”  On this basis the settlement required Saipem to pay Snr Buitrago $700,000, which it did on the same day {M/98.4T/351.5}.  Snr Buitrago signed a Paz y Salvo in the standard form for settlements involving Saipem: see [391] above.  A copy of the Paz y Salvo was authenticated by a notary on 23 October 1997 {M/102T/359.1}, but the date on which it was originally signed does not appear. </p>

A document described as an invoice of damages supports the calculation included in the settlement agreement but provides no further information {M/100.1/357.5}.  There is no witness or documentary evidence of any settlement agreement or Paz y Salvo entered into between Snr Buitrago and Ocensa.  The pattern of settlements and Paz y Salvos to which I refer at [393] does not demonstrate that Ocensa always entered into separate settlements and Paz y Salvos so as to justify a finding that it entered into a separate formal settlement or Paz y Salvo entered into with the LC50 Claimants.  </p>

The photograph was taken on 26 September 2010, the same day as Dr Atencio’s first attendance at LC50.

Reviewing their evidence for the purposes of preparing this judgment has confirmed that provisional view.  On the material that is available to me I find that until June 2011 the Claimants’ recollection and instructions both to the lawyers who prepared the 2008 Schedule of Loss and the 2011 Further Information was that they had dug the pools before the Ocensa pipeline were laid.  That recollection and account was repeated to Dr Atencio and Dr Velez in September 2010.  I make no finding about whether it was repeated to Dr Atencio on his second visit in November 2011 but infer that he was not told anything different: had he then been told by the Claimants that they had dug the pools after the Ocensa pipeline had been laid I would expect him to have noted that fact in some way in his report.  </p>

That was at least 14 years after the event and it seems overwhelmingly likely that the change took place in the course of compiling evidence for inclusion in witness statements for exchange in the litigation.  That of itself gives rise to concern about why the change of recollection occurred and how it could be regarded (either by those compiling the evidence or by the Court) as more reliable than the earlier version in the absence of any documentary assistance.  I have no information about the privileged process by which witness statements were produced and therefore should not be taken to express any view about whether the process itself contributed to the change of version on this point.  For my purposes it is sufficient to find that I do not accept that the new version was based upon recollection that the pools were dug after the Ocensa pipeline was laid.  I conclude that the earlier version is probably correct, that the digging of the fish pools was an enterprise embarked on by the Claimants before the Ocensa pipeline was laid and that, if and to the extent that either man now has a recollection that there was a pipeline in place when they dug the fish pools, it was the ODC pipeline. </p>

Snr Manco said that around Point 199 there was probably 2 metres of mud or marshland {Day8/68:14}.  When Dr Tobon entered the swampy area with the aim of taking measurements of the depth of sediments accumulated there, he sank into the swamp {H7.7/52/1903}.  Dr Savigny described that his leg was not long enough to reach the bottom and that a 2 metre-long stick was not long enough to reach the bottom either {Day37/216:7}.  The pleaded case is that 15 cows have become stuck and were lost in SW1 between 2002, when Snr Manco re-introduced cattle to La Alborada, and 2012.  By 2002 the possibility of cattle getting into SW1 existed because he had cleared parts of the forest on either side in the way that I have described. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It is common ground that pathways existed for sediment from the ODC and Ocensa ROWs to go into the watershed for W1-W4 and into the streams {H2.3/3/726}.  There is also clear photographic evidence of sediment below the ROW and above the streams.  Soil making its way into W1 would go down towards the alluvial fan and SW1 {Day36/134:5} ff.  Because W1 runs roughly parallel to and below the ROW it forms at least a partial barrier to prevent sediment going down the hill into the valleys to the north of the valley containing SW1.  Similarly, W2-W4 operate as barriers to sediment which reaches them, with their waters carrying the sediment on its further journey unless a quantity of sediment sufficient to overwhelm and overtop the stream arrives.  The evidence does not support a finding that the streams were overwhelmed or overtopped in their course above the alluvial fan: Dr Tobon observed no sediment accumulation in the streams and no damage on the bed of the streams between the stream sources and the point of conflux of the streams in the flat area, except for small accumulations of sediment in the concave parts of the beds {H7.3/3/877}.  From Point 197 the streambed was completely filled with sediment {H7.3/3/886} which supports the Claimants’ case that the streams carried sediment down the steeper parts of the hill and deposited it where the slopes flattened out.  The alluvial fan is well illustrated by {H7.3/3/884}.  There is remarkably little photographic evidence showing the state of SW1 and what there is does not materially assist in determining the questions at issue between the parties. </p>

I shall refer in greater detail to the points of erosion alleged by the Claimants later on.  For present purposes I refer back to [504](i) and (ii) and Dr Card’s eventual acceptance that 69% (2,100/3,035 cubic metres) of the volume of soil that he estimated had been lost from his seven “notable points” drained to the west and not onto LC50.  He gave no description of SW1, but gave as his opinion that “any sediment originating from the ROW is likely to have entered Streams 1-4 and that “such sediments” (i.e. sediments that had entered Streams 1-4) “are likely to have been transported rapidly and deposited in flatter areas along the channel lengths as well as in the flattest terrain downstream where Swampy Area 1 is located.  Based on the soil erosion recorded on the ROW and the lack of functional erosion control measures it is my opinion that soil erosion is on-going due to lack of repair and maintenance to the erosion control measures and lack of vegetation cover on the ROW as I have described...” {H1.1/1/176}.  He rejected natural soil erosion processes and deforestation as material causes of SW1 {H1.1/1/177} {H1.1/1/179} but did not himself measure or estimate the volume of sediment in the area, deferring to Dr Tobon who, he said, “provides an estimate of the volume of sediment in this area based on his field measurements” {H1.1/1/179}.  As has already been seen, Dr Tobon in his turn deferred to a non-existent paragraph said to be from Dr Card’s report to establish that the amount of soil accumulated in SW1 greatly exceeded the amount of soil that could have eroded from the deforested slopes above it: see [498](ii) and [499](ii).  For his part, Dr Card said that he had never done a calculation that led to the 70/30 split as asserted by Dr Tobon because he (Dr Card) was waiting for Dr Tobon’s assessment of the volumes in SW1 {Day27/19:20}.  The circularity was therefore complete.  For reasons already given, I find no assistance in Dr Card’s attempted quantification of soil loss in his Fourth Report.  I accept his evidence that the potential for soil loss from the ROW was at its greatest before revegetation became established: the same would be true of the ODC ROW.  Dr Card offered no expert analysis of or opinion about soil loss from the ODC ROW.  He appears to have assumed that the Claimants’ accounts meant that there had been no significant soil loss from the ODC ROW between 1991/1992 and the end of 1996. </p>

Between there and where W3 emerges from woodland close to the house is first SW1 and then the still-wooded W3 wetland.  Dr Tobon writes that the “principal stream displays significant sediment accumulation on its streambed in the flat part of the farm where a swampy area has formed covering the entire flat area in this part of the farm” {H7.3/3/878}.  On 24 November 2011, during the wet season, Dr Tobon measured sediment depths of c. 1 metre in the alluvial fan and measurements of 30 cms and in excess of 1.25 metres in at Points 197 and 199 in SW1.  On 8 April 2013, during the dry season, he measured a depth of sediment in excess of 1.5 metres at a different point of SW1 {H7.7/61/2175}.  Professor Monsalve’s measurements, taken at different places described as “immediately downstream from the conflux of streams [W1-W4]” {H8.26/30/6584}, do not cast doubt on Dr Tobon’s measurements, which I accept as accurate.  Dr Tobon’s evidence (which was essentially factual on this point) was “that the swampy area [SW1] was almost entirely silted”,  that the sediment “has filled the entire area of land”, and that there was significant sediment accumulation “across the swampy area” {H7.3/3/881}. </p>

He said that he reached his opinion on the basis of various sources of evidence including Dr Obando’s report.  I have no confidence that he had in fact read a report from Dr Obando to justify that reliance, for reasons given earlier.  He also gave as his opinion that soil from current erosion was still moving towards the sources of the four streams, from where it is transported down to the flat area {H7.3/3/879}.  He relied upon the witness statements of Snr Manco, Snr Buitrago and Snr Echevarria to support his opinion that “a large part of the soil was either deposited directly over the location of the sources or large quantities of soil were eroded from the ROW especially during the time that the soil removed from the ditch was exposed” {H7.3/3/879}.

In my judgment, their witness statements provide no support at all for an opinion that a large part of the soil was deposited directly over the location of the sources or that large quantities of soil were eroded during the (very short) time between excavation and backfilling of the trench.  His opinion was also influenced by his mistaken belief that the ROW had been entirely covered by forest until felled by Ocensa {H7.3/3/880}.  The gist of his opinion was that the major problem of sedimentation derived from the period of construction, though he qualified this subsequently to include the period of construction “and in subsequent months” {H7.3/3/880}.     </p>

His agrological evidence was directed to allegations of inversion, mixing and compaction.  As such it has relevance when considering why there is erosion on the ROW, but does not assist in determining the consequences of any erosion from the ROW during construction and thereafter.  In his Fourth Report he stated that he had found “rock fragments characterized by angular faces [in SW1], serving as an indicator of a short and quick transportation similar to that of fragments coming from colluvial areas.  In this particular case these corresponded to rock fragments coming from the ROW excavation and from soil deposits” {H3.10/20/2324}.  So far as I have been able to tell, there is no previous mention in Dr Obando’s reports to his having taken samples or made observations in SW1 in the course of his inspections of LC50.  There is a reference in his first report to finding materials and rock fragments from the ROW “in the water channels W3 and W4” which were consistent with the materials found in the soil profiles on the ROW {H3.5/5/995} {H3.5/5/1006}; but that is not the same as finding them in SW1.  Neither his second nor his third report mentions SW1 or the observing of rock fragments in it.  I accept his reported observation of rock fragments in W3 and W4 as described in his first report; but, although he was not crossexamined on the point, I am not confident that he made any separate observation of such fragments in SW1 and do not place weight or reliance upon his observation that he did.  Dr Obando provided no observations or analysis of SW1 that contribute to a finding on how and when it was caused. </p>

As part of his 2010 visit he took an inventory of fresh landslides along the secondary road and found 35 which he considered “were shedding sediment into runoff waters”.  By reference to points marked A, B and C on his image LC50-5 {H2.3/3/685} there were 12 between A and B and 23 between B and C {H2.3/3/718}.

I too am in no doubt that the construction of the secondary road was a source of damage to LC50, but it has not been shown that the damage it caused was damage that contributed materially to the presence or extent of SW1.  The original Schedule of Loss was imprecise about the damage that the secondary road caused: see [1666] above.  When the damage from what was then called the access road was articulated in the Particulars of Claim it referred to damage to fruit trees and damage to an unidentified stream: see [1667] above.  Snr Buitrago’s evidence was of earth being piled up in his meadow before being taken away by dumper trucks {D5/91/1035}.  That does not suggest damage to the upper reaches of LC50, which for the most part had not been cleared.  On the evidence that is available to the Court, the withdrawal of the claim relating to the secondary road was explicable on two distinct grounds: (a) the road was constructed long before the Ocensa works, and (b) it did not contribute to the damage for which the Claimants ultimately decided to claim. </p>

If, as is the Claimants’ case put at its highest, SW1 is a swampy area which is rendered swampy in its entirety by the presence of sediment to the measured depths of up to and more than 1.5 metres, the question “where did such a volume of sediment come from and over what time scale?” must be answered with an eye to the volumes of sediment that such a finding implies.  If, however, SW1 has an area that is affected by sedimentation in parts but is in other parts a waterlogged bog as described by Dr Savigny, the volumes of sediment that must be contemplated are smaller and the central question may have a different answer.  To my mind, therefore, there is a question of fact that must be answered in order to resolve the dispute about SW1 and the claims that are contingent upon it: do I accept Dr Savigny’s factual evidence about what he encountered when, as he says, he criss-crossed SW1?

Of most importance is the evidence that in September 1995 (before the onset of the dry season) the ROW had 90-100% exposed soil.  As elsewhere I make allowance for the inherent imprecision of these figures: but, in general terms, revegetation of the ODC ROW had failed, leaving the ROW substantially naked (to adopt a term used by the Claimants in their closing submissions).  Snr de los Rios described the ROW as being bare of vegetation cover in 1995 {H5.5/6/1173}.  Contrary to a suggestion made by Dr Obando there is no direct evidence and no reason to suppose that the condition of the ROW had deteriorated by September 1995 from a better condition with less exposed soil at an earlier date after the ODC works.  Nor is there any evidence or reason to assume that the condition of the ROW improved significantly between September 1995 and November 1996. </p>

The reference in the Bateman study to geotechnical works installed by ODC being destroyed (to which Dr Card referred in his report) was not specific to LC50 {H1.1/1/64}; but it is a timely reminder of the forces to which the ODC ROW on LC50 was exposed.

On all the evidence, that acceptance was not merely correct but inevitable.  While recognising that the width and layout of the Ocensa ROW was not congruent with that of the ODC ROW, I find that eroded materials from the exposed soil on the ODC ROW in the period from the opening of the ODC ROW (which is most likely to have been in or about early 1991) until the commencement of the Ocensa works (in late 1996) would have had available the same pathways to and down the slopes of LC50 subject only to minor differences attributable to the increased width of the Ocensa ROW.   </p>

It will then also be necessary to look at the evidence about inversion, mixing and compaction (though in less detail than in other cases) in order to form a comprehensive view about whether the surface erosion that can now be seen is attributable to failings on the part of Ocensa making the ROW more susceptible to erosion than it had been before.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">As a preliminary point, the use of the ROW has changed.  As I have said before, there is no evidence that cattle were kept on the ROW before Snr Manco reintroduced his herd of 25 cows in about 2002, later increasing its size up to over 100 head before starting to switch to the heavier buffalo that he now keeps.  Cattle and buffalo are not a source of erosion on the ROW before 2002 at the earliest.  Until then the only traffic on the ROW was human (typically the army and perhaps guerrillas), with one identified reference in 2002 which may have been to heavy machinery using the ROW on La Alborada to gain access to a property to the north in order to maintain a pipeline valve {K60/590T/3}.  Although the evidence is very limited, it seems probable and I find that the trail seen on the 1998 Overflight Video is probably attributable to its use as a track for humans rather than simple failure of revegetation, there being no obvious reason (and no satisfactory explanation from the experts) why the revegetation should have failed there but not generally elsewhere.  As I shall set out below, I accept that the direct cause of much of the erosion that is now to be seen on the ROW is caused by the passage of cattle along trails.  In some places cattle have followed and extended the width of the previous trail.  I accept Dr Savigny’s general evidence that the 2009 and 2010 aerial images show numerous criss-crossing livestock trails with 90-100% exposed soil, with the balance of the pasture ranging from 10-50% up to 50-90% exposed soil {H2.3/3/694} {H2.3/3/695}.

In any event, depending upon precisely where the landslide is to which reference is being made, it is not clear that any soil would drain onto LC50: see {H2.3/3/713} at lines 1364-1378.  If the soil loss was from the area shown in Dr Savigny’s image LC50-15, it would drain to the west {H2.3/3/707}.  In summary, I am not satisfied that the landslide was attributable to Ocensa (as opposed to ODC) works or that soil from the landslide would have drained onto LC50, though some may have done for the reasons given by Dr Savigny, whose evidence as identified above I accept. </p>

The difference between the organic content on and off ROW is largely accounted for by choice of sampling locations and it is notable that no result for organic matter in a surface layer on the ROW from any expert was below 2%: see [760] above.

Without attempting to attach any numbers, this follows from the most basic consideration of the very dramatic changes that are applied to the C-factor in the USLE calculation as between land that is bare and land that is vegetated, as discussed earlier in this judgment: see, in particular, [526] ff.

Of the material that left the ROW only a proportion would drain to the east, and only a proportion of what drains to the east would end up in the alluvial fan or, beyond that, in SW1 because some remains on the higher slopes.  Yet even if, contrary to the facts, one were to assume that everything that was eroded on the ROW drained off it to the east and made its way through the alluvial fan to SW1 then, if the entirety of SW1 is to be covered in sediment, each centimetre of sediment depth will require more than a centimetre of sediment loss from the whole of either the ODC ROW or the Ocensa ROW.  As in another context, the mathematics may reasonably be described as magnificently imprecise and I am not attempting to achieve any measure of precision.  My purpose is simply to attempt to achieve some form of qualitative understanding of the implications of the Claimants’ case that the entirety of SW1 is covered in sediment.  If the depths of sediment at the points measured by Dr Tobon and Professor Monsalve were representative of the entirety of SW1, the volumes of sediment that would be required to come from the area of the ROW would, in non-technical and nonquantitative terms, be enormous.  None of the observational or photographic evidence of the present condition of the ROW supports a finding that such enormous quantities have been shed from the ROW at all, leave aside the need to increase the aggregate loss to cater for the fact that not all would drain off the ROW to the east. </p>

Even if this were otherwise a reliable figure, it is the maximum rate on the Claimants’ reworked figures and would only apply to the very short period between construction and the installation of erosion control measures {C4/3.8/1366.7}.  Thereafter the rate of delivery would reduce with the impact of erosion control measures and subsequent revegetation of the ROW.  It is not possible for me to quantify the effect of the revegetation after the Ocensa works: I can only record again that the revegetation was generally successful.  I am therefore unable to attach any weight to this calculation as evidence of the likely quantities of soil to be lost from the ROW which may have found its way to SW1 over time. </p>

It remains possible that they have helped to perpetuate the condition at the edge of SW1 and continuing downstream through the W3 wetlands, but the expert evidence is not sufficiently precise to enable me to make a positive finding about their causative contribution to the present state of those areas.  Because of my conclusion on the causative effect of such erosion, I can state shortly that there is clear evidence, which I accept, that (whatever the theoretical carrying capacity of the area converted to pasture) Snr Manco’s increasing numbers of cattle and, latterly, his much heavier buffalo are a material cause of the observable deterioration on the other pastures as well as on the </p>

The second is the lack of contribution from the secondary road and the late clearing of relevant pastures.  The third is Dr Velez’ description of the terrain as being composed of hills and canyons, in which wetlands are easily formed during the rainy season: see [1663](v) above.

I accept the thrust of Dr Tobon’s observational evidence that there was limited damage to the streams: see [1769] above.

The final decision rests on my assessment of Dr Savigny as a witness of truth.  For reasons I have set out in this section of the judgment, there are a number of aspects of Dr Savigny’s opinion evidence in relation to LC50 which I reject.  More importantly in the present context, my impression of his original report on LC50 was and is that it was less thorough and less compelling in a number of respects than his work on the other three properties that I have had to consider.  I referred at [507] to the Claimants’ submission that he had a tendency to blame everything <span style="font-style:italic">except</span> the Ocensa pipeline for the damage which the Claimants allege that their land has suffered.  To my mind, his original report on LC50 provided evidence of such a tendency.  Whatever the reason for this falling off from his normal standards, I do not find it inconceivable that his subsequent factual evidence was true but omitted from his first report.  I recognise that the factual evidence is inconsistent with the terms of his original report as to the cause of SW1; but if, as the Claimants have submitted, he was succumbing to a tendency to blame what might be described as “the usual suspects”, I can conceive how his original report ended up as it did.   </p>

Because the fields to the west of La Alborada were cleared by Snr Manco after the Ocensa works, the affected area of SW1 had already been subjected to the sediment from both the ODC and the Ocensa ROWs since 1991/1992 and 1996 respectively.  In the absence of reliable quantitative evidence, I can and do accept that the delivery of sediment from the ROW would have increased to a rate higher than had been prevalent since the ODC works for a relatively short time from November 1996, because of the increased area affected by the Ocensa works and the fact that soil that was already disturbed was being re-disturbed; but after the Ocensa revegetation took hold, there is no basis for a finding that erosion continued at the same rate as during the relatively short period from November 1996 or that it continued at a rate as high as had been prevalent from the bare ODC ROW.  It follows that, by the time that Snr Manco says that he started losing cattle in 2002, SW1 had been affected by sedimentation from the bare ODC ROW for approaching five years, from the bare Ocensa ROW for approaching six months and then from the Ocensa ROW at a reducing rate as revegetation took hold from about mid-1997 to 2002.  The initial rate of sedimentation from the Ocensa ROW was sufficient to cause Snr Buitrago to complain in August 1997, which was well into the rainy season.

Together these mean that their records are likely to be less complete or sophisticated than would be the case with farmers in, say, this country” {C4/3.6/936}.  As in other cases, this is true but it understates the true level of the Claimants’ difficulties, which go wider than simply the assessment of quantum.  As I have indicated, Snr Buitrago’s memory is unreliable, particularly for questions of chronology; and, as I have found, the presentation of the Claimants’ case suffered from the fundamental flaw of ignoring the significance of the ODC ROW.  Snr Manco’s memory was in some respects better; but it became clear during the trial that, in crucial respects, he was not in a position to give reliable evidence about what happened or when it happened.  Quite how memory changes and works is well beyond the scope of this judgement, save to observe that there are many instances in this litigation which suggest that memory has been affected by the evidence gathering process. </p>

I reject the submission that Snr Buitrago’s evidence in re-examination indicated that he had been trying to refer to part of SW1.  He drew a clear distinction between having to walk 30 minutes to the fish ponds (which are on the northern boundary of SW1) and a distance of about 100 metres to where his heifers had died {Day9/120:12}.  If he had maintained that his two heifers died in SW1 I would have found that profoundly unlikely and that he was confused, because his 5 heifers were being kept on the 1-2 hectares near the house and were nowhere near the area by SW1, which had not yet been cleared and was heavily wooded.  The ponded area where the two heifers in fact died was in the area which had been cleared and where they were being kept.  It is not alleged that the ponded area where they died was rendered dangerous by the Ocensa works and, given my finding that he lost the heifers before the Ocensa works were carried out, that question could not arise in relation to their loss.  Had they been lost in 1997 and had it been alleged that the ponded area near the house had been rendered dangerous by the Ocensa works in 1997, I would have rejected that suggestion, for two main reasons.  First, the general area has been identified as including an area of wetland since 1961: see [1662](i) above.  Second, I would reject as implausible and not supported by any reliable expert evidence that sedimentation from the ROW since the Ocensa works could have reached the lagoon near the house in such quantities as to make a material difference to its state of swampiness or danger for cattle.  Both the formation of the wetland near the house and the swampiness of the pond was of long-standing. </p>

The pastures round SW1 had not yet been cleared: fear of losing cattle in SW1 cannot have been and was not the reason for selling the three heifers (whether that had happened in 1997 or, as I find, before).  In any event, there is no evidence that Snr Buitrago sold them at an undervalue.  As I have said elsewhere, a claim for loss of production of calves or milk where the full value of the productive animal has been obtained by sale or awarded as damages is double recovery: see [908] above. </p>

When asked to show the area where the cattle got stuck, he marked the CAI to indicate that it was between Points 92 and 201{C6/4/1}.  Roughly speaking, that is between a point towards the eastern end of SW1 and the bridge near to the house.  Point 92 is identified in the key to the CAI as “Bodies of cattle that got stuck in the swamp” and is close to Point 107, which is identified in the key as “area where cattle stuck in swamp” {C4/3/362}.  Points 92 and 107 are approximately 75 metres to the east (downstream) of the easternmost of Dr Tobon’s sediment measurements (Point 199).

I also accept that Snr Manco lost animals within SW1 near to Points 92 and 107 but am not satisfied that all of the animals he lost were within SW1, because both his initial answer in cross-examination and his marking on the CAI indicates that some animals were lost much closer to the house.  I do not think that Snr Manco has a real recollection of when his animals were lost and am unable to place any reliance on the fact that the claim is pleaded as being losses between 2002 and 2012, since I am not satisfied that inclusion in the pleadings has reliable evidential significance. </p>

The fencing claim is for fencing around the pastures into which the cattle were placed.  Snr Manco gives no evidence about how his cattle got into the area of trouble.  Snr Echevarria gave evidence that he “tried to fence off the swampy area but the cows kept pushing the fence down. As a worker on the farm of [Snr Manco], one of my jobs was the reconstruction of the wire fences that had been broken down by the cows.  I did it about eight (8) times, if I remember rightly.  … The fences we had to repair were 50-60 metres long, because most of the ones that were broken down by the cows were in meadows without solid ground, so if they pushed down one fence post all the rest would follow” {D5/97/1058}. </p>

The reference to meadows being without solid ground is consistent with the photograph of the fence erected on one side of the pond near the house {H8.26/30/6824} but is otherwise uninformative.  His evidence does not receive further explanation or corroboration from other witnesses.  As will be seen at [1847]ff below, neither the pleaded case nor the Claimants’ closing submissions make clear where the fences were placed.

I accept that cattle sometimes break down fences and that the ease and regularity with which they do so will depend on various things such as their desire to get to water and the quality of the fencing.  If I were to conclude that the numbers of cattle claimed had all broken through Snr Manco’s fences with the consistent regularity suggested by the formulation of the claim, I would seriously question the competence of the fencing he had erected and the decision to keep his cows in pasture with such inadequate fencing.  Although Snr Manco himself is not by profession primarily a farmer, the evidence of his farming practices does not suggest that he would consistently keep his animals in pastures with such inadequate fences. </p>

Later in the Revised Schedule of Loss it was alleged that, as well as clearing new pasture areas between 1997 and 2002, “they erected fencing to keep cattle away from affected areas” but that “fences erected by the Claimants were not always sufficient to keep cattle safe as they occasionally pushed fences down to access further pasture areas and strayed into swampy areas” {B4.2/5/231}.  Neither the Further Information nor the CAI or its key identified where the fences were.  It was not alleged that the fence was an attempt to place a fence round all or part of SW1.  Two days’ labour per year was claimed for maintaining the fences.  The gist of what was being said appeared to be that the fences were part of the enclosure of new pastures that were away from the swamp.  The 2015 Further Information {B4.4/2/66} was in the same terms, which therefore represent the most developed statement of the Claimants’ case. </p>

The evidence of the Claimants is that they dug the pools during the dry season and that the pools were destroyed in the following wet season after they had extracted one harvest of fish.  I accept that evidence.  On my finding that the pools were dug before the Ocensa pipeline was laid, the pools were dug at the latest in the dry season of 1995/1996 and were destroyed in the wet season which followed.  The 1996 rainy season was coming to an end when the Ocensa ROW was opened in November 1996.  Between then and August 1997, when Snr Buitrago complained to Ocensa about sedimentation there was the dry season until the rainy season returned during April 1997.  On the Claimants’ evidence, the damage to the fish pools would have occurred before then and probably during the rainy season before the Ocensa ROW was opened.  On the most generous view, at least the first incident to which they both referred would have happened.  If either the partial clogging from the first incident or the final clogging of his pools had happened, Snr Buitrago would have complained about it in August 1997.  He did not do so.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">This provisional conclusion must be tested by reference to the Claimants’ evidence about how the fish pools came to be damaged.  Both mechanisms accepted as possible by Professor Monsalve could have occurred during a rainy season before the Ocensa ROW was opened.  Accepting, as I do, his evidence that it was perfectly possible for sufficient sediment to have gone down W1 in an avalanche process, there is no evidence to indicate that such an event could not have happened while the ODC ROW was in its bare condition.  Equally, I accept that his alternative mechanism of a landslip caused by the saturation of soils during prolonged and heavy rain could have caused the sudden arrival of a substantial amount of soil at the fish pools.  I recognise that no particular landslip has been identified as being the landslip in question; but, even with the resources that have been devoted to this litigation, I do not find that surprising and conclude that such a landslip may well have happened and contributed to the clogging of the fish pools.  This conclusion is more easily arrived at if the description of the fish pools being “completely clogged” or being “filled … completely” are not taken entirely literally.  I therefore find no objection to my provisional conclusion in the descriptions of what happened and the possible mechanisms that have been advanced. </p>

I therefore say nothing about quantum save that I am not satisfied that the quantities for which the Claimants contend were sustainable in the basic pools they had dug, supplied and oxygenated only by a hose from the dam in the stream.  I would also reduce any sum awarded substantially because the keeping of fish requires daily attendance and routine maintenance which I find to be most unlikely in the light of the security situation and Snr Manco’s frequent absences now and in the future.  I have no confidence that fish farming was a sustainable long term venture in these circumstances, even on the basis that Snr Manco would hope to continue to employ others to run La Alborada for him. </p>

The formulation of the claim for moral damages ignores the prior impact of the ODC ROW.  The only feature in the claim for moral damages with which I have not dealt previously is the need to take water from an alternative source.  I make no finding about whether that happened before or after the Ocensa works; but even if it happened after, I am satisfied that the water sources on the slopes below the Ridge were compromised before the Ocensa works in the manner I have described earlier, and that the need to find temporary water sources was likely to have happened in any event.  </p>

La Alborada has suffered some damage as a result of pipeline works and has deteriorated in other respects which are not attributable to either pipeline (e.g. the creation of the secondary road, progressive deforestation and the deep cattle trails now evident on the property); but the RARSL portrayal makes no concession to the contribution of the ODC pipeline or other causes of deterioration.  The need to prevent cattle from getting into the swampy and boggy areas of SW1 and the wetlands of W3 and further downstream would have existed whether or not the Ocensa pipeline had been laid and it is simply not possible to find that the switch to buffalo was attributable to the presence of the Ocensa ROW.  The destruction of the fish pools is not a relevant consideration in the light of the findings I have made about timing.  The evidence given at trial does not establish that Snr Buitrago or other members of his family have gone hungry, nor is there evidence that they suffered significant adverse changes in their diet.  The Ocensa pipeline has not increased the extent or the dangerousness of SW1 and has therefore not caused a further reduction in the productivity of the property.  There is no evidence that either Claimant has suffered any actual loss of status or respect as a result of the Ocensa pipeline works. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">In their Joint Statement the Experts treated the claims generally as claims for damage to land and reached agreement about the categories of persons who are entitled to make a non-contractual claim for damage to real estate property {H23.2/7/559}.  Snr Manco did not fall within any of those categories until he became the owner of the land in November 2004.  Professor Castro agreed that this was the case {Day21/226:16}.  However, she had previously said in her first report that Snr Manco would be entitled to pursue compensation for damages based on his interest as Snr Buitrago’s de facto partner between the date on which the informal partnership was created and November 2004 {H14/1/126}.  In her oral evidence she returned to this opinion, stating that Snr Manco could claim from the Defendant in tort for a reduction </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Put in this way, I prefer the opinion of Professor Vallejo.  It seems to me to be most unlikely that Colombian Law would confine the right of recovery for direct damage to land to those having the particular interests agreed by the Experts but allow a right of recovery to a wider class for consequential economic losses.  If a person such as Snr Manco, who has entered into a de facto partnership to work the land with Snr Buitrago, is not entitled to recover damages for direct damage to the land, there seems no obvious reason why he should be entitled to recover for the more remote consequential financial losses he suffers as a result of the reduction in the productivity of the land. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">So far as I am aware, neither expert addressed the issue as being one of direct damage to Snr Manco’s property.  Included in the claims for loss of income as set out in the RARSL are the allegations that fish died when the fish pools became sedimented and that cattle died from 2002 in SW1.  The cattle on La Alborada from 2002 were Snr Manco’s.  There is no direct evidence about who owned the fish.  Although it seems implicit in the evidence that it was Snr Buitrago, I assume for present purposes that the two men might have bought and owned the fingerlings together.  On this basis, the question might arise whether a claim would be admissible to the owner of property other than real estate (in this case fish or cattle) who suffers loss as a result of their deaths caused by a dangerous activity.  Such a claim seems to me to be conceptually possible, but it is not the way in which Professor Castro was supporting Snr Manco’s claim.  Furthermore, it is not obviously the way in which any part of the claim has been advanced on behalf of Snr Manco, although the death of the fish and cattle is a constituent element of the claims that have been brought.  In the light of the fact that the claims have not been pursued in this way and that the expert evidence has not addressed Snr Manco’s claims on this basis, I do not express any view on it one way or another and leave the point undecided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">After 2004 Snr Manco had the requisite interest in land to bring a claim in respect of damage to it.  I accept Professor Vallejo’s opinion that he would then only be entitled to claim for new damage suffered to the property {H15/1/208}.  On the facts that I have found, no new damage has been caused to the property that is attributable to the Ocensa works: if the loss of Snr Manco’s cattle included losses after 2004, their loss was consequent upon damage to the land that had been suffered by November 2004. </p>
