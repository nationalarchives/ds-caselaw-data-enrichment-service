	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">This is a very substantial dispute about the quality of the fabrication of steel monopiles and transition pieces for an offshore wind farm in the North Sea. The Claimant (“Fluor”) is an engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management company registered in England (and is a subsidiary of Fluor Inc, the US multinational construction company).  The Defendant (“ZPMC”) is a wellknown steel fabricator, based in Shanghai with a major manufacturing base at Changxing Island.  ZPMC has an international reputation as a heavy duty equipment manufacturer, in particular ship to shore container cranes.  </p>

Since one of the main issues in the case is whether or not Fluor’s claims in this action were settled by an agreement made in June 2010, it has been agreed that all questions of quantum, if they arise, should be tried in May 2017. The claim is for about US$400 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In order to ensure the quality of the welds in the MPs and the TPs the BOP Contract provided for non-destructive testing (“NDT”), one form of which was ultrasonic testing (“UT”).  UT can involve several different techniques known as scanning patterns.  I will say more about these later in this judgment, but in outline this involved placing a probe on the surface of the steel which transmitted an ultrasonic pulse through the weld metal being tested.  Imperfections in the weld (of a certain type and/or size) would be revealed by an alteration in the signal seen on the operator’s screen.  For this testing to work properly there has to be good contact between the probe and the surface of the metal being tested.   A longitudinal or circumferential seam weld has a curved profile, known as the cap. If the cap is unground, the probe usually has to be placed on the flat surface of the metal either side of the weld. The pulse is transmitted through the weld metal at an angle to the line of the weld seam and also at an angle to the horizontal.  This method of scanning - known as scanning pattern E, or E scanning - is efficient at picking up some types of imperfection but others, such as cracks that are transverse to the line of the weld, are more readily picked up by scanning pattern D. For some welds in critical areas, such as the mud line, the specification required the weld cap to be ground flush with the surface of the base metal, and so it was possible to scan these welds by placing the probe on the surface of the weld itself - this is known as scanning pattern D, or D scanning.  D scanning is much more efficient at picking up transverse cracks, as the facts of this case have demonstrated with startling clarity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">One well-known, albeit fairly uncommon, problem that can occur when welding thick steel plates is hydrogen cracking, sometimes referred to as cold cracking.  This happens when atomic hydrogen created by the welding process remains in the weld metal after it has cooled.  Being the element with the smallest atoms, at high temperatures hydrogen can diffuse through and out of the lattice of the weld metal relatively easily, but for this to happen the weld metal must be prevented from cooling too rapidly.  Hydrogen cracking is fairly rare and when it does happen it is usually the result of some systemic shortcoming in the welding procedure, rather than the result of isolated acts of poor workmanship.  Hydrogen cracking typically occurs in a plane transverse to the line of the weld. </p>

So much so that many circumferential welds were passed as satisfactory by E scanning when in fact they contained many imperfections that could be seen on a D scan.  As a result of the concession in relation to D scanning on ground welds, relatively few circumferential welds at Changxing were subjected to inspection by D scanning during the early </p>

About a week later some MPs of the shipment were tested by RTD Applus, a testing company engaged by GGOWL, which found transverse cracking on another MP, IGH 06.  The upshot of this was that on 3 June 2009 GGOWL issued a non-conformance report (NCR 006) which required Fluor to retest the entirety of the MPs in Shipment No 1 and repair any cracks that were found.  It was sent to Fluor by e-mail the following day.  The retesting was to be carried out using D scans wherever possible, even if the welds had not been ground.  The size of the welds on the MPs was such that the weld caps were relatively flat so that it proved possible in most cases to carry out an effective D scan even though the weld had not been ground flush with the base metal. </p>

In order to do this, extensive temporary facilities had to be set up at Vlissingen and the installation of the MPs at sea was delayed.  However, both Fluor and ZPMC began to take the view that the extensive retesting required by GGOWL was not only more extensive than their respective contractual obligations but also was unnecessary in terms of the structural integrity of the MPs.  By the end of September 2009 Fluor had decided, having taken expert advice, that the further testing and repair should cease and that the MPs of Shipment Nos 1-3 should be installed without further delay, irrespective of whether or not they had been repaired. </p>

He is clearly a very able executive and, in general, I am sure that he is an honest man.  However, his evidence before me was tainted by the fact that much of it was directly contrary to the evidence that he gave to the arbitrators in 2012.  In relation to his written evidence to the arbitral tribunal, he explained that his witness statements have been drafted for him by US lawyers and that he had been provided with a limited set of documents, by reference to which the statements have been prepared. He said that he had conversations by telephone with the US lawyers and </p>

He said that the preparation of his witness statements in the current proceedings, by contrast, had been much more thorough, and that he had seen many more contemporaneous documents, with the result that his present evidence was much more reliable and complete than that which he gave in the arbitration.  In these circumstances, I consider that his evidence, both to the arbitrators and to this court, must be treated with a considerable degree of caution. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">Arc welding is one of several fusion processes for joining metals. The intense heat required to melt the steel is generated between the welding wire, acting as a positive electrode, and the pieces of steel to be joined - the base metal - acting as the negative electrode. When the welding wire contacts or is in very close proximity to the base metal it forms an electrical circuit through an arc, which has a local temperature in excess of 3,000°C, which melts both the wire and the base metal.  The molten pool of weld metal fuses with the base metal which, as it cools, creates the metallurgical bond or weld.  During this process it is important that the molten weld metal is protected from gases such as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen which can have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the weld.  This is done, in part at least, by the use of a flux. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">In SAW the positive electrode is a solid welding wire the tip of which is passed under a layer of flux, which is in the form of a powder placed on the surface of the base metal. Some of the flux is melted into “slag” which solidifies on top of the weld metal as it cools. This has to be removed mechanically after each welding pass, but this is not difficult.  The procedure is then repeated over and over again until the whole of the joint between the steel plates has been filled by the weld metal.  Thus very many passes are required in order to achieve the complete weld.  </p>

A frequent criticism made by Fluor of ZPMC’s practices when using SAW was that the surplus flux powder that had not been used up in the welding was simply swept up and dumped in the hopper without any attempt to separate it from other contaminants with which it had become mixed.  This may explain why there was a higher number of defects in the primary SAW welds than there should have been, but for reasons which will become clear later in this judgment I find that little of any ultimate significance turns on this. </p>

At Changxing the wire (or consumable) used at the time was called Supercored 71H, manufactured by Hyundai.  Additional protection against contamination by detrimental gases was provided by an externally supplied shielding gas, CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> (although it could have been argon, or a combination of CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> and argon).  With FCAW both the arc and the molten weld pool are not concealed by a layer of flux and so they are clearly visible to the welder, which requires very strong protection for the eyes of the operators. </p>

When production first started ZPMC sometimes used FCAW for the primary – mainly longitudinal - welds, but Fluor objected to this and, by the end of 2008, nearly all the production welds were carried out using SAW.  Repairs were necessary if the subsequent NDT revealed a defect in the weld.  If the indications revealed by the probe were above the relevant criteria, then the weld would have to be repaired. The weld material in the relevant area was gouged out and then re-welded (by FCAW). </p>

First, because the base metal either side of the area being repaired is joined by the existing weld, the base metal in the area being repaired is effectively rigid so that there is a very high degree of restraint.  Second, the length of each weld pass is very short, with the result that one pass follows quickly after the other and the weld metal remains at a much higher temperature throughout the process, albeit for a shorter time overall.  </p>

There are three reasons for this (which, for convenience, I take from the first report Mr Teale).  First, it lowers the cooling rate in the weld metal and the base metal, producing a more ductile metallurgical structure with greater resistance to cracking. Second, the slower the metal cools the greater the opportunity for any hydrogen present in the weld metal to diffuse out and not cause cracks. Third, it reduces shrinkage stresses in the weld and the adjacent base metal.  A number of factors affect the choice of preheat temperature, such as the thickness of the joint, the type of steel being welded and the amount of restraint imposed on the components forming the joint. </p>

The higher temperature allows more rapid hydrogen diffusion and reduces the tendency for cold cracking. The entire part or only the metal in the vicinity of the joint to be welded may be preheated (see Table 3.2). For a given set of welding conditions, cooling rates will be faster for a weld made without preheat than for a weld made with preheat. The higher preheat temperatures result in slower cooling rates.

It is only if cracking persists in circumstances where the workmanship is good and no abnormal factors are present, that an inadequate preheat temperature is likely to be the culprit.  It was for ZPMC to choose a preheat temperature for each welding process so as to ensure, absent some unanticipated and abnormal factor, that there is no cracking if the specified procedures are followed and the workmanship is satisfactory.  To that extent, therefore, it is not an obligation that can be discharged simply by the exercise of reasonable skill and care. </p>

The material is so thick that it may be pulling the heat away too fast - making adequate preheat impossible even if it appears that the preheat is okay.  I discussed this with Ms Ma and she said ZPMC has reached a similar conclusion and has made it mandatory for all preheat to be done with the electric bands.

Of course it is possible that by the time of the later visit ZPMC might have thought that the problem with the cracks which had been found about a week earlier had been resolved, with the result that it was not mentioned to Mr Dove.

In relation to repairs, Mr Dove noted that repairs were still being made in the up position using FCAW, with the result that in many cases the appearance was unacceptable.   He said also that the current repair rate was about 6%, which was also unacceptable.  There was no specific reference to any problem with preheating in relation to repair welds: the only reference to this related to the primary production welding, although if the methods of controlling or measuring preheating were unsatisfactory for the primary production welds it may well have been no better when carrying out repairs. </p>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">“When we arrived at the site, two large circumferential weld seams were being preheated (picture 1). In addition, 3 welders were performing repair welding at three areas (see picture 2 and 3). The repair weld seen in picture 2 is very long and was being welded by one welder. The repair weld seen in picture 3 is not long; during the interval of welding, I touched it with my hand and it was only tepid. There was no heating operator on site, and neither was there anyone controlling temperature with a tempil stick. So to speak, almost all the repair welding was performed without preheat. Later on, an operator was called to heat the scene with a flame torch. Operating in such temperature (less than 10° C) in the open air on thick plates and long weld seams, heating symbolically and carelessly with a torch while the heating operator has no tempil sticks cannot meet with the heating requirement and the temperature would cool down very quickly. Thus, there was basically no preheating for weld repair, not to mention the interpass temperature which was tended to by no one. They said that the schedule was tight and they were shorthanded, and there was not enough heating equipment.  I think for short weld seams heating with flame is acceptable, but at least each welder should be accompanied by a heating operator with a tempil stick. For some long repair weld seams, the preheat temperature can never be reached by heating with flame and they must be heated with electric bands. There are three construction teams working on this pile but few people were working. Due to the terrible welding quality, each weld seam has to be repaired more or less, and for some weld seams the repair length can reach almost half the length of the whole weld seam.  In January the temperature will be even lower and severe consequences could occur to the quality of repair weld if no measures are taken. </span>

To accelerate heating, more electric bands can be added and the heating zone can be covered up with quilts . . . the electric bands are narrow and they can only heat with one side (in some places the racks for electric bands are not properly arranged so the electric bands are positioned too far from the workpiece which results in worse heating effect). The cans are rolling and it is difficult to heat on both sides; two electric bands can be placed side-by-side on the welding zone to heat. In addition, heat loss should be reduced which can be achieved by covering up with quilts . . . Of course, this would require an increase of investment and manpower and the bosses would not be willing to do this, so the leaders’ decision would be needed. </span>

First, that the preheat temperature was not only to be achieved at least 75 mm from each weld seam, but also at the “rear side” (which I take to mean the other side of the plates from that being welded).  Second, it said that during welding “<span style="font-style:italic">in order to secure adequate interpass temperature, the rear heating plate shall, instead of being taken down, be continuously supplied with power for heating</span>".

As Dr Gordon pointed out, post heating to a temperature equal or below the minimum preheat temperature would be an attractive course to a contractor in the position of ZPMC because it did not require requalification. </p>

In fact, both Mr Marlow and Mr Teale agreed that the cause of the hydrogen cracking was in the nature of a systemic problem rather than just an isolated case by case problem. Mr Teale emphasised that the fact that hydrogen cracking was so rare meant that if it occurred on a systemic basis something must be wrong with the process or the nature of the welding consumables being used: it could not be down to errors by individual welders (Day 17/16).  The real difference between the approach of Mr Marlow and Mr Teale was that the former regarded the application of an incorrect or inappropriate welding procedure to be a workmanship problem.  That may or may not be right, but in my view in the context of this case that distinction does not matter. </p>

First, that there should not be an excessive overmatch between the strength of the weld material (from the consumable) and the strength of the base metal.  Second, welding consumables should be stored in clean, dry and warm conditions and so as to minimise contamination with water and dirt. Such contamination could be directly responsible for hydrogen in the welds. Third, preheating reduces the rate of cooling of the weld metal and adjacent metal, and this allows a longer time for the hydrogen to diffuse out whilst the temperature is sufficiently high for it to do so.  It was agreed that high-energy welding processes, such as SAW (submerged arc welding), generally require less preheat than FCAW (flux cored arc welding). </p>

But in my view this is doing no more than explaining why there is a “bowl” of heat as described by Dr Dolby.  It follows, as a matter of common sense, that if a substantial area of a sheet of metal is heated by a torch applied to one surface, the rate of loss of heat into the surrounding base metal at a given depth will be lowest in the centre of the area being heated - simply because at that point the base metal on either side is also hot so that the heat sink is limited principally to the base metal below the centre. </p>

First, the purpose of preheating the base metal is to retard the rate of cooling of the weld metal after it is deposited (as both Mr Marlow and Mr Teale agreed: see Day 17/21-22).  It is also clear from the evidence that temperature is the most influential variable in determining the rate of diffusion of hydrogen. It follows, therefore, as the code requires, that all parts of the base metal in the vicinity of the weld must be preheated, not just the surface.  Indeed, Dr Gordon said (Day 18/26-27): “<span style="font-style:italic">I think as the thickness increases, the heat sink potentially increases so it is important, then, to ensure this you have a broad and long enough area pre-heated to the right temperature</span>".  He made a similar point at Day 18/28-29.  This, I find, was an implicit acceptance of Dr Dolby’s bowl analogy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Second, if “in all directions” means all directions in the plane of the surface of the steel plate, then it is hard to see why the required distance must be at least equal to the thickness of the thickest welded part.  Although “thickness” is not defined in this part of the code, both counsel and experts proceeded on the assumption that it referred to the depth of the weld (or the plate, if it was a full thickness weld): see Day 18/26 (Mr Brannigan and Dr Gordon) and Day 18/30 (Mr O’Sullivan). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Third, there is evidence that atomic hydrogen is deposited differentially at different depths in the weld. The hydrogen and oxygen present in the air as water become separated into their atomic states by the heat of the arc (see, for example, Mr Marlow, at Day 17/39; Mr Teale at Day 17/67).  The atoms of hydrogen are the smallest of the elements and can diffuse through the lattice structure of steel, the rate of diffusion being very dependent on the temperature.  In his first report Dr Gordon said that chevron cracks are generally buried in that they do not extend to the surface: page 38, paragraph 8.2(2). This, he said, is partly the result of the hydrogen gradient in the weld, which decreases close to the surface, and partly because of the reduced residual stresses at the surface. According to Dr Gordon there is a trend for the maximum diffusible hydrogen concentration to be in the central third of the weld, decaying as one moves towards the surfaces.  Increasing the pre-heat from 20°C to 100°C produces a significant reduction in the diffusible hydrogen level.  All this suggests that there is as great a need, if not a greater need, to preheat the base metal at lower depths in the weld than at shallow depths. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Fourth, in my view there is no warrant for limiting the words “in all directions” to all directions in the plane of the surface of the plate at the side being welded.  The considerations that I have set out above seem to me to point firmly in the opposite direction.  Mr O’Sullivan’s points might have had some force if the code had said that the temperature had to be “measured” at a given distance in all directions from the point of welding, but it does not say that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">There are at least three methods of applying preheat to the base metal prior to welding. The first is the use of a gas torch with what is known as a “rosebud” head so as to provide a flame over an area. This is often used by the welder and so the heat will be applied to the surface being welded.  This was ZPMC’s general practice during the early months of manufacture, and may well have persisted well into 2009. The second is the use of gas burners with several heads which, in an application such as this, would be configured to follow the contour of the surface of the plate.  The heat would be applied to the surface opposite to that being welded.  I have seen no evidence that ZPMC made any or at least any significant use of gas burners on this project. The third is the use of electric bands or pads, which are usually applied to the opposite surface from that being welded. In an ideal world these would be thermostatically controlled, but those used by ZPMC did not incorporate thermocouples and so they had to be regulated manually. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Dr Dolby and his co-experts criticised the use of handheld gas torches because, without close supervision, they could produce regions under the area being repaired that would be significantly cooler than the temperature at the surface.  By contrast, they said, if preheat was applied to the surface opposite from that being welded there would be a much more uniform heat distribution through the plate thickness underneath the repair groove so that the heat sink effect would be negligible (Reply Report, page 5).  I accept this evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In relation to the use of handheld gas torches, it seems to me that the combination of the high dependence on the skill of the operator and the risk of not heating a sufficient volume of the base metal in the plates makes it likely that, in a fabrication operation the size of this one, there would be many instances where the preheating of the base metal prior to welding would be either insufficient or uneven.  I consider that this often happened during the first six months or so of fabrication (October 2008 to March 2009, perhaps longer).  Aggravating factors during this period - being the winter months - would have been low ambient temperatures (making the base metal much colder) and high humidity levels with consequently greater availability of hydrogen from the atmosphere.  </p>

Please ensure preheating temperature and measures for gouging and welding; try to use newly unpacked wires in the repair or at least do not use wires that have been placed in the open air overnight; try not to make the repair groove too narrow and too deep, and ensure the shape coefficient; grinding the carburized layer till it turns metallic lustre before welding; properly control the parameters in the welding, adopt multi-layer and multi-pass welding; conduct PWHT after welding; FCAW is recommended for the first repair while manual metal arc welding is recommended for multiple repairs in the same area; especially pay attention to the above matters in outdoor repairs.” </span>

However, in repair welds the two factors worked in opposite directions: the shorter time between passes provided less time for the deposited hydrogen to diffuse, whereas the higher temperature which resulted from the weld material being put down repeatedly in a confined space would increase the rate of hydrogen diffusion.  But one thing that was quite clear is that the higher the temperature and the longer the period for which the temperature was maintained, the greater the rate of diffusion of hydrogen out of the weld material. </p>

One aspect of the process that was tested was the use of the consumables and investigation of the extent to which exposing the consumables to the atmosphere prior to use made a difference. Four of the areas where cracks had been found were repaired with FCAW, using newly unpacked Supercored 71H.  The Testing Centre’s conclusion – set out in a note dated 10 February 2009 - was that it was relatively easy to produce good welds, including weld repairs, as long as the procedures were properly carried out.  Several aspects of the welding procedure were emphasised, including the need to achieve the correct preheating temperature, not using wires that have been left in the open overnight and carrying out post heating after welding. </p>

As I have already mentioned, when he opened ZPMC’s case Mr Andrew White QC emphasised the very substantial size of the operation at Changxing, which was running 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  With such a vast workforce, many of whom appear to have been subcontracted labour, it is perhaps unsurprising that unless supervision was very tight and discipline strict ZPMC would find it difficult to ensure that the procedures were properly followed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In the context of the causes of the cracking, it is clear that maintenance of the minimum specified preheat temperature in steel that was more than 65 mm thick (110°C) was seen as an essential condition of success.  It is clear also that it was appreciated that this temperature would have to be maintained throughout the thickness of the plate in the region of the weld.  That, I suspect, was why Ms Ma and others appreciated that electric heating pads applied to the plate on the opposite side to that which was being welded would be the best way of achieving this.  Mr Marlow said that on thick material you had to measure the temperature at the opposite side to that where the heat was being applied (Day 17/50, 52, 130-131).  In my view, for the reasons that I have already given, that is obviously correct. Further, I find as a fact that this was appreciated by ZPMC by late May 2009, and possibly 2-3 months earlier.  The problem with the use of torches was that identified by Dr Dolby, namely that the “bowl” of heat created under the area of the weld was insufficient to prevent the large mass of the plate acting as a heat sink, thereby drawing heat away from the area of the weld. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">The problem of measurement of the temperature can be crudely illustrated by the simple example of a poker in a fire. If the tip of an iron poker is left for some time in a hot fire, it will probably become red-hot (about 500°C or more).  Nevertheless, the other end of the poker will usually be much cooler to such an extent that the poker can be drawn out by hand without discomfort.  That is because there is a temperature gradient along the length of the poker: as one moves away from the tip so the temperature of the iron falls.  Suppose now that, instead of being placed so that the tip of the poker is in the hottest part of the fire, the poker is placed so that the heat of the fire is applied to a region about 6 cm from the tip. When the poker is withdrawn that will be the region that is red-hot, and the tip will be cooler. Measuring the temperature of the red hot zone does not tell you the temperature at the tip of the poker. If, therefore, with the poker in the same position one wants to heat the last 6 cm of the poker to a given minimum temperature, that temperature must be measured at the tip of the poker. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Unfortunately, no tests have been carried out in the course of this litigation (at least, none of which I am aware) in order to discover the temperature that the opposite side of a plate, say, 85 mm thick is likely to reach when the surface where the welding is to be carried out is heated by a torch to 110°C.  Dr Gordon was asked to what temperature one would have to heat the face of the metal on one side of the plate in order to obtain a temperature of 230°C on the surface of the opposite face. Dr Gordon, albeit with the qualification that he was guessing, said it would have to be over 300°C (Day 18/166).  The precise figures do not matter, but Dr Gordon is a very experienced engineer and so I am sure that he was right in a qualitative sense - if not as to the precise number.  This suggests that if one side of a plate 65-75 mm thick was heated to 150°C, the opposite face might achieve a temperature of 110°C. Conversely, heating one face to 110°C only would result in a substantially lower temperature at the opposite face and, indeed, a significantly lower temperature at a point 30 mm below the surface - where hydrogen cracking might be expected to occur if a repair was being carried out from the inside of the can (ie. to the larger weld).<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="14">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:-0.50in"> The longitudinal and circumferential welds of the cans were carried out in two stages: one from either side of the plates. Each weld had a V shaped cross section, but one was deeper and wider than the other. In the case of the circumferential welds, the deeper and wider weld (x2) was usually on the inside.  This was criticised by Mr Dove but it suited ZPMC to do it this way, even though many other fabricators may have chosen to have the deeper and wider world on the outside where access was easier.  I am not prepared to find that ZPMC's approach was, in principle, a breach of any standards as to workmanship (but of course it required the welding to be carried out properly). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">But for one point, therefore, I would have no hesitation in concluding that the problems encountered by ZPMC in achieving successful repair welds was very largely the result of inadequate preheating and the specification of a preheat temperature, 110°C, which was too low.  The former was the result of using a torch to heat the face of the plates being welded, rather than heating from the reverse side which is what I find ZPMC should have done.  Both factors were aggravated by the use of the 71H Supercored consumable.  However, as I have already concluded the latter was not a breach of contract but it did have a consequence of making the selection and achievement of a suitable preheat temperature much more important.  The point that remains is whether such a conclusion is consistent with the results of the repairs that were carried out at Vlissingen and the tests that were carried out by ZPMC in August 2015. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">The issue here is whether the hydrogen cracking that was found at Vlissingen occurred in original production SAW welds or in repair welds carried out using FCAW, or a combination of both.  There are broadly two aspects to this.  As I have already indicated, the primary production welds were, on the whole, carried out using SAW - although during the very early stages of fabrication it seems that in the case of about 5 or 6 cans the seam production welds were carried out using FCAW.  It is not in dispute that, almost invariably, the repair welds were carried out using FCAW.  It is self-evident that one would not have to carry out repairs unless there were defects in </p>

It is ZPMC’s case that virtually all the cracks that were discovered either on inspection at Vlissingen in the case of Shipment No 1 or, in the case of Shipment Nos 2 and 3, on inspections at Changxing prior to shipment, were cracks in repair welds. </p>

But if the repairs had been carried out successfully and had rectified all the original defects, the cause or causes of the original defects would be no more than a matter of history. </p>

Of a total of 623 cracks found, all were in circumferential welds and 618 were in areas that had been repaired.  The current thinking at the time (on the part of Fluor) was said to be that the problem was confined to the repair procedure and was not associated with production welding.  Unfortunately, very few samples were taken of welds which had cracks; however, five coupons (or samples) which were taken of areas where cracks had been found all concerned repair welds. </p>

It is sufficient to find that the proportion of defects in production SAW welds was much lower than that for which Fluor had contended.  Again, in the light of cross examination, it is now quite clear that those cracks had to be repaired unless and until an Engineering Critical Assessment (“ECA”) had been carried out and had shown that the piles were fit for installation in their as delivered condition.

Further, the absence of cracking in the August 2015 tests when a preheat temperature of 175°C was adopted (measured at the surface being welded), suggests that the lower temperature that would have prevailed at a depth of, say, 30-40 mm, was in fact sufficient.

The method involves the use of a probe that is placed on the surface of the metal being welded, or sometimes on the weld itself, which, by means of a short pulse of ultrasound, can detect imperfections </p>

It is important to appreciate at the outset that what the equipment detects is an alteration in the signal that is reflected back from the material being tested. If there are no flaws in the metal being examined the operator will see two spikes on the screen: the first is the signal emitted (the “send” pulse) and the second is the echo from the back of the steel plate, which represents a discontinuity.  The distance between the two spikes on the screen represents the depth of the metal being examined. If the weld contains a flaw, the operator will see two signals in addition to that given by the send pulse: an echo from the flaw and a second echo (from the part of the pulse that misses the flaw) from the back of the steel plate.  The distance between the spike from the send pulse and the spike representing the echo from the flaw indicates the depth of the flaw. </p>

However, if the mirror is turned sideways on, the observer may see little more than a faint reflection in the form of a line representing the edge of the glass.  It is much the same with ultrasound. An additional factor is that the strength of the signal diminishes with distance, partly because it is diverging and therefore reducing in intensity and partly because some of it is absorbed by the medium through which it is passing.  </p>

The welds for which this is required will be specified in the design.  Where welds have been ground in this way it is possible to place the probe on the weld itself. This is often referred to in the documents as “<span style="font-style:italic">riding on the weld</span>”.  It is technically known as scanning pattern D (or D scanning). </p>

In addition to the beam being directed at an angle to the horizontal, it is also directed at an angle to the line of the weld. Whilst this method is efficient at picking up flaws that are parallel to the line of the weld, it is not so good at detecting transverse flaws which are orientated so that they are, in effect, edge on to the line of the beam (as in the example of the mirror turned sideways on).  E scanning is done from both sides of the weld seam and usually at two or three different angles to the horizontal.  In this way the operator methodically works his way along the line of the weld seam, scanning one side for a certain length and then the other. </p>

Each hole is scanned and a mark is made on the screen at the peak of the signal.  The process is repeated for each of the holes. A curve is then drawn linking the peaks and this becomes the DAC curve.  When the operator starts scanning finished welds any difference in the response to the signal, known as an indication, is compared with the DAC at the same point and the signal size is assessed as a percentage of the level of the DAC curve at that point.  The UT specification for a particular project will provide acceptance criteria in terms of a percentage of the DAC curve. For example, it may provide that any indication in excess of 50% of the level of the curve is to be investigated further and, if confirmed, is to be treated as a defect and will normally have to be repaired. </p>

That further investigation may suggest that the flaw is a crack, but the signal always remains just below the threshold.  On Dr Morgan’s approach, therefore, that crack can simply be ignored.  I appreciate that this is probably an artificial scenario, but I have created it in order to test the hypothesis. </p>

I agree with Mr Lilley and his fellow experts that if the operator is certain that what he is seeing is, for example, a crack, then he can reject the flaw forthwith without needing to seek an independent examination by a second operator.  Dr Morgan, in his reply report, appeared to suggest that an independent examination by a second operator was required in every case where the first operator thought that he had found a crack, irrespective of how confident he was about it. </p>

Fluor must have assumed that the E scans would pick up any relevant flaws.  With the benefit of hindsight, it can be seen that this request was inappropriate and its approval unwise.  Nevertheless, from a contractual point of view it left ZPMC free to choose whether it carried out UT before or after grinding.  If that had the consequence that cracks were missed that would otherwise have been detected, which is in fact what happened, that is a matter in respect of which of itself Fluor has no recourse against ZPMC.  As I have mentioned before, whether or not a particular circumferential weld was to be ground was a matter for the designer. It had nothing to do with any UT considerations. </p>

Such an interpretation does not fit with the terminology used in the standard.  In evidence, Fluor’s NDT expert, Mr Lilley, did not accept this. He said that if one read through the standard the word “method” was sometimes used to refer to the form of NDT but at other times it referred to the “<span style="font-style:italic">way in which NDT is applied, the technique</span>” (Day 16/71).  He may have had in mind the reference to “methods” in the last sentence of paragraph B 406; however, that seems to me to be using “methods” in the sense of the type of NDT.

The problem here is that, since the NDT requirement for the circumferential welds was already 100% UT, there was no scope for extending it using scanning pattern E.  In the case of repairs, there was a similar problem in that the extent of the UT required was only in the immediate area of the repair – so there was no scope for extending it. </p>

Suppose, for example, that ZPMC became concerned at the discovery of cracks in repairs to circumferential welds that were not being picked up by E scan.  It could then, in my view, increase the scanning by carrying out an additional D scan on, say, all welds that had been ground flush in order to confirm the findings of the E scan already carried out.  I can see no reason why that should not be considered an increase in the “extent” of the NDT since it would not involve changing the method or the agreed procedure.  Its only effect would be to override the concession granted by RFI 34.  I consider that that is what ZPMC should have done once it was apparent that D scans carried out by “<span style="font-style:italic">riding on the weld</span>” were discovering cracks that were not being revealed by E scanning. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">For these reasons, I consider that, in principle, it was not only open to ZPMC to increase the extent of the NDT by adding a requirement for D scans to be carried out in addition to E scans but also that, under paragraph 405, it was obliged to do so if that was necessary to ensure that “<span style="font-style:italic">all relevant defects are discovered in the areas of concern</span>”.  However, there is an important qualification: in this event the D scanning to be carried out would have to be in accordance with a technique laid down in the agreed written procedures.  Dr Morgan said that a contractor would require the customer’s consent to such a change if he was “<span style="font-style:italic">changing his process</span>” (Day 16/83); but, by implication in my opinion, an increase in the extent of the NDT that did not require a change to the agreed process would not require the consent of the customer.  Therefore, once it became apparent to the operators in branch company 3 that cracks could be discovered by “<span style="font-style:italic">riding on the weld</span>” that were not revealed by E scanning, they should have taken the immediate step of carrying out D scans to all ground welds (notwithstanding the concession confirmed by RFI 34) and at the same time raised the matter with higher levels of management within ZPMC.  Failure to do the former was a breach of paragraph 405 of the DNV standard and the latter a breach of ZPMC’s workmanship obligations under the PO. </p>

Fluor invites the court to draw the inference that not only did Mr Chu report the occurrence of cracking at the daily meetings, but also that he reported the fact that branch company 3 was finding those cracks by using D scans, not E scans.  Ms Ma was asked about this e-mail and whether she remembered Mr Chu raising the issue of transverse cracks on many occasions at the meetings. She said that maybe he had raised it “<span style="font-style:italic">but I don’t think so many times</span>” (Day 14/11).  She went on to say that she just had a vague memory of it which, seven years after the event, is hardly surprising. </p>

In his first witness statement Mr Estabrook said, at paragraph 40, that he was sure that ZPMC was only using E scans, at least after early December 2008; he said that he usually walked around the various welding shops “<span style="font-style:italic">more or less every day</span>” and would frequently see operators doing NDT, but that he now cannot remember what type of scanning they were doing.

The only possible explanations are either that D scans were not used very widely in branch company 3 or that the Fluor inspectors were not very thorough in checking what was going on or, possibly, a combination of both. </p>

On the basis of the evidence, it has not been shown that knowledge of this spread outside branch company 3 until early or mid May 2009, by which time it was known to Fluor also.  In the context of this project, I do not consider that the knowledge of Mr Chu, the Production and QC Manager of branch company 3, can be regarded as the knowledge of ZPMC.  In the organisation chart for the Wind Farm Project, which was attached to the witness statement of Ms Ma (attached as Appendix A), he appears at the lowest level of management - which was the production and QC management in each of the three branch companies.  On the Quality Assurance side, there were three intermediate levels of the hierarchy above this and below the level of Vice President. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">For these reasons I am not prepared to find that ZPMC as a company knew before May 2009 that many transverse defects in the circumferential welds could not be detected by E scanning - the agreed procedure - but only by “riding on the welds", that is to say by using a D scan procedure on welds that had not been ground flat. </p>

An obligation of good workmanship, or to ensure that the work will be carried out skilfully and carefully is not an obligation simply to take reasonable steps to ensure that such a standard of workmanship is achieved, but actually to achieve it.  A breach of good workmanship which remains unrectified is a breach of contract irrespective of the level in the corporate hierarchy at which it occurs.  Indeed, in a contract such as this one it is for the most part the fitters and welders who do the work contracted for, not the general managers and vice presidents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">I have already concluded that if ZPMC’s shop managers became aware of the occurrence of cracking that was not always being detected by E scanning, but which could be detected by D scanning, they should have reported this up the line.  In my view this would at least have required ZPMC to bring the matter to the attention of Fluor and, probably, to submit a proposal for the adoption of a different method of NDT or, alternatively, different UT procedures so as to identify the cracks.  In this context I agree with Mr Li that if the production or QC management in branch company 3 knew that the NDT testing procedure that they were having to adopt in order to detect cracking was not in accordance with the agreed procedures, and if they knew that the other two branch companies were not using such scanning method, they should have raised the matter with their superior management.  If that had happened, it would have been the duty of the superior management to raise the matter with Fluor and, as I have already found, to submit an appropriate proposal for the modification of either the procedures or the methods of NDT.  I consider that a failure to do so would have been a breach of ZPMC’s workmanship obligations under the PO. </p>

Accordingly, it should have reported this to senior management within ZPMC and the failure to do so, or to do so in a manner that ensured that the point was understood, was a breach of ZPMC’s workmanship obligations under the PO. </p>

Gouging was arranged and MT testing will be performed tomorrow. I really could not stop them doing the gouging. Zhu Youngjun and Fang Min wanted to do gouging and grinding themselves. In the end nothing could be done so Meng Guangdong and Li Yujun had to bring the gouging gun. After gouging, Fang Min did the grinding by himself. I will pay more attention to this in the future. I heard that Big Changxing did not even allow supervising engineer to perform spot check. Please find the daily pass rate in the Daily UT tracking record for the UK Wind Farm Project. </span>

However, no material has been put before the court that suggests that Mr Yuan might have had any reason to be untruthful.  However, I bear in mind that the language used by ZPMC employees in messages of this sort can sometimes be a little over dramatic. For example, whilst this e-mail might give the impression that Mr Fang might have done both the gouging and the grinding, I am quite satisfied that he did not do any gouging.  Gouging needs special training, whereas grinding - using what in this country is called an angle grinder - is an operation that can be carried out by anyone with a sufficiently steady hand, particularly if the machine being used is relatively small, which was probably the case here given the nature of the operation.  Mr Fang described the machine used by ZPMC as a “sand wheel machine” (Day 19/68).  That sounds to me like an angle grinder.</p>

In response to the witness statement served by Mr Yuan, Fluor held a telephone call with Mr Fang.  A Mr Tom Smith, of Hogan Lovells, participated in the call with Mr Hans Ho, of Fluor, acting as an interpreter. The call took place on 3 March 2016.  According to Mr Smith’s note of the call, the accuracy of which I have no reason to doubt, Mr Fang said that he had been a team leader of the night shift at Small Changxing from January 2009 to April 2009 (however, this was contradicted in evidence when he said that the nightshift did not have a separate team leader because it reported to the leader of the day shift: Day 19/43). His primary work in January 2009 was working on the transition pieces. His role was to oversee the visual inspection of the welding processes in order to ensure that ZPMC’s work followed the proper procedures. He said that he did not work alongside Mr Zhou, because he led the day shift.  He said that he had no involvement with NDT inspection, although he was qualified in China to Level II.  He said that although the name of Mr Yuan Zhiyong sounded familiar, he had no clear memory of him. </p>

These show that on 8 January 2009 weld 12 was inspected by ZPMC using what seems to have been E scanning (with beam angles of approximately 45°, 60° and 70°) and seven defects were found, all of which were described as slag defects.  These were therefore rejected.  On 20 January 2009 the same points along the weld were re-examined using the same method and were recorded as acceptable.  The latter examination described the welds as being both FCAW and SAW, which appears to confirm that they were repairs.  That report was countersigned two days later. </p>

If the welds were re-inspected on 20 January 2009 following ZPMC’s earlier inspection that day and cracks were then found, it becomes difficult to see how ZPMC could have signed off the report two days later as it appears to have done.  The e-mail does not say that Mr Fang and Mr Zhou found the transverse cracks: rather, the fact that they were mentioned by name whereas the “Supervising Engineer” was referred to only by title, tends to suggest that they were not the same people. </p>

I do not find it unlikely that they would have put pressure on ZPMC to carry out the excavations of the welds straightaway, if necessary by threatening to do it themselves.  Again, I see no reason why Mr Yuan should have made up the allegation that Mr Fang did the grinding if it was in fact untrue.  For Mr Fang to do this might not have accorded with the procedures, but I find it hard to see how he could be criticised for his eagerness to discover the nature of the defects.

For example, when asked what would have been re-inspected, he replied “<span style="font-style:italic">the repair spot</span>”.  When it was then suggested to him that those carrying out the re-inspection would not have known where the real defect was - because it had been falsely marked - he said that the entire circumference was re-inspected and the true repair spot was then found (Day 14/121).  But of course this would only have happened if the team carrying out the re-inspection had been told that the mark indicating the crack was in the wrong place, which would defeat the point of marking a false location in the first place. </p>

I reject both aspects of this submission.  First, knowledge of some transverse cracks in two circumferential welds on one occasion would not, in my view, be expected to put an independent testing contractor on notice that there was a widespread problem with such cracking throughout the site.

Fluor asserts that ZPMC’s decision “<span style="font-style:italic">to repair transverse cracks</span>” without informing Fluor and obtaining their prior approval was a breach of this clause (see paragraph 682 of Fluor’s closing submissions).  I have heard no evidence as to what is meant by the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">major or delayed cracks</span>”: however, it seems to me that it refers either to individual cracks that are major or to cracking that is delayed.  But this is not a case about major cracks, it is about a very large number of small cracks.  It is also not a case about delayed cracks, which I take to mean cracks that would not be in existence at the time when NDT is carried out 48 hours after completion of the relevant welding.  If cracks formed within 48 hours of welding, then in principle they should be detected by the contractual NDT procedures and so there would be no need for any specific provision in the code.  In the absence of any evidence that clause 5.26.3 bears some different meaning, I consider that it does not apply to the facts of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">Clause 5.4 of the agreed Weld Repair Procedure, which formed part of the Quality Control Plan, provided that ZPMC was not to attempt to repair any longitudinal or transverse cracks until a thorough investigation had been conducted and approval to repair had been obtained from Fluor.  This seems fairly unambiguous and, in particular, it is not limited to cracks of any particular magnitude. </p>

This provided that Fluor’s inspectors (SQS) were entitled to witness some types of operation and so ZPMC had to give them notice when that operation was to take place. If the SQS representative did not appear, then the operation could proceed.  However, other types of operation were ones that were not only to be witnessed by Fluor’s SQS, who had to be given 1 days’ notice, but also could not go ahead without being witnessed.  These were designated W/H (“witness hold”).  Weld repairs other than to cracks were designated M, meaning that they had to be monitored, but crack repairs were designated W/H. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">On 28 May 2009, two relevant events occurred.  First, Fluor decided to perform a 100% re-test of all circumferential welds in Shipment No 3. This followed further testing on Shipment No 3 during which Fluor found an increasing number of transverse cracks in welds that had passed the ZPMC QC process. Having increased its QA testing to 20%, Fluor found even more transverse cracks.  Fluor then decided to increase this to 100%. </p>

Mr Hovermale said that this was testing that Fluor had tried very hard to avoid.  However, when Mr Dekker asked Mr Hovermale whether they had found transverse cracking at Vlissingen, Mr Hovermale passed the enquiry on to Mr Hardie.  Mr Hardie’s immediate reply was “<span style="font-style:italic">No we have not</span>” and, two days later, in an e-mail to Mr Hovermale of 31 May 2009, he said: </p>

According to an e-mail sent by Mr Ho the day after the meeting, Mr Guan said that ZPMC would accept “some responsibility” for weld defects and, in particular, would assume responsibility for repairing them. ZPMC’s notes of the meeting record ZPMC as saying that it would “<span style="font-style:italic">take the responsibility entirely</span>” for repairing defects in the welding.  ZPMC stated expressly that it would not be liable for indirect or consequential damages, including the cost of engaging other contractors to carry out repairs.

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">. The Employer Required NDT and Remediation presently being conducted on MPs and TPs by Fluor and ZMPC (sic) at the Vlissingen Staging Port will, therefore, cease, and Fluor will proceed immediately to install the MPs presently available, likely beginning with those in Shipment 3 and will also proceed immediately with fit-out of the TPs to prepare them for the earliest possible installation. Moreover, Fluor will henceforth strictly enforce its contractual right to restrict the Employer’s testing on welds in the MPs and TPs to the ZMPC (sic) facility in Shanghai, and no such testing will be permitted at the Vlissingen Staging Port. After very careful consideration, Fluor is confident that, by proceeding in this manner, it is not only satisfying all applicable code requirements and mitigating the damages and delays that are being incurred, but it is also fully and completely discharging its contractual duty to execute the work in the “manner specified in the Contract” and “in a proper workmanlike and careful manner, in accordance with Good and Prudent Practice. </span>

All those efforts, however, have been - and will continue to be - without prejudice to and with a complete reservation of Fluor’s rights to recover all resulting direct and indirect costs, which rights Fluor intends to pursue. </span>

The account of this meeting in Mr Cao’s witness statement appears to be based on the Pinsent Masons translation rather than the Merrill Brink translation.  He explained that he placed a tick at the end of points 1, 1.2, 2, 5 and 6, because these were points to which ZPMC had indicated at the meeting it would agree.  He said that the tick against point 1.2 indicated that ZPMC had agreed to improve the storage, use and preheating of weld materials. </p>

If Fluor was really saying that it would make no claim against ZPMC for any welding defects that might become apparent in the future, that would empty the warranty of most of its content: since welding defects would be one of the most likely causes of any pile failure within 25 years, Fluor could well be prevented from making a claim under the warranty if future claims in respect of welding defects had been waived in their entirety. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In my view the discussions between the parties at this point were focused principally on the very substantial costs that each of them had incurred as a result of the NDT regime imposed by GGOWL and GGOWL’s insistence that all cracks found on examination were repaired.  However, both Fluor and ZPMC must have had cause to consider why the cracks were there in the first place and whether or not their existence was the result of a breach of contract by ZPMC (and, in consequence, a breach by Fluor of its contract with GGOWL). The fact that in earlier discussions </p>

The early reference in Mr Fuller’s note to focusing on “<span style="font-style:italic">preheat and handling of flux</span>” is, I find, a recognition of the fact that there were still concerns about the quality of the workmanship in Changxing.

I consider that the parties were concerned to reach agreement in principle, and that the finer points - such as the precise extent of any waiver - were to be left to the drafting.  However, on any view it appears to have been the common intention that Fluor would not seek to hold ZPMC responsible for the costs occasioned by the “<span style="font-style:italic">extra contractual testing</span>” imposed by GGOWL, but would instead join forces with ZPMC in order to recover those costs from GGOWL. </p>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">As a result of the Non Conforming Reports (“NCRs”) issued by the Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Ltd (“GGOWL” or the “Employer”) with respect to certain welds in the mono piles on Shipment Nos. 1, 2, and 3, there has been much confusion regarding the appropriate Non-Destructive Testing (“NDT”) and the subsequent repair of any defects found in the welds, and, unfortunately, that has in turn caused much disruption and delay to this Project. This letter is an attempt to address that issue so that you will have a better appreciation of Fluor’s actions in this regard and to finally put to rest questions concerning this problem. As you know, any deficiencies that were discovered in ZPMC’s welding procedures with respect to the MPs and TPs have been and continue to be addressed by your QC personnel and our QA staff.  We have always expected ZPMC to follow acceptable and appropriate welding procedures regardless of what requirements GGOWL imposes or attempts to impose on the welding process, and that expectation remains in full force and effect. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">The NCR with respect to Shipment No. 1 was not issued by GGOWL until that shipment reached Vlissingen and was inspected and tested by GGOWL there, even though GGOWL had done NDT on the MP welds while they were still at ZPMC’s facility in Shanghai.  In an attempt to satisfy the Employer’s demands, Fluor agreed, under protest and with a complete reservation of its rights, to adopt an NDT procedure being required by the Employer, even though that procedure required ultrasound testing with a different scan pattern and at a higher sensitivity than that required by Fluor’s Contract with the Employer, the applicable welding codes incorporated therein, and Fluor’s Inspection and Test Plan (“IT&amp;P”). That Employer Required NDT and Remediation required an extraordinary undertaking at the Vlissingen Staging Port, including the establishment and maintenance of a vast infrastructure to support the testing and repair work, as well as, of course, the transfer of some one  hundred fifty ZPMC tradesmen to the Vlissingen Staging Port to perform that work. </span>

We know you share our conclusions in this regard and look forward to having your assistance in that effort with the Employer. I believe that, going forward, the best approach is for ZPMC and Fluor to work together in an effort to ensure that all the welding of the MPs and TPs, which remains to be completed, is performed in the appropriate standards of quality so as to eliminate any issue in that regard. We look forward to having your cooperation.” </span>

First, that “deficiencies” had been discovered in ZPMC’s welding procedures and that these continued to be addressed by ZPMC’s QC staff and Fluor’s QA staff.   Second, that it was the NCRs issued by GGOWL that had caused much “<span style="font-style:italic">delay and disruption</span>” to the project and the NDT procedure required by GGOWL that was responsible for the “<span style="font-style:italic">extraordinary undertaking at Vlissingen</span>"; it was not an independent need to repair cracks in the welds.

The only evidence that it took place comes from Mr Liu, who said that he was present. He said in his witness statement that it took place on a cold winter morning at the hotel where Mr Dobbs was staying in Puxi, Shanghai.  He was there to translate.  In evidence, he said that he thought the meeting was arranged at very short notice at a time when Mr Dobbs was passing through Shanghai. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In his witness statement he said that Mr Dobbs made it clear to Mr Guan at the meeting that for there to be no issues and claims between the parties the issue of the 25 year warranty would have to be resolved.  Whilst Mr Guan was quite prepared to give a 25 year warranty for both the MPs and the TPs, he could not agree to Mr Dobbs’s demand that it should be supported by a bank guarantee. Mr Liu said that Mr Dobbs made it plain that if ZPMC were to provide a 25 year warranty supported by a bank guarantee, there would no longer be any issues and claims between them and ZPMC would help Fluor in preparing information and documents to support the claim against GGOWL. He thought that Mr Dobbs was genuinely keen to reach a settlement with Mr Guan in order to avoid a dispute between Fluor and ZPMC - not only because he clearly valued the business relationship between the two companies, but also because of his personal relationship with Mr Guan. </p>

However, in the absence of any contemporaneous note I am somewhat sceptical about the reliability of Mr Liu’s recollection of precisely what was said by either Mr Dobbs or Mr Guan.  I think that it is more likely that, having read what had been said at the earlier meetings, he is remembering that which he would have expected to have been said, rather than what was actually said: however, his account of what happened is plausible and is entirely consistent with what had been said at previous meetings.  To the extent that his recollection is reliable, I regard it as important that Mr Liu remembers Mr Dobbs as having said that the proposed terms would have to be reduced to writing.  By that he must have meant that this would have to be done before any agreement could be finalised.  That is, of course, what happened. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">If one pauses at this point, it is abundantly clear that no agreement was reached at this meeting.  Whilst ZPMC had indicated that it was willing to give a 25 year warranty, Fluor was still demanding that it be supported by a bank guarantee - something that Mr Guan was not prepared to offer - and no agreement had been reached as to any alternative form of security for it.  According to Mr Liu’s account Mr Guan said that he would see whether ZPMC’s parent company would provide a guarantee in lieu of a bank guarantee.  From the account in Mr Liu’s witness statement, there is no suggestion that Mr Dobbs had indicated that a parent company guarantee, if available, would satisfy Fluor: on the contrary what Mr Dobbs was seeking was a bank guarantee.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">There was then an important event. On 7 December 2009, and with little advance warning, Mr Guan retired as the president of ZPMC.  He was replaced by Mr Kang Xuezeng.  Appreciating the importance of the relationship between ZPMC and Fluor, Mr Kang took the opportunity to visit Mr Dobbs at Fluor’s headquarters in Dallas the following month. This visit took place on 20 January 2010.  At this time, the other major project that ZPMC shared with Fluor was the steelwork for the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge (“SFOBB”). In his witness statement Mr Kang said that the discussions in Dallas were mainly about exploring business opportunities, rather than the two current projects.  He said that whilst there were some discussions about progress on the SFOBB project, the Greater Gabbard project was mentioned only in passing.  Perhaps rather surprisingly, Mr Kang said that at that time he was unaware of the problem with cracking in the welds of the monopiles.  He was not briefed about this until after his return. He was then given to understand that there was a proposal that each party should give up its claims against other, that Fluor would pursue GGOWL on behalf of both itself and ZPMC and that ZPMC was to provide a 25 year warranty for the monopiles and the transition pieces.  Mr Kang understood that the only outstanding issue was the provision of a bank guarantee to support the warranty. </p>

This meeting took the form of a dinner and drinks on 2 February 2010 in Beijing.  At that time Mr Kang was more concerned with problems on the SFOBB project and he had decided not to reopen any of the discussions on the Greater Gabbard project.  Mr Dobbs was taken to the meeting by Mr Liu and on the way Mr Dobbs asked Mr Liu if he thought that Mr Kang would stand by the agreement that had been reached in outline with Mr Guan. Mr Liu said that he had already obtained Mr Kang’s assurance that he would stand by any undertakings given by Mr Guan, but in order to reassure Mr Dobbs he telephoned Mr Kang who confirmed the position. </p>

An original draft in English dated 19 April 2010 gave the NCR numbers (in numbered paragraph 3) as 006, 007 and 008, and not, as they should have been, 006, 008 and 009.  Curiously, the Chinese translation dated 19 April 2010, that was given to ZPMC at the meeting on 20 April 2010, has the correct numbers throughout. However, nothing turns on this.  The passages that are struck out were in the version handed over at the meeting on 20 April 2010 but were deleted in the revised version of the letter that was signed on 30 January 2012. The passages in square brackets were added at the same time.  </p>

Mr Fuller’s speaking note records that each of ZPMC and Fluor were agreeing “<span style="font-style:italic">not to submit any claim against</span>” the other.  However, taken literally this is obviously not correct because it has never been either party’s case that Fluor and ZPMC intended to settle all claims against each other whether or not connected with the welding defects that were discovered at Vlissingen and Shanghai in the summer of 2009.  For the reasons that I have already given, apart from anything else, there would be little point obtaining a warranty from ZPMC if Fluor was agreeing not to make a claim under it.  This suggests that these notes were a prompt of the points that he had to cover, rather than an attempt to explain the individual paragraphs in the letter. </p>

As subsequent events demonstrated, Mr Gao had a different understanding from others within ZPMC as to the extent of the waiver of claims by Fluor.  He had attended the meetings on 30 September, 1 and 2 October 2009 and said in his first witness statement (at paragraph 2.9) that it was very clear to both parties that “<span style="font-style:italic">we were talking about claims relating to the weld cracks problem in shipments 1 to 3</span>”. </p>

In a letter to Mr Kang, dated 21 February 2011, Mr Gao said that ZPMC could not accept the deductions proposed by Fluor (apart from that in relation to the weight of the steel) because the agreement reached between ZPMC and Fluor at an earlier stage was that both Fluor and ZPMC would “<span style="font-style:italic">bear their own part of the cost, respectively</span>”, whereas Fluor was saying that this cost was merely limited to the cost relating to the welding repair.   </p>

		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:-0.50in"> One memorable example of this occurred when one of ZPMC's witnesses, Mr Guan, gave an answer that clearly surprised and alarmed the bilingual members of ZPMC's team who were in court. It turned out that the source of the problem was that in the course of the interpretation the same Chinese word was used for the English word "projects" and the English word "items".  In the course of the questioning, when translating the answer, the translator used the English word "projects" in a context when it was said that the witness must clearly have meant "items" (Day 10/63-64, 69).  </p>
	      </authorialNote> That is something that the Court can seldom discover.  In the circumstances it seems to me that the most important feature of the meeting is not so much what was said (or was thought to have been said) but that ZPMC was provided with copies of the letters and was given time to consider them at its leisure. </p>

So far as the waiver letter is concerned, the only amendment, in addition to the correction of the erroneous NCR numbers, was the addition of the following words to paragraph 5c: “If the costs exceed the award, such difference shall be borne by Fluor”.

The second was that the words “and indirect” were deleted so that the warranty was limited to direct damages only resulting from any structural failure of the MPs or TPs.  However, again I do not think that these affect the discussions that took place on 20 April 2010. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In January 2012 some amendments were made to the waiver letter, principally concerning the form of the assignment.  The revised version of the letter was presented to Mr Kang with the explanation that Fluor had said that the English version of the letter was slightly inconsistent with the Chinese translation provided at the time. Accordingly, Fluor said that it had retranslated the letter so that it accorded with the Chinese version.  Neither party relied on these amendments in themselves, but I have included them in the version of the letter set out above.  The point of significance, relied on by Fluor, is that ZPMC was still prepared to sign the letter, which it did on 30 January 2012 in spite of having received Fluor’s letter of 14 October 2011 (see paragraph 509 and 510 below). </p>

Thus, by this assignment, ZPMC was irrevocably forgoing any right to claim these costs from Fluor in the future.  The costs in question were those consequent upon acts or omissions of GGOWL.

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:1.58in;margin-right:0.08in">Thus there was a potentially important distinction between the waiver letter and the discussions that had preceded it. The waiver letter was concerned with claims for a certain category of costs.  By contrast, the previous discussions - at least according to ZPMC’s account - concerned the mutual waiver of claims arising from a particular cause of action, namely defective welding.  However, as already discussed, an unqualified waiver of claims in relation to welding defects could well deprive the warranty of any content, since the most likely cause of any failure of the unrepaired MPs and TPs would be defects in the welding. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:1.58in;margin-right:0.08in">So, whatever ZPMC may have thought, a blanket waiver of all claims past or future in relation to welding defects was inconsistent with the undertaking to give a warranty in relation to the life of the piles.  Viewed objectively, that cannot have been the honest intention of either party.  Accordingly, if there was to be a waiver of claims in respect of welding defects it had to be limited in some way so that it would not undermine the warranty.  I anticipate that this point might have been appreciated by Fluor’s lawyers who therefore made the waiver referable to categories of costs rather than to a cause of action, but whether or not that was in fact the case does not matter. </p>

	      </authorialNote>  If that could have been the subject of any doubt, it is made clear in the warranty letter.

That was the basis that underlay the agreement set out in the waiver letter.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">It seems to me that the relevant passage in this report is the one that I have underlined, which refers to Fluor’s intention to claim against ZPMC for the losses “<span style="font-style:italic">they suffered from this</span>” if ZPMC does not provide the requested guarantee.  The difficulty is understanding what is meant by “<span style="font-style:italic">this</span>”.  It appears to refer back to the reference to the losses in relation to delay referred to earlier in the same paragraph.  This does not really assist ZPMC: on the contrary, it appears to suggest that the losses that Fluor was agreeing not to pursue were losses in respect of delay caused by the dispute relating to the crack issue.  However, the members of the board were provided with the two letters and had the opportunity to read them for themselves. </p>

By contrast, Mr Liu said that an agreement to waive claims was not something that required approval from the board.  I therefore reject Fluor’s submission that ZPMC’s estoppel claim must fail because the board was not aware of any common assumptions that might have been relevant to a consideration of the waiver letter. </p>

Fluor’s case now, which is directly contrary to the case put forward in the arbitration, is that the actions that it took in relation to the discovery of the cracking at Vlissingen had nothing to do with the issue of the NCRs by GGOWL, but were caused by its own belief that cracking in welds such as these was unacceptable and that accordingly all the cracks should be discovered and repaired. </p>

The first concerns the true construction of the waiver letter and whether or not it is to be read in the manner contended for by Fluor. The second, which only arises if Fluor is right on its construction of the letter, is whether or not some or all of the losses in respect of which it claims were the result of the NCRs or the result of its own independent decision to carry out the testing and repairs that were in fact done.  The third issue is whether Fluor is estopped from relying on its construction of the letter. I shall deal with the first issue in this part of the judgment and the other two issues separately. </p>

The point made by ZPMC is that whether or not the buyer thinks that the goods are fit for their purpose is irrelevant: either they are or they are not.

This is only carrying out the will of the parties. The only meaning of adjusting a formal contract is, that the formal contract shall supersede all loose and preliminary negotiations - that there shall be no room for misunderstandings which may often arise, and which do constantly arise, in the course of long, and it may be desultory conversations, or in the course of correspondence or negotiations during which the parties are often widely at issue as to what they will insist on and what they will concede. The very purpose of a formal contract is to put an end to the disputes which would inevitably arise if the matter were left upon verbal negotiations or upon mixed communings partly consisting of letters and partly of conversations. The written contract is that which is to be appealed to by both parties, however different it may be from their previous demands or stipulations, whether contained in letters or in verbal conversation. There can be no doubt that this is the general rule, and I think the general rule, strictly and with peculiar appropriateness applies to the present case.” </span>

But pre-contractual negotiations seem to me capable of raising practical questions different from those created by other forms of background. Whereas the surrounding circumstances are, by definition, objective facts, which will usually be uncontroversial, statements in the course of precontractual negotiations will be drenched in subjectivity and may, if oral, be very much in dispute. It is often not easy to distinguish between those statements which (if they were made at all) merely reflect the aspirations of one or other of the parties and those which embody at least a provisional consensus which may throw light on the meaning of the contract which was eventually concluded. But the imprecision of the line between negotiation and provisional agreement is the very reason why in every case of dispute over interpretation, one or other of the parties is likely to require a court or arbitrator to take the course of negotiations into account.

Such a person would not have been privy to the negotiations and may have taken the terms of the contract at face value. There is clearly strength in this argument, but it is fair to say that the same point can be made (and has been made, notably by Saville LJ in </span>

Ordinarily, however, a contract is treated as addressed to the parties alone and an assignee must either inquire as to any relevant background or take his chance on how that might affect the meaning a court will give to the document. The law has sometimes to compromise between protecting the interests of the contracting parties and those of third parties. But an extension of the admissible background will, at any rate in theory, increase the risk that a third party will find that the contract does not mean what he thought. How often this is likely to be a practical problem is hard to say. In the present case, the construction of the agreement does not involve reliance upon any background which would not have been equally available to any prospective assignee or lender.  </span>

The rule may well mean, as Lord Nicholls has argued, that parties are sometimes held bound by a contract in terms which, upon a full investigation of the course of negotiations, a reasonable observer would not have taken them to have intended. But a system which sometimes allows this to happen may be justified in the more general interest of economy and predictability in obtaining advice and adjudicating disputes. It is, after all, usually possible to avoid surprises by carefully reading the documents before signing them and there are the safety nets of rectification and estoppel by convention. Your Lordships do not have the material on which to form a view. It is possible that empirical study (for example, by the Law Commission) may show that the alleged disadvantages of admissibility are not in practice very significant or that they are outweighed by the advantages of doing more precise justice in exceptional cases or falling into line with international conventions. But the determination of where the balance of advantage lies is not in my opinion suitable for judicial decision. Your Lordships are being asked to depart from a rule which has been in existence for many years and several times affirmed by the House. There is power to do so under the Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966] 1 WLR 1234. But that power was intended, as Lord Reid said in </span>

The exercise of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable reader, and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties have control over the language they use in a contract. And, again save perhaps in a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision. </span>

That is simply the obverse of the sensible proposition that the clearer the natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify departing from it. However, that does not justify the court embarking on an exercise of searching for, let alone constructing, drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural meaning.

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">Fourthly, while commercial common sense is a very important factor to take into account when interpreting a contract, a court should be very slow to reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight. The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice. Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party. </span>

The construct is not there to re-write the parties' agreement because it was unwise to gamble on future economic circumstances in a long term contract or because subsequent events have shown that the natural meaning of the words has produced a bad bargain for one side. The question for the court is not whether a reasonable and properly informed tenant would enter into such an undertaking.

So, whilst it may be that, in one sense, the enhanced testing of Shipment No 2 was prompted by the issue of NCR 006 - in that Fluor feared a repetition in the case of the second shipment also, the fact is that NCR 006 was expressly limited to the “1st shipment”.   Fluor could not have made a claim against GGOWL on the basis that NCR 006 constituted an instruction to carry out enhanced testing and remediation in relation to Shipment No 2 for the simple reason that it was not such an instruction. </p>

The costs that Fluor incurred in relation to additional testing and repair of Shipment No 3 prior to 7 August 2009 - whether in Shanghai or Vlissingen - can, subject to any estoppel, form the subject of a claim against ZPMC. </p>

There was never any suggestion by Fluor - at that meeting or subsequently - that its offer to waive these costs was dependent on its own belief as to the true reason for carrying out the extra contractual testing: or, to put it another way, that if Fluor would have implemented the extra contractual testing irrespective of anything said or done by GGOWL, then the waiver would not apply. </p>

As it happens, I have already found that, in relation to Shipment Nos 1 and 3 all, or almost all, of the extra contractual testing and remedial work to the MPs was, as a matter of fact, the result of the issue of the NCR and not of any independent decision by Fluor.   </p>

In my view, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked to prevent Fluor from asserting, correctly I find as a matter of fact, that the extra contractual testing for that shipment that was carried out until 29 July 2009 was not the result of the issue of an NCR.  By contrast, Fluor is in my view estopped from contending that the extra contractual testing required by NCR 008 that it carried out on Shipment No 2 after 29 July 2009 was not caused by NCR 008.  </p>

I have heard no evidence as to the extent, if at all, to which any of the NCRs required, either expressly or by implication, testing or repair of TPs.

It was not until a responsive submission by Fluor dated 27 June 2016 that it was asserted that “<span style="font-style:italic">the NCRs did not extend to the TPs</span>”.  In response, ZPMC said in a submission dated 8 July 2016 that no distinction had been drawn by the parties between the costs referable to the MP defects as opposed to the TP defects, and that no one had ever suggested that any distinction should be drawn when construing the waiver and warranty letters.
