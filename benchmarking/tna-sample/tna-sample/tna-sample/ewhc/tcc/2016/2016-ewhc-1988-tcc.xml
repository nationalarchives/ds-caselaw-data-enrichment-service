	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">These proceedings concern the procurement of a very sizeable contract for the decommissioning of 12 different Magnox nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom. The proceedings consist of three claims, each commenced by the entity that was then called Energy<span style="font-style:italic">Solutions </span>EU Limited (now called Atk Energy EU Limited) as Claimant (“Energy Solutions”) against the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (“NDA”). All three claims concern the same procurement exercise, and have been case-managed and tried together. The NDA is an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body established under the Energy Act 2004, responsible to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. It is tasked with overseeing the clean-up and decommissioning of a number of the United Kingdom’s civil public sector nuclear sites, installations and facilities. The NDA has responsibility for 17 different sites, and the associated civil nuclear assets and liabilities that were formerly owned by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (“BNFL”). All three of the claims issued by Energy Solutions arise out of the same public procurement competition, namely one undertaken by the NDA for the award of a contract central to the decommissioning of 12 of these former nuclear sites. The contract the subject of the procurement was called a Transition Agreement. Assuming certain conditions precedent were complied with, a successful tenderer who was awarded the Transition Agreement would then be awarded another contract called the Parent Body Agreement (or “PBA”) about six months after award of the Transition Agreement. The 12 sites in question are the ten nuclear power stations that are called “Magnox” power stations, namely Berkeley, Bradwell, Chapelcross, Dungeness A, Hinkley Point A, Hunterston A, Oldbury, Sizewell A, Trawsfynydd and Wylfa, together with two other sites. These latter two sites, namely those at Harwell and Winfrith, are (or were) nuclear research sites, and not power stations, although one of the reactors at Winfrith did produce some electricity which was supplied to the National Grid for a time. The two research sites both had nuclear reactors. Magnox is the name for a particular type of nuclear reactor which was designed in the UK; these nuclear power plants were built in the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the Magnox reactors were exported abroad but are not relevant for the purposes of these proceedings. Magnox reactors are older nuclear technology and are no longer used in the United Kingdom, although one of the nuclear reactors at Wylfa in Anglesey was operational at the time of the procurement. The other sites were no longer operational by then. The term “Magnox” is taken from the magnesium-aluminium alloy used to clad the fuel rods used by the reactor. Magnox is also the name used for various entities that were previously responsible for the Magnox sites, which is explained further below. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The Contents of this judgment, which is in a number of different parts, are as follows below. There are also five appendices, Appendix 1 being a glossary. Appendix 2 is a graphic. Confidential Appendix 3 contains judgment narrative and findings on the allegations that concern the successful bidder, CFP, and hence material already protected by an existing confidentiality order. This Appendix falls within the wider of the two Confidentiality Rings, namely that which currently includes not only the legal representatives acting for Energy Solutions, but also Mr Bowes and Mr Board, the two employees (now former employees) of Energy Solutions permitted to see certain parts of the CFP bid documents. Appendix 4 contains a summary of the scores that were awarded by the NDA in the evaluation, together with a summary of the adjusted scores for some of the Requirements as a result of findings within this judgment. Confidential Appendix 5 contains salary and bonus details for some of the Energy Solutions’ witnesses. These details only became relevant during the NDA’s application to dismiss the whole claim at the very end of the trial, in the circumstances explained in Part V of the judgment. The application itself is dealt with in Part XI of the judgment. I do not consider that this judgment needs to make available publicly these personal salary details, which is why they appear in an appendix. Neither Appendix 3 nor Appendix 5 will be made available on www.bailii.org.<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span><br/></p>

In broad outline terms, the Claimant was part of a consortium with another company, Bechtel Management Company Ltd (“Bechtel”), which submitted a tender to the NDA for the Transition Agreement. Initially there had been a third member involved with Bechtel and Energy Solutions, URS International Holdings (UK) Ltd, as well. URS withdrew from the procurement prior to the submission of the tender, and following this withdrawal Bechtel and Energy Solutions formed a consortium called Reactor Site Solutions (“RSS”) for the purposes of the procurement.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">That consortium was unsuccessful in the procurement process. The purpose of the procurement was for the NDA to award a contract to the successful tenderer, who would then become what was known as the parent body organisation (“PBO”) for two separate Site Licence Companies (“SLCs”). The intention was for the PBO to acquire the two then-existing SLCs by way of transfer of shares in those companies to the PBO. The two SLCs in existence at the time of the procurement were called Magnox Ltd (“Magnox”) and Research Sites Restoration Ltd (“RSRL”). Energy Solutions was the incumbent PBO at the time of the procurement for Magnox, which as the name suggests, was the SLC for, and managed and operated, the ten Magnox power stations (but not the two research sites). Energy Solutions had become the incumbent PBO for Magnox by means of the commercial acquisition of a subsidiary of BNFL in 2007. RSRL managed and operated the two research sites of Harwell and Winfrith. The two research sites were, at the time of the procurement, essentially under separate control, and contained within a separate SLC, from the ten Magnox sites. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The outcome of the tender process was that the NDA awarded the contract for the PBO for the two SLCs to another consortium (at the start of the Competition this consortium had been called the Babcock Fluor Partnership and had as its members Babcock Nuclear Services Limited and Fluor Enterprises Inc. This consortium changed its name after Babcock rebranded its nuclear services division as Cavendish Nuclear). I will refer to it as CFP throughout this judgment for convenience. Following the detailed evaluation exercise, the overall scores given to the two different tenderers were 86.48% to CFP and 85.42% to RSS. The difference between them was therefore 1.06%, which is a very small margin. It can therefore be seen that the outcome of the procurement, as conducted at the time, was very close indeed. The tender procurement process took place between 2012 and 2014. The maximum duration of the contract was to be approximately 14 years, and the NDA’s funding limit for the first seven years of the contract period was stated to be in the region of approximately £4.211 billion. It was a very complicated and technical procurement process, of what is evidently very complicated and technical subject matter, namely the decommissioning of multiple nuclear facilities across a large number of sites. It also, again evidently, was a procurement for a contract that involved very considerable sums of public money </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">and was of some public importance. All public procurement exercises are important, and governed by regulations requiring fairness and equal treatment. There is obviously a scale with, at one end, relatively small value contracts for limited periods of time being awarded by local authorities for services of limited scope. At the other end of the scale are very large value contracts for very important services over a considerable period of time. The same legal principles and regulations apply to both. The NDA, in its submissions, relies on the scale, value and importance of the procurement as having a particular effect or effects upon my consideration of principle. I will deal with those points in detail below. It is otiose to debate whether procurement exercises at either end of the scale are more important than those at the other. However, it could be said that it would be difficult to envisage many cases more at, or towards, the extreme upper financial end of the scale, or involving greater amounts of public funds, than this one. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The Procurement was initiated by way of publication on 18 July 2012 of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union published under the number 2012/S 136-227570 (the "OJEU Notice") {L/2/1}. This was the formal commencement of the process. The competitive dialogue procedure was used. This is one where an authority’s requirements are not fully defined at the beginning of the process. On 31 March 2014, Energy Solutions was notified by the NDA that it had been unsuccessful. In the period between those two dates, the consortia involved in the procurement procedure expended considerable time and large sums of money in seeking to win the contract award. The NDA also expended considerable time and doubtless large sums of money in developing the procurement, engaging in the dialogue process with the potential bidders, evaluating the tenders and deciding which consortium was to succeed in achieving the contract award. Energy Solutions has stated that it expended approximately £10 million in the tender process, and stood to earn approximately £100 million in fees had it been successful. There are different forms of relief available to an aggrieved bidder who challenges a procurement exercise as being unlawful. In this case, proceedings were not issued within the time required to trigger an automatic suspension of the contract award. Accordingly, the NDA and CFP entered into the Transition Agreement untroubled by any automatic suspension, and Energy Solutions claims damages in these proceedings. This judgment does not deal with the quantum of damages, but those claimed by Energy Solutions are said to be in the region of approximately £100 million. </p>

Upon analysis, Energy Solutions decided that there had been various breaches by the NDA of its obligations under the regulations that govern such procurement processes, namely the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No.5) (“the Regulations”) {AB/4/1}. It is agreed that these Public Contracts Regulations 2006 are the relevant ones that apply to the procurement in question in these proceedings. They implement the provisions of Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 (“the Directive”) {AB/2/1} and Council Directive 89/665/EEC, as amended by Directive 2007/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 (“the Remedies Directive”) {AB/1/1}. </p>

Bechtel therefore was not involved in these proceedings, which were issued by Energy Solutions alone, and Bechtel has consequently taken no part in them. However, that is not relevant to the claims as Energy Solutions, as a member of a consortium, is entitled to bring proceedings individually. This is because pursuant to Regulation 28(4), Energy Solutions is itself, as a member of a consortium, an “economic operator” within the meaning of Regulation 4. Energy Solutions issued proceedings in the First Claim, HT-2014-000053 on 28 April 2014 against NDA seeking damages {A/1/1}. This date post-dated that which would have triggered the automatic suspension that would have prevented the NDA from contracting with CFP, and the Transition Agreement had already by that date been entered into by them on 15 April 2014. As a result of certain pleas in the Defence served by NDA in that action {A/5/1}, and to avoid limitation issues, ES issued proceedings in the Second Claim, HT-2014-000094 on 29 August 2014 {A/12/1}. This was to rely upon additional breaches of the Regulations that had not been included specifically in the First Claim. Ramsey J made an order on 3 October 2014 that the two claims were to be heard together {F/7/1}. </p>

NDA made an application for permission directly to the Supreme Court itself. Although the outcome of that application was not known at the conclusion of this trial, during the drafting of this judgment on 16 May 2016 the Supreme Court granted permission, although the hearing of that appeal has not yet occurred. It is therefore the case that the Supreme Court could find that the socalled “<span style="font-style:italic">Francovich </span>conditions” <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> imposed on the damages claim by Energy Solutions, such that these conditions have to be satisfied in order for Energy Solutions to be entitled to recover any damages.

The NDA argued in the Court of Appeal, unsuccessfully, that the phrase “may award damages” in Regulation 47J(2)(c) gives effect to the <span style="font-style:italic">Francovich</span> conditions in a claim such as this one. That argument is, unless the judgment of the Court of Appeal is overturned in the Supreme Court, not one which needs to be considered further in this case at this stage.  The parties have agreed that any submissions on this (whether following a successful appeal to the Supreme Court, or before that for reasons of efficiency to avoid later remission) will be in a subsequent judgment, prepared after hearing submissions on “sufficiently serious” by reference to any actual specific breaches that I may find. I do not therefore deal in this judgment with the issue of whether any breaches are “sufficiently serious” within the meaning of the second of the <span style="font-style:italic">Francovich </span>conditions, which is a point that currently is academic. </p>

This was done following disclosure, in particular examination by Energy Solutions and its advisers of the entries made by the NDA evaluation team on the AWARD system (a computerised method used by the NDA for noting and evaluating the different bids). The Third Claim, HT-2015-000163, was issued on 16 March 2015, after the preliminary issues in the First and Second Claims had been heard and decided by Edwards-Stuart J. The Third Claim did not raise any new or different issues so far as the preliminary issues were concerned. In summary, the Third Claim pursued further alleged breaches by the NDA in its evaluation of both the RSS and CFP Tender Responses. It is said by Energy Solutions that clarification of </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">the two competing bids had been sought by the NDA in a way which breached its obligations of transparency and equal treatment, and that the consensus rationale and scores given to the CFP bid were not supported by the comments of the individual evaluators in the AWARD system. It was also said that the NDA had amended scores of the two bids in the absence of justification. There were also other complaints made in the Third Claim, including that the NDA had not acted properly in considering the pass/fail thresholds. This was a mechanism whereby the scoring for some requirements was one of pass/fail, or “Below Threshold/Threshold”. This is further considered in paragraph 805 and following below. Energy Solutions submit that CFP had, on Energy Solutions’ view of the case, failed properly to provide the relevant information within the CFP bid such that the correct outcome should have been an evaluation by the NDA that resulted in “below threshold”, or “fail”, in respect of some parts of the CFP bid. Failure, or a finding of “below threshold” would have led to the bidder in question being excluded from the competition, although there was a dispute between the parties about the way in which that consequence would apply. The principles dealing with this are considered in Section C1 of this judgment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The Third Claim therefore raised new matters which supported or supplemented the claims brought by Energy Solutions of breaches of obligation by NDA. An order was made by Akenhead J by consent on 14 August 2015 that the three actions be tried together and that is what has happened. There was no distinction made at the trial in terms of which issues were contained in either the First, Second or Third Claims, nor was there any need for such distinction to be made. Had all the relevant information been available to Energy Solutions at the time the First Claim was issued, the claims made in the Second and Third Claims would simply have formed part of the particularisation of the same claim. The same damages are claimed, and no point is made by the NDA that a complaint, say, made in the Third Claim could and should have been brought in one of the earlier claims. I recite this purely for completeness, and there is no criticism of either party for the adoption of this approach, which was perfectly sensible in the circumstances, entirely in accordance with the over-riding objective, and often occurs in procurement cases. It avoided the necessity for lengthy amendment of pleadings, which can sometimes become cumbersome as a result, and also the issue of the Second Claim avoided potential limitation issues. The three claims have proceeded as though they comprised different elements of the same action, which is how I intend to deal with the matters raised in each, in this judgment. I therefore make no differentiation in this judgment between issues arising in the three claims. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The focus at the trial (apart from the obvious need for consideration of the relevant legal principles) was therefore on the following main factual areas. Firstly, the way in which the NDA had evaluated the tender bids of both RSS, and CFP. Each separate part of the tender bid was called a Node, and contained different matters that were called Requirements. Each Requirement was given a particular score by the team of evaluators responsible, which numbered three individual Subject Matter Experts or SMEs. The SMEs were also sometimes referred to during the trial and in some of the evidence as evaluators. There was a detailed process by which this scoring exercise was undertaken to which I return in Part X Section B below. The SMEs were under the overall management of the Core Competition </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, as part of the evaluation, in respect of some of the Nodes under consideration, the clarification process used by the NDA had to be considered. If the SMEs considered at the time that part of a bid was unclear, clarification could be sought. Clarification was sought by the NDA in documents called Bidder Clarification Requests (“BCRs”) which were drafted by the SMEs or the Core Competition Team and issued by the Core Competition Team to the bidders. The responses would be scrutinised by a member of the CCT. The NDA’s approach was said, by the NDA, to be that if the CCT member felt the response went further than clarification, those parts that did provide additional information would be redacted and only the clarification element provided to the SMEs. This is challenged by Energy Solutions. </p>

Having considered and decided the legal framework within which the NDA was required to consider the different tenders, they required analysis of all of the different elements of the 22 Requirements within the RSS Tender Submission, and the 24 within the CFP Tender Submission, of which complaint is made by Energy Solutions. The final three, namely Initial Issues 6, 7 and 8, could be termed the “legal issues”. These are not, for the most part, as controversial as the “factual issues”. The legal issues themselves are not, however, free from controversy. Paragraphs 58 to 62 of the Particulars of Claim in the First Claim {A/2/11} set out the applicable principles that Energy Solutions say govern the procurement exercise. These paragraphs pleaded that the conduct of the Procurement was subject to the 2006 Regulations, and/or the Directive, and/or applicable general EU Treaty principles, including those of equal treatment, transparency, nondiscrimination, proportionality and good administration. In particular, pursuant to those principles and to Regulation 4(3) of the Regulations, Energy Solutions averred that the NDA was required to treat RSS and Energy Solutions equally, transparently and in a non-discriminatory way and to conduct a fair and objective assessment of Tender Responses free from manifest error. Energy Solutions also maintain that the NDA was also required to comply with the obligations in Regulations 18, 30 and 32. It is also said that under Regulation 47A, the NDA also owed Energy Solutions a duty to comply with the relevant provisions of the Regulations and any enforceable EU obligations.

Although the parties are agreed that “manifest error” forms an essential element of the test that is to be applied by the court, the NDA contended as follows in respect of a great many of the alleged breaches: “An evaluative judgment of this sort is not capable of constituting a manifest error”. This point is dealt with in Part IX below. The NDA would have the court approach whether or not there was a “manifest error” by the NDA in a rather different way than Energy Solutions submits I should approach the exercise. I deal with this further below but it means that the first task I have is to consider and establish the legal framework within which the tenders were to be considered by the NDA. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">These Initial Issues were, during the trial itself, refined and expanded. This was in response to a number of requests from the court that the parties, by agreement, attempt to identify the issues for decision in respect of each of the complaints which related to each of the nodes in both the RSS and CFP tenders. The outcome of this was dramatically to expand the number of issues affecting both the different Nodes, and the legal issues. I have reproduced the Initial Issues above because it was agreed that the points concerned in Initial Issue 7 could not be dealt with in this judgment, and also because Initial Issue 8 deals with the “sufficiently serious” point to which I have referred in respect of the appeal from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Initial Issue 7 cannot be dealt with in this judgment because adjustment of the scores that were given to either of the tenders – namely that of RSS, and/or CFP – does not lead to a simple arithmetic adjustment of the overall score, due to the different weighting given to the scores obtained against different requirements. It has been agreed by the parties that following this judgment, the percentage effect of the adjustment will be agreed by them. It will only be possible to answer the question posed in Initial Issue 7 once that exercise is done. Although hypothetically there would in such a case be the possibility that the trial would lead to <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>adjustment of the score given both to the RSS and the CFP tenders, in this case that hypothesis will not come to pass. This is because prior to the trial the NDA conceded that the marks given to RSS on two Requirements in two Nodes should be increased. This is dealt with in Agreed Issue 37 below but relates to Requirements 110.5.9(c) and 112.5.9(c). On each of these the NDA only gave RSS a score of 1 in the evaluation, and now accepts that each ought to have been awarded 5, the top mark available. Accordingly, the RSS tender is by this concession entitled to an increase of 8 marks (prior to adjustment for weighting). The number of marks awarded to the RSS tender will therefore change, but not necessarily the percentage due to the correlation between the scores for the Costs and Technical Nodes. However, even on the scores awarded prior to the commencement of the litigation, the resulting scores given to the two tenders were very close. CFP was awarded a score of 86.48% {U/5/1} and RSS was awarded a score of 85.42% {U/2/1}. That margin may, prior to my findings, become narrower due to the concession to which I have just referred. In opening, Mr Howell QC for Energy Solutions submitted that if just a few of the challenges to the scores succeeded – and Energy Solutions highlight as many as 35 different serious errors – the outcome of the competition would have been very different. That remains to be seen, but it does mean that the overall scoring consequences of my findings in this judgment will have to be dealt with subsequently. <br/></p>

The trial also made use of an electronic trial bundle, or e-bundle. To adopt a phrase used by Briggs LJ in his Civil Courts Structure Review: Interim Report, this freed the case “from the stranglehold of paper” and enabled a vast amount of material to be accessible very promptly. Without an electronic bundle, the hearing would have taken very much longer.  The electronic bundle also made control of the confidential material a more manageable task; unless one had the necessary authorisations, it was not possible to access documents, statements or pleadings that contained the material that was subject to either of the two levels of confidentiality (the “confidentiality ring” and “lawyers-only confidentiality ring”).

However, a reader with the necessary authorisation – for example, more senior judges should this judgment be subject to appellate review, or partners at the solicitors’ firms for the parties, who will have the necessary authorisation – will be able to use the hyperlink function to access the relevant documents (or parts of documents) identified.

Decommissioning of nuclear facilities is a term that refers both to the decontamination and dismantling of both buildings and facilities at nuclear sites. Modern nuclear facilities are constructed with decommissioning requirements very firmly in mind, and operational records are also comprehensive. It might seem surprising looked at with the hindsight of the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century, but earlier nuclear facilities did not approach record keeping in the same way, and also did not take decommissioning into account. The reason for this was that priorities were very different in the earlier days of the nuclear industry, from development and research in the 1940s, through to energy production in the 1950s onwards. The result of this earlier approach means that there is often only limited information available about the nuclear waste currently stored in some of the older facilities, and there are few reliable design drawings available of the facilities themselves. </p>

There are three different categories of nuclear waste. High level waste (HLW) has high levels of radioactivity that generate significant heat. This heat has to be taken into account when designing storage and disposal facilities. Sellafield is the only site in the UK that manages HLW.  Intermediate level waste (ILW) is radioactive waste which has radioactivity levels which exceed the upper boundaries for low level waste, but which does not require heat to be taken into account in the design of storage or disposal facilities.  ILW is stored in tanks, vaults and drums. Most of this type of waste requires concrete to shield operators from the radiation. Both HLW and ILW emit large amounts of harmful radiation and require large amounts of shielding for protection. Low level waste (LLW) is the lowest category of radioactive waste, and constitutes in excess of 90% of the UK’s radioactive waste legacy by volume, but is responsible for less than 0.1% of the total radioactivity. (By definition therefore, HLW and ILW constitutes less than 10% of radioactive waste legacy by volume but is responsible for in excess of 99.9% of radioactivity.) Some LLW is sent to the UK’s dedicated repository for lower activity waste, the Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) near the village of Drigg, Cumbria. Other LLW, at the lower end range of the range of radioactivity, can be disposed of in specific landfill sites soon after it is produced. All nuclear facilities require regulation by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (“ONR”). </p>

One example stated in the evidence in the trial was the ponds. These are concrete-lined ponds of water, which have a twofold function in relation to spent fuel. The water in them is used to cool the spent fuel, which is highly radioactive, before the spent fuel is sent to Sellafield. The water also acts as a barrier against radiation. Even after the spent fuel, which is kept in what are called “skips” (although these are specialised containers) is removed, the ponds remain highly contaminated. Sludge (again, itself highly contaminated) will have accumulated over time, as well as debris from the fuel elements and other items which are referred to as “furniture”. Decommissioning involves dealing with all aspects both of the ponds themselves, and all that is within them, including the water, the sludge, the debris and the furniture. </p>

Appendix 11 of the ITSFT contained the Statement of Response Requirements, or SORR {J/10/1}. This document was developed by the NDA in conjunction with the parties during the dialogue phase. The final version of the SORR was therefore one arrived at following a process of evolution in which the bidders and the NDA participated. The SORR contained the scoring criteria against which the different tender submissions were to be evaluated, and represents the most relevant rules of the procurement competition for the purposes of the trial. The dialogue phase was one which would have imposed a burden upon members of the teams assembled by the bidders, due to the number and intensity of the meetings. However, given the NDA were dealing with <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the bidders, in my judgment it could safely be said that the burden during this period upon the individuals within the NDA acting as SMEs was probably about three or four times as heavy as those within the bidders’ teams for each Evaluation Node. The term “Node” was used to describe different components or sections of the bid. The dialogue phase ran from January 2013 to September 2013 and included the different bidders having the opportunity to make site visits. During this process, the different bidders also received what was called by all the witnesses “feedback” on their proposals which included drafts of their likely tender responses, which were called “Interim Submissions” or “Interim Drops”. </p>

There was no opportunity for there to be any guidance from the NDA on this change, because it was made so late in the process, and this was accepted by Mr Rankin {Day9-NC/14}. Six of the challenges brought by Energy Solutions relate to Critical Assets and the evaluation by the six teams of SMEs on six different Nodes. These are Nodes 405, 408, 410, 411, 412 and 414. The effect of “key critical assets” and how this was interpreted are dealt with further in greater detail in Section B1 below. I was not given any particularly detailed explanation about why such a change, so very late in the lengthy dialogue phase, was necessary. It might be a coincidence that so many areas of challenge relate to such a very late change to such an important area of the bids.  </p>

This confirmed that the “Dialogue period of the competition has now closed” and also that the NDA had “secured the necessary governance approvals to be able to enter into the formal ITSFT period”. The letter requested that the documentation – which was the “Formal ITSFT Documentation” – be reviewed and invited “any clarification questions that you believe are unanswered by the final drafting of all of the documents. For the avoidance of doubt these submissions should be limited to matters of clarity, not to reopen dialogue on any subject matter contained within.” The letter therefore made it clear, not that any of the parties at the time would have been in any doubt about the matter, that the final drafting of the ITSFT had gone as far as it was going to go, and the ITSFT documentation was at that point in its final form. </p>

These tender responses were to be scrutinised by the SMEs and scored against the detailed scoring criteria contained in Appendix 11 to the ITSFT, namely the SORR. The tenderers were required to submit responses addressing a series of topics called the “Evaluation Nodes” or “Nodes”.  Each Node comprised a number of individual stated requirements (“Requirements”).  The final version of the SORR was also dated 2 October 2013 and was headed “ITSFT Release Version” {J/10/1}.

The NDA deployed substantial resource in order to conduct this exercise, and recognised that this would be a heavy workload. The SMEs were all given training for the task. In the training material considered at the trial, which were PowerPoint graphics or slides, the SMEs were told by the NDA “personal demands on you will be high – very limited schedule contingency is available” {R/8/3}. This meant that there was little room in the programme for any overrun in terms of how much time was available for the SMEs to accomplish the evaluation. There was therefore a degree of time pressure upon the SMEs. </p>

This identification was to be accomplished by evaluation of the different tenders using the Evaluation Framework. MEAT was referred to as Level 1 on the Evaluation Framework, which then had four Level 2 Evaluation Nodes. These were Cost; Commercial; Key Enablers; and Technical Scope and Methodology Underpinning (which was referred to generally as Technical Underpinning). Each Level 2 Evaluation Node was sub-divided into a number of Level 3 Evaluation Nodes.  Each Level 3 Evaluation Node was allocated a reference number in the Evaluation Framework. The Cost Evaluation Nodes were numbered 100 onwards, Commercial Evaluation Nodes numbered 200 onwards, Key Enabler Evaluation Nodes 300 onwards and Technical Underpinning Evaluation Nodes 400 onwards.  So for example, Nominated Staff is numbered Evaluation Node 303, and all the Technical Underpinning Evaluation Nodes are numbered 401 and so on.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The percentage weightings for the Alternative Strategies were small, at 0.16% each. This was because the bidders were only required to develop plans that supported how they would approach the development of the strategies were these to be required. The bidders did not need to set out the strategies in detail. The bidders were all identified by number starting from 2. Bidder number 1 had been the Bechtel/URS consortium, and after URS withdrew the number 1 was not reallocated. Each of bidders 2 to 5 submitted their tender bids by the date required, namely 1 November 2013. The Award Notification was dated 31 March 2014. Simply by considering the dates it can be seen that the process of evaluating, scoring, and satisfying the internal procedures necessary before announcing the outcome of the competition, was performed to a timetable that was very tight. In fact, the evaluation process itself was shorter than that, and lasted less than four months; it started on 11 November 2013 and was supposed to end on 4 March 2014 {C/7/50}. This is less than half the period allocated for the dialogue process. The evaluation period was in fact extended, but only by half a day at the request of the SMEs doing the Overall Cost Summary Evaluation Node, and it finished on 5 March 2014. It was the evaluation process that was crucial to two important matters. Selecting the tender who had submitted the most economically advantageous bid; and complying with the statutory duties upon the NDA to do so in accordance with the Regulations so that the procurement was conducted lawfully. </p>

The last day of submissions on the substantive issues had been 23 March 2016 when further submissions were required on one particular area, namely the disqualification provisions of the SORR. The draft judgment then continued to be written over the next three months, and a draft was issued to the parties under CPR Part 40 in the usual way on 6 July 2016. During May 2016, a date in July had been chosen for the formal handing down of the judgment, to suit the availability of the parties, that date being 14 July 2016. Typographical and other clerical corrections were received from both parties in the usual way and these were incorporated.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">However, on the morning of 13 July 2016 a letter was received by the court from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (“Freshfields”), Energy Solutions’ solicitors acting in the litigation. The letter was dated 12 July 2016 and had been sent the evening before, and involved the revelation of a highly unusual state of affairs. This had only come to Freshfields’ attention shortly before the letter itself had been written. To put it at its shortest, Freshfields had just discovered that their client, Energy Solutions, had entered into a written agreement with Ian Bowes, one of its witnesses, whereby Mr Bowes was to be paid a bonus of £100,000 in the event that Energy Solutions was successful in the litigation. This agreement was dated 13 July 2015, coincidentally almost exactly one year before Freshfields discovered its existence. That agreement (“the Bowes Supplemental Agreement”) had not been disclosed to the NDA (although it was disclosed under cover of the letter of 12 July 2016) and the arrangement whereby Mr Bowes was to be paid this sum dependent on the litigation outcome had not been made known to the court, and had not been (prior to July 2016) known to Freshfields. Freshfields accordingly asked that the formal handing down be adjourned so that investigations could be undertaken. The NDA’s solicitors, Burges Salmon, acceded to the request to postpone the formal handing down. </p>

Very shortly before that hearing, further information was provided by Freshfields to the NDA and to the court. By the time of the hearing at 2.00pm on 14 July 2016 it had been discovered that similar arrangements appeared to have been made also for Philip Colwill, Andrew Davies, Johanna Wilson, and Nigel Board, as well as for Mr Bowes. I therefore gave directions for evidence to be served by the partner in charge of the case at Freshfields, Ms Sally Roe, explaining how this state of affairs had come to her knowledge; from personnel at Energy Solutions responsible for these Supplemental Agreements; and from the witnesses themselves who were affected by these arrangements. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">I also set down a two day hearing for 25 and 26 July 2016, the intention being that the NDA could, if so advised, further cross-examine such witnesses as they wished on this state of affairs, details of which were still emerging. This point can be summarised as Energy Solutions having entered into agreements with each of these five witnesses, promising to pay them what were referred to as “win bonuses” dependent upon the outcome of the litigation. Evidence was served in accordance with my directions during the week commencing 18 July 2016 from all five of these witnesses who had given evidence earlier in the trial, together with witness statements from Ms Roe {D/6/1}, Simon Stuttaford {D/18/1} and Tim Joyce {D/20/1}. Mr Stuttaford is a solicitor whose job title was Senior Vice President Legal at Energy Solutions, and he was the sole lawyer there, and in-house counsel. He had already served a witness statement in October 2014 relating to the preliminary issues {D/2/1}. He had, at the time the first Supplemental Agreement had been entered into (which was with Mr Board), still been employed by Energy Solutions, although he left and went to a law firm called DWF LLP on 22 June 2015 {D/18/2}. He had been in-house counsel at Energy Solutions from 11 August 2011 to 12 June 2015. He was therefore directly employed at the time the agreement with Mr Board was executed (“the Board Supplemental Agreement”), and he had also been involved in drafting the other agreements. After he left Energy Solutions’ employ he continued to provide services to them as a DWF partner and would work typically one day a week out of the Energy Solutions’ offices. Tim Joyce {D/20/1} is a main board member, chartered accountant and had been the signatory to the agreements. He had also been the person who had instructed Simon Stuttaford to draft them, and hence had direct knowledge about them. He had also given a witness statement earlier in relation to an earlier interlocutory application {D/3/1}.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">On 20 July 2016 the NDA issued an application seeking dismissal of the whole claim and/or striking out of the whole claim, alternatively seeking a declaration of mistrial in relation to all the proceedings before me that are the subject of this judgment {F/44/1}. Each of the witnesses I have identified in the preceding paragraph were cross-examined on 25 or 26 July 2016 by either Mr Hapgood QC (who appeared for the first time at this stage in the trial) or Mr Giffin QC. The NDA also cross-examined Ms Roe, the Freshfields’ partner. I deal with that application in Part XI of this judgment, and for the reasons given there I dismiss it. However, I have evidently revisited both my view of each of the five witnesses who had such an agreement, and also revisited each of my factual findings and my analysis of the case brought by Energy Solutions on each of the issues in this case as a result of these events, and these agreements. My analysis of the witnesses in the subsequent section of this judgment, Part VI, contains my views on the totality of what I have heard in the whole of these proceedings from, and about, these witnesses including the events of July 2016. I have also considered the situation in respect of each of the witnesses who had Supplemental Agreements containing “win bonuses”, and the effect such an arrangement might have had on their evidence, separately from one another. It is not the case that the same conclusion has to be reached for all of them, or that the same weight has to be given to each of their evidence either on that particular point, or indeed on any point.  </p>

Although this was guarded against, from time to time it was inevitable that some witnesses found themselves explaining what they believed particular text really meant, or should be interpreted as meaning. There was a great deal of technical subject matter and as could be expected, all of the witnesses on both sides seemed suitably qualified and experienced in their roles, both in the bid and indeed generally. There were however important differences between them and I address these in the relevant parts of the judgment when dealing with specific Nodes.   </p>

He has worked in the nuclear industry for 34 years and is evidently a man of considerable experience. For 20 of those years he worked for BNFL, predominantly at Sellafield. He led the BNFL team in a successful bid for the contract (together with Lockheed Martin Corporation and Serco Group plc) to manage and operate a joint venture company called AWE Management Ltd. This company managed and operated AWE plc, a company whose main activity is to manufacture and maintain the UK’s nuclear warheads which form the UK’s strategic nuclear deterrent. Mr Bowes was a main board member of AWE plc. He worked in the division of BNFL that facilitated the handover of the nuclear sites to the NDA. When the NDA parent body agreements and management and operation agreements came into effect on 1 April 2005 he moved into Magnox Electric, the body that operated the Magnox sites. When Magnox Electric was split into Magnox South and Magnox North, he became the Commercial Director of Magnox South. When Energy Solutions acquired a subsidiary of BNFL in June 2007 he was responsible on behalf of BNFL for agreeing with the NDA certain amended, restated and consolidated parent body agreements, and site management and operations contracts that had to be put in place. In October 2007 he moved into what is called a commercial development role, and became a Senior Vice President of Energy Solutions in 2010. He was involved in commercial dialogue with the NDA for a consortium bid Energy Solutions entered into (with AMEC Nuclear Holdings Ltd) for a PBO for Dounreay. In this bid the subject of these proceedings, he was the commercial lead for the RSS bid team, and was also a lead author, and reviewer, of particular sections of the RSS bid.  </p>

He answered the questions put to him clearly and sensibly in all respects and the whole of his evidence appeared to me, then, entirely uncoloured by any partisan view. That remained my view after the Supplemental Agreements came to light, and after he had been cross-examined on 26 July 2016. Mr Bowes, having worked in the industry as he had for so many years, had become something of a specialist in bidding for new contracts. However, absent specialist (or indeed any) legal knowledge about the nature of such agreements, he could not be expected to know of the policy considerations that have an effect upon their legal status, nor could he (or the other witnesses) be expected to know that such agreements are contrary to public policy. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The notable feature of this case so far as the Supplemental Agreements are concerned is that once Energy Solutions, by definition, lost the procurement competition, the US-based parent company decided to re-organise the business with many employees becoming redundant. Mr Bowes had his employment terminated on 31 March 2016. He had signed a Supplementary Agreement on 13 July 2015 {D/11/133}, well before he came to give evidence before me in the trial, but only the day after his first witness statement was signed {D/10/1}. The reason that these “litigation win bonus” agreements are all called Supplemental Agreements is they were supplemental to, and not included within, the terms of the Settlement Agreements by which these personnel were made redundant or had their employments terminated. The only exception to this is the agreement with Mr Davies, who was not made redundant. The fact that they are separate to Settlement Agreements is a point relied upon by the NDA in its application in Part XI, but I find there is nothing in that point because they are in fact referred to within the Settlement Agreements themselves, for example at {D/17/27} by the words “save as provided within a supplemental agreement between the Parties of even date”.  </p>

He had been the leader of the bid team, and he was effectively the leader of those personnel at Energy Solutions who were involved in the litigation too. He liaised extensively with Freshfields, and gave evidence. As he explained to me “reward and recognition including using incentive payments was part of the overall reward structure adopted by the Claimant”. He had qualified for a bonus upon submission of the RSS tender itself (which was the product of a great deal of work) in the sum of £24,778. Had the RSS bid been successful, he would have been entitled to a “win bonus” of £63,072, although he told me that he had only done that calculation recently, and had thought it was about £75,000. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">There is a further factor that affects both Mr Bowes and Mr Board, but none of the other witnesses. On 1 July 2016 a further agreement was entered into between the US parent company and each of them, although the legal entity contracting with Energy Solutions LLC was, for each of Mr Bowes and Mr Board, a limited company through which they provided consultancy services. Mr Bowes’ company was called IJRB Ltd. This agreement was of a similar nature to the Supplemental Agreement, although it was far more detailed and the payment terms were different (and far more generous). The win bonus in this agreement (which I will call “the Percentage Recovery Agreement”) consisted of two elements, one of £100,000, and the other of 0.5% of the amount recovered in damages. The Percentage Recovery Agreement with Mr Bowes has been terminated. The reason that the Percentage Recovery Agreement was with the US parent was due to the claimant entity having been disposed of to Atkins Ltd, another major company in the sector, with the benefit of the litigation being retained by the US parent. Given the potential scale of damages, the percentage element of this bonus could amount to up to £500,000. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">There is nothing to suggest that Mr Bowes knew that the Percentage Recovery Agreement or anything like it was possible, or available, when he gave evidence at the trial. The services to be provided are included in Schedule 1 {D/11/178} and include giving evidence “if required” but also go wider than that, including working with Mr Board on management of the claim and instructing Energy Solutions’ legal advisers. This agreement was also formed at a time when it must have been becoming obvious to all at Energy Solutions that the litigation was potentially going to take far longer to resolve than perhaps had been anticipated during 2015. The Supreme Court had given permission to appeal on the preliminary issues, and this first instance liability judgment had taken some months to draft (and, as at the date of the Percentage Recovery Agreement, had not even been distributed). An appeal by either party, or even both parties, may occur. I find that the formation of this agreement had no effect whatsoever either on the evidence given to me by Mr Bowes on the substantive issues in the trial in November/December 2015, nor at the hearing before me on 26 July 2016. Further, the litigation win bonus of £100,000 (which was known to him when he signed his first witness statement) does not, in my judgment, alter my view of him as a witness or diminish the weight which I have given to his evidence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Colwill adopted a style of giving evidence that became increasingly common throughout the trial for the majority of the witnesses for Energy Solutions. I was unaware of the architect of this when I drafted the judgment distributed to the parties on 6 July 2016, although in further disclosure in July 2016 following the Supplemental Agreements and win bonus issues, it appears that witness training was provided by a company called Bond Solon. Whether that training was responsible for the style of giving evidence, I do not know. Mr Colwill was the first to use it. This was, at times, to avoid the question and embark upon something of a corporate presentation. The linguistic device adopted for this approach was, usually, to state that it was necessary to put a question “in context” and then embark upon an exposition that was essentially sketching out the Claimant’s case, and avoiding giving a clear answer to sensible questions from Mr Giffin QC for the NDA. I found this increasingly unhelpful. In my draft judgment of 6 July 2016, I expressed the view that particularly in a procurement case, where the content of the tender submission essentially speaks for itself, evidence from a claimant’s witnesses is not as crucial as it is in other cases where there might be more stark disputes of primary fact. That remains my view, and indeed appeared to be the view of Leading Counsel for the NDA in its Note of Oral Closing Submissions {AA/21/17} when it was said “So far as the ES witnesses are concerned, it is common ground that in reality their evidence is of secondary importance to a challenge of this kind”. That view on the part of the NDA changed dramatically by the time of the hearing on 25 and 26 July 2016, which is a point to which I return in Part XI of this judgment dealing with the application to dismiss the claim. Despite that change of view by the NDA, I remain of the view expressed in my draft judgment – namely, that in a procurement case, where the content of the tender submission essentially speaks for itself, evidence from a claimant’s witnesses is not as crucial as it is in other cases where there might be more stark disputes of primary fact. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">However, even though it is correct that in procurement cases a claimant’s witness evidence is not necessarily so crucial as in other cases (where there may be, for example, issues about what was actually said at a meeting, or what in fact happened on a particular occasion) the approach to giving evidence adopted by the majority of the Energy Solutions’ witnesses (with the exception of Mr Bowes, Mr Peel and Mr Matthews) is to be discouraged. Mr Colwill was the first proponent of this technique, and other witnesses for Energy Solutions adopted it to a greater or lesser degree, such that a pattern seemed to emerge. This had obvious disadvantages. Preparation by a witness is undoubtedly necessary in a case such as this with so much material, covering so many different technical areas, but if preparation involves refining an approach to keep witnesses’ oral evidence as close to a pre-ordained script as possible, it risks being counter-productive. This became more pronounced (or noticeable) during the evidence of the different witnesses, and it approached its nadir during Ms Wilson’s evidence. I do not consider that it had a determinative impact upon my findings on any of the areas in dispute, but it would be detrimental if such an approach were to be adopted in future hearings in this (or indeed any) litigation. </p>

Perhaps the lack of time for extensive preparation, or witness training, was a good thing. Certainly where before there had been long pauses, requests to put matters “in context”, careful consideration of questions and equally careful non-answers, on 26 July 2016 he answered promptly, candidly and openly, and I found what he had to say wholly convincing. </p>

This related to the personal consequences of the failed bid. In his view, the NDA had made significant errors in the evaluation of the RSS tender but the litigation would only remedy the consequences of that so far as the company was concerned. He was expected to put in a considerable amount of work to help Energy Solutions correct this wrong, yet he had suffered personally to a considerable degree – he was being made redundant rather than taking up a senior role in the PBO. Also, and again this applies to all the other employees, he would have been entitled to a substantial bonus had RSS won the bid in the actual competition. He and his colleagues were therefore suffering a double impact due to what they saw as the wrongful evaluation of the bid. They had lost the bonus they felt should have been paid; and they had to work very hard in the litigation as well. He considered that his role up to October 2015 had cost him both in family and career terms, and he explained his views in a letter dated 2 October 2015 to Mr Bowes {D/17/52}. Ms Wilson sent a similar letter dated 3 October 2015, which I deal with below. In his letter, Mr Colwill suggested a further payment in respect of his involvement in the litigation, and notably in my judgment his first option was one regardless of outcome. </p>

He, as with so many of the witnesses at the trial for both parties, is highly technically qualified, and his evidence on the substantive issues principally concerned the intricacies of the movement of nuclear waste. The suggestion that someone involved in the nuclear industry since 1982 would give the court untruthful evidence about the movement of nuclear waste, a highly hazardous operation, in exchange for the possibility of a payment of £15,500 is something that, in my judgment, would need substantial material to justify it. It is also something that in my judgment would be inherently unlikely, given the nature of the industry and the potential consequences for technical inaccuracy. The NDA did not put a single point to Mr Davies (or indeed to any of the re-called witnesses) that his (or their) evidence on any particular item was technically wrong, incorrect or untruthful. The highest it was put to Mr Davies was that the litigation win bonus made him “a little keener” that the trial should go a particular way. </p>

She was made redundant at the end of January 2016. She has over 25 years of experience in this field, having worked at the CEGB, and running her own consultancy which was hired by the NDA in 2005. She therefore had considerable experience of the energy and nuclear sectors when she was hired by Energy Solutions in 2011. She had oversight of the training, development, resourcing and talent management of individuals employed by Energy Solutions and has worked on various public sector tender processes in which Energy Solutions had been involved. She became involved in this competition in September 2012 and was the lead author of Node 303, Nominated Staff Appointment. She was chosen for this based on her expertise, and was based in the UK head office at the time. In her view, the RSS Tender Submission should have received the maximum score for all the requirements relevant to the Nominated Staff node. She was also the lead author of another Node, namely People Strategy, although the subject matter of that Node did not form part of the subject matter of the proceedings before me.  </p>

In my draft judgment, I had expressed the view that I did not doubt at that time that Ms Wilson genuinely held the views that she expressed when cross-examined by Mr Giffin QC. However, she did very often ask to see particular documents before she would answer even the simplest of questions. Her answers would also usually be very lengthy, again even to the very simplest of questions. This made her evidence somewhat less helpful than it might otherwise have been, simply because it came across as a prepared and careful exposition of Energy Solutions’ case, rather than as answers to the questions that were being put to her. This, again, may have been as a result of the witness training that she had undergone. She gave her evidence on 26 July 2016 in a far more helpful way.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Wilson had a Supplemental Agreement which included a litigation win bonus in the sum of £15,500. Her situation was rather different to the other witnesses. When she was assigned to the RSS bid team, she was classified as a Category B participant rather than a Category A participant, which was the highest category and for those playing a more significant role, such as leading parts of the bid. It had been intended that Bechtel would provide the Category A participant for these two Nodes, and Ms Wilson would support that person. However, no such participant appeared or was assigned by Bechtel, and so Ms Wilson performed a Category A role whilst being recognised as only Category B {D/14/4}. This affected her bonus arrangements. She raised dissatisfaction about this, and the multiplier applied to her bid submission bonus, at the time in 2013, which resulted in an offer of something called a “President’s Award” {D/15/9} of £1,000. It should also be noted that when Ms Wilson was assigned to the RSS bid team, she was required to work in the Manchester office full time. She then lived in Gloucestershire and had dependent children. Her involvement in the bid therefore required her children living with another family member whilst she was away. This is an obvious personal sacrifice, which Ms Wilson, it might be thought entirely understandably, did not feel was suitably recognised.  </p>

She had a substantially lower salary; she was assigned a lower Category; and she was paid a lower multiplier than other lead authors. Accordingly, these factors together meant she experienced substantially lower remuneration. She discovered in June 2015 that she was to be made redundant. She found out in September 2015 that some of the other participants in the litigation had been granted litigation win bonuses. She had not. </p>

Ms Wilson, a HR specialist, would have been unlikely to feel that there was a lack of equality had she not been the only female lead author.

She was offered a sum of £8,500 only after she had written the letter of 3 October 2015, which she did as part of her wider attempts to obtain suitable recompense and equality of treatment generally. This stands starkly in contrast, in my judgment, to the higher figure offered to Mr Davies, for example, who did not even have to ask for such a bonus. Eventually the figure agreed with Ms Wilson was £15,500 and a Supplemental Agreement was executed with her on 26 January 2016. This was the same amount as that given to Mr Davies. Indeed, and without dwelling on the irony inherent in this, Mr Davies’ litigation win bonus amount was increased to £15,500 because Mr Bowes and Mr Joyce did not feel he should be offered a lower win bonus than Ms Wilson (who managed to negotiate her figure upwards) for reasons of equality of treatment and fairness. Those principles do not seem to have been foremost in their minds when the initial offer was made of a litigation win bonus to Ms Wilson that was lower than any of the other (male) witnesses. </p>

Only one of them, the third in a list of five, seeks a litigation win bonus. She described this as a “win-type bonus”, having obtained this wording from Mr Colwill. Other options she suggested included both a salary increase and/or payment in lieu of notice (“PILON” in the letter). As she said, she was proposing a number of ways in which she could be compensated for a pay package that was considerably lower than it ought to have been. I find that this letter was sent by Ms Wilson for entirely understandable and perfectly proper reasons as part of a legitimate attempt to remedy what she saw as her historic treatment, to avoid being treated less favourably than other colleagues going forwards, who already had such agreements by that date (namely Mr Broad), and to improve her package with the company. I reject the notion that she sent it as part of some sort of coercion of Energy Solutions in advance of giving her evidence.  </p>

He had been employed in the nuclear industry for in excess of 30 years, with particular experiences in nuclear decommissioning. He commenced in the industry in 1982 at nuclear sites such as Dounreay, Sellafield and Chapelcross, employed by WS Atkins. Over time, he was seconded to BNFL and also managed the decommissioning of the Windscale Pile Reactors in the early 1990s for the UKAEA at Windscale, which is an enclave of the Sellafield site. He was the Senior Manager for the decommissioning of Dounreay, and from December 2004 until he commenced his semi-retirement he was Chief Consultant for Nuvia Ltd, and led a team working for RSRL in relation to the decommissioning and removal of the nuclear reactors at Winfrith and Harwell. It can be seen therefore that not only does he have considerable experience of nuclear decommissioning, but also specific experience at some of the sites that form part of this procurement competition.  </p>

Due to the particular nature of this site (which was never a power station but used for experimental and research reactors) decommissioning commenced in 1990 and the last operational reactor closed in 1995. Decommissioning was therefore at an advanced stage compared to the other sites. Mr Matthews had a depth of knowledge of Winfrith in particular, and his evidence concerning Figure 408-25 and the development of the tender submission so far as the plans for fencing was concerned was illuminating. He was helpful in the way he gave his evidence, and did not seem as committed as other witnesses from Energy Solutions to stick to a particular script, which is to his credit. As a consultant, he was paid his usual rate for assisting on the litigation, and had no payment arrangements contingent on litigation outcome. Freshfields gave Energy Solutions some advice on this in relation to Mr Matthews in 2014, to which I will return in Part XI of this judgment dealing with the NDA’s application to dismiss the claim. He was not recalled to be cross-examined on 25 and 26 July 2016, and the NDA did not seek to have him recalled.  </p>

He had not specifically requested a premium (by which he meant bonus) linked to the outcome of the litigation. He did, however, explain that Energy Solutions had a “culture of shared success” and in his oral evidence {Day22Z-CON/89/23} said that the nuclear industry was used to paying on the “end milestone” and Energy Solutions had a “long history of paying us reasonably large contingent amounts”. His employment package entitled him to an annual bonus of up to 50% of his salary, which given his high salary was a sizeable amount.

That is made clear, if it could be in any doubt, by the payment to the employees of bonuses for submitting the RSS bid. I am fairly confident that Mr Board would have been more than happy with an agreement that promised, for example, to pay him £30,000 for his involvement in the litigation regardless of its outcome.

They were each crossexamined in conventional and perfectly logical fashion by Mr Hunter QC. His approach was to use as a starting point the reasons given by the NDA in the consensus rationale (prepared by the SMEs during the evaluation) for the particular score that RSS had obtained, for each of the different Requirements under the different Nodes that were the subject of the proceedings. He would then compare those reasons with the contents of the RSS Tender Submission, to demonstrate that (for example) if it had been said that a particular matter had not been included and this omission had affected the score, in reality it had been included and was to be found in a particular place within the Tender Submission. Such an exercise, with logic at its core, too often foundered due to illogicality by the NDA witnesses, in claiming that the NDA’s own stated reasons did not mean what they, on the face of the words, in fact stated. Accordingly, logic became an early casualty during the NDA evidence. At times, the degree to which the different NDA witnesses sought to explain the contemporaneous reasons as meaning something quite different from their natural words became an extraordinary exercise in the tortured misuse of the English language. It was therefore often the case that the reasons relied upon in oral evidence by any particular witness bore little, or no, resemblance either to the pleaded case, or to the reasons given by the NDA in its letter of 11 April 2014 to RSS with its appendices, or indeed to the notes made at the time in the AWARD system entered by the SMEs. This was usually explained away by the witnesses by suggesting that the words in AWARD really were intended to mean (or encompassed) the new reason given in oral evidence, even though they were often entirely different.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Semantic debate about the meaning of words between counsel and witness in this context is rarely of assistance to the court. Occasionally, witnesses would recall very precise discussions that they said had taken place between the SMEs contemporaneously, as to why a particular score had been given or what was wrong with, or missing from, the RSS bid. This clear recall was on occasion remarkable, given the contents of the witness statements, and was only rarely reflected in the stated reasons. I believe that the different NDA witnesses were, both collectively and individually, all highly defensive of the NDA, and this defensive nature led to their evidence being, at times, of extraordinarily limited assistance in the task upon which the court was engaged. It is of course understandable up to a point that those involved in the evaluation exercise were defensive of their own position; people do not always readily admit if they have made a mistake, and the essence of procurement challenges generally is to demonstrate manifest error in evaluation. It is also difficult in a case such as this, which must inevitably have involved considerable preparation by the different witnesses prior to their giving evidence, to differentiate between their contemporaneous behaviour (namely how they evaluated the tender submission at the time) and what they <span style="font-style:italic">now</span> believed they did or thought at the time.

A great deal of his evidence, as one would expect of someone in such a senior role, revolved around what “the NDA” or as he would put “we decided” to do, and how they did it. He was also the lead SME for the PBO Governance and Consolidation Evaluation Nodes. The former Node was the only one that had fewer than three SMEs, and Mr Rankin evaluated that Node with one other person, namely John Butler the Head of Internal Audit. Mr Rankin explained in some detail the way the competition was established. The six other members of the Core Competition Team were Andrea Livesey, Steve Dixon, Clare Poulter, Tony Godley, Andrea Graham and Claire Russell (who managed the AWARD system as well as having other duties). He was therefore the only member of the Core Competition Team who gave evidence at the trial.

Those SMEs were obviously giving evidence to demonstrate that they had not made any errors, or certainly no manifest errors, in arriving at any particular score. Mr Rankin could not give evidence about their particular thought processes at all, and did not attempt to do so. He did however explain that: </p>

It is also rather surprising given that the SMEs were “continuing their day jobs during the evaluation process” as Mr Rankin put it. It may be that some of the SMEs had sufficient time, and avoided “becoming stressed or under pressure” to use Mr Rankin’s words. Some pressure is inevitable in any event. However, the impression given by Mr Rankin in his written evidence was of a smooth evaluation process conducted entirely free of manifest error and entirely under control throughout, properly recorded and with ample records. My view of the matter is somewhat at odds with this, as will be seen from the substantive findings in this judgment. Given the amount of material the SMEs had to work through in evaluating the bids, the period of time for the evaluation was shorter than I would have expected. Also, given my findings in this judgment, it may be the case that the mistakes that were made could be at least partly explained by excessive workload.

The first was the approach to documentation, and the presence in various training materials prepared for the SMEs of express references to shredding of notes by the SMEs. This is considered in detail in Part VII below. I do not consider that I was ever given an adequate explanation by Mr Rankin regarding this subject. Reliance is put by the NDA upon the fact that the version of training slides that was actually used had deleted references to shredding. However, Mr Rankin told me that shredding was directly contrary to the NDA policy on record keeping; if this were the case, I do not see how such clear express references to shredding could have been included in the training Power Point slides for the SMEs, even if deleted in a later version.  </p>

There is no doubt that the NDA were acutely aware that an unsuccessful bidder might challenge the outcome of the competition. In my view, this sensitivity to potential challenge led to the NDA adopting a defensive approach to how the evaluations would be performed. Restricting note taking by the SMEs, which Mr Rankin did (and considering whether to shred notes) was in my judgment part of that overly-defensive approach. </p>

If the scoring was complete and the Node “closed down”, it is not clear why any of the SMEs would be “reflecting” upon what would (or should) be by then a finally agreed score reached consensually by all the SMEs tasked with the evaluation. Nor is it clear to me who would be challenging them, and why, why the question of “responding to challenges” from people who were not SMEs should have arisen at all, or why the SMEs would otherwise be reconsidering their scoring after the score had been “closed down”. Closing down would only occur after the three SMEs, tasked with the evaluation, had jointly decided exactly what the correct score should be, after reflection, consideration, discussion and decision by the three of them. I do not consider that I ever received a satisfactory explanation about this. Particularly as the score for a Requirement or Node was one that was supposed to have been reached jointly by the SMEs working together, a single SME later deciding “upon reflection” that a “closed down” Node needed to be re-opened so its score could be changed – which in the RSS Requirements under consideration here means reduced - (with the obvious potential consequence of changing the outcome of the whole procurement) seems to me to be directly contrary to the ethos of a joint decision leading to a score that was supposed to have been finally agreed and “closed down”. </p>

I was left, having read the material, which demonstrates how sensitive the NDA was to a potential challenge concerning the outcome of the competition – which was highlighted as a high risk at an early stage – with the suspicion that deflecting any legal challenge to the outcome of the competition was foremost in the collective mind of the NDA at all stages of this competition. At least part of this strategy to deflect any challenge was directed towards restricting the amount of material available to be scrutinised by an unsuccessful bidder. Whatever the primary purpose of the Burges Salmon Review, it has had this restricting effect. Whether this has been accomplished by accident or design does not matter, as the obligation of transparency is upon the NDA in any event.

When he was asked if Burges Salmon had ever spoken directly to the SMEs, Mr Rankin said “they may have done”. Again, in a situation with a legal obligation of transparency, this is disappointing.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, there is a third area in which Mr Rankin could have provided very helpful direct evidence on an subject worthy of note. The SMEs, whilst in the room set aside for the purpose of reaching consensus and scoring, were not given any access to emails. This meant that they could not send any. However, they could, and did, personally approach members of the Core Competition Team if matters arose, who would then assist. Mr Rankin did this four or five times, but said he would not become involved in scoring and simply act as a “sounding board” and to provide gentle encouragement. He also performed his own personal review; this led to “conversations in the office” about the consensus rationale and the scores that led to Dr Clark and Mr Grey adding comments as a result. Mr Rankin was also involved in some most important conversations, which in my view he tried to play down, which were not recorded anywhere and of which no notes exist. One was with Dr Clark in relation to the fencing at Winfrith on Requirement 408.5.1(a) and the evolution of the score given to RSS downwards to 1, the lowest score. Another very important one concerned the CFP Tender Submission and Requirement 401.5.1(b)(ix). This concerned a part of the Response that stipulated a graphic and the necessity for information to be provided. The initial view of the SMEs (led by Mr Grey) was that the terms of this Requirement were <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> met by CFP. Because this was a threshold Requirement, that would have led to CFP being disqualified. The SMEs’ collective view was changed following a conversation with Mr Rankin – which I find must have taken place with Mr Grey, even though neither could recall it - to the quite opposite conclusion that the Requirement <span style="font-style:italic">had been </span>met.

This has obvious consequences when the NDA is under an important obligation of transparency. It is also directly contrary to the approach adopted on the very same item, which was to send emails dealing with this matter on 29 November 2013 {T/36/2} between people who already knew about what had happened, and who were involved in and knew the solution chosen, to what was a dilemma. Mr Grey sent an email to Mr Rankin asking for permission to reopen the CFP consensus answer book on AWARD. Even though Mr Rankin would, and must, have known (and did in fact know) about this important matter already – and indeed had been involved in at least one conversation about it, leading to a way around the problem of potentially disqualifying CFP – he replied in an email in potentially misleading terms. In his reply giving permission he said (in an email copied to Mr Tait the NDA Internal Audit Manager) “Thanks for making me aware of this situation”.  I find that email to be misleading in the circumstances. It suggested that Mr Rankin was not aware of the issue, absent the email; he was not only aware before he received the email, but I find that he had been centrally involved. There is no reference at all in that email to the conversation that had already taken place in which Mr Rankin was instrumental in arriving at the solution.  </p>

I doubt that there can be any sensible explanation for prohibiting email use by SMEs during closed evaluation sessions on the one hand, yet permitting unrecorded oral conversations on such important topics with the Head of Competition on the other.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">This demonstrates, in my judgment, two important matters. Firstly, the NDA was prepared to pay lip-service to the obligations upon it of transparency, yet Mr Rankin and others in the CCT attempted to keep transparency to the absolute minimum, in order to avoid exposing the NDA to a claim by a dissatisfied bidder. Although I did not hear from any other members of the CCT, Mr Rankin could not have adopted this approach on his own, or unbeknownst to the other members of the CCT. References in the training material (even earlier versions) to the shredding of notes, and the general ethos of restricting note taking by the SMEs, were part of this approach. Secondly, Mr Rankin and the whole CCT were acutely aware of the difficult issues that arose during the evaluation process, such as the potential disqualification of CFP due to the terms of the SORR. The solution they adopted was to try and navigate a way around such issues, in a non-transparent way, to avoid scrutiny being brought to bear upon the evaluation (and the SMEs’ reasons) and to put the NDA in a position that could be more easily defended in the event of a procurement challenge. The conversations with Mr Rankin when evaluators “left the room” to discuss matters with him were part of this. Hardly any </p>

However, individual paper note-taking and email discourse were either discouraged or prevented. Indeed, given the three SMEs were in a room together, the only way they could seek assistance from Mr Rankin was for one of them to leave the room and speak to him. They could not record their concerns in an email to him from their consensus sessions. Because of this, very important aspects of the evaluation process were wholly lacking in transparency, in breach of the obligation of transparency upon the NDA. Decisions on what to do about scoring that could lead to a bidder being disqualified were made “off stage”, and consciously so in my judgment. </p>

He has worked in the nuclear field both for companies providing services to the nuclear industry, and with the Environment Agency. At the relevant time, he was employed by the NDA, starting with that Authority in 2007. He became the Strategy Implementation Manager for the NDA in 2012. He was the Lead Evaluator on a number of nodes, including one which figured heavily in the oral evidence, namely Node 408, Winfrith Interim End State. His wife is also Dr Clark and where necessary to differentiate her, I shall refer to her as Dr Anna Clark – she was also an SME on some of the same nodes as Dr Clark. On occasion Dr Anna Clark was referred to in evidence as she had been involved in the evaluation too. He gave oral evidence for approaching two days of Court time. He is, obviously, a highly intelligent person, although he did occasionally prefer to fence with counsel rather than give a straight answer to a straight question. Often introductory or scene-setting questioning could become bogged down due to the approach he adopted to oral testimony. His approach was probably due to the same desire to defend the NDA’s position that affected almost all of the NDA personnel. He could not always resist the opportunity to comment on text in documents, if that would either dilute the force of the question or, as he saw it, help the NDA. However, when he did answer he was frank and when he told me he could not remember some details, I accept that was his genuine evidence. His explanation at the end of his evidence concerning the application of the threshold, or Pass/Fail criteria, I found particularly helpful and illuminating. He was on holiday with his wife Dr Anna Clark when the 11 April 2014 letter was drafted for the NDA to respond to the concerns raised by RSS. He was adamant that he had not been involved in drafting the response by the NDA to the letter of challenge sent by Energy Solutions as he had been on holiday with his wife.  </p>

He holds an honours degree from the Institute of Physics and a Master's degree in Manufacturing Systems Engineering from Warwick University, and both of these qualifications were obtained by studying part-time alongside his full-time employment, which in my judgment shows a high degree of professional dedication. He joined the NDA in January 2005 as a Programme Manager for Calderhall and Chapelcross. He led a team monitoring and overseeing the performance of the Management &amp; Operations (M&amp;O) Contracts for those sites. These contracts were the precursor to the SLCAs, which were first introduced at Dounreay. His first role was therefore monitoring and overseeing the implementation of these contracts in practice. He then moved to another Programme Manager role at Sellafield, where he oversaw all the elements of contract, performance and investment for support services. These included HR, health physics and safety, security, engineering and finance. A key area of his focus in this position was the Sellafield central engineering function. He had a lead role in the asset management improvement project at the NDA. In this he worked alongside John Inkester, NDA's Head of Engineering, and this was because at that time, there had been concerns expressed by the regulators and the NDA about the standard of asset management practices at Sellafield. He played a key role in a joint project to drive improvement based around an agreed set of asset management principles which were jointly signed-up to by all the relevant parties and agreed by the regulators.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">For this procurement competition he was the lead SME on eight technical nodes and at least four cost nodes – he could not remember the exact number of nodes in which he had been involved. During the lengthy dialogue stage, which occurred prior to submission of the bids when there were four bidders, he was extensively involved in dialogue with all of the different bidders, on all the nodes in respect of which he was involved. He told me that this part of the process had involved him in having four meetings a day, four days a week, over a period of eight months. (This was an approximation as Ms Thomas’ written evidence said it was seven months, but this is a minor difference and in my judgment does not matter). After that, as part of the evaluation process, Mr Grey was then involved in evaluating all the different Requirements by each of the bidders on all the different nodes in which he was involved. This was a period of approximately four months for individual evaluation followed by the consensus evaluation. For the lead evaluator of at least 12 of them, this would have been a very considerable task. Needless to say, therefore, he was also very closely involved in the litigation when the challenge to the outcome of the competition was commenced by Energy Solutions. He was the only witness called in the trial by either party who had prepared five witness statements on the substantive issues, and two of these statements were extraordinarily detailed, even by the standards of this case (Mr Bowes and Mr Board also served five witness statements, their fifth statements in July 2016 dealing with the Supplemental Agreements and win bonus situation). His crossexamination took place over four court days and this inevitably involved bringing a great deal of close scrutiny to his evaluation decisions, throughout what had been a very long and highly detailed process. On a great many occasions, he simply had no recollection of what had occurred. Sometimes, he would remember conversations that he said had taken place, or which he thought had occurred.  </p>

It became necessary to have more frequent breaks than usual in order to preserve the quality of his evidence. On some days, breaks became necessary after only about 45 minutes. Mr Grey seemed to me to feel, most heavily, the potential impact that many of his answers might have on the NDA’s case in the litigation, particularly towards the end of his oral evidence. No doubt out of an urge to justify what had occurred, and loyalty to his colleagues, he would not readily admit deficiencies or errors.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment Mr Grey gave his evidence truthfully, and such mistakes as he did make (which I deal with further below in the body of this judgment) were probably simply a factor of his extraordinary workload, and the curious features of the system that was established by the NDA to evaluate the tenders. When I explored with Mr Grey at the end of his evidence the extent to which he had been so centrally involved in so much of the procurement process, and whether he ought to have had further resources put at his disposal, he explained that Mr Rankin had been interested in this very subject throughout the whole process. Mr Grey told me that Mr Rankin had constantly checked that Mr Grey had not taken on too much responsibility, and whether he needed any help. In my view – and this is plainly one based on hindsight and the proceedings – Mr Grey very obviously did need assistance in the enormous task which he was given to perform. However, as is often the case with people who work very hard, which Mr Grey obviously did throughout this entire process, they may be the last to admit that they have been given far too much for them to do. Throughout the dialogue and evaluation process, Mr Grey’s workload must, in my judgment, have been so vast that, regardless of what Mr Grey said when asked by Mr Rankin, it was verging on, if not completely, unmanageable. In my judgment the CCT should have realised at an early stage that they had, in fact, given Mr Grey far too much to do during this period. That objective assessment should have been done regardless of Mr Grey’s own views as to whether he could cope with the workload.  </p>

This meant that Mr Grey, having borne the lion’s share of the burden of the dialogue and evaluation stages of the procurement, then found himself in an equally (if not more) unenviable position regarding the burden of the litigation, including seeking to defend evaluations where other SMEs, not called as witnesses, had far more knowledge of the subject than he did.  </p>

However, regardless of those legal principles, the NDA’s decision in this respect had the following effect. Mr Grey commenced his cross-examination on Day 11, and finally finished towards the end of Day 14. Some of the NDA personnel involved in the specific evaluations being challenged gave no witness statements, and so were simply not cross-examined at all. It is entirely a matter for any party to litigation to decide upon whose evidence to rely. However, in this case Mr Grey found himself at the very centre of a great many of the challenges alleging manifest error. That was, in my judgment, directly as a result of the different decisions taken by the NDA. </p>

Human nature being what it is, they tended to agree with Mr Grey after he had changed the score. Indeed, there were no examples in the oral evidence of the SMEs refusing to agree to the unilaterally awarded different score. This effectively granted the lead SME the ability to arrive at a different score than the one that had initially been reached in consensus. When those changes were explained by Mr Grey as having been made as a result of the Burges Salmon Review, and that document had privilege asserted over it, it can be seen that the NDA were not in a readily defensible position when the scores were challenged in these proceedings as being manifestly erroneous.  </p>

She qualified in the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development in 1993 and became a Fellow in 2000, one of the requirements of Fellowship being prior experience of holding a board level position. She had worked as a consultant for a variety of organisations before joining the NDA, including for example working as HR Director for BAE Systems on the Eurofighter Typhoon programme. She had worked for Serco in its nuclear business and was involved in an intended bid by that organisation for the PBO role at Dounreay. In the event that bid was not made. However, she had prior experience of NDA procurement before becoming involved in this competition. She joined the NDA in May 2010, initially in an interim role and from November of that year she occupied a permanent position. Initially she was Head of Employee Relations but on 1 July 2012 that changed to Head of People Relations. On 1 April 2014 her job title changed again and she became what she now is, namely Head of HR Strategy and Delivery. She was therefore Head of People Relations during the Evaluation. She explained in her evidence that her job had three main parts, namely HR Strategy, Employee Relations and as an SME. HR Strategy involved developing the People Strategy on behalf of the NDA and working collaboratively with HR colleagues across the SLCs (in her own words) to “deliver the People and Skills outcomes identified by the Strategy”. She was also responsible for Employee Relations across the NDA Estate and worked with local and national trade unions to understand the industrial relations environment both in the SLCs and the NDA's subsidiaries. Thirdly, as an SME, she was the lead evaluator on any People and Nominated Staff matters relating to the employees and the Executive teams in the SLCs. This required her to give advice: </p>

These sections designed by her were the Nominated Staff and People Nodes for the Key Enablers section of the SORR. She is obviously a senior member of staff, and a person of considerable experience and expertise. She had used the approach that the NDA had adopted in the Dounreay competition as a starting point and then developed this further using her own knowledge and experience. The Key Enablers were the 11 Evaluation Nodes intended to test the bidders' proposals in relation to some of the areas that the NDA considered to be most important for the successful delivery of the contract.  </p>

There was also an air of unreality about some of her evidence. The following is also dealt with in respect of Node 303 in section B4 below, but is a good example of her approach. One of the criticisms made by the NDA of RSS’S response to Node 303 was the reference within it to MCP10 – this was said by the SMEs to be something that was not explained in the tender response, as a result of which the RSS bid was marked down. MCP10 was however an <span style="font-style:italic">existing</span> policy document, and was in fact made available by the NDA to all the bidders, as it was contained within the data room. It was the Management and Control Procedure 10 (hence MCP10) in force at the time of the bid for the Magnox sites, and was necessary to comply with the site nuclear licence conditions. One would have thought the SMEs would have known this, or certainly it was reasonable for the bidders to have expected at least one of the SMEs evaluating the Node to have known this. The field of nuclear decommissioning (and hence also this judgment) is replete with acronyms and three letter abbreviations (“TLAs”), and on occasion four or five letter abbreviations. Ms Hanson would not accept in cross examination that she should have known what MCP10 was, and she expressly stated that she had “no idea” what was in the data room. This did not seem to give her the remotest concern. She said: </p>

She was not being criticised in cross-examination for not knowing the detail of MCP10. When Mr Hunter QC put to her that at least one of the SMEs should have known what the current procedure in relation to this was, and that MCP10 had been provided to the bidders by the NDA itself in the data room, she expressly would not agree with these obvious points in Energy Solutions’ favour.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, it was not clear whether the NDA’s position was that none of the three SMEs knew what the reference “MCP10” meant, or that none of them could be expected to know the detail. Later during this same passage of evidence, Ms Hanson stated that she did in fact know, but was not allowed to use her existing background knowledge in this respect during evaluation, and that was the reason why the RSS bid was marked down. This was not persuasive, and is in any case highly artificial and wrong. In my judgment it is also verging on the ridiculous. An SME is expected to have a certain amount of existing knowledge, and to apply it; it is integral to being a SME. It would be rather odd for a Subject Matter Expert not to be permitted to apply the knowledge in which they were expert. Mr Rankin in his first witness statement explained that the SMEs were “selected based on their experience and knowledge of the nuclear sector as a whole, the particular sites within the Magnox &amp; RSRL SLCs and projects that were the focus of the Competition” {C/7/39}. There is no point in doing this, yet prohibiting the SMEs from using that very background existing knowledge in the process of evaluation. I consider this was a shift by Ms Hanson of her position during difficult questions to which there was only one sensible answer, which was that the SMEs had made an obvious and manifest error by not realising to what MCP10 referred. I found this evidence of considerable interest. It demonstrated, in my judgment, what was endemic throughout the evidence of most of the NDA witnesses, namely that they were prepared to defend what had been done in the evaluation process, regardless of logic. It is plain to me that the SMEs, at least in this respect, did not know what was in the data room, and had not understood the reference to MCP10. When confronted with this, Ms Hanson shifted her ground to find a different basis to justify marking the requirement as the NDA had at the time. </p>

Given MCP10 was placed in the data room and was provided by the NDA to the bidders, in my judgment that point should be answered with a rather obvious “yes”. </p>

She simply could not remember being involved. I do not criticise her for this. She explained to me that she had certain serious family issues in April 2014 as her mother had become terminally ill at the time. However – and this is to be taken as a criticism of the NDA, and not in any way a criticism of Ms Hanson – there was no formal (or even informal) handing over of her responsibility or involvement in drafting the relevant appendix, to anyone in particular, during what was obviously a difficult time personally for her, and a most important period for the NDA and the procurement. Ms Hanson assumed Sara Johnston, one of the other evaluators, had done this in her absence. She described Sara Johnston as the “port of call” when she, Ms Hanson, was not available. She therefore assumed that Ms Johnston had been involved but did not know. The precise authorship of the relevant appendix (and so many of the other appendices) therefore remained unclear. This is because the NDA did not properly organise (or if it did, that organisation was not explained, at least not to the court) the responsibility for drafting the detailed appendices that accompanied that letter.  </p>

The precise authorship of the different appendices is still unclear even after this trial. Very few, if anyone, at the NDA was prepared to accept primary (or any) responsibility for drafting the appendices that responded to the concerns raised by RSS over its tender. In my judgment, the letter was something that the NDA witnesses, as a whole, were not particularly enthusiastic with being associated with, and as individuals they readily disassociated themselves from it.  </p>

He joined the NDA in October 2011, having before that been with Scott Wilson and Capital Symonds, during which he had built up considerable experience of managing projects and programmes. During the competition he was an SME in relation to Node 307 Portfolio, Programme and Project Management. This was a Key Enabler Node. Andrea Livesey was the lead SME for this Node, project managed the competition and was on the Core Competition team. She was not called to give evidence. In the 11 months that Mr Miller was at the NDA prior to becoming involved in the competition, he had not managed any NDA projects or programmes.

The particular word “fundamentally” was important because of the definition of material omission in the SORR. An omission was material if it fundamentally undermined confidence. Even though this single word was expressly removed by – on Mr Miller’s account – all three SMEs acting in agreement, he insisted that the nature of the omissions was such that the confidence of the NDA was indeed “fundamentally undermined”. In other words, his evidence was that the removal of the word, agreed by all three of the SMEs, did not represent their final agreed view in evaluation. I reject that evidence. In my view, this was a clear mistake at the time by the SMEs as to what constituted a <span style="font-style:italic">material</span> omission. The removal of the word “fundamentally” strongly suggests that the omission(s) were not material.

In June 2006 she became Contract Manager for Magnox South. This was following a change in the NDA competition strategy – initially all contracts for decommissioning the Magnox sites were arranged on a site-by-site basis. This was changed, and the strategy became one whereby the Magnox decommissioning sites in the south of the UK were to be completed as the second PBO competition after the Low Level Waste Repository or LLWR. To this end, the sites were grouped into Magnox North and Magnox South.

The comments in relation to Requirement 306.5.1(n) stated that sufficient information in relation to improvement outcomes was not provided by RSS, and also specified that it did not appear “elsewhere in their response”. In cross-examination, her explanation for this shifted and I will return to this later in the judgment when I deal with the detail of the evaluation for that specific Node. However, it transpired that her evidence was that this entry did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>mean that the information was not to be found elsewhere in the response, but rather it did not appear in the relevant section. This amounted to meaning the information did not appear “here”, which was rather different to stating that it did not appear “elsewhere in their response”.

He was the Contract Manager for the Competition and was also on the Core Competition Team. He was also the person, according to Ms Dancy, who was responsible for preparing Appendix 9 to the Letter of Reasons, which was the appendix of detailed reasons that deals with this Node. He still works for the NDA and I was not given any explanation as to why he did not give evidence. At least so far as the CFP response to this Node is concerned (in distinction to the RSS response) a marked change in the scoring of that response in respect of Requirement 5.1(j) occurred during the evaluation phase. Initially, at the earlier stages of the consensus process, CFP had been given a mark of 1 by the three SMEs, which would have been a “below threshold” score leading to disqualification. Upon reflection by the evaluators, consideration of the same material saw this considerably improve to a mark of 4. The reflection, however, followed a conversation between Mr Godley and Mr Rankin. Mr Rankin was not an evaluator, lead or otherwise, and told me he had no input into the scoring. He said he could not remember the conversation. The best – indeed only – direct evidence from an evaluator of that important conversation would obviously have come from Mr Godley, given Mr Rankin appeared to have forgotten all about it. It is surprising that Mr Rankin would have no recall of such an important discussion, although the extent of his poor recall was not pursued to any great extent in crossexamination. Although he still works for the NDA, Mr Godley was not called as a witness.   </p>

Individual SMEs could only access and input into the "AWARD Notes Answer Book" their own individual entries until they reached the consensus meetings, which were held with the other SMEs on the particular Node.  The lead SME for an Evaluation Node had access to all the individual award notes, so he or she could read them, but was unable to edit them.  When the SMEs were working through the Requirements in a particular Evaluation Node, the screen would only show an individual Requirement, the scoring criteria (both as worded in the SORR) and a space for entering the note for one Requirement at a time. Mr Rankin explained in his evidence that there was a curiosity of the system as follows. Within the AWARD system, there were two options when an SME wanted to move to another Requirement, either to press the "Complete" or "In Progress" button.  However, one function of the software was that AWARD would default to marking a Requirement as "Complete" if an individual SME pressed "Next" without marking it as "In Progress".  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">It is not clear to me why any SME would fail to mark an entry as “In Progress” if they genuinely did intend to return to it. When the changes of score that occurred in respect of some of the Requirements come to be considered in detail, the status of the earlier entries as “Complete” is relied upon by Energy Solutions to demonstrate that the concluded view of the SME in question was a particular score. I deal with each of these instances individually. Regardless of that, however, if Mr Rankin is right and the SMEs did need “further guidance on the scoring, further clarification, or just more time to consider a point with a view to coming back to it later” then in my view this would have made it more, not less, likely that the SME in question would – and should -- have marked the entry as being “In Progress”. I find that the purpose of Mr Rankin’s evidence on this point was to try and dilute the force of any criticism by Energy Solutions concerning scores for entries that were marked “Complete” at the time, but then changed later. There is no particular reason to conclude generally that entries were accidentally marked as “Complete” because of Mr Rankin’s quirk of the system, rather than the SME choosing to mark it as “Complete” at the time (or not choosing to mark it as “In Progress”, which amounts to the same thing). Given this was purpose-designed software specifically for the NDA that had been used by the NDA before, unless there is other evidence from a SME that a particular entry was incorrectly labelled as “Complete”, I find that the way the AWARD system identified an entry as either “Complete” or “In Progress” constitutes an accurate description of the stage of evaluation that had been reached by that SME. That is not to say that “Complete” makes the view at that time wholly determinative; SMEs can change their minds and often did so. However, the lack of any explanation as to why such changes of mind occurred is something that in my judgment can be taken into account when considering whether any particular score has been reached manifestly erroneously. </p>

When the SMEs met in consensus, they met in specially allocated rooms with a single laptop, with the AWARD programme projected onto a screen. In this way all of the members of the SME team could see the entries.

This was, or should have been, the final stage in evaluation on any particular Requirement. In order to close down an Evaluation Node in AWARD, each member of the SME team had to sign a form to confirm that the scores and consensus entries were complete. That form was then passed to Claire Russell who would “close down” AWARD for that Evaluation Node, which meant that the lead SME no longer had access to it and could not make any further changes. In order to make any further changes, the lead SME was obliged to obtain authorisation from Mr Rankin to do so, and if that were given, Mr Rankin would instruct Claire Russell to open the Node again on AWARD so that changes could occur. There is a contentious point between the parties concerning this. Mr Rankin’s view is that this was perfectly permissible – as he put it:  </p>

In order to do so the lead SME needed to obtain authorisation from me.  If I thought it was appropriate I would authorise Claire Russell to open the Evaluation Node again. Until the evaluation period had ended, it was entirely right that SMEs could reflect, think again, and respond to challenges about their original scores and comments.  That is all part of a thorough and diligent process.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The position of Energy Solutions to the acceptability of this is somewhat different, and raises two important points. I summarise them. The first is that the consensus procedure was supposed to be used so that the SMEs would jointly arrive at the correct score. Once AWARD was closed and a particular score arrived at, that was prima facie the correct score. The second point is that once AWARD was closed, there was nowhere for any SMEs (or indeed anyone else) to record even the most basic thought processes that would, or in fact did, lead to a particular score being changed. Energy Solutions described AWARD generally as “a limited vehicle for recording individual views”, an expression I endorse and adopt. It should be remembered that after consensus had been completed, AWARD was formally “closed down” with each SME signing a sheet to that effect for a purpose. That purpose must have been to demonstrate that it was, indeed, “closed” and that the score had been finalised by the SMEs responsible. I find Mr Rankin’s attitude to the later changing of “complete” scores somewhat cavalier, if not glib. Indeed, his evidence that it was right that the SMEs be entitled to “respond to challenges about their original scores and comments” introduced a wholly new, separate and informal stage of the process that was never intended, namely the involvement of people other than the SMEs into the scoring process. The reason for having three separate SMEs independently considering the tender responses against the SORR at different stages (initial and final), with those SMEs then arriving at a consensus score, was so that the final score would be the independent conclusion of their separate and collective judgement. That was how the evaluation process was carefully designed. The “post-closed down” final, new, separate and informal stage permitted by Mr Rankin so that this consensus view could be changed (whether it is described accurately as a change, or as he did by way of “challenge”) was, in my judgment, not part of the process of evaluation as it was designed. It was also an extra stage fraught with danger for the NDA in this sense; it ran the obvious risk that depending upon who was doing the challenging, and why, and which parts of the consensus results were being challenged, and in respect of which bid, this informal stage may not have been applied equally to the different bidders.  It is also not transparent because no records are available of it. </p>

In this case the whole process and rationale for the changing of the consensus scores <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> AWARD had been closed is shrouded in mystery. This is because the post-AWARD closure discussion, who was involved, and their reasoning, was not recorded, or if it was, the records have not been made available. This whole episode in terms of evaluation appears to me to be contrary to the restrictions imposed by the NDA, for example, on the SMEs at the Final Review stage. The SMEs were instructed that they were only permitted to discuss the matter with the other SMEs and only in the Competition Office. This was perfectly sensible; it prevented the views of those who were not SMEs from being taken into account in the evaluation. But if such an instruction or rule is imposed, it is directly contrary to that to have unrecorded oral discussions leading to changes in the score <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>AWARD was closed (when final consensus score had been reached and signed off by the SMEs). </p>

I deal with this in the following section. This was a step in the process that could be described as “planned”, but does not seem to have been fully planned at the beginning to the same extent as it was in fact used. Exactly what its results were is not before the court as privilege is claimed in respect of it. </p>

The correction of the error increased the RSS score by 0.24%, narrowing the margin between RSS and CFP to 1.06%. It does not seem to have led to any specific review of the way that scores had been entered into AWARD after Nodes had been closed generally, or specifically by Mr Grey. If the closure of AWARD was to have had the effect explained, namely that no access would have been possible absent Competition Team approval, such an error simply could not have occurred.

Because if you lead a bidder up the garden path, that is likely to amount to a breach of transparency, so if they act in reliance on what's been done.

Although it is one thing to state that something is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> acceptable or does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>meet the requirements, the converse cannot be relied upon to justify a claim that a particular score should have been given because one part of the bid was not indicated as not being acceptable (using the double negative specifically). To hold otherwise would be to impose an obligation upon a contracting authority to notify a potential bidder (or all the potential bidders) where in their draft submissions they could or should improve the content. To do this would be to impose an impossible burden upon contracting authorities. There was a requirement for consistency, such that the NDA were not entitled to state one thing concerning proposed solutions to the bidder in the dialogue process, but then evaluate the tender submitted on a wholly different basis. However, in my judgment the challenges to the scores do not fall into that rather stark category.  </p>

Mr Grey’s evidence on this is rather telling. Not only is it directly contrary to that of the Head of Competition, it is also at odds with the express terms of the training materials which were used to brief and train the SMEs. The second bullet point in the Introduction states “Integrity of evaluation pivotal to success – design, implementation and consistency from dialogue phase” {R/8/2}. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The reason that this is, in my judgment, a notable point is Mr Grey was performing evaluations on more individual nodes than any other single SME, (and who at one stage was planned potentially to be doing all the evaluations on all of the nodes). He plainly did not believe that he had to be personally consistent. He therefore did not know (or if he did know, did not apply or follow that knowledge) that the NDA required the SMEs to be consistent in their evaluations with the feedback given to bidders. Also, inconsistency in treatment of different bidders can amount to unequal treatment. One specific example of this concerns Requirement 411.5.3(c), and Dungeness. RSS was marked down, and given a score of 1 not 3, for not identifying either the AETP or the saline groundwater pumping system as key critical assets. However, CFP did not identify either of those as key critical assets either. It is a point for consideration as to whether either were key critical assets. But if they were, then they must have been key critical assets for both bids, or not key critical assets for both bids. Both bids should have been marked on the same basis. There can be no justification, in my judgment, where there is an obligation of equal treatment, for scoring the RSS bid as though these were key critical assets that were missing (justifying a 1) yet overlooking that omission in the CFP bid (and giving that bidder a score of 3).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">The second notable point is that the NDA personnel kept no records of the dialogue. Given that no records were kept of this important period which lasted several months, the only way in which the consistency sensibly required by the NDA and of which Mr Rankin told me the SMEs were aware (because he had told them) would have been their memories. Mr Rankin accepted that the way that the SMEs would achieve consistency would be by memory, as there were effectively no notes kept {Day9-NC/30}. Given the breadth of material, I find this evidence verging on incredible. Mr Rankin explained in his evidence that the four tender responses comprised some 84 boxes of material, or 364 files {C/7/49}. Mr Rankin stated that such an exercise required “significant project management” and I agree. However, that project management does not seem to have involved any mechanism or process whereby there was any proper record available to the SMEs of what had occurred during the dialogue process. It is difficult to see how consistency was going to be achieved in those circumstances. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">It is however consistent with the NDA’s attitude towards keeping records of the evaluation, which I deal with elsewhere. A major aspect of the explanation for this given by the NDA in closing submissions was that it would have been too logistically demanding to record anything that took place in the dialogue meetings. I find this explanation as weak as it is surprising. A summary should not have been too difficult to prepare, and there would not necessarily have been any need to have such a summary formally agreed with each bidder, which was one of the “logistical difficulties” identified. Not only that, but preparation of separate records would not necessarily have been required in any event. Digital recording devices are widely available and inexpensive. Simply recording what was said would not have been too difficult. In the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century, there must have been a better way of ensuring consistency from the dialogue stage than the SMEs’ memories. </p>

Accordingly, regardless of their status as potentially subject to legal privilege or not (because legal professional privilege has been claimed by the NDA for all documents created by Burges Salmon) the existence or content of such notes does not have any effect upon this unsatisfactory aspect of the way this phase of the competition was organised. <br/></p>

These were summarised and included “taking informed, transparent decisions and managing risk” as well as others such as maintaining strict commercial confidentiality and avoiding any actual or perceived conflict of interest.

The scope of the audit included looking at the clarifications raised by SMEs on the bidders' tender responses, attending consensus meetings as an observer and checking the scoring for the consensus award meetings to ensure that the scoring agreed at the meetings was reflected in the entries entered into AWARD. </p>

At certain points, namely those that represented a significant transition from one stage to another, approval had to be sought from HM Treasury to proceed.  These were called Treasury Approval Points (TAPs).  The Major Projects Authority (MPA) of the Cabinet Office also undertook what were called gateway reviews at key stages of the Competition. This is because this project was a major UK Government project which was part of the Government Major Project Portfolio. There were two additional interim reviews conducted by the MPA during the dialogue period (Gate 3) in July 2013 and a Transition Readiness Review, also referred to as a Project Assessment Review during the evaluation period in February 2014. </p>

The Delivery Confidence Assessment uses a five point "traffic light" system known as the RAG (Red–Amber–Green) scale.  Green indicates that the successful delivery of the project to time, cost and quality appears highly likely and that there are no major outstanding issues that appear to threaten delivery of the project significantly. Amber/Green means successful delivery appears probable but constant attention would be needed to ensure risks did not materialise into major issues threatening delivery. For the Competition, the Delivery Confidence Assessment given by the MPA was either "Green" or "Amber Green" demonstrating a high level of confidence in the delivery of the Competition.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Rankin and the NDA were obviously drawing my attention to this to demonstrate that the “audits” or checks upon how the NDA had run the competition were satisfied. However, I do not accept that such audits would, or could, have considered the material in the same way that was done at the trial. Energy Solutions had to demonstrate manifest error in order for any of its challenges to succeed. The consideration of that meant that the court heard submissions and evidence based on the scoring criteria in the SORR, the content of the Tender Submissions, the reasons provided by the NDA and the entries in AWARD. I do not believe that any of the governmental steps to which Mr Rankin referred would have looked at the same material in the same way. Therefore, the “green lights” in the Delivery Confidence Assessment or approvals by HM Treasury for expenditure, whilst a good thing, do not provide any defence to the substantive challenges by Energy Solutions.  </p>

Secondly, the use of the word “therefore” means that the decision that the SMEs should not write on hard copy documents was (at least in part, if not wholly) motivated by the knowledge that if a document were written on, it must be kept for audit purposes.

There is no record of the conversation between Mr Godley and Mr Rankin that led to the SMEs moving, in just a few minutes, from a conclusion that there was no necessary process or evidence such that CFP should be given a score of 1, to a conclusion that the necessary references could be “inferred” and the correct score was one of 4. Even without the obvious impact upon the overall score of the CFP bid, which would determine who would be the winning bidder, that conclusion helped CFP to avoid being disqualified entirely. Mr Rankin even said he had no recollection of this conversation at all. How that can be reconciled with a submission by the NDA that the process was “appropriately or sufficiently recorded and documented” is a mystery to me. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">It is therefore clear that at one stage (and the relevant version of the training slides is dated October 2013, which is very close to the beginning of the evaluation phase) it was obviously intended by the NDA that any hard copy notes that the SMEs took during the evaluation process would be shredded. This is in the context of a major procurement competition of public importance with a very high financial value measured in billions of pounds, with clear obligations of transparency upon the NDA. That intention, which is expressed within a sentence that starts “as a matter of policy”, was sufficiently well-developed to make its way into training materials for the SMEs, and also to be printed on the foot of the Clarification Note sheets themselves. In my judgment it is wholly unacceptable for a publicly funded body such as the NDA ever to consider a policy of shredding notes because they may become subject to disclosure in subsequent legal proceedings. This was then changed, and on 18 October 2013 the slides were amended. In this version SMEs were told they were only to keep notes on the AWARD system, which is an electronic package for evaluating the tenders. The SMEs were told they “must not record paper notes either on the copies of the bid that are provided or in their own notes books”. However, the end result of that different approach was essentially the same so far as paper notes were concerned – there were to be none available. None of the SMEs were allowed to keep any of their own notes, certainly not in the form in which a great many people actually take notes, namely in hard copy. In other words, the same ends were achieved, but in a different way. </p>

He expressed similar if not greater surprise about the references to shredding, because he told me it would have been contrary to NDA policy to have suggested shredding or destruction of notes. He said, initially, that the NDA did not tell the SMEs not to keep notes. He then changed this, and stated they were allowed to keep notes but they had to keep them on AWARD. Given he was the Head of Competition, he was either not being frank with me, or he was wholly unaware of detailed preparatory steps that were taken to train SMEs, the contents of the training material, and the fact that one version instructed them that their notes would be shredded. Either of the alternatives – lack of frankness, or being wholly unaware - is wholly unsatisfactory, to say the least. In my judgment, the former is the more likely explanation, but regardless of that, it does not make much difference because the outcome is the same in any event. The sensitivity of the NDA to potential challenge meant that positive steps were taken to restrict, so much as possible, the amount of evaluation material available to a disappointed bidder for review.  </p>

It does not appear from that Flowchart that this intention was ever consciously abandoned, at least not so far as the Clarification Notes were concerned. I cannot think of any reason why a body such as the NDA should have contemplated shredding any documents created in this procurement competition. There are a great many good reasons to the contrary, justifying why no such shredding should have been contemplated, but it is perhaps necessary only to identify the most important one, namely the obligation of transparency. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">One of the explanations given by Mr Rankin {Day9-NC/162} for the NDA’s approach to notes was that the disclosure process would be easier if all the notes were kept in one place, namely AWARD, and that was the reason that the NDA forbade the SMEs from keeping paper notes. I do not accept that this was the only, or even the prime, reason. If it had been, there would never have been any need for any training slides to state with such clarity the intention to shred notes, and the email from “Steve and Andrea” would have been worded very differently. I do not accept it is a good reason in any event. The whole approach of the NDA to restricting notes in this way seems to have been designed to minimise the degree of scrutiny to which the SMEs thought processes could be subject, in the event of a challenge. A simple method of ensuring that such notes were retained – for example, by issuing numbered notebooks, and collecting them – would have easily dealt with any difficulties, real or imagined, with potential disclosure. </p>

It is no answer, in my view, for Mr Rankin simply to state that notes could be kept in AWARD. Firstly, unless a particular person wishes to work in that particular way, it is not necessarily easy to keep sensible or comprehensive notes on such a system. The SMEs were given hard copies of the tender responses; they should have been permitted to keep their own hard copy notes had they so wished. Secondly, Mr Rankin was not particularly enthusiastic about the SMEs keeping notes on AWARD either as the passage from his evidence on this point makes clear, quoted above in Section V of this judgment {Day9-NC/171}. </p>

I was told in evidence that decisions to change scores that had been “closed” in AWARD were made following oral discussions or telephone calls. Certainly no records of these have been disclosed, which means that the only way such discussions could have taken place would have been oral. This is wholly lacking in transparency. </p>

In one of those, the NDA policy is stated as being wholly to the contrary of what Mr Rankin told me it was. I reject his evidence on this subject as being an attempt to deflect attention away from this. I find the NDA was concerned that too much note taking, or too great availability of notes, or too full a record of the evaluation, would render it more difficult for the NDA to deal with a legal challenge – as Mr Rankin put it “I was very aware that could attract the attention of disappointed bidders”. Mr Rankin’s approach to SMEs keeping fulsome notes on AWARD was part of this. There was a real reluctance on the part of the NDA to have too full a record by the SMEs of their thought processes of the important evaluation stage. This was highly likely, in my judgment, to have been influenced (if not entirely driven) by the NDA’s sensitivity to a potential legal challenge. I do not understand such sensitivity. Indeed, the more comprehensive and robust the record of the SMEs evaluation, the stronger the NDA would have been in terms of any challenge, assuming the evaluation was done correctly. Thus, ironically, in my judgment the NDA’s approach to note-taking ran counter to its objective. </p>

In my judgment, that rather misses the point, because it is as though the NDA now seek to excuse the approach adopted during SME training by demonstrating that the intention either changed, or was not carried out. In my judgment, the need for transparency in the evaluation was never sufficiently grasped by the NDA. This has led to important matters, such as the lack of any records of most important conversations such as the one between Mr Godley and Mr Rankin concerning the CFP Tender Response to Node 303, being dealt with in a manner that is wholly contrary to the obligation of transparency. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">As well as an associate of Burges Salmon being present at some of the dialogue meetings, there was a step in the evaluation process called “the Burges Salmon Review”. The purpose of this was explained as a “legal review”. Initially on 4 December 2013 members of that firm undertook a legal review of the requests for clarification that had been raised by the SMEs, the redacted responses and the scores and consensus comments of selected Requirements where consensus had taken place. This review concentrated on the score and comments to “examine whether the comments appeared to be consistent with the score and appeared to have applied the appropriate evaluation methodology for the Requirement as set out in the SORR”. They also checked to see if the SMEs had been consistent in their approach to different bidders. Further visits took place on 27-29 January, 5-6 February, 24-25 February, and 3-4 March 2015. On these occasions Burges Salmon undertook what was called “a legal review” of the reports for the Evaluation Nodes which had recently been through consensus and any new clarification requests and responses.  On their first three visits Burges Salmon only carried out legal reviews against those Evaluation Nodes where the consensus award record sheet had been signed off by the SMEs and the relevant Requirement closed. Subsequently Mr Rankin took the decision that Burges Salmon should carry out its legal review before the consensus award record sheets were signed off.  He did this because it saved “on the administration involved in closing down and reopening the Requirement in AWARD.”  This therefore meant that Burges Salmon became intimately involved in the process whereby particular scores were arrived at. By the time the evaluation process was completed, the Burges Salmon team had carried out a legal review of the scores and consensus comments for all the Evaluation Nodes (with the exception of the Overall Costs Summary Evaluation Node which had not been evaluated by then) at least once, and in some cases more than once. </p>

A claim of legal professional privilege was made by the NDA in respect of categories (i) and (ii), and such documents within category (iii) that involved communications to and from Burges Salmon. A witness statement was provided by the NDA from Clare Poulter, the Head of Procurement at the NDA for the application. This stated that the role of Burges Salmon had been to identify whether the evaluation methodology had been properly and consistently applied, and this involved providing legal advice and the application of legal expertise. This involvement by Burges Salmon was initially intended to be by way of “sample checks” but was reconsidered after the evaluation process had been commenced. This was because a legal challenge from a bidder was considered to be “the top risk” to the competition and because “greater legal input” was required into the process.  </p>

The document "Parent Body Organisation Competition Programme Governance Arrangements PBOC – 019" {W/91/1} made clear that the “Good Governance Standard for Public Services” applied to this competition. This standard is stated in that document as being based on Nolan principles. These principles are taken from the publication on 31 May 1995 by the Committee on Standards in Public Life of “The 7 Principles of Public Life” chaired by Lord Nolan.

It is not relevant to speculate whether the NDA has made its task of defending these claims more or less difficult by its approach. For the avoidance of doubt, I am not asked by Energy Solutions to consider whether that assertion of privilege amounts to a breach of the NDA’s obligation of transparency. The court can only consider the material before it when weighing the claims by Energy Solutions of manifest errors in valuation. However, the absence of reasoning for any particular score (particularly where that score was changed from a far higher one without explanation) cannot help the organisation that gave that particular score, namely the NDA. In this sense, the reliance on legal privilege by the NDA will not necessarily assist it in its defence to the claims brought by Energy Solutions.  </p>

The consideration and application of “manifest error” is dealt with further below, but the exercise undertaken in this judgment is not a remarking exercise. Agreed Issue 1 effectively recites that the test is one of manifest error. Absent a finding of manifest error or other unlawfulness as set out in Agreed Issue 1(a) on any of the Requirements, consideration of Agreed Issue 1(b) simply does not arise. There are separate considerations in respect of what were called “Threshold Issues”. This term refers to elements of the Tender Submissions that had to reach a certain standard – either Threshold, or a Pass – and a failure to meet this standard would potentially have the result that the tenderer in question faced disqualification. Section IX – C “CFP Threshold Issues” deals with these, and Section C1 considers the legal principles relevant to disqualification.

It was established to meet decommissioning needs in the nuclear industry in the general interest, and it is financed by the Secretary of State. At the risk of stating the obvious, the nuclear industry is a heavily regulated one and the NDA’s sites are closely regulated by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (“ONR”), the Environment Agency, the Department of Transport and, depending upon their location, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Natural Resources Wales. The NDA does not perform the actual decommissioning and clean-up activities of nuclear facilities itself. This is done by the SLCs on its behalf. Private sector contractors act as PBOs for the SLCs and these private sector contractors are selected following procurement exercises. Each nuclear site has what is called a life time plan or LTP which sets out the NDA’s strategy for that site, and this will include milestones along the time line of decommissioning from their current state to their end state. This is the end result of the decommissioning, and an important milestone along the path to the end state is when the site has reached something which is called the Interim State. There are site-specific variations to that because at Winfrith there is something called an Interim End State (or “IES”). This is where further risk reduction is achieved by means of monitored radioactive decay rather than physical restoration work. </p>

The competitive dialogue procedure was introduced by the Public Sector Directive because contracting authorities, on particularly complex projects, may have found it objectively impossible to define the means of satisfying their needs (or assessing what the market could offer to that authority by way of technical solutions). Such definition would be required or necessary if an authority were to use the open or restricted procedure. The competitive dialogue procedure is more flexible, and allows the authority to discuss the aspects of the contract with the tenderers, whilst still preserving competition between economic operators.

It does however add an extra stage of factual background into the procurement, because the tenderers engaged in a period of dialogue with the NDA prior to finalising their bids. Drafts of the bids were submitted by the tenderers to the NDA for comment during this period; these were called “interim drops”. The NDA had run other procurement processes before the one the subject of these proceedings, most recently before this, one for the facilities at Dounreay. Dounreay is the UK’s former centre of fast reactor research, and many of the personnel involved in this competition (both at the NDA, and Energy Solutions) had been involved in that competition previously. Energy Solutions had been unsuccessful in its attempt to obtain the contract to become the PBO for </p>

It had sought to do so in conjunction with AMEC Nuclear Holdings Ltd (“AMEC”), those two companies forming a consortium called Caithness Solutions. Some members of the Energy Solutions team involved in this procurement, who had been similarly involved in the Dounreay competition, explained in their evidence that the lessons that had been learned on the Dounreay competition were taken into account in the approach that Energy Solutions adopted for this procurement. Similarly, NDA personnel involved in both competitions undoubtedly drew on their previous procurement experience in the Dounreay competition. </p>

Once the dialogue was concluded, the different bidders submitted their final tenders. The most economically advantageous tender (or MEAT) was to be chosen. Deciding which bid was the most economically advantageous was done in this procurement by marking each bid against the scoring criteria. The financial elements of the different bids were assessed by the commercial teams and the technical elements were assessed by the technical teams. Care was taken by the NDA to ensure that the commercial aspects of the bids were not communicated to the technical SMEs so that the different solutions that were being considered and marked on their technical merit would not be affected by the financial consequences of those solutions. </p>

Section 5.1(a) of the ITSFT stated that there was to be an initial assessment after which “non-compliant bids will be rejected”, and after that a detailed evaluation exercise would be conducted with the Tender Responses evaluated against the criteria and weightings set out in Appendix 7 (the Evaluation Framework), and in further detail in Appendix 11 (Statement of Response Requirement) and Appendix 14 (Commercial (Contract Terms) Evaluation). Section 5(3)(a) of the ITSFT indicated that the Tender Responses would be assessed “on the basis of the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (Level 1)”. Section 5(3)(b) stated that weighting had been applied to what were termed Level 2 criteria, and Appendix 7 illustrated the criteria and sub-criteria to Level 3. The weighting to the Level 2 criteria was in section 5(3)(c) and was in the following percentages: </p>

Within each Evaluation Node for Key Enablers and Technical Scope, the bidders were required to respond to a number of detailed requirements. These were set out in Section 5 of the SORR for each Evaluation Node and were separately numbered. As an example of nomenclature, Requirement 5.1(a) of Evaluation Node 405 is referred to as Evaluation Node 405.5.1(a). Depending upon how many of the detailed Requirements were addressed in the response to that section or Requirement, the bidders would receive a score. The score varied but would typically be either 1, 3 or 5. 3 was defined as “Fair”, and 5 as “Excellent”. 1 was defined as “Unacceptable”. Appendix 2 contained Tables which contained what was called the Scoring Matrix. This set out the criteria for different scores. The criteria were clearly supposed to be applied fairly and objectively to the different bidders’ Tender Submissions to arrive at the correct scores for the different Requirements. These scores, with the necessary adjustment for weighting, would then provide a percentage total so that the most economically advantageous tender could be identified.   </p>

A different way of expressing the same principle is to state that a contracting authority that has set rules for that procedure must follow them, applying those rules in the same way to the different bidders. Changing the decision-making procedure during the process of assessment risks arbitrariness and favouritism, a risk that it is the purpose of such requirements to avoid.

This letter asserted that the RSS Tender Response had been underscored by at least 6.02%, and highlighting some key points. Questions and requests for information were raised in 11 Appendices.

The NDA provided some reasons by its letter dated 31 March 2014 and certain spreadsheets that were said to be “a statement of the reasoning for [RSS’s and CFP's] scores” (although some cells in the spreadsheets had been redacted). The NDA also provided a letter dated 11 April 2014 {U/23/1-2} which Energy Solutions refers to as the “Supplementary Reasons Letter”. This letter also has numerous appendices; very few of the NDA witnesses were prepared to admit to having had very much to do with the drafting of these appendices. In the letter of 11 April 2014 the NDA refuted the suggestion that the RSS Tender Response had been incorrectly scored. The NDA stated that RSS had identified what were, in reality, differences of opinion between its own experts in the bid teams and the NDA’s SMEs. One particular point that is worthy of individual comment at this stage is that RSS asked questions of the NDA that effectively stated that the way CFP’s Tender Response had been scored in certain respects had led to CFP avoiding a situation where it failed threshold requirements. Had it done so, the NDA would have had to exclude CFP from the competition. The NDA interpreted the questions from RSS in that way and replied as follows {U/23/1}.

The reason for this dispute about the title that should be applied to the letter (which might be thought otherwise to be an irrelevant squabble) is an important difference between the parties about which of the reasons given by the NDA the court is entitled to consider, when deciding the question of unlawfulness, and at what stage the court does so. In some instances Energy Solutions maintains that the NDA has changed its reasons for having given the RSS Tender Response particular scores. The NDA does not seem, on the face of it, to accept this, but if it has changed the reasons upon which it relies it might be thought not to be a promising start to defend its own scoring of the RSS Tender Response which is under attack in the Energy Solutions claim. Energy Solutions submits that it is only the reasons in the two letters that I may consider, as a matter of law, when deciding the question of unlawfulness. If I decide that the decisions made by NDA were unlawful, then I would come to consider other reasons given (either in the pleadings including the Further Information, or the evidence) as part of causation. In opening, the NDA submitted that I should take all the reasons into account when considering unlawfulness; by closing submissions, that position had modified a little but the NDA did not formally agree that the analysis submitted by Energy Solutions was correct. Agreed Issue 2 sets out the different approach of the parties. I deal with this subject under the heading “Reasons given by the NDA” below.  </p>

The CJEU has held that, while it would be compatible with the Remedies Directive to exclude an individual member of a consortium from bringing a claim alone to set aside or annul a contracting authority’s decision, it would be incompatible with that Directive to exclude such an individual member (such as Energy Solutions in this case) from bringing a claim for damages alone: see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">C-145/08 Club Hotel Loutraki AE v Ethniko Simvoulio Radiotileorassis</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>[2010] 3 CMLR 33 {AB/19/1} per AG Sharpston at [AG95, 111-118, 121, 124], and the Court at [72], [79]-[80]. In this case, the NDA refused to extend the standstill period within which, if proceedings are issued, the authority would be prevented by the automatic suspension from entering into the contract with the successful tenderer CFP. Indeed, the fact that Energy Solutions issued proceedings outside that period was one of the areas of consideration under the first of the preliminary issues that was decided on appeal to the Court of Appeal from Edwards-Stuart J. The NDA had argued that this was a break in the chain of causation. This point will now be considered by the Supreme Court. This is a claim for damages by Energy Solutions alone, without the involvement of Bechtel, and this is permitted as to prevent a member of a consortium from being able to do so individually would be incompatible with the Directive. </p>

It was because the claim was an action for breach of statutory duty that it had to be compared, in order to give effect to the EU law principle of equivalence, to other such duties.

The NDA, upon advice, took certain anticipatory steps for the procurement in terms of training the SMEs and preparation for the evaluation. The detail of this has been set out above, but in my judgment the procedure that the NDA adopted involved certain conscious decisions (which I find curious) in terms of record keeping that must have made evaluation far more difficult for the SMEs than would otherwise be the case. The motivation, it appears to me, seems to have been as much to make the NDA immune from challenge, as it was to ensure that there would be no grounds for challenge in the first place. Serious consideration seems to have been given to restricting the keeping of contemporaneous records of evaluation, because it was known these would be disclosable in any litigation. Of course, had the evaluation process been performed in accordance with the NDA’s obligations under the Regulations, disclosure of the records of that process would present no danger to the NDA (assuming the evaluation was done without manifest error) because they would constitute what was described as an “audit trail” of the NDA’s collective decisionmaking. </p>

It is in matters of judgement or assessment that the NDA has what has been called a “margin of appreciation”. Accordingly, where an evaluative judgement has been involved in arriving at the score awarded (as here), this “margin of appreciation” is brought to bear in considering whether there has been a manifest error. The court will not substitute its own view for what the score should have been just because that score might be different to the one arrived at by the SMEs. In my judgment, the NDA’s pleaded sentence that “An evaluative judgement of this sort is not capable of constituting a manifest error” is wrong, in so far as it suggests a prohibition upon finding manifest error where an evaluative judgement has been applied. There is no prohibition, but there is a margin of appreciation. Differences of opinion are not sufficient to have the score changed. Absent a manifest error, the court will not interfere.   </p>

Failure to comply with the obligation to give reasons warrants the annulment of a decision. If further information is requested by the tenderer, such information may be taken into account (provided it does not conflict with what has previously been stated).

A council had notified the appellant that a finding of intentional homelessness against him was based on its lack of satisfaction that he had experienced harassment in Greece (as he claimed), their enquiries in that respect having not been answered. By the hearing of the application, the council had accepted that the reasons notified to the applicant were not their true reasons, but submitted affidavit evidence stating what their true reasons were. On appeal against the decision of a Deputy Judge (who had admitted the evidence), the Court of Appeal held that if no reasons, or wholly deficient reasons, had been given at the same time as the decision itself had been communicated, an applicant was prima facie entitled to have the decision quashed as unlawful. The court would admit evidence to elucidate or, exceptionally, correct or add to the reasons given by a housing authority, but it would be very cautious about doing so, and the function of such evidence would generally be elucidation, not fundamental alteration.  </p>

One is to enable the persons concerned to be aware of, and consider, the reasons so that they can, if necessary, defend their rights. The second is to enable the court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. That latter purpose would be wholly undermined, or rendered of no effect, if those reasons could arbitrarily be substituted or replaced throughout the proceedings. Of course, the cases make it clear that in exceptional circumstances that can be done, but Mr Giffin QC does not contend that this is an exceptional case and in my judgment he is right to adopt that approach. In a claim for damages, other reasons (whether different to the original ones or not) can and should be considered when the court comes to consider causation. But the primary issue the court is required to consider, before it comes to consider causation and damages, is whether there has been the necessary breach of statutory duty or not, so that a conclusion can be reached whether the procurement process has been unlawful, or not.  </p>

However, I do not consider that in any of the cases relevant to the failure to give adequate reasons which are analysed above, is the validity of an applicant’s claim for damages frozen in time at the date of the application to the court, and the validity of that claim analysed solely by reference to the reasons provided to the applicant at the time the legal proceedings were issued. Further reasons put forward by an authority that post-date the application can and should be considered, because of the necessity for a causal link between the making of an unlawful decision, and loss suffered by the applicant.

The passage in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Harmon</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>at paragraph [239] makes it clear that the reasons being considered were those for rejection of Harmon’s tender. The reasons for the award that were prepared at the time were not recorded at all; there was no evaluation of the different tenders in the sense that term is now normally understood. The House of Commons also negotiated with the successful tenderer prior to awarding the contract to it, did not negotiate with Harmon in the same way or at all, and also committed the tort of misfeasance in public office in doing so (point (14) in the headnote and paragraphs [241] to [256]). The reasons to which the Judge referred, upon which the House of Commons wished to rely, were stated by him in paragraph [239] as “certainly cannot be ones which either were not held at the time when the decision was taken or which were or might have been held but were not recorded as such”. The reasons were also wholly different to the ones stated at the time. He also held that such reasons “have also to be tied back to the grounds upon which the contract could properly be awarded”. In my judgment that case should be seen as confined to its own particular and highly unusual facts. If it does have any wider application on this particular point, it should indeed be confined to cases where the authority seeks to substitute an entirely new set of reasons of an entirely different character. I certainly do not read it as making a positive finding that is contrary to my findings in paragraph 250 of this judgment concerning reasons which must be considered as a matter of causation.  </p>

However, given the requirement for causation to be demonstrated in any event in a claim for damages, which is what these proceedings consist of, the essence of the test advocated for by the NDA in Agreed Issue 2(ii) does fall to be considered when analysing what the correct score would or should have been. That stage is only reached if a Claimant succeeds in demonstrating manifest error on the reasons available at the time that proceedings are issued. However, it does not mean that the NDA is shut out from relying upon other reasons that post-date the issue of proceedings when challenging causation.  </p>

In each case, the nature and extent of the reasons will be fact-specific. In terms of the further reasons that were requested in this case, RSS (and Energy Solutions) was anxious to discern more of the reasoning that had led to the outcome of the procurement competition, no doubt in order that it could consider its legal position. There is nothing wrong with that – this is one of the functions of the Regulations that require such reasons. It is an express requirement of Regulation 32(2)(b) that such reasons are communicated, and the authority would have known throughout any procurement that this is required. It can hardly therefore have come as a surprise to the NDA. The reasons provided should amount to sufficient information to satisfy the Regulations. One of the purposes of the reasons is to enable unsuccessful tenderers to decide whether to defend their rights by issuing proceedings. Such reasons ought to be readily available to the contracting authority because they are (or should be) the reasons why an authority has already acted as it has, by the time the tender award notification has been issued. They also ought to be broadly accurate. Of course they are not going to be of the same nature and detail as a fully (or even partly) pleaded case, and in my judgment Energy Solutions is not claiming that they should be. But where (as here) the RSS Tender Response was scored on a particular requirement under an Evaluation Node as meriting a mark of 1 (or sometimes a 3), the reason for that ought to be readily capable of being provided. My findings on admissibility of reasons going to the consideration of unlawfulness at Stage 1 should not be seen as requiring anything out of the ordinary for a sensibly organised procurement exercise that is conducted transparently. There is certainly no intention within this judgment to impose any extra burden upon authorities in providing such reasons, or to insist upon a counsel of perfection.  </p>

This was made clear in the letter of 31 March 2014 notifying RSS of the award {U/1/1}. It was therefore essential for RSS, or any unsuccessful tenderer, to have sufficient information as quickly as possible, particularly if RSS were to issue proceedings within the relevant period to trigger the automatic suspension of the contract award to CFP. Secondly, the NDA was later asked by RSS to extend the standstill period and refused to do so. Given the time that the procurement exercise had been underway – the notice was in the OJEU in July 2012, and dialogue had gone on from January to October 2013 – and the scale and complexity of the subject matter – a maximum duration of the contract term of 14 years, with funding in the region of £4.211 billion – it might be thought that any pressure of time in this period at the very end of the process was brought about by the NDA itself. To be fair to Mr Rankin, he did not make this his major point, and in my view he was right not to do so. Section V of this judgment which deals with the witnesses also addresses some characteristics of the letter of 11 April 2014 and the NDA witnesses’ reluctance to admit to any authorship of it. </p>

One mistake might give the unsuccessful tenderer a total for that page that is 10 marks <span style="font-style:italic">fewer </span>than the correct arithmetic total for the individual scores on that page; an error on another page might give the unsuccessful tenderer a total 10 marks <span style="font-style:italic">higher</span>. Each would be an obvious error when looked at in isolation, but they would have made no difference in practice to the outcome of the scoring. Another example, put forward by Mr Howell QC in his oral closing submissions, was where there could be four reasons identified by the NDA for giving a score of 3 (rather than 5) for a particular Requirement. Three reasons might be perfectly valid and correct, the fourth obviously wrong. In those circumstances the court would not interfere with the scoring of that Requirement; there would have been a manifest error, but it would not have been material.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;margin-right:1.01in">"In neither EU nor domestic law is there an articulation of what is understood by "manifest". The phrase is defined in dictionaries as something which is: readily perceived, clear, evident, clearly apparent, obvious or plain. The etymology is from the Latin "manifestus" - palpable or manifest. These definitions are helpful only to a degree. What has to be "manifest" is the inappropriateness of a measure. There are two broad types of case where inappropriateness is put in issue. First, where it is said that a measure is vitiated by a clearly identifiable and material error. These are the relatively easy cases because the error can be identified and determined and its materiality assessed. The error may be a legal one, e.g. the measure is on its face discriminatory on grounds of nationality (as in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R v Secretary of State for Transport ex Parte Factortame</span> [1991] ECR I-3905). It may be a glaring error in logic or reasoning or in process. But even here there are complications since whilst it is true that an error which is plain or palpable or obvious on the face of the record may easily be termed "manifest" that cannot be the end of the story. An error which is clear and obvious may nonetheless not go to the root of the measure; it might be peripheral or ancillary and as such would not make the disputed measure manifestly inappropriate. Equally an error which is far from being obvious or palpable may nonetheless prove to be fundamental. For instance a decision or measure based upon a conclusion expressed mathematically might have been arrived at through a serious error of calculation. The fact that the calculation is complex and that only an accountant, econometrician or actuary might have exclaimed that it was an "obvious" error or a "howler", and even then only once they had performed complex calculations, does not mean that the error is not manifest. An error in the placing of a decimal point may exert profound consequences upon the logic of a measure. This suggests that manifest in/appropriateness is essentially about the nature, and, or centrality/materiality of an error. <span style="text-decoration:underline">An error will be manifest</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">when (assuming it is proven) it goes to the heart of the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">impugned measure and would make a real difference to the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">outcome</span>."  </p>

It would be rather surprising if, in the example given above concerning two basic arithmetical errors, each incorrect by 10 marks but cancelling each other out, it could properly be said that adding 2 and 3 together to give an answer of 15 is not a “manifest error”.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;margin-right:1.01in">"In neither EU nor domestic law is there an articulation of what is understood by "manifest". The phrase is defined in dictionaries as something which is: readily perceived, clear, evident, clearly apparent, obvious or plain. The etymology is from the Latin "manifestus" - palpable or manifest. These definitions are helpful only to a degree. What has to be "manifest" is the inappropriateness of a measure. There are two broad types of case where inappropriateness is put in issue. First, where it is said that a measure is vitiated by a clearly identifiable and material error. These are the relatively easy cases because the error can be identified and determined and its materiality assessed. The error may be a legal one, e.g. the measure is on its face discriminatory on grounds of nationality (as in R v Secretary of State for Transport ex Parte Factortame [1991] ECR I-3905). It may be a glaring error in logic or reasoning or in process. But even here there are complications since whilst it is true that an error which is plain or palpable or obvious on the face of the record may easily be termed "manifest" that cannot be the end of the story. An error which is clear and obvious may nonetheless not go to the root of the measure; it might be peripheral or ancillary and as such would not make the disputed measure manifestly inappropriate. Equally an error which is far from being obvious or palpable may nonetheless prove to be fundamental. For instance a decision or measure based upon a conclusion expressed mathematically might have been arrived at through a serious error of calculation. The fact that the calculation is complex and that only an accountant, econometrician or actuary might have exclaimed that it was an "obvious" error or a "howler", and even then only once they had performed complex calculations, does not mean that the error is not manifest. An error in the placing of a decimal point may exert profound consequences upon the logic of a measure. This suggests that manifest in/appropriateness is essentially about the nature, and, or centrality/materiality of an error. An error will be manifest when (assuming it is proven) it goes to the heart of the impugned measure and would make a real difference to the outcome." </p>

Secondly, the CFP tender in relation to Evaluation Nodes where Energy Solutions maintain CFP should have failed on a “threshold” issue, or issues, such that the correct and lawful outcome should have been elimination of CFP from the competition (“CFP Threshold Issues” dealt with in Part C of this Section). This group also contains arguments raised by the NDA in the alternative against the RSS tender, were the CFP Threshold Issues to be decided against the NDA. These points arise because the NDA maintains that <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> the approach urged on the court by Energy Solutions in relation to CFP Threshold Issues was the correct one (contrary to the NDA’s defence to those issues), then application of the same approach at the time by the NDA in relation to the RSS tender would have led to elimination of RSS from the competition as well. Thirdly, there are what are called “nonthreshold” issues relating to the CFP tender, in which Energy Solutions maintain the score given to CFP was in breach of statutory duty and manifestly erroneous (“CFP Non-Threshold Evaluation Issues” dealt with in Part D of this Section). </p>

Some of the themes encompass the requirement of lack of equal treatment, for example in the way BCRs were used (or not used) by the NDA, which were said to have had the effect of disadvantaging RSS.

The court cannot substitute its own assessment of the facts for that made by the authority concerned.  What the court will consider is whether the NDA’s evaluation was vitiated by a “manifest error” or a misuse of powers, and that it did not “clearly exceed” the bounds of its discretion {AB/53/5}.  The expression used by Morgan J In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Lion Apparel Systems Ltd v Firebuy Ltd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2007] EWHC 2179 (Ch), [2008] EuLR 191 {AB/40.1/1}, namely a “margin of appreciation”, applies to matters of judgement of assessment when considering manifest error, but not in relation to compliance with its legal obligations of transparency and equality.

A similar but more limited exercise was undertaken in relation to the CFP bid. The witnesses were cross-examined and inevitably such cross-examination dealt with numerous matters of fine detail as well as the more global criticisms of what had been done, and why, and/or what should have been done. I have carefully considered all of the evidence, both written and oral, and was greatly assisted by two documents prepared by the parties called “RSS Node Summary Sheet” and “CFP Node Summary Sheet” that provided specific references in both parties’ evidence, written and oral, concerning each Requirement within each Node. However, in this judgment I only deal with such evidence as is required in order to come to the necessary findings on the complaints of manifest error, and lack of equal treatment and transparency on the different Requirements under the different Nodes, and any re-scoring necessary. Reciting all of the evidence in this judgment, both written and oral, both for and against each party’s case on each of the Requirements, would add immeasurably to the length of this judgment. It should not be thought that evidence has been ignored simply because it is not individually recited. It should also be remembered that the exercise in which the court is involved is the limited review of what the NDA SMEs did in evaluating the RSS Tender Submission. The evidence relied upon by Energy Solutions in this trial was not available to those SMEs for that evaluation.  </p>

It follows that it was insufficient to justify a score of 1 for the SMEs merely to conclude (justifiably) that an asset which a bidder had not identified was “<span style="font-style:italic">critical</span>”. A score of 1 was only justified if SMEs concluded (justifiably) that the omitted critical asset was a “<span style="font-style:italic">key</span>” critical asset. </p>

The real point is more substantive for each Node, and amounts to whether the RSS bid had omitted to identify the key critical assets necessary. Essentially – and the assets in question are different for each Node – the SMEs concluded that the RSS bid had failed to identify certain assets that were in reality key critical assets that were necessary to deliver RSS’S strategy, with the exception of Node 410.5.3(c). For that Node, which achieved a score of 3, the SMEs concluded that the rationale for the critical asset categorisation was not provided. </p>

The only reason for having the criteria for scores of 3 and 5 use the word “key” in conjunction with “critical assets”, was to reflect the fact that a sub-set of critical assets was to be considered, namely those that were “key”. A RWIND tenderer would have read the scoring criteria for each of 1, 3 and 5 as all relating to the same subject matter, namely “key critical assets”. However, for an asset to be a “key” critical asset, it must be a critical asset in the first place. It is obvious that key critical assets are a sub-set of critical assets. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">Essentially, the complaints by Energy Solutions in relation to the way these Nodes were scored amount to this. The Lead SMEs – in five cases Mr Grey, in the other case Dr Clark – are said to have applied the wrong test or tests to what was a critical asset/key critical asset. Dr Clark accepted that his views on this subject “mostly came” from Mr Grey {Day10-NC/125} although he said there were other colleagues who also helped him develop and understand the NDA’s expectation. I find as a fact that Dr Clark applied the same test as Mr Grey in this respect. Energy Solutions submits that the wrong test was applied by the NDA as to whether an asset was a critical asset or not. It is submitted that this was because both these SMEs considered that it was irrelevant what risk might be associated with an asset, when one was considering whether that asset was a critical asset or not (or a key critical asset). All that should have been considered was the impact of failure of the asset in question. Accordingly, applying this test – which was different to the one adopted in the RSS Tender, because risk <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> been taken into account by the tender team – these SME teams concluded that a score of 1 (Unacceptable) was the correct score for five of the Nodes as the response did “not identify the critical assets necessary to deliver the Bidder's strategy”.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">In summary, the NDA position in the proceedings is that risk should properly be taken into account with critical assets, but only in the management of those assets. It is not taken into account when identifying whether those assets are in fact critical or not. There were different specific reasons given by the NDA in respect of each of the six Nodes for their score of 1. For example for Node 411 and Requirement 411.5.3(c), the SMEs took the view that RSS had failed to identify the Active Effluent Treatment Plant (“AETP”) and saline water groundwater pumping system (“SWTP”) as key critical assets. Additionally so far as this Requirement was concerned, there is a challenge to the CFP bid for exactly the same reason – CFP had not identified the AETP or the saline water groundwater pumping system as key critical assets either, but were given a higher mark than RSS for this Requirement. This forms the subject of Agreed Issues 71 and 72 which are dealt with in Confidential Appendix 3.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">The specific reasons provided by the NDA in relation to each Node are separately dealt with, but fundamental to them is the approach to critical assets explained in the evidence. As Mr Grey put it in his first witness statement “I believe [RSS to have used] the wrong approach to the identification of critical assets” {ZACON/2/28}. For three of the five Nodes in which Mr Grey was involved, that was the reason for the low score. For the other two, it was said there were deficiencies in the answer in relation to the management of assets and whether RSS were adopting good practice. Dr Clark, for Node 408, together with the other two SMEs for that Node (who were Dr Clark’s wife, Dr Anna Clark, and Mr David Rushton), concluded that there was a failure by RSS to include two particular assets as key critical assets, namely the Active Liquid Effluent System (“ALES”) and the Treated Radioactive Waste Store (“TRS”). There were other issues on other Nodes, for example, for Node 412 and Requirement 412.5.3(c), the SMEs decided at the evaluation stage that RSS had failed to identify the skip handling crane as a key critical asset, and the NDA stated that it should have been so identified. This was said to be because the crane was necessary to move fuel inventory in and out of the storage ponds. In fact, that contention was wrong and the skip crane does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>move fuel inventory in and out of the storage ponds. This point was abandoned during the proceedings by the NDA, and another one put in its place as justification for the necessity of the skip handling crane being a critical asset. </p>

Not only does PAS-55 make clear that this is Good Industry Practice – and the Client Specification itself expressly required bidders to use Good Industry Practice, with PAS-55 being specifically identified as a benchmark in that respect – but other documents make it clear that risk is an integral part of this identification and categorisation process. My finding in this respect means that Mr Grey and Dr Clark failed to apply the correct industry-wide test when they were considering the identification of critical assets. They applied the wrong test when they were evaluating the RSS Tender Submission in this respect. It is not only PAS-55 that uses the risk-based approach. ISO-55000, the International Standard on Asset Management {V/239.1/1} uses the same definition as PAS-55 and the British Standards Publication BS ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines on the application of ISO 55001 expressly state at paragraph 6.2.2.1 {V/260.2/19}: </p>

Yet this is precisely the crux of these issues between the parties. Notwithstanding the obvious difficulties in reconciling these two approaches, Mr Grey sought to reconcile them. He explained the award of a score of 5, in which he had personally been involved, for this Requirement in Node 406, must have occurred either because the SMEs had not appreciated what RSS was proposing, or that they had not focussed as they should have done when assessing it {Day 12Z-CON/89}. In my view this is a clear example of a failure by Mr Grey to recognise and accept an obvious mistake. Mr Grey accepted that, before the Consensus Rationale was formulated and the Requirement was scored, each of the three SMEs would have read RSS’s Tender Responses at least three times, and may have gone back to certain parts more often {Day12Z-CON/90}. The notion that all three of them would each have made the same error on at least three (if not more) separate occasions is not a sensible one. Mr Grey fastened on this because to do otherwise would have been to admit that the approach by the NDA on the other more numerous Nodes was wrong. I consider that he was trying to “protect” or defend the overall score given to the RSS Tender Submission, and would rather criticise the award of 5 on this Requirement – which in my view was plainly right, and certainly was not reached manifestly erroneously – than accept that all six of the other Nodes were scored manifestly erroneously.  </p>

The British Standard Institute Guidelines referred to above, whose terms were put to Mr Grey by Mr Hunter QC, initially without being identified as such, were roundly criticised by Mr Grey as constituting “bad industry practice” {Day12-NC/55}. I find the British Standard Institute Guidelines to constitute good industry practice. Mr Grey also explained the presence in the Gate C document, which he had personally drafted (and proof-read), of the text above as being a “mistake”. He accepted many people must have read that text since its inception in 2011, and that none had brought the mistake to his attention {Day12-NC/64}: </p>

That is the scenario that is far more likely, and is the one that I find occurred. I find that Good Industry Practice is represented by the express terms of these different published documents, and that this was applied by RSS. Risk would not only ordinarily be taken into account, but must be taken into account, by a bidder when identifying assets as critical assets (and by extension when considering key critical assets). The mistake made by Mr Grey was also made by Dr Clark, who was taking guidance from Mr Grey, as he was more familiar with this subject than Dr Clark. Dr Clark had no asset management experience of his own and had been given no training on asset management. His knowledge of this subject was plainly limited.  </p>

That evidence in itself would, on its own, give grounds for concern, given Dr Clark was involved in the exercise of scoring tender submissions by reference to marking criteria that required express consideration of asset criticality. However, in conjunction with his taking guidance from Mr Grey, who was plainly applying the wrong test, this leads me to conclude that Dr Clark was applying the wrong test too.

Attention was also drawn by the NDA to the fact that the amendment to the SORR that added the word “key” was made on 20 September 2013 {J/9a/409}, dialogue closed on 30 September 2013, and within that period RSS could have sought clarification of the amendment had it wished to do so.

I reject both of those submissions. Mr Grey was attempting to reconcile what the document stated, which was one thing, and what he had done (apart from on Node 406) which was another. It was sensible of him to accept that reconciliation could not be achieved as the two approaches were entirely different, and his good sense in this respect was helpful to the court. It would have been verging on the ludicrous had he attempted to explain that he had applied the Gate C approach, because he plainly had not. I simply do not understand how the NDA can criticise its own witness for being “too willing to accept that he had made a mistake”. Such a submission does however neatly encapsulate the NDA’s overall approach in this trial, which was never to accept that any mistakes were made, regardless of the evidence to the contrary. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">The question therefore arises concerning assets that were not owned, or within the particular project. Bidders had been instructed, as Mr Colwill explained, to treat the Sample Projects in question as wholly self-contained {B/7/71}. An asset that was not owned could not, on a proper construction of the SORR, be identified as a key critical asset within that project because the bidder could not “demonstrate ownership”. Logically, if such an asset were identified as a key critical asset, this should have resulted in a score of 1, since the criteria that had to be satisfied to obtain a higher score (“explaining how [the bidder] will manage” it to deliver its strategy) could not be met. In some cases, however, the NDA argues that RSS failed to identify, as critical assets, assets which it would not own and manage as part of the project, such as the Active Effluent Treatment Plant (“AETP”) in Node 411 Sample Project 2 (Dungeness). This was to be operated by the Site Operations team and was not part of the Sample Project. The asset was expressly out of scope, as was made clear in the Tender Submission {Q/27/13}. This meant that it could not be managed as part of the Sample Project. Mr Grey said in his evidence {Day13Z-CON/42:15} that this was: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.00in">That point is somewhat circular, and omits consideration of the terms of the SORR itself. The answer assumes that management is not relevant if an asset has been identified as critical. However, the SORR requires management to be identified as part of the bidder’s strategy for a particular project. If the management is being performed within another project or out of scope, then that asset should not be identified as critical to the project in question.   </p>

Mr Grey stated {Day13Z-CON/45} that in this situation the response should identify or provide a description of “the way in which they would manage the interface with whoever was” responsible for their management. But there were other Requirements in the SORR, not assessed by reference to the same criteria, and these dealt with interfaces with other projects. Dealing with such interfaces is wholly different to identification of what were the key critical assets within, for example, Sample Project 2.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, an explanation was required for how RSS would manage the key critical assets in the context of past performance, future demand and capability. Until a bidder’s asset management strategy was approved and put in place under the contract (which could be expected to take up to 24 months), it was an NDA requirement that the successful bidder was required to manage any asset in accordance with the existing arrangements for it in the LTP Performance Plan. The explanation bidders were required to provide of how an asset was to be managed “to deliver the Bidder’s strategy in the context of past performance, future demand and capability” was plainly directed at how it would be managed under the bidder’s own asset management strategy, once that was in operation. Accordingly, there would be no point in identifying, and it would be inconsistent with the SORR’s manifest intention to identify, an asset as a “key” critical asset whose use would come to an end before the bidder applied its own asset management strategy, since there would be no relevant management proposals to explain. That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the object of including the Requirement in the relevant specific Nodes (as the structure of the SORR itself indicated) was to test a bidder’s asset management strategy by seeing how assets would be managed under it. It would make no sense (as a matter of the SORR Requirements) for bidders to be required to identify assets which they could not, and would not, manage as part of their strategy for the project or Sample Project. Mr Grey accepted that it would be impossible for the bidders to set out asset management plans, and also that the purpose was to test the bidder’s new asset management strategy {Day12Z-CON/105}. This was also accepted by the NDA during the trial {Day5Z-CON/11} when Mr Davies in cross-examination said it had to be at a high level and Mr Giffin QC sensibly described this as “a perfectly fair point”. RSS had also been told by the NDA in dialogue on 5 July 2013 {M/35/4} that it: </p>

The equipment is either a critical asset for the Project or it is not. I fail to see how it can be critical for RSS, but not for CFP. It would be wholly irrational for the SMEs to conclude that groundwater ingress was important at Dungeness such that RSS should be considered to have made a material omission in this respect, but not CFP. The exercise of judgment by the SMEs should lead to the same conclusion if both bids are being treated equally, which is what is required. Further, Mr Harrop was not able to give any explanation for the change of score granted to CFP to increase it above that originally given of 1. I am entitled to draw an adverse inference from that, and I do so. However, even were I not to do so, my conclusion on this issue would be the same.

Such fuel is placed in containers called skips, and these remain submerged in the ponds. The water both cools (as the spent fuel gives off considerable heat) and acts to absorb some of the harmful radioactivity that is emitted, providing barrier protection. Everything in the ponds would, in use and over time, have become contaminated to some extent from this radioactivity. The subject matter of Sample Project 3 was to deal with the redundant former fuel storage ponds at Sizewell A. These ponds had to be de-planted of the equipment contained within them, the ponds had to be drained and sealed, and the pond building itself had to be prepared for Interim State. RSS’s Tender Response {Q/28/16} identified two specific critical assets. These were firstly the AETP Sand Pressure Filters (“SPFs”) and Hold Up Tanks, and secondly the In-Container Drying of Sludge kit. Two other assets were also referred to, namely the pond skip crane and the UHP jetting equipment (meaning Ultra-High Pressure, and used for cleaning). The RSS Tender Response stated that these had originally been identified as potentially critical but were no longer:  </p>

This point has already been addressed and the approach adopted by RSS for identification of critical assets was plainly in accordance with the published material and Good Industry Practice. Other matters are also relied upon by the NDA as justifying the need for identification of the skip handling crane as a key critical asset, such as the statement that the crane was operational, that reference was made to it in the table of assumptions as item TO-0344 and the identification of highest rated risks. The NDA also submits that because it was described as “essential” it must be a critical asset. These points are not correct, and ignore the published guidance and good industry practice as to categorisation of critical assets. An asset can be essential, but with a low probability of failure, and/or having a low impact in the event of failure (because replacement equipment could be readily obtained, for example). Both these latter points should be taken into account in assessing criticality. Mr Grey accepted that if a risk-based approach was permissible he could not disagree with RSS’s assessment that the skip handling crane was not a key critical asset {Day12Z-CON/144}. This disposes of these submissions by the NDA. </p>

It could only move the fuel inventory (basically, the skips containing spent fuel) around the pond whilst they remained submerged. It cannot lift skips out of the water or out of the pond (which contains the water). Indeed, this is a specific design feature of the crane, as Mr Colwill explained {B/7/111}, and the purpose of it is to ensure that the shielding from radioactive emission provided by the water in the pond is available at all times. I accept his evidence fully on this point. Further, all the fuel would have been removed from the ponds in any event before the relevant project began, as Mr Grey accepted {Day12Z-CON/132}. It is obvious that whoever drafted that particular Appendix to the letter and provided the answer to Question 4 did not know this, and misstated the function and purpose of the skip handling crane.

It entirely confuses the three different tenses of Past Performance (what occurred in the past); Future Demand (what will or is likely to be the case in the future); and Monitoring (what will be done in the present during the Sample Project to monitor those assets). It should also be noted that the detail provided by the RSS Tender Submission is somewhat more comprehensive than that of CFP under Node 405 {XD-CON/16/38}, where critical assets were simply listed. Even though Mr Grey said that the required information in the CFP bid was “woven through” the CFP Tender Submission rather than separately identified, I do have considerable difficulty in accepting Mr Grey’s complaint of a lack of “joined up” proposals about asset management in the RSS Tender Submission on this Node, particularly when compared to the approach adopted by CFP. The NDA in its Closing Submissions assert that what was wrong with the RSS Tender Submission was that rather than planning on the basis of past failures, the regime proposed was “essentially [a] reactive one of relying upon inspections”. There is nothing inherently wrong in a regime relying upon inspections, which provides real data on performance and steps necessary to avoid failure, both of which are obviously parts of management.  </p>

The PWTP deals with the water within the pond, recirculating it in broadly the same way that swimming pools have filtration and treatment systems. Energy Solutions submits that the water in that system, which is a closed system, is not effluent at all. Accordingly, that would mean this sat within Sample Project 3 and not Sample Project 5. The Re-Re-Amended Defence in paragraph 92(1) and (4) {A/10/48} and the NDA’s response to a request for further information {A/25/16} both refer to the consequences of degradation of the pond water and the risk that if it were to degrade sufficiently, that would interrupt or disrupt operations in relation to the ponds (by leading to a lack of sufficient clarity for visual operations or an unacceptable imbalance in chemical impurities); and that the PWTP was the only viable means of preventing degradation of the water quality. It was also asserted that, if the water became “contaminated through lack of treatment”, additional delay and cost might be entailed to bring it into a condition for safe discharge {A/25/16}.  </p>

At the point of draining, the water within the pond would become effluent, because it was no longer being used in operation of the pond; this point was accepted by Mr Colwill {Day4Z-CON/20}. Mr Colwill did not know whether the water would go through the PWTP before it reached the AETP, which was to be the last point of treatment (the word used in cross examination was “barrier”) before the sea. However, even if it did, the treatment of it was to occur in the AETP before it was discharged. Its treatment in the PWTP as part of recirculation for re-use in the pond for operational purposes would have ended. In those circumstances, I consider it was manifestly erroneous to have concluded that it should have been identified as a critical asset and that the failure to do so was a material omission. I accept the submission of the NDA in its Closing Submissions that the precise amount of the PWTP that would be used in so draining the pond is not determinative of whether the PWTP should have been identified as a critical asset. However, equally, simply because part of it was to be used to drain the pond does not make it a critical asset either. Drainage of water (even potentially radioactive water) is not the most complex of activities, and low risk of failure is something that I have expressly found can and should have been taken into account (in accordance with the published guidance) when deciding upon asset criticality.  </p>

As he said “my individual review is a very different thing to consensus review”. However, this does mean that the witness the NDA called to defend the evaluation was one of the SMEs who, individually and upon consideration, saw nothing wrong with the submission prior to consensus. The fact that RSS gave a reason for not listing the ALES and TRS as critical assets, and the validity of that reason, is not determinative of the issue but does provide considerable assistance. It does give the impression that the RSS team considered these assets potentially to be critical assets, but they had not been listed as such for the reason stated. Certainly, there would be no reason for the Tender Submission to have provided an incorrect reason. However, only one of those two assets has to be truly critical (or to put the same point another way, the SMEs would have to be manifestly erroneous in their conclusions as to <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> assets) for Energy Solutions to be entitled to have the court review the score.  </p>

I reject the point of principle relied upon by Energy Solutions, which was based on use of this asset having ceased before the asset management plan by RSS was to be fully adopted. The incoming PBO was going to be responsible for the asset during the period prior to cessation of its use. The RSS plan for ALES (shown in Figure 408-11 at {Q/24/10}) was that it would be completely closed by February 2015 when liquid LLW operations and disposal ceased. Under the SLCA, the successful bidder had to carry out the scope of works in accordance with existing plans until its new strategy was implemented. ALES was not an asset that RSS would manage as part of its asset management strategy, but it would be monitored and maintained under the existing plan including inspection and maintenance arrangements until it was switched off in February 2015. There was therefore a period of months (depending upon when it was actually switched off) when the successful PBO would be responsible for Winfrith whilst ALES was operational. Dr Clark explained that the transition period ended on 1 September 2014, so the period was approximately six months. Thereafter it was to be decommissioned. </p>

It also has multiple barriers to failure and any failure is only likely at the component level. Given the majority of its components are readily available commercially, such a failure would not have appreciable consequences. It also has significant spare capacity to store any liquids requiring treatment (this is called “buffering”). Although the NDA did not have Mr Colwill’s evidence during the evaluation – the SMEs only had the Tender Submission – these factors should have been known to them, in particular the simplicity of the system, its recent refurbishment and the buffering capacity. The period of time it was to be in use is a highly relevant factor too.  </p>

This would allow sufficient time to deal with any failure, were one to occur, without impacting on the strategy and without risking any regulatory action. Any failure would therefore present no real risk to RSS’s strategy or ability to deliver the NDA’s milestones for Winfrith. Dr Clark was unable to say how much storage capacity ALES had for buffering, or how long it would take to become full {Day11Z-CON/24}. He explained that one of the other SMEs, Mr Rushton, was far more familiar with Winfrith than he was. Mr Rushton is still employed by the NDA but was not called as a witness. Dr Clark could not recall if risk of failure was considered by the SMEs in arriving at their conclusion. Mr Matthews, who gave evidence for Energy Solutions, also had been employed at the site previously and had greater specific knowledge than Dr Clark.  </p>

Firstly, the application of the wrong “good industry practice” test by the SMEs, which was manifestly wrong. There is no evidence that the SMEs considered the risk of failure, only the consequences of that failure. However, that was not the only reason for the score of 1. The second point is, had the matter been considered using the correct test (namely risk of failure as well as risk of consequences), should the ALES have been considered a critical asset? Proper consideration of the factors identified by Mr Colwill demonstrate, in my judgment, that the risks of failure of ALES and the consequences of any such failures were so negligible that a conclusion that the ALES should have been identified as a critical asset was manifestly erroneous.

The drums contain the waste and the drums are themselves contained in sand filled concrete silos within the store building. Given it is a building constructed in the 1990s, I accept that the risk of failure of the building fabric or envelope is negligible. Indeed, failure of a structure – particularly a recently constructed structure – is of a completely different, and far lower, order of risk than failure of mechanical equipment. The TRS was to be used until 2017, and Energy Solutions cannot rely simply upon the “use having ended” point of principle for this asset to justify its omission, any more than for the ALES. However, given that the risk of failure is so low, in my judgment it was manifestly erroneous to conclude that the failure to identify this as a critical asset was a material omission.

Rather, concentration is upon a “Lessons Learned” document {V/241/1}, which was an RSS internal debriefing process.

In particular his claim that CFP had “weaved in their approach throughout the document” {Day13Z-CON/73} is not made out when the submission is read either superficially or thoroughly. That finding also disposes of the detailed criticisms put by Mr Giffin QC in cross-examination of Mr Davies. The type of detail which Mr Giffin QC was alleging was missing from the RSS Tender Submission – the number of journeys of movements of the modular flasks contained exotic fuels, the continuing of the existing maintenance regime of the flasks at Harwell, whether there were sufficient M2 flasks, the details of the refurbishment required for the Wylfa crane – would all be relevant for a detailed plan, but that was not what the SORR required.

The latter point is a failure to identify management proposals within the relevant context, in other words what has happened in the past and what it is proposed to do in the future. They are different points. The NDA wishes to have them dealt with as the same because the consensus rationale (prepared by a team of SMEs, having applied what I have already found to be the wrong measure of good industry practice) identified what was said to be an inconsistency. Upon analysis, and using the correct approach to good industry practice, there is no inconsistency and nothing can be pointed to by the NDA within the relevant part of the RSS Tender Submission as being inconsistent. However, to avoid the obvious consequence – namely a finding of manifest error and an increased score – the NDA and Mr Grey sought to explain the consensus rationale as meaning something entirely different, namely that something was missing that should have been included.</p>

Further, it is obviously sensible that the term “assumption” would be applied as meaning the same across different Nodes, regardless of whether those Nodes dealt with cost or technical matters. It would be somewhat bizarre if the same word had two different meanings depending upon whether it appeared in a Costs Node or a Technical Node. I find that it meant the same in both types of Nodes. Assumptions are not facts, or knowledge. They are used to bridge gaps in facts or knowledge. The reason that the different Nodes required assumptions to be identified was because different tenderers would, almost certainly, have made different assumptions, and the Tender Responses needed to identify what these were, and what risks attached to them.

In this case, I do not see how Mr Grey’s generic explanation for how the result of that review would lead to a changed score, namely to correct “an apparent mismatch between the score and the consensus rationale” could explain the change. This is because the consensus rationale did not refer to the omission as a “material omission”, as at that stage the SMEs had identified a non-material omission. The word “material” was added, as Mr Hunter QC explored with Mr Grey in the passage of cross-examination above, 11 days <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the score had been changed. In other words, the score was reduced, then the rationale was later changed to reflect that reduced score. If the approach of the SMEs after learning of the results of the Burges Salmon Review was to check to see that the score matched the rationale, there would be no logical explanation for that sequence of events.

The rationale for this is obvious, as to do so would simply be reciting many assumptions that other areas of work were to be performed by the same organisation as expected.

The fact that the ISF was referred to as having potential impact upon the project schedule (whether as a constraint or otherwise) is not relevant given the assumption, which bound the scope of Sample Project 1. I also consider that the reasons provided by the NDA to Energy Solutions in the consensus rationale and 11 April 2014 letter are in breach of the NDA’s obligations of transparency. This is because the evidence available to the court makes it clear that the score of 1 was not awarded because of the supposed “material omission” at all. Indeed, the omission (if it were considered to be an omission) was not identified as “material” until 11 days after the score of 1 had been awarded. It was not the reason for the score of 1, and I find that the phrase “automatically scored” is wholly misleading concerning the award of the score, and lacking in transparency.

The table of assumptions set out 11 different assumptions {Q/24/41}. One of these was given the identifier TO-0128 and stated “No soil contamination exists which requires remediation”. Against the “associated risks” column in the table, the following entry appears “See item TO-0128 in the Threats table”. That table, which was given the title “Figure 408-6 Threats” was said to identify the “activities to mitigate the top five threats…..” (this description being in the text under Requirement 408.5.1(d)(iii) {Q/24/6} which introduced the figure itself).

This means that the contention advanced by the NDA, that there was an inconsistency between the assumption that no soil remediation was required and Figure 408-6, is itself inconsistent with the SMEs’ own evaluation at the time of Requirement 5.1(d). Dr Clark was unable to offer any explanation for that.

In the absence of such work, the likelihood of soil removal being required was estimated at between 50-80% as shown in Figure 408-6 {Q/24/7}. That reflected the fact that there was a high likelihood that regulators would require removal of contaminated soils if such studies were not completed. It was assumed, however, that regulators would accept risk-based criteria or “clean-up standards”; this is shown in threat TO-0076 {Q/24/7} within Figure 408-6. The mitigation to reduce this risk was accordingly for such studies to be completed and for the IESR Manager to develop a persuasive case for leaving contamination on site with suitable managerial and physical controls based on residual risks compared to “dig and dispose” methodology {Day7Z-CON/41}. The residual risk that soil removal would be required should have been small after such mitigating measures; even if it were not small, it probably would have reduced. However, it remained as a risk.

It could have been, as the assumption actually made, that none would be. Whatever the extent of the assumption that was made, an assumption of some kind dealing with contamination had to be made, because the situation and the amount of contamination was unknown. This gap in knowledge therefore had to be bridged. The approach had to be identified and it had to be identified in an assumption. The difficulty with Dr Clark’s approach and understanding of the percentage probabilities in Figure 408-06 is that, given RSS had correctly identified soil contamination and remediation as a risk, any assumption that failed to “match” those figures or that approach would have been seen by him as an inconsistency. </p>

The answer to Agreed Issue 25 is that the assumption was not inconsistent with Figure 408-6. Again, there is no issue that specifically addresses what the score ought to be, in the event that I have found that the evaluation was manifestly erroneous. Carefully considering the content of the tender submission on this Requirement with the scoring criteria and the evidence, it is clear to me that Energy Solutions’ submissions are correct on this Node and the correct score absent manifest error would have been 5. The assumption is a perfectly valid and clearly stated one, and there is no inconsistency.  </p>

Both this Node and Node 303, Nominated Staff Appointment, tended to use modern business language and terminology more than the others. This could, on occasion, lead the unwary into frustration in terms of the application (or lack of it) of plain English. However, such use of language is a function of modern life, and this procurement competition was no exception.  Although the use of language in this way does not have a direct impact upon any of the findings in this judgment, it is part of the background both of the Tender Submission and the evaluation exercise. A single example will suffice. The first sentence of the explanation of strategy dealing with the approach that was to deliver RSS’S High Level Objectives stated the following {Q/25/1}: </p>

There was no requirement in the scoring criteria to <span style="font-style:italic">“fully define</span>” the competencies required or to link them to particular roles. The SORR imposed no requirement for a full definition of competencies required for roles. What the SORR required as a matter of construction of its terms is a matter of law not evidence, but for what it is worth, Mr Grey accepted this interpretation of the SORR {Day12Z-CON/45}. It is also said by Energy Solutions that it would have been quite impossible in the space available in the tender submissions for RSS to have done this in any event.

Energy Solutions points out that the SORR did not require such clear and full descriptions. What the SORR required was for the SMEs to assess whether or not RSS had considered or addressed the available and needed competencies. Mr Grey said in his evidence that, when evaluating the tender responses, something more than mere “<span style="font-style:italic">consideration”</span> of the available and needed competencies had to be demonstrated to score 5 {Day 12Z-CON/22}. </p>

Indeed, he had some difficulty in defining what that “something more” should have been. Certainly there is no assistance provided in the SORR as to what might constitute the elusive “something more” that the NDA required. The available and needed competencies had to be addressed for a bidder to score 5. If these were not addressed, then a lower score was justified. But to impose a different, more detailed or higher standard in respect of identification of competencies in order to achieve a score of 5 is not made out on the terms of the SORR. </p>

Further, the approach in fact used by the SMEs to score the CFP tender on this Requirement is directly contrary to the reasons provided in the 11 April 2014 Letter by the NDA to RSS for why a score of 5 was not awarded to RSS.

The only function where this is perhaps not true is “Exec and Delivery Team”, where reference is made (for example) to leadership and communication, and to strategic direction. It is implicit within these submissions by the NDA that “functions”, “sub-functions” and/or “responsibilities” are not competencies.

In other words, training should be instrumental in developing and sustaining competence. IAEA has defined competence as ‘the ability to put skills and knowledge into practice in order to perform a job in an effective and efficient manner to an established standard’. ONR concurs with this definition, which is widely accepted within the international nuclear community.

In my judgment this is very close to, if not exactly the same as, the dictionary definition of competence which is (in this sense) sufficiency of qualification; capacity to deal adequately with a subject (taken from the Oxford English Dictionary). That is certainly, in my judgment, how an RWIND tenderer would have interpreted it. Competency means sufficiency of qualification, capacity, and also includes the condition of being competent in something. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">Obviously context has a part to play in the meaning of the term. Sometimes it might have a specialised meaning, such as being legally competent. As an example, if one said that Mr X was competent as a witness, it could mean that Mr X had the legal capacity to give evidence as a witness. If one said that Mr X was competent as an expert witness, it could mean that the performance of Mr X in giving evidence as an expert in that particular field was perfectly satisfactory. The same statement could potentially mean that Mr X had the sufficient degree of expertise to be qualified to give expert evidence. Mr Grey’s evidence was that competency was a “pretty well understood” term, utilised quite extensively in the nuclear industry {Day12Z-CON/24-25}. Based on the contents of the ONR publication, I find that competence does not have a particularly specialised or unique meaning within the nuclear industry; its meaning is the same as in everyday language. However, Mr Grey did not accept the equation of capabilities, skills and knowledge with competencies, and in these proceedings neither does the NDA.  Rather, he explained competencies as being about the ability to <span style="font-style:italic">apply</span> matters such as skills, knowledge and qualifications {Day12Z-CON/27}. That is undoubtedly one element of competency; if a person has a particular skill, but cannot apply it, they would not be likely to be competent in whichever role requires application of that skill. They would not have the capacity to deal adequately with that subject.  The NDA submits that Mr Grey’s interpretation of what a competency is “is entirely consistent with the established industry definitions” but it appears that Mr Grey’s interpretation entirely ignores the “sufficiency of qualification” – or in other words the necessary skills and capabilities – meaning of the word. </p>

In my judgment, the SMEs were in fact looking for more than that, but an RWIND tenderer would not have known this from the SORR. Mr Grey agreed in cross-examination that the evaluators had expected something more than mere “consideration” {Day12ZCON/22}. This shows that he, the lead SME, was not applying the terms of the SORR, and it is logical to draw the conclusion that the other two SMEs, not called in evidence by the NDA, were not either. I am not persuaded by the points argued by the NDA in this respect, namely that in reading the criteria for scores of 5 and a score of 3 consistently with each other (which must be done), the difference between competencies being “addressed” must mean that “consideration” requires something more. The concept of “addressing” available and needed competencies must itself be interpreted in the context that the Requirement is ultimately about describing a strategy for the <span style="font-style:italic">delivery</span> of common support functions. In that context, a bidder has clearly not “addressed” available and needed competencies, or given “consideration” to that, unless it has engaged with the question of what competencies are actually going to be needed. The NDA submits that it was for the SMEs to exercise judgment about whether the available and needed competencies had been sufficiently “addressed”. It undoubtedly was a matter of judgment, and a margin of appreciation is available to the NDA in this respect, but applying something other than the terms of the SORR is manifestly erroneous in my judgment. </p>

Similarly, in response to the equivalent Requirement 5.1(6) in Node 413 (Sample Project 4), CFP’s Tender Response was again scored 5 although the consensus rationale recorded {U/7/65} that “competencies covered superficially (named by discipline only)”. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">I find the comparison between how CFP’s bid was marked, and the criticism made of RSS’S bid by the NDA, instructive. This is particularly so, given the NDA were under an obligation to treat all bidders equally. As Mr Grey admitted {Day14ZCON/49} in its response RSS set out considerably more about competencies than CFP did in its response. It is therefore clear to me that the approach being urged upon me in these proceedings by the NDA in terms of what competencies are, and how application of the scoring criteria should have been applied, was not one adopted by the NDA itself when evaluating this particular Requirement for the CFP Tender Response. </p>

The nature and particularity of the competencies was required at a very high level, and the SORR permitted these being defined by reference to functions. Key capabilities, skills and knowledge are in any event all integral parts of what constitutes a competency or competencies.

It was however illuminating in this sense, in that it demonstrated the lack of explanation available from the very personnel who had been tasked with performing the evaluation, and the difficulty that Mr Grey (the lead SME) had in explaining what had been done and why in terms of reaching the score awarded to RSS. Despite his best efforts, it was difficult for Mr Hunter QC to pin Mr Grey down on what deficiencies were in reality said to be present in the RSS Tender Submission to justify the score of 3. Entirely understandably, Mr Hunter QC took the pleadings as representing the case being advanced by NDA.

That is something that the NDA is seeking to impose now to justify what was done, which in my view is not in accordance with the terms of the SORR.

Firstly, it is said that it is a different reason to the one advanced in the Consensus Rationale. Secondly, it is said that it “is clearly wrong”. On the first point, it could be argued that a failure to outline strategic tolerances was the same as not identifying “true” strategic tolerances. However, on the second point, Dr Clark accepted {Day10Z-CON/103} that strategic tolerances involve a different type of concept from risk tolerance. The notion that they amount to the same thing is therefore not made out on the NDA’s own evidence. However, a tolerance does not have to be a range, in my judgment, for the same reasons as explained in respect of risk tolerances.

It is certainly in my judgment a criticism that can be made without manifest error. Regulatory approval in the nuclear industry is an important aspect of most changes, but particularly this one which involved a shift to a Regionalised and Centralised model as set out in the Client Specification. The description above is of limited assistance to the SMEs in terms of evaluating the Tender Submission. It touches in the barest terms upon how a failure of acceptance by the Regulator would be “confirmed and monitored”, which was part of the scoring criteria for a score of 5. The tolerance itself is stated as being “If Regulators do not accept the proposed move to a Regionalised and then Centralised model, RSS will be unable to implement the planned CS Strategy”. That is a statement that is on its face correct, but not a particularly helpful one regarding a tolerance in terms of keeping the strategy fit for purpose, which both parties agreed was the overall aim. The NDA point out that it is noticeable that RSS’s purported tolerances were largely a paraphrase of items which appeared in the table of threats at Figure 409-11 {Q/25/9}, or the table of assumptions at Figure 409-44 {Q/25/42-43}. </p>

This allowed for timely intervention if the relevant rates fell below those specified.

On the first, the RSS Tender was given a score of 4 and Energy Solutions maintains had the evaluation been done without manifest error this should have been a score of 5. On the second, a score of 3 was awarded and Energy Solutions’ case is that too was manifestly erroneous and ought to have been a 5. However, the NDA’s case is that it ought to have been scored with a 2, which would have meant (given the status of this Requirement as a Threshold/Scoring one) that RSS would have been eliminated from the competition. It is also relevant for three different Requirements for the CFP Tender, namely 303.5.2, 303.5.3 and 303.5.4.  It is convenient to deal with the principles together, as the way CFP’s Tender was evaluated is relied upon by Energy Solutions as demonstrating manifest error/unlawfulness on its own submission. On the first Requirement, 303.5.2, CFP was given a score of 5 whereas Energy Solutions maintain this was manifestly erroneous and it should have been a 4. On Requirement 303.5.3, CFP was given a score of 3 whereas Energy Solutions maintain it should have been a score of 2. Finally, Requirement 303.5.4 was a Pass/Fail with CFP achieving a Pass, whereas Energy Solutions maintains it should have been awarded a Fail and eliminated from the competition.  </p>

Energy Solutions’ position is that, on a proper construction of the SORR, the scoring for each Requirement, 5.2 and 5.3, is required to be done on an overall basis by reference to the response to each Requirement as a whole. In particular the correct approach to the evaluation of supporting evidence was to consider whether there were evidence that was relevant to give confidence in the delivery of the outputs for all (or some other percentage) of the processes identified in response to the Requirement as a whole.  </p>

Common sense goes a long way when one is approaching what are said to be competing arguments of construction. The amount that has to be read into the SORR in order to justify the “tick box” and arithmetical approach to arriving at a percentage contended for by the NDA is remarkable.

It must also be remembered that there is a statutory obligation upon the NDA, and any authority in such a competition, to provide reasons to unsuccessful bidders. There is little point in having such an obligation if it can be satisfied by statements that are obviously wrong and keep changing, with later reasons contradicting the earlier ones. Additionally, such behaviour makes it very difficult to work out what the reasons for the particular evaluation in question in reality actually were at the time. I am not of the view that such constant changes in the reasons given by the NDA for why the score was in fact awarded can be wholly disregarded. If the NDA’s own SMEs cannot sensibly explain why a particular Requirement was given a particular score, that is not a promising start if the Stage 1 reasons are wrong. </p>

In this case, therefore, the words eventually chosen were of no difference to the SMEs, but the visible picture to the bidders became different after the post-Burges Salmon Review change. </p>

Mr Hunter QC’s final question – that at least one of the three SMEs should have known the current procedure – was expressly disagreed. The real point is even starker – it is that at least one of the three SMEs should have known that MCP-10 was an acronym that stood for the current procedure, not even what the current procedure contained. The evidence of the lead SME for this Node was therefore to the effect that none of the three Subject Matter Experts should have been expected to know that MCP-10 referred to the current procedure, which was expressly provided to each of the bidders by the NDA in the data room as part of the material available for their tender preparation. Even without the evidence of Ms Wilson (which is evidence I accept) that this had been used in dialogue sessions with the SMEs, who knew about the document and the terms of it {B/5/27}, I do not see how the lead SME for this Node could sensibly or reasonably hold this point of view. The assertion that not one of the three SMEs evaluating the node should be expected to know about such a document, which was, after all, made available by the NDA itself to the bidders in the data room, is verging on the extraordinary. The document contained the current procedure at 10 of the 12 Magnox sites, and was part of compliance with the existing Nuclear Licence Conditions. In my judgment, bidders were indeed entitled to assume that those evaluating their responses for the NDA would be familiar with the documents – or at the very least with the titles of those documents – which the NDA had itself provided to bidders for the purpose of the competition. Failure to be so aware, and to have marked down RSS’s tender response for failing to explain what MCP-10 was, amounts to a manifest error in my view.  </p>

Energy Solutions rely upon this as indicating that, in the SMEs’ view, CFP’s Tender Response was worse than RSS’s. Moreover, the scoring suggested that when the same SMEs used the same phrase, “some supporting evidence that in the opinion of the evaluators is relevant to give confidence in the delivery of the outputs for this process”, they must have meant different things by the same words. For RSS “some” meant “insufficient”; for CFP it meant “sufficient”. </p>

It is correct that each element was concerned with a different issue or area and called for something different by way of response. The question was whether, in each case, the evidence gave the SMEs confidence that the bidder could deliver what was called for in the context of each specific element. The NDA rightly point out that the matter or matters under consideration are those of evaluative judgement (in which a margin of appreciation is available). It is therefore unsurprising that evidence might be considered by the SMEs to be helpful under one element, but of less assistance (or even of no assistance at all) under another. That is of course correct, but when the reasons explained for a particular deficiency are that there is nothing dealing with a particular subject (such as debriefing, which is a real as opposed to hypothetical example) yet that subject <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> dealt with elsewhere, that criticism cannot sensibly be met by stating that it was being considered under a different element and not the one under consideration.

But the broad thrust of why an evaluation was concluded as it did, particularly when applying detailed scoring criteria to many separate requirements, as here, ought to be discernible.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">This is not supportable and I reject Ms Hanson’s attempts to portray the RSS Tender Submission as deficient in this way. Firstly, the meaning of “debriefing” did not have to be explained in the Tender Submission in my view. It is a widely understood term in the industry (if not in society) and it has a dictionary meaning. Secondly, the word appears five times in the first paragraph including in the actual heading of the response. Had Ms Hanson and the other SMEs really needed to have it explained to them – which I reject, and which no RWIND tenderer could be expected to have known– this would have appeared in the Consensus Rationale. However, debriefing was sufficiently explained in the Tender Submission in my judgment. The numerous references to debriefing make it clear that the complaints that the RSS tender did not “talk about debriefing or where they have undertaken” this before, or that the “the only reference in the evidence section...to debriefing was in the title” are simply factually wrong and can be seen to be wrong almost instantly. Thirdly, the Tender Submission when read “globally” did identify where and when it had been used before, both by date and place. Ms Wilson for Energy Solutions explained in her evidence the structure of the supporting evidence section, and also that these should be considered “as a whole” or “holistically”. Ms Hanson stated that this is what she had done {C/12/5}, but she also stated that she did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> consider the SMEs were required “to take into account the Evaluators’ own knowledge of matters that are not properly explained or described in the RSS tender response”. In my judgment, the whole purpose of having SMEs was that they would have such general or specialist knowledge, and this would be used when they were performing their evaluation. They were, after all, experts in the subject matter.  </p>

It was not possible to cross-examine on every single point, but I am satisfied that the main areas of challenge were put to Ms Hanson by Mr Hunter QC for Energy Solutions. I have also carefully considered all of Ms Hanson’s written evidence, as I have with all the witnesses, and not just the parts upon which crossexamination occurred.

The explanation proffered in evidence that there was a difference, because Requirement 303.5.2 was concerned only with setting up a new team at the outset, whereas 303.5.3 was concerned with incorporating new individuals into an established team, has no merit. If anything, the latter process is likely to be easier because there are likely to be fewer individuals moving as replacements into an already-established unit. It cannot be sensibly suggested that incorporating one new person into a team already established and working on a project – or all the projects – will present higher or more complex challenges than establishing such a team ab initio. </p>

There was no necessity for specific examples to be included, and this cannot be read into any part of the SORR in relation to these items. An RWIND tenderer could not know that specific examples were required. A bidder had to describe the processes it would put in place and the anticipated outputs from them. When the material is read as a whole, the specific criticisms that were raised by the NDA can all be dismissed as being wrong in fact and manifestly erroneous. Applying the SORR to the material that was provided in the RSS Tender Submission leads to the conclusion that the RSS Tender Submission, when considered against the scoring criteria in the SORR, merits a score of 5. Accordingly, Energy Solutions is entitled to have the RSS Requirements re-marked to the one that would have been given, namely a score of 5. </p>

Then, certain columns were removed and other columns were re-labelled for the reasons explained above. To clarify, we did not include "Hinkley" in the name of the category "SP4 ILW Oldbury" simply for space/formatting reasons.

It must be remembered that they would not have had Mr Peel’s evidence. Even if Mr Peel were right, I do not accept that the SMEs should have realised this, or even that the risk register extract should be read in the way contended for by Energy Solutions. It might have been a formatting issue when the extract was taken from the Master Risk Register, it might have been a typographical error, or it may have been a coding peculiarity, but there is nothing on the face of the table in my judgment that would, or should, have led the SMEs to come to any conclusion other than the one that Ms Thomas reached at the time, namely that the extract only concerned Oldbury risks.  </p>

The extract was indeed as it appeared, namely dealing with Oldbury risks. This was confirmed by RSS in its answer to the BCR. Further, two particular sentences are of note. The first is “we have found that we did not appropriately code those risks as applicable to this Node”; the meaning of this could sensibly be said to be acceptance by RSS of a mistake. Had the risks been “coded appropriately”, the suggestion seems to be that some other outcome would have occurred. Further, the sentence “We will gladly provide evidence of the Hinkley risks if you deem it appropriate” also suggests that they were not to be found elsewhere within the existing Tender Submission. This seems to me to constitute an offer to provide something further that was not at that point included within the Tender Submission. Both of those justify the stance taken by the NDA at the time and in these proceedings, to the effect that Hinkley risks were not included.  </p>

This argument does not assist Energy Solutions in my judgment, and I reject it. Each BCR and the answer provided has to be considered individually. Just become some were uploaded without redaction does not, in my view, mean that all the BCRs should have been. Also, Energy Solutions is in difficulty in this respect. Once it had confirmed to the NDA that the extract was solely in respect of Oldbury risks, RSS must have realised that it had a serious problem. It could not, by the rules of the competition, provide further detailed submission or additional information. However, equally it can only have wished not to draw too much attention to what was, in my view, an error. I consider that the full text of the BCR seems to have been designed to provide a sufficient smokescreen for RSS to answer “yes” and provide more information by way of reference and make an offer (which it did) to try and bolster the response based on material already submitted. It did not however – nor could it – provide the type of information provided in Mr Peel’s witness statements for a whole host of reasons, not least that this information was nowhere contained in the Tender Response itself.  </p>

It was the RSS team who had put the Tender Response together; it was RSS who tried to remedy the situation by the answer to the BCR. In neither situation was the correct approach to Hinkley Point A risks adopted, either in codification, labelling, or other identification. It is not an answer to the lacuna in Hinkley Point A risks for Energy Solutions to complain that the NDA should have issued a second BCR. In my judgment, although the NDA could, in its discretion, have done so without objection, there was no manifest error in the NDA deciding not to do so. It had already raised one BCR seeking confirmation that the extract was solely in respect of Oldbury, as it appeared to be. That confirmation was provided.  </p>

Although I made it clear to the parties during the trial that technical pleading objections were to be discouraged, I have in any event considered the point, even if not pleaded. The case was opened for Energy Solutions by Mr Howell QC who made clear the stance taken in relation to BCRs, and all the points were properly pursued by Mr Hunter QC with the NDA witnesses. All of the relevant material is before the court, regardless of the precise wording of the relevant paragraphs of the many pleadings in the three actions. However, even had the whole BCR been uploaded into AWARD in an un-redacted form, I consider the correct score would still have been the one that was awarded.

Mr Board has worked in relation to Magnox sites since October 1991 with extensive experience of portfolio, programme and project management. Prior to Mr Miller’s involvement in the competition in September 2012, which was 11 months after he had joined the NDA, he had not managed any NDA Projects nor any Programmes {Day16Z-CON/105}. It is correct to describe Mr Board’s wealth of experience in the nuclear industry as putting him at a considerable advantage, so far as substantive evidence relevant to this Node, over Mr Miller.

The statement originally was that their confidence was “fundamentally undermined”. AWARD shows they deleted the statement that the SMEs’ confidence was “fundamentally” undermined on 5 December 2013. This is shown at {T/130/414}. Mr Miller, although stating that he stood by that change (that is, he stood by the deletion of the word “fundamentally”), also said that the change was made by Ms Livesey, probably whilst he was in the room, but he could not remember why it was made {Day16Z-CON/121}. Given he expressly “stood by” the change when he was giving evidence, this can only mean he accepted that the deletion of “fundamentally” was correct.

There is also text dealing with this at {Q/19/11} and {Q/19/15} which directly refers to that Figure. Programme Managers are shown as being “Accountable to” the Waste and Strategic Programmes Director in Figure 307-15 RSS Organisational Structure {Q/19/23}.

Projects “up to Gate 3” means during the development phase. If that is right, then even Mr Miller did not seek to maintain that the structure “above” the programme manager was not missing. On the face of the documents, he was correct not to defend that position, because the structure and organisation was clearly set out when the material was read together.

In any event the Tender Submission at {Q/19/15} identifies the existence and function of the detailed resource loaded schedule, and the Resource Centre is also described in the submission. Given that what would be required would inevitably vary over time, sites and different programmes, the specifics that Mr Miller stated would be required could never be specified in the way he explained {Day16Z-CON/147}, and certainly an RWIND tenderer would not have understood they were required from reading the SORR. Those specifics also do not appear in that way in the SORR and could not have been understood, in my judgment, as being required by an RWIND tenderer. This Node was in any event concerned with organisation structures and not a fully detailed identification of specific resources. I do not consider that there was any omission of this nature in the response at all. </p>

It seems to me that having control of such a project is implicit in the programme manager being in charge of it, which was the whole point and basis of the Tender Submission. Figure 307-5 {Q/19/6} clearly showed that the Site Closure Directors were not accountable to Programme Managers and the response to Requirement 307.5.3(d) {Q/19/20} clearly stated that Project Managers were responsible for the management of their own budgets.  </p>

Following Gate 3, accountability transferred to the Project Manager who reported to the Site Closure Director. I do not see how this could lead to the conclusion that there “might” be a “loss of programme oversight”, as stated in the Further Information by the NDA. There could not be such a loss of oversight based upon what was explained in the Tender Submission, in particular the “<span style="font-style:italic">Lead and Learn</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">cycle</span>” but also the statement that “the programme maintains an oversight of all project risks (and opportunities) being managed at the site during project phases 4-5” {Q/19/13}. </p>

The SMEs had not been concerned about the resources available to the Programme Manager during these phases at all during the evaluation; their concerns were with phases 1-3 and also Gate 3.  This led to a line of evidence from Mr Board {Day7Z-CON/99} where hypothesis was piled upon hypothesis, based upon the views of someone not involved at the time.

All we want to know is how will the budget be managed.  If it is okay I could give you a slightly different view of this.  It would be fine for a programme manager to manage that budget, but they might manage it within the confines of their programme, so they may be able to make changes within a project as long as the programme stays within its budget.  It may be that they wish to apply the same controls and trending etc as they were looking to apply post-gate 3.

That is correct, but Energy Solutions submits that since the SLCs had not arranged a transition from the existing strategy to a new one before (as Ms Dancy accepted {Day17Z-CON/16}), those were the only improved performance outcomes to which the scoring criteria for this Requirement could have applied. It is said by Energy Solutions that any suggestion that the improved performance outcomes were not demonstrated would also be inconsistent with the SMEs’ scoring of the other elements of Requirement 5.1 where they had been specified and demonstrated. However, that rather misses the point, in my judgment, concerning the period of change from the existing strategy to the new one. This Requirement, 5.1(n), was specifically about the change and simply because the other elements of Requirement 5.1 were amply demonstrated does not mean that this was sufficient. </p>

This project had a higher weighting than those for the Sample Projects. Dr Clark was the lead SME on this Node and gave evidence for the NDA. Energy Solutions’ evidence was given by Mr Matthews and Mr Board. This was selected as one of the projects that would be used to test the bidders’ technical scope and methodology because it was a unique project within the decommissioning. The site had hosted various experimental reactors and a reasonable amount of decommissioning had already taken place there. It had never been a power station in the sense that the ten Magnox Power Stations were, and it retained both a Dragon reactor and a prototype steam-generating heavy water reactor or SGHWR. It was 74 hectares in size, but located within a far larger Site of Special Scientific Interest (“SSSI”) in Dorset near the coast. It also had the ALES facility and a Treated Radwaste Store known as the TRS.  </p>

The site and its characteristics are therefore important. The heathland area (that is a SSSI) within which the Winfrith site sits, is 285 hectares in size. The public have access to that larger area, with paths for walkers and cyclists. Dr Clark in his written evidence explained in some detail the background to this, including the importance to the NDA of establishing publicly the precedent that a former nuclear site could be safe for the public to use for access whilst there was still residual radioactive material on site {XC-CON/2/17-29}. “Public access” and “residual radioactivity” are not terms that naturally sit together, and the NDA principle was to demonstrate that notwithstanding the site’s previous use, public access could be achieved.  </p>

Energy Solutions submits that this was not a reasonable reading of RSS’s Tender Response. This is because the text on which the SMEs relied does not state where any fencing might be, and does not state that it will be around the reactor footprints. It is also submitted by Energy Solutions that the “SMEs’ criticism proceeds simply from an unjustifiable and unreasonable reading of Figure 408-25” {Q/24/28}. The inclusion of this graphic no doubt caused problems for RSS on this Requirement. I reproduce that Figure as Appendix 2. It shows two red areas, one marked “Dragon” and the other “SGHWR”. The red outlines on that diagram are along the footprints of the reactors. The title underneath states “Winfrith at IES, (Red = IES Site boundary– Green = Site fence beyond IES Site boundary)”.  </p>

By contrast, the red lines on Figure 408-18 were said in the key to that Figure to show existing fencing {Q/24/21}. Secondly, it is said that the description of the red lines in the key to Figure 408-25, namely that they indicate the IES site boundary, is plainly wrong. The site to be put into the IES included the licensed area and the unlicensed part within the site boundary, which is a far larger area. This is shown in the start conditions on Fig 408-18 {Q/24/21}, as Dr Clark accepted, since RSS did not propose to shrink the site {Day10Z-CON/43}. Energy Solutions therefore say that the caption, or key, beneath Figure 408-25 was “obviously a mistake”. That mistake was however, obviously one made by RSS, it was not a mistake made by the NDA. Dr Clark said {Day10Z-CON/41} that it had not occurred to the SMEs at the time that the caption was a mistake. This therefore constitutes criticism by Energy Solutions of Dr Clark for not realising that the RSS tender team had made a mistake and captioned its own Figure incorrectly. Thirdly, the reactor footprints were not shown fenced on Figure 408-26, which is on the same page and shows the “Alternative End Conditions for Winfrith”, in which (as Dr Clark accepted {Day10Z-CON/39}) the only difference in the End Conditions is </p>

That figure could, in my view, sensibly be interpreted as it was labelled, with the green line representing what it said it did, namely “site fence”. Further, the red area could equally be interpreted as representing a fence.

Just because an area is fenced does not mean that it is not so suitable. There was no problem with the SSE compound remaining. Further, areas of SSSIs are often fenced off for a variety of reasons, without this necessarily rendering them not accessible to the public. Mr Matthews used the example of protected species. Humans are often, in some areas, rather damaging to certain protected species. Fencing areas for the latter does not of itself contradict the NDA strategy in my view. Where such fences are, and whether such areas were, or were not, the same as the reactor footprints themselves, does not seem to me to matter in any respect. The SMEs seemed to have come to the conclusion for the RSS Tender Submission that <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> fences were contrary to the NDA Strategy.

But that was not RSS’s proposal at all. Rather RSS proposed – as a concept – some fencing principally for conservation purposes (with no specific proposal as to the location).

The fact that it uses the phrase “restricting public access” does not mean that it is contrary to the NDA strategy. As Dr Clark accepted {Day10Z-CON/29}, it was “important”, when considering whether any fencing proposed was inconsistent with making the IES suitable for use as public access heathland, to consider “the purpose of that fencing and the extent of that fencing”. If it was to ensure conservation for protected species, which is what the text expressly said, I do not consider that it would be contrary to the NDA strategy, regardless of where those fences were to be located.  </p>

Clarification could have been sought by means of a BCR, but the NDA point out that this allegation is not pleaded and Energy Solutions are out of time to raise it.

The failure to produce it before that appears to have rested on some quibble about relevance. I do not see how it could credibly be suggested that such a document was not relevant to this issue, but it is not necessary to consider the matter in any detail because, finally, it was produced in time to be dealt with. Important documents do occasionally emerge in this way and the CFP Tender Response to this Node is, in my judgment, important. This shows that the CFP bid was awarded a score of 5, yet like the RSS Tender Response it also envisaged agreeing management arrangements and institutional controls to allow public access to the site whilst it was still licensed. In CFP’s express view such controls could also include fencing or restricted access, and fencing is specifically referred to. In different places this was identified and these were brought to the attention of the court during Closing Submissions. They are the third bullet point in left hand column, second and third bullet points in right hand column {ZC-CON/4/2}; Table 19 last bullet point under Regulator engagement {ZC-CON/4/24}; Table 21 last bullet point under Stakeholder {ZC-CON/4/25}; and the reference to demonstrating “proper control of the heathland to ensure access is restricted”{ZCCON/4/28}. CFP’s Volume 5 also included reference to {XE-CON/7/27} “The Fernald site is an accessible area to employees and the public with only very small, fenced off, restricted areas.” In CFP’s view {XE-CON/7/35}, “engineered barriers, such as fencing, gates and locks are also important institutional controls”. Thus the institutional controls at the Fernald Site included controls such as infrastructure “for the protection against human exposure to contaminants, such as fences and signs” {XE-CON/7/38} and “fences and postings” {XE-CON/7/39}.  </p>

The premise for the questions was a conclusion that a bidder has failed to achieve a “threshold” specified in the SORR. There were certain safeguards before such a conclusion could lawfully have been reached by the NDA. These were both substantive and procedural. Firstly, if the threshold criterion was capable of being understood in more than one way by a RWIND bidder then the NDA could not lawfully find that the threshold had been failed, if it would be passed applying any of those interpretations. Secondly, if the bidder submitted a response containing an obvious error, then the NDA would have had to provide a bidder with the opportunity to correct that before failing the bidder, provided that that did not lead to what was in reality a new tender. This would be as a matter of discretion on the part of the NDA which had to be exercised equally and fairly. If the bidder submitted a response which was unclear in any respect or might be susceptible to clarification, then the NDA would have had to provide a bidder with the opportunity to clarify its bid (through the BCR procedure) before failing the bidder, applying its own rule of “<span style="font-style:italic">if in doubt clarify</span>”. Finally, the NDA would have to give the benefit of any doubt to the bidder, applying its rule of “<span style="font-style:italic">if in doubt score up</span>”. As a matter of construction, Energy Solutions submitted that any failure to achieve a relevant threshold should have led to a bidder’s exclusion from the competition.  </p>

Mr Giffin QC orally submitted that it was a properly relevant consideration to keep a bidder within the competition. In my judgment this is simply a different way of saying the same thing – the NDA’s case is that it was permissible to attempt to keep a bidder within the competition, even though that bidder may have failed to comply with a Requirement which was stated to be a threshold Requirement. The concept of “leaning against disqualification” is one that is rather difficult to apply, yet remaining within the rules of the competition if those very rules state disqualification will or must occur. The SORR was a NDA document (arrived at following dialogue with the bidders) and constituted the rules of the competition.

Further, I do not accept that the SMEs were entitled to apply the scoring criteria differently to how those criteria were set down in the SORR, simply because they feared that to apply the criteria correctly would result in a disqualification, and so to “lean against disqualification” in that way either. The NDA had an obligation to apply the rules of the competition contained in the SORR transparently and in accordance with the obligations upon it under the Regulations, which include that of equal treatment. “Leaning” one way or the other to influence the evaluation in respect of any particular bidder is or would be, in my judgment, an obvious example of unequal treatment.

There is no provision within the SORR itself for some further consideration by the NDA as to whether a failure was one of form rather than substance, with disqualification following only if the failure to achieve threshold was the latter but not the former. However, failures of form rather than content fall to be considered under the principle of proportionality which is considered further in this section. I do not accept that the NDA had the discretion claimed in its qualification (5) in respect of any of the Requirements being challenged by Energy Solutions.

Further – and this is a practical, rather than legal point – the NDA SMEs did not see themselves as either having or exercising such a discretion, even if they had one. The SMEs saw themselves as applying the “if in doubt, score up” approach. That was not something that applied specifically to threshold Requirements; the NDA witnesses told me that it was a rule that applied to the evaluation generally, and it was included within the training slides used to train the SMEs before the evaluation started. It was a way of arriving at a particular score, and it was only once that score was finalised that it would be known if a bidder had failed to achieve threshold or not. This is not the same as reaching a below threshold evaluation (or a fail) and then deciding whether to exercise a discretion to avoid disqualification, and hence increasing the score for that reason.  </p>

Any supposed “disproportionality” could only arise as a result of the direct application of the rules; therefore the rules of the competition set out in the SORR must within themselves (for there to be such potential disproportionality) have specified as a potential threshold failure something that may not have been that important.

However, to introduce the test of something “so deficient it is not fit for purpose” urged upon me by the NDA would be, in my judgment, to rewrite the SORR itself. That was not the way the competition was designed, and that is not the way the rules of the competition were drafted.

Also, given the subject matter of the whole competition and the fact that nuclear facilities and radioactive waste play a central part in that, it might be thought that “points of detail” could prove to be rather important during the duration of the contract. Bidders engaged in such activities could reasonably be expected to have a grasp of detail. Whether points in the tender are, or are not, of particular importance is something that had to be addressed when the scoring matrices in the SORR were being decided upon and drafted, not after the bids have been submitted in an effort to avoid application of the rules of the competition. </p>

The tenderer relied upon the fact that the Council had relaxed the rules for two other tenderers. One was the subject of the power failure, and it was this that had led to the extension of three hours to the deadline. The other tenderer had been concerned that the case studies had not been uploaded, and been allowed to lodge these in sealed hard copy before the deadline expired. That tenderer’s offices were in Exeter so this was possible, but in the event the hard copies were not opened because the upload had, in fact, included the case studies. The Judge held that the factual circumstances concerning these two other tenderers were objectively different to the Claimant’s, and so the Council’s behaviour towards them did not amount to discriminatory treatment of the other tenderers. The Judge also held, in paragraphs [55] and [56], that the principle of proportionality also applies to procurement competitions.

The tenderer in that case had made an error concerning the period for which the tender was valid, and that error was obvious to any reader of the tender. The Commission did have an express power contained in the invitation to tender to seek a prompt clarification, but rather than exercise this, it rejected the tender as non-compliant with the tender terms. </p>

The principle can be explained in summary as requiring a proper relationship between the action taken, and the objective to be achieved. It is the opposite of the principle of “zero tolerance”. The principle of proportionality is woven into both the substantive and adjectival law. It is central, for example, within this jurisdiction to the procedural reform contained in the Woolf reforms of 1999 and more recent procedural reforms. However, in a procurement competition, the objectives to be achieved are compliance with the legal obligations of transparency and equal treatment, and compliance with the rules of the competition. The action under consideration in this case would be disqualification in certain circumstances. In my judgment there is a proportionate relationship between that action and the objectives to be achieved.  </p>

Disqualifying a bid in those circumstances could not be said to be a disproportionate result.

This is because where a Requirement was given a score, that mark (when adjusted for weighting) was to count towards the overall percentage outcome of the competition. In my judgment, CFP was not entitled to be marked as though, say, a particular Requirement merited a 3, or a 5, when in reality and in accordance with the SORR, the bid only merited a 1. The proper course would have been to mark that Requirement correctly (in this example a score of 1) yet waive the “below threshold” consequences. That would also be the transparent course. I consider this a compelling point that affects six of the Requirements challenged by Energy Solutions which attracted a score that would count towards the total. Increasing the score artificially to one above Threshold, to avoid having to face the consequences of a below Threshold score, cannot properly be described as a waiver at all, in my judgment.

She also suggests that there should be a presumption that contracting authorities have a right to waive non-compliance (as well as to allow corrections) in the case of “nonconformity with merely procedural requirements”, with the presumption capable of rebuttal when there is evidence of impact on the authority or a significant advantage to the tenderer; where the need to comply with the requirement might have deterred other tenderers; or where significant risks of abuse exist. With respect to Professor Arrowsmith, in my judgment that appears to go too far. I do not accept that there is such a presumption. Even if there were, that presumption could be rebutted where (as here) the rules themselves state that disqualification is mandatory.

If form, then there is a second step. If the failure relates to content, in my judgment, the second step would not fall to be considered at all. That second step would be then to consider the scope and extent of the failure. If merely trivial, then the authority could potentially waive the failure, as long as doing so would not breach the obligations of transparency and equal treatment. Further, such waiver should only be permissible in the most exceptional of cases. It is also important to differentiate between cases where the rules of the competition entitle the authority to waive non-compliance, and those that do not.

In a technically complex tender such as this one, failure to align these two different areas would undoubtedly have an impact. The purpose of those Requirements was to ensure that the two separate component parts of the bid – the cost, and the technical aspects of the work – sat together consistently. The only one that could arguably fall into the “trivial or no real impact” category could be Requirement 401.5.1(b), which was also a Pass/Fail, and which did not contribute to the percentage outcome. However, upon analysis, it can be seen that the content (as well as the form) was what was being assessed in that Requirement.

The alternative would be conducting an unlawful evaluation leading to a potential challenge, claims for damages and even greater embarrassment and financial loss depending upon the outcome. The final point has already been made above; with the scores of so many threshold Requirements counting towards the overall percentage total, the solution to the position in which the NDA found itself could not be artificial or unwarranted increase of a score.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">It was not legitimate for the NDA to “lean against disqualification” if that means applying the scoring criteria set down in the SORR differently because the effect of applying such criteria fairly and equally would have led to disqualification of a bidder. The court is slow to interfere with a decision by the NDA as to evaluation, which would lead to the score or Pass/Fail being awarded – manifest error is required for reconsideration of the score, and in matters of judgment there is a margin of appreciation available. However, there is no separate stage of “reluctance to interfere” if there is a manifest error such that the score is reconsidered, and the lower score would constitute or lead to a failure to achieve threshold. </p>

This factor however needs to be considered at the evaluation stage, as the SMEs should have evaluated the response in accordance with one that a RWIND tenderer could have understood to be in accordance with the SORR. Disqualification would only fall to be considered after that process had occurred, if the score that resulted after that evaluation was one either of below threshold, or failure. </p>

Energy Solutions have waived privilege in certain communications with Freshfields on this issue. In an email of 26 September 2014 at 3.25pm, Freshfields recorded their view about payments to witnesses in the context of paying Mr Matthews, who was a consultant and not an employee. This advice was given by Ms Roe’s assistant Kate Gough, assisted by Emma Procter, to Ms Roe, and was then given to Mark England of Energy Solutions in a meeting the same afternoon. The advice reviewed the law of England and Wales concerning this subject, and Energy Solutions was told that a witness must not be paid contingent on the evidence he or she gives, or “for giving evidence”. However, compensation could be paid for the time spent “provided that the rate is reasonable and represents the witness’s loss of earnings for the time spent.” Emails back to Freshfields on the same day at 17.25 and 18.08 show that both Mark England and Simon Stuttaford were aware of the advice, and an agreement was reached with Mr Matthews at his standard hourly rate for his loss of earnings. This was the same rate he was paid for working on the bid. That agreement is unobjectionable and the NDA take no point in respect of it.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">Freshfields were not instructed to advise Energy Solutions on the redundancy programme but knew it was occurring. They were obviously involved in the litigation throughout the process. They notified Burges Salmon on 1 December 2015 of the intended disposal of Energy Solutions by its US parent, and again notified Burges Salmon of completion of that transaction on 11 April 2016. The next relevant part of Ms Roe’s involvement came in April 2016 when a draft of the proposed consultancy agreement with IJRB Ltd was sent to Freshfields by way of background, as Freshfields were to prepare delegations for Mr Bowes and Mr Board for the next phase of the litigation. The commercial terms were not reviewed at that time by Ms Roe. On 4 July 2016, a copy of the final version of that agreement was sent to one of Ms Roe’s assistants, Tom Hutchison. That day, it was briefly reviewed by Ms Roe (Ms Gough being away) and she noticed, in passing, a reference to “bonus payments”, which led her to review clause 4.2 itself. This clause was the one that contained the operative provisions relevant to this issue, namely the contingent payments of £100,000 and the 0.5% of damages recovered. She was immediately very concerned, but did not realise that the £100,000 was already in place from the earlier Supplementary Agreement, and thought it was a purely prospective future arrangement. She did, however, immediately instruct Mr Hutchison to follow this up and investigate the point, which he did initially with Mr Bowes, and although Mr Board was on holiday, also with Mr Board a couple of days later. Counsel were then consulted on 11 and 12 July 2016 which led to the letter dated 12 July 2016 being sent out later that day both to Burges Salmon and the court.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">The following points are relevant. In my judgment, Freshfields acted as promptly as could be expected, and with urgency, once Ms Roe noticed the reference to such arrangements in the document she had been sent. No criticism can be attached either to Ms Roe, or to any of her team, for not realising the existence of these arrangements earlier than they did. Also, Mr Bowes, when asked by Freshfields, and then Mr Board too, were entirely open and helpful in explaining not only about the document they were asked about (the Percentage Fee Agreement) but also the Supplementary Agreements too. They therefore brought the full picture to the attention of Freshfields and in my judgment there was no attempt at secrecy. I should also state that Ms Roe acted in accordance with the highest professional standards, and brought the matter promptly to the attention of the court so that the handing down could be postponed and the matter thoroughly investigated.  </p>

Also coincidentally, Burges Salmon acted for Energy Solutions in the redundancy programme, but Mr Stuttaford told me that the continuing role of Burges Salmon as HR advisers to Energy Solutions was specifically considered by him following receipt of the acknowledgement of service in the First Claim {A/3/1}, and it was decided that as long as something “sat wholly outside of the claim….

He also accepted that he drafted the Supplementary Agreements. He actually signed Mr Board’s Supplementary Agreement {D/19/85}. He also accepted that he had signed the Disclosure Statement in the litigation on 30 April 2016 {G/11/15}, less than three weeks before this. Rather worryingly, he said that he did not consider drafts of the Supplemental Agreements would be disclosable – a point which is plainly and obviously wrong – but even on his own view of “documents”, and given the duty of continuing disclosure, I fail to see how in any circumstances, any solicitor could sensibly fail to disclose the executed Board Supplementary Agreement. Not only is this failure to disclose extremely concerning in itself, in my judgment the failure to disclose is a free-standing and separate issue to the formation of such contractual arrangements themselves. These are two separate issues, and Mr Stuttaford is central to each of them.  </p>

He used the phrase “inherently corrupt”, stated that such arrangements “must be regarded objectively as corrupt ones” and also referred to them as “corrupt arrangements”. He described them as “secret arrangements which were known to be improper”. However, he did not put the case in these terms to the witnesses which, were the NDA intending to advance such arguments, should have been done. At the end of the crossexamination of Mr Stuttaford, I did put to Mr Stuttaford the point about corruption, as a matter of basic fairness and because, of all the witnesses, in my judgment he could have been expected to know more about the propriety of such agreements than anyone else involved.

He therefore became the responsible director running the Magnox programme from February 2013, and hence was not involved in the bid. He was not involved in the decision to issue proceedings against the NDA but supported it. He did not know how the amounts payable in the Supplemental Agreements would be dealt with in the litigation either as part of the quantum claim, or as costs, and I find that he could not be expected to know. He did not think about them in the context of disclosure and I find that he could not be expected to do that either; Mr Stuttaford, in my judgment, had that responsibility. He oversaw the redundancy programme and the restructuring. He saw the agreements to pay litigation win bonuses as part of dealing with the small group of people necessary to be dealt with as a distinct group. The Settlement Agreements were in a common form for all employees, and the Supplemental Agreements each depended upon the personal circumstances of the individuals in question. Shortly after the bid had been lost, some personnel including Mr Colwill had raised the question of bonuses if the litigation was successful. This was understandable in my judgment – they would have received such a bonus had the bid been successful, and the whole rationale of the procurement challenge was that the RSS bid <span style="font-style:italic">should </span>have been successful. However, although this was rejected by Energy Solutions at that time, once the redundancy programme was adopted it had to be reconsidered and was. Also, Mr Board and Mr Bowes were rightly concerned about the effect on their futures of the confidentiality undertakings. In my judgment Mr Joyce took a business decision at a high level, ignorant of the public policy considerations relevant in this jurisdiction to such agreements. He instructed Mr Stuttaford to draft the agreements and this was done.  </p>

Obviously that equitable remedy is designed with the purpose of putting the parties back into their pre-existing positions. The correct characterisation of the nature of the Supplemental Agreements in terms of illegality would have an impact upon enforceability of (for example) one of the witnesses in seeking payment of the litigation win bonus. That issue is academic here, and any views I could express are not made after full (or indeed any) argument on this point. Suffice it to say, for present purposes, that payments to a witness contingent upon the outcome of litigation such as these are contrary to public policy and also contrary to the SRA Rules. They should not have been entered into. However, the fact that they were does not of itself entitle the NDA to succeed on this application.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hapgood QC readily accepted that there was no authority specifically on the point upon which he sought to rely. However, his primary submission was that this conduct was so far at the extreme end of the scale that dismissal of the claim, and/or striking out of the claims, was necessary as the trial “had been corrupted”, the evidence was tainted, there was a significant risk that a fair trial was impossible, and was generally conduct by both witnesses and Claimant that was so reprehensible that the Claimant had lost its right to have its claims heard. Essentially, the right to access to the courts had been lost. In the alternative, he submitted that the trial before me was so compromised it was necessary to have the case reheard by another judge at a retrial. Exploring the final element of the consequences of that alternative case for a mistrial before me, and a retrial, it was expressly submitted that none of the five witnesses involved could give any admissible evidence at a retrial and should not be permitted to be called. In technical terms, leading counsel for the NDA (of whom there were two) agreed they had become incompetent as witnesses. </p>

This was the case even if a claim had been fraudulently exaggerated. The emphasis should be on a fair trial. In that case the conduct was a claim for solicitors’ fees brought on the basis of fabricated documents and a knowingly inaccurate bill of costs. It was held “the remedy should be proportionate to the abuse” and the appeal against the striking out of the claim was allowed. Even there, where the conduct went to the very heart of the substantive claim, it was not struck out.  </p>

But, for my part, I would allow that appeal on a second, and additional, ground. I adopt, as a general principle, the observations ofMillett J in <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose Ltd v Southend United Football Club Ltd (The Times,S March 1988)</span> that the object of the rules as to discovery is to secure the fair trial of the action in accordance with the due process of the court; and that, accordingly, a party is not to be deprived of his right to a proper trial as a penalty for disobedience of those rules - even if such disobedience amounts to contempt for or defiance of the court - if that object is ultimately secured, by (for example) the late production of a document which has been withheld. But where a litigant's conduct puts the fairness of the trial in jeopardy, where it is such that any judgment in favour of the litigant would have to be regarded as unsafe, or where it amounts to such an abuse of the process of the court as to render further proceedings unsatisfactory and to prevent the court from doing justice, the court is entitled - indeed, I would hold bound - to refuse to allow that litigant to take further part in the proceedings and (where appropriate) to determine the proceedings against him. The reason, as it seems to me, is that it is no part of the court's function to proceed to trial if to do so would give rise to a substantial risk of injustice. The function of the court is to do justice between the parties; not to allow its process to be used as a means of achieving injustice. A litigant who has demonstrated that he is determined to pursue proceedings with the object of preventing a fair trial has forfeited his right to take part in a trial. His object is inimical to the process which he purports to invoke.  </p>

Secondly, it is not a correct characterisation of the nature of these agreements when consideration is made of the relevant facts. The central point in the litigation is that had the NDA acted lawfully, RSS would have won the procurement competition. Each of these witnesses would have been entitled to a bonus at the time as a result of RSS winning the competition, had that occurred. Accordingly, on one view of their employment rights, one consequential effect of success in the trial would have been possible lawful entitlement to a bonus. The fact that the Supplemental Agreements had different amounts to those bonuses does not, in my judgment, matter. They had already worked on the bid submission itself, gaining bonuses for submitting that bid, even though that work was within their employment responsibilities and could arguably be said to be covered by their salaries. Assisting with the case, preparing their statements, and giving evidence, was work additional to their normal employment responsibilities, and given the subject matter of this case, must have involved work out of normal working hours and at weekends.

This case concerned surveillance evidence clearly demonstrating that an employee in a personal injury action against his employer had grossly and fraudulently exaggerated the effect of his injuries, claiming significant disability and inability to work. He could in fact not only work normally, but even play football. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by the employer who sought to strike out the award of damages for the injuries he had actually suffered. The employer argued this was justified as the fraudulent case he had advanced was an abuse of process. Lord Clarke in [41] to [44] makes it clear that there is jurisdiction to do this, both within the court’s inherent jurisdiction and the CPR, but this power would only be exercised where “it must be a very rare case” and he agreed with the Court of Appeal who had said this was “a largely theoretical possibility”. In my judgment, the existence of the Supplemental Agreements does not come close to making this such a very rare case.  </p>

The points on the Supplemental Agreements have all been put to the witnesses. I have taken account of these points when assessing the weight which I should attach to the evidence of the five witnesses in question. This was a lengthy trial and even without the supplementary submissions necessary in March 2016, the trial started in November 2015 and ended in January 2016. There are only finite resources available to the courts. Undergoing the whole trial process again – for what is, if I am correct about admissibility, the purpose of questioning witnesses on the Supplementary Agreement before another judge – would not only increase cost to the parties, it would also deprive or delay other litigants. In my judgment, it would be contrary to the overriding objective in the CPR. The same evidence would be led at the subsequent trial, as I do not consider that there is a new category of inadmissibility of evidence created by the execution of such agreements. The NDA accepts there is no authority to support their express submission that each of the five witnesses has become incompetent. That submission is, in my judgment, entirely wrong in law. </p>

It could, potentially, be advanced without any evidence at all from witnesses for Energy Solutions. Indeed, one part of the case upon which Energy Solutions succeeded was particularly suited to such an approach, namely the CFP Threshold Issues which are the subject matter of Part X Sections C1 to C6. There is nothing to suggest that even if the NDA was correct, and even if each of the five witnesses who entered into the Supplemental Agreements did become incompetent to give any evidence, or that their evidence were totally untruthful, that this would have any effect.

The summary of my findings on these Nodes was that Mr Grey failed to apply industry standards, and the tests set out in his own published material, to the categorisation of critical assets. He manifestly applied the wrong test. Again, there is no need for extensive, or even any, evidence from the five witnesses the subject of these Supplemental Agreements for that case to succeed a second time. In terms of equal treatment (or lack of it), in Node 411 the NDA had marked RSS down for failing to identify either the AETP or the saline groundwater pumping system as critical assets. However, CFP did not identity these very same systems as critical assets either, yet the CFP bid was not marked down.

Given the context, it was particularly important that the competition was conducted in proper compliance with the relevant legal obligations, which are designed to ensure fair competition and transparency. There is an obvious public policy benefit in important public contracts being awarded to the most economically advantageous tenders. It was important that evaluation of the tender responses was done in accordance with the rules of the competition and the SORR, and in accordance with the obligations of transparency and equal treatment which were upon the NDA.

Whatever the reason or reasons behind the failures that occurred in this competition – and excessive workload on a few individuals may have been one explanation for at least some of the problems – there is, in my judgment, no escaping the fact that applying the correct legal test to the evaluation exercise leads to the scores having to be reconsidered, with some of them changing. There were many manifest errors by the NDA SMEs in the evaluation of the RSS tender with the result that the RSS score is, as a result of this judgment, to be increased. On some Requirements, RSS was treated quite differently and less advantageously than CFP. Indeed, the NDA had conceded in any event that the RSS tender score had to be increased as a result of Requirement 5.9(c) for both Nodes 110 and 112 in Agreed Issue 37.  </p>

They sought guidance from the Core Competition Team and a way was found to avoid disqualification of CFP. In my judgment the NDA sought to avoid the consequence of disqualification by “fudging” the evaluation of those Requirements to avoid reaching a situation where CFP would be given a “Fail” or “Below Threshold” score. By the word “fudging”, I mean choosing an outcome, and manipulating the evaluation to reach that outcome. This was by choosing a score high enough to avoid that undesirable outcome, rather than arriving at a score by properly considering the content of the tender against the scoring criteria.
