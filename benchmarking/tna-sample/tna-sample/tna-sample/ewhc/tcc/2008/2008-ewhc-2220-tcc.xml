	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">This is the final round of the long running litigation between Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd (“Multiplex”) and Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd (“CB”).  Multiplex are the main contractor who constructed the new National Stadium at Wembley.  CB were the steelwork subcontactor.  Matters did not proceed smoothly and each party lost confidence in the other.  By agreement, CB’s role under the subcontract was substantially reduced in February 2004 and was further substantially reduced in July 2004.  On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2004 (by which time CB’s obligations were limited to a fraction of their original scope) Multiplex and CB parted company in acrimonious circumstances.  Both this court and the Court of Appeal have held that it was CB who repudiated the subcontract.  After 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August Multiplex employed Hollandia BV (“Hollandia”) and Hollandia’s sister company, Zuid-Nederlandse Staalbouw (“ZNS”) to perform CB’s repudiated obligations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.48in;margin-right:0.05in">The principal obligation which CB repudiated was the obligation to fabricate certain steel for the bowl of the stadium.  This steel (referred to by all counsel as “the repudiated steel”) was fabricated by ZNS at much lower cost.  It is therefore common ground that Multiplex made a substantial gain as a result of CB’s repudiation of its principal obligation.  In their written closing submissions Multiplex quantified this gain at about £2 million (as demonstrated by Mr Williamson at day 36, pages 98 – 99).  CB contend that Multiplex’s gain is substantially higher. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.48in;margin-right:0.05in">Multiplex’s original position was that, because the subcontract was so attenuated by 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2004, damages for repudiation would be modest.  Multiplex’s claim for damages for repudiation (after giving appropriate credit) was only some £3 million.  However, that position changed dramatically following Multiplex’s victory on the repudiation issue.  In schedules 4A to 4F served in August 2006 Multiplex claimed to have suffered losses totalling no less than £25 million as a result of CB’s repudiation. </p>

On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2004 the two actions were consolidated.  Multiplex became claimants and CB became defendants in the consolidated action.  CB’s parent company, Cleveland Bridge Dorman Long Engineering Ltd, became second defendants in the consolidated action.  At a case management conference on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, I had a constructive discussion with leading counsel as to how the disputes might most economically be resolved.  A set of nine preliminary issues was formulated by counsel, the answers to which (it was hoped and expected) would enable the parties to resolve their differences.  A tenth issue was subsequently added to the list at the request of counsel on both sides.  The trial of preliminary issues 1 to 10 commenced on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 and lasted for a month.  On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006 I gave judgment on preliminary issues 1 to 10 (“judgment 1”): see <span style="font-style:italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> [2006] EWHC 1341 (TCC).  Judgment 1 dealt with a number of issues concerning the interpretation and effect of the Heads of Agreement (dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004) and the Supplemental Agreement (dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2004), both of which amended the terms of the original subcontract.  Judgment 1 also rejected CB’s case that there was an oral agreement fixing the value of CB’s work as at 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004 and dealt with the repudiation issue.  On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2007 the Court of Appeal gave judgment upholding this court’s decision in relation to issues 1 to 10, in so far as they were challenged on appeal (“CA judgment 1”): see <span style="font-style:italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> [2007] EWCA 443 (Civ). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">While this court’s judgment on issues 1 to 10 was making its way through the Court of Appeal, Multiplex served amended schedule 4 pleadings transforming their case on damages for repudiation, as mentioned above.  Multiplex’s new case included the proposition that, at the time of repudiation, CB were responsible for designing and fabricating temporary works for the roof.  At the request of the parties, I agreed to try a further preliminary issue (“issue 11”) to determine whether that proposition was correct.  On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2007 I gave judgment to the effect that, as at the date of repudiation, CB were not responsible for the design or fabrication of temporary works for the roof (“judgment 2”): see <span style="font-style:italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> (No. 2) [2007] EWHC 145 (TCC).  On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2007 the Court of Appeal gave judgment upholding my decision that, as at the date of repudiation, CB were not responsible for the fabrication of roof temporary works, but reversing my decision in respect of responsibility for the design of roof temporary works.  The Court of Appeal held that CB remained responsible for the design of roof temporary works (“CA judgment 2”): see <span style="font-style:italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> [2007] EWCA 1372 (Civ). </p>

All thoughts of reaching a sensible settlement after resolution of the preliminary issues (as canvassed at the December 2005 case management conference) were seemingly jettisoned.  The parties served pleadings, witness statements and evidence for the main trial, due to start in March 2008.  CB pleaded their claim for payment in respect of work done in Scott schedule 2.  Multiplex responded with a rival version of Scott schedule 2, setting out Multiplex’s valuation of the work.  Multiplex pleaded their claim for damages, alternatively abatement for defects in Scott schedule 1 and their claim for damages for repudiation in Scott schedule 4, to all of which CB have responded.  Two recent decisions of this court concerning the pleadings are <span style="font-style:italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> (No. 4) (“judgment 4”) [2008] EWHC 231 (TCC) and <span style="font-style:italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> (No.5) [2008] EWHC 569 (TCC) (“judgment 5”).  Judgment 4 dealt with CB’s application to re-rere-amend Scott schedule 2.  Judgment 5 dealt with Multiplex’s application to re-amend Scott schedule 4C. </p>

The volume of evidence is such that if all matters were to be explored in what may be called “the old style”, the trial would have lasted for well over a year.  The parties did not wish to incur costs on that scale.  Accordingly they entered into a “chess clock” agreement, whereby the trial would commence on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March (subsequently put back to 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March) and finish by the end of May, with the time available being shared equally.  The trial duly proceeded on that basis and was concluded on Wednesday 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  The consequence of this accelerated programme was that many matters were touched upon very briefly at the oral hearing and much of the evidence has been left to my private reading. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Post-trial hearings.</span>  Whilst judgment writing during June and July I held a number of post-trial hearings, for which purpose I provided to the parties numerous draft chapters of the judgment.  The purpose of these hearings was twofold: first, to seek counsel’s assistance in checking my calculations or doing further calculations or agreeing figures as appropriate; secondly to discuss with counsel the impact of my draft decisions on other issues in the case.  Occasionally it emerged that matters requiring decision by the court had not been dealt with at the trial.  Those matters were sometimes argued out at the post-trial hearings and were sometimes agreed between the parties (with certain encouragement from myself).  In a case such as the present, where there is a complex skein of interrelated issues, such a procedure can lead to considerable saving of time and costs, as it did in this case.  I pay tribute to counsel and solicitors for the co-operative and constructive approach which they adopted at these post-trial hearings.  As a result, by the end of July (two months after the end of trial) all consequential calculations had been carried out and the parties knew what sums were being awarded in respect of each head of claim and counterclaim in the various Scott schedules.  Issues concerning interest and the position in respect of retention monies (which were not explored during trial) were resolved in September.  Those matters will be dealt with in the final chapter of this judgment.  </p>

This did not mean that all the drawings changed, although the models had to be remade.  This was not a huge task.  There was a change in the assembly method for T7, because the parts were drawn in such a way that it was not very practicable to transport or assemble them.  Indeed, in July CB said that they wanted to change the method of assembling T7.  A further reason for the change made by Hollandia was to improve quality control and tolerances. </p>

This involved rotating the arch to a more upright position (producing slack in CT17 so that it could be connected to nodes at each end) and then rotating the arch to its final position, so that the whole load was carried by CT17.  The load of the arch was then taken by the PPT and concrete cores C3 and C10 (the two cores nearest to the foundations of the arch at either side of the stadium).  One major problem which emerged in late 2004 was that cores C3 and C10 (constructed by PC Harrington) were not strong enough to take the load during the arch layback operation. </p>

It also overcame the problem identified in section 6 of Hollandia’s April 2004 audit report (viz that CB’s method of erection was not feasible, given the tight tolerances).

Fast Track did the remedial work itemised in schedule 1D and they often ticked the ‘client’ box on the site modification sheets.  They did this because they had been asked to do the work by representatives of their client, Multiplex.  They were not apportioning blame as between Multiplex and CB. </p>

This is a claim for £10,850 in respect of replacing the bottom flange of upper tier raker section, so as to enable tubular brace to be erected.  The work is said to have been instructed by site works instruction SW 063.  It can be seen that the site record sheet corresponding to SW 063 (M1D-1/73) contains no figures for labour or materials, but merely a round sum total at the bottom of the page.  This figure is carried across to schedule 1D, where it is described as “estimate”.  Furthermore, schedule 1B (paintwork following on after remedial work to steel) contains no item corresponding to SW 063.  On the basis of these documents Mr Williamson suggested that the remedial work alleged in Hol 15 simply was not done at all.  Mr Perkins denied this and said that the work was definitely carried out.  Multiplex actually saw the work being done.  In the alternative, Mr Williamson suggested that if the work was done, then it was the subject of other site records; it never gave rise to the financial claim for £10,850 which appears in the site record sheet at M1D-1/73.

He accepted that a number of factors (such as crane availability or weather) could affect the erection rate.  It was put to Mr Watkins that the rate of output assumed in his present calculation was substantially higher than (a) the estimate which he gave at a meeting in March 2004, (b) the output assumed in the calculations in his first witness statement and (c) output which he had put forward as reasonable in oral evidence at the first trial.  Mr Watkins made a number of points in response.  In particular, the figures under discussion are all averages.  The actual erection rate is heavily dependent upon the weight of steel pieces being erected.  It takes much longer to erect 20 pieces of steel weighing 1 tonne each, than 1 piece of steel weighing 20 tonnes (even though heavier steel has to be lifted more slowly).  The calculations in his present statement are directed to what labour force is required to achieve a specified output.  His earlier calculations were directed towards assessing what output the actual labour force ought to have achieved. </p>

The unions had been unco-operative from the time that Hollandia took over, and matters came to a head with the strike. </p>

These diary entries were reviewed at some length in crossexamination (day 21/139 – 171).  Many of the entries relate the wrong steel being delivered or to pieces of steel which could not be found.  Mr Green made two principal points about these diary notes.  First, they recorded problems at the time of writing.  If a vital piece of steel was found soon afterwards, Mr Green would not go back and amend his diary note.  Secondly, in his diary he blames all problems on “Darlington”.  However, Mr Green’s subsequent investigations have revealed that most of the problems for which he was blaming Darlington were in fact caused by design changes. </p>

So there is a difference here between Multiplex’s records and CB’s records.  Looking more generally at Mr McGregor’s list of B and C status connection designs, that does not indicate any major outstanding work.  The work required could be minor.

SK 3 illustrates a simple mathematical model and finite element analysis.  SK 4 illustrates how pre-sets and pre-cambers overcome the problem of deflection.  SK 1 and SK 5 show how the gaps, in which rafters and purlins are to be fitted, change during erection.  SK 7 shows how purlins are used to prevent a member buckling under compressive load.

Go Data was also unable to cope with the extensive work done by other fabricators or by other contractors and subcontractors, such as Enob and Hollandia.  In order to deal with these matters, much information had to be entered manually into the system.  There was concern within CB that steel had reached site without appearing on Go Data.  Accordingly CB staff made manual entries, in order to show additional steel on site.

Some turning struts can be seen.  Their weight would have been about 2 tonnes per linear metre.  The toblerone trusses were suitable for re-use.

In relation to north roof erection, both Hollandia’s method and CB’s method had certain advantages and disadvantages.  The water bag system would have had disadvantages requiring consideration.  Similar comments could be made about the erection of the south roof.  One advantage of Hollandia’s methodology was that movement during the erection phase would be reduced. </p>

He has no experience of giving expert evidence and no knowledge of the requirements for giving expert evidence.  He is not independent of CB, having been employed by a company in the Cleveland Group for the last eleven years.  See day 17, pages 77 – 78.    Permission has not been obtained or sought under CPR rule 35.4 to call expert evidence in relation to the “roof” issues which Mr Taylor addresses.  CPR Part 35 constitutes the “rules of court” referred to in section 3 (1) of the Civil Evidence Act 1972. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point to note is that Mr Taylor, like several other witnesses in this case, is a highly qualified and experienced engineer, who was involved for many months in the Wembley project.  He is employed by DLT.  In that capacity, between February and July 2004 he assisted CB in the design of roof connections and in dealing with erection engineering for the north and south roofs.  He managed the north roof erection engineering team.  It is not clear whether he managed the south roof erection engineering team.  Between February and October 2005 Mr Taylor was engaged by Hollandia to assist in relation to erection engineering for the north roof.  In the interval while Mr Taylor was absent from Wembley, Hollandia had taken the basic decisions as to how they would erect the north and south roofs.  Mr Taylor’s role was to assist with the detailed implementation of those decisions in relation to the north roof.  It is self evident that in order to perform his functions in 2005, Mr Taylor had to understand the decisions which had been made while he was away and to read the relevant documents.  It is clear from the evidence that Mr Taylor had many discussions with Hollandia’s engineers; the relationship between DLT’s engineers and Hollandia’s engineers was one of mutual respect.  One cannot look at the north roof in isolation from the south roof, not least because of their complex interrelationship.  An engineer could not design the detailed erection engineering for any part of the roof, without fully understanding the overall methodology.  Furthermore there is a continuing interaction between permanent works connections design and erection engineering.  Decisions made in each discipline affect the other.  I shall therefore treat Mr Taylor as a factual witness who (a) is possessed of considerable engineering expertise and (b) has personal knowledge of the roof design and erection engineering decisions which were made in the period February 2004 to October 2005. </p>

In relation to major engineering projects (such as Wembley Stadium or the M6 Toll Road) those factual witnesses are likely to have very considerable expertise.

It very often happens in professional negligence cases that a defendant will give evidence to a judge which constitutes the reason why he considers that his conduct did not fall below the standard of care reasonably to be expected of him. He may do this by reference to the professional literature that was reasonably available to him as a busy practitioner or be reference to reasonable limits of his professional experience; or he may seek to rebut, as one professional man against another, the criticisms made of him by the claimant’s expert(s). Such evidence is common, and it is certainly admissible. Mr Phillips, who appeared for the claimant at the trial, did not believe he had told the judge that Mr Moreland’s evidence on matters of this kind was inadmissible, and neither of the very experienced leading counsel who appeared in this counsel who appeared in this court was willing to support the judge’s view of the matter. </p>

For example, an engineer after describing the foundation system which he designed may (and in practice frequently does) go on to explain why he believes that this was appropriate to the known ground conditions.  Or an engineer brought in by a claimant to design remedial works (which are subsequently challenged as excessive) may refer to his experience of rectifying comparable building failures in the past.

The objections to his first statement were raised in correspondence but then were left on one side until the matter surfaced after his oral evidence was complete.  Mr Taylor’s two witness statements together span 143 pages.  It is not a realistic task for me to append all 143 pages to this judgment indicating which parts are admissible and which are not.

On the other hand, I note that many of Mr Taylor’s views were accepted by Multiplex’s witnesses, when put in cross-examination.  I conclude that the presentation, but not the underlying content, of Mr Taylor’s witness statements was unduly influenced by CB’s lawyers.  Furthermore, Mr Taylor gave his oral evidence in a fair and candid manner, despite his admitted close connection with CB.  These are all matters which I take into account when assessing the weight to attach to those parts of Mr Taylor’s evidence which are admissible. </p>

The evidence of Mr Perkins and Mr Petaccia establishes that some limited damage had previously been caused to painted steel whilst at CB’s yards, before starting the journey to Wembley.  However, it is quite impossible to separate this damage out from the substantially greater damage to paintwork caused by Multiplex. </p>

It required remedial work which went well beyond normal “touch up”.  Touching up is normally required to 5-8% of the surface area of steel.  In this instance, however, damage affected between 15 and 30% of the surface area of columns and beams.  Mr Atkins compiled the twelve daywork sheets totalling £81,235, and he put this down in his blame sheet as to be the responsibility of CB.  Further details of the remedial work are to be found on surveillance sheets 148-154 and 162-168, all of which Mr Atkins compiled. </p>

The subcontract breakdown includes separate sums for assembly and pre-assembly in relation to the arch, but not in relation to the bowl.  In my view, the welding of rakers formed part of the fabrication process, wherever CB chose to carry out that work.

The bottom ends of the cables were attached to ring cable node points on CT 17.  The highest point of each cable was attached to the arch, as shown in the plan at defendants’ supplemental 1A, slide 2.  CB duly installed the cables, but unfortunately in respect of four cables they misaligned the ends attaching to the node points on CT17.  As a result, when the arch was raised in June 2004 to its initial position, those four cables became twisted.  The cables remained twisted when CB repudiated on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2004.

On the other hand, it is clear from the evidence of Mr Davies and Mr McGregor that Bridon undertook a substantial amount of work in order to rectify the twisted cables.  It is also clear from the payment advice notices and Hollandia’s invoices that (a) Hollandia paid Bridon’s invoices and (b) Multiplex paid Hollandia for Bridon’s work pursuant to contract WP2760.  See in particular Hollandia’s application for payment no. 46 at T7/401.068.  Mr Ong states that his team validated the documentation before paying Hollandia in respect of Bridon’s work.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in">As will be set out below, Multiplex made a substantial gain from CB’s repudiation of its obligation to fabricate outstanding bowl steel (the “repudiated steel”).  This is because Hollandia fabricated the repudiated steel at a significantly lower cost than CB would have been entitled to charge under the Supplemental Agreement.  Mr Williamson contended that the gains which Multiplex made in this regard should be set off against Multiplex’s claims in schedule 1:  see day 36, pages 105 – 106.  This was a new argument, which had not been raised until the last day of closing speeches.  I have come to the conclusion that the argument is unsound for two reasons. </p>

The other flows from ceasing to work after 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August.  It is fortunate indeed that CB’s repudiation of the fabrication contract has enured so substantially to Multiplex’s benefit.  That, however, is a consequence of CB’s deliberate conduct and Multiplex are entitled to keep the windfall.  If CB had not done defective work, Multiplex would have kept the whole of that windfall.  As it is, Multiplex have had to pay out £151,305.39 in order to put right CB’s defective work.  Multiplex are entitled to recover that sum as damages.  There is no reason why Multiplex should pay those remedial costs out of their saving on post-repudiation fabrication costs. </p>

Each of those three activities (completing work on site, bringing materials onto site and procuring materials off-site) generate preliminary costs.  The whole thrust of paragraph (a) is directed towards work actually done and materials actually provided.  As the Court of Appeal pointed out in CA judgment 1, paragraph (a) of schedule 1 to the Supplemental Agreement is closely linked to clause 21 of the sub-contract conditions; and within clause 21 the “core provision” is clause 21.3.2: see paragraphs 100-101 of May LJ’s judgment.

At first sight, this may suggest that work off site (such as procurement) is to be disregarded.  However, such an approach to valuation would be odd and would be inconsistent with the Payment Programme.  Clause 1.1 of the Payment Programme provides “The purpose of the Payment Programme is to show the values of the various elements of the Works for the purpose of valuations and payment”.  Furthermore, clause 21.4 (2) expressly refers the reader to the three activity bars in the Payment Programme and these comprise: (i) management and preliminaries, (ii) procurement and fabrication and (iii) construction activities.  When one reads clause 21.4 (2) in conjunction with the graph in the Payment Programme, it is clear that valuations must have regard to work done by CB both on and off site.  Any more restrictive reading of clause 21.4 (2) would (a) be unduly harsh upon CB and (b) would conflict with the Payment Programme. </p>

If CB’s interpretation of the sub-contract were correct, it would mean that CB became entitled to substantial monthly payments of the fixed elements of preliminaries, even if CB did no work and procured no steel.  In the present case, it would mean that CB became entitled to reimbursement of preliminary costs which CB had not begun to incur.  For example, in the valuation up to 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February CB would be entitled to recover £638,000 in respect of strand jacking, even though CB had not incurred those costs: see Dr Mastrandrea’s report re schedule 2 at paragraph 3.98.

Dr Mastrandrea was cross-examined about the reliability of Go Data on day 26 at pages 89 to 100 by reference to Multiplex’s pleaded criticisms of the system.  (Multiplex’s pleaded criticisms of Go Data are set out in Multiplex’s Further Information dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2006.)

CB agreed that those drawings would be included in the list of contract drawings; that the contract sum would remain at £60 million; CB would be paid for doing the additional work identified in those drawings by means of £400,000 being added to whatever may be the assessed valuation of the hotel variation (whether that valuation was a negative or a positive sum).

One obvious reason for not specifying part payments is that Go Data does not reveal how much fabrication has been carried out to steel which has entered that process.  Nor does it reveal how much painting has been carried out to fabricated steel, which has gone off for painting.  There simply was no practicable way of valuing part fabrication or part painting (as CB concede in paragraph 219 of their opening note). </p>

Thus it can be seen that CB receive credit for work in progress as at repudiation in two ways.  First, Multiplex’s claim for damages in schedule 4A is reduced because there was less work to do in respect of part fabricated steel.  Secondly, the amount of credit (i.e. the unused part of the £12 million lump sum) which Multiplex must give against their damages claim is increased. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">The final issue which arises concerns the 1,200 tonnes of variation steel. Should that be treated as all falling within the erected category (as Multiplex contend) or should it be spread evenly across all categories (as CB contend)?  In my judgment that quantity of steel should be spread evenly across all categories.  CB’s application for payment in respect of variation work (in the sum of £8,504,830) was advanced on the basis that such work was only partially complete.  Multiplex’s valuation of that work was in a substantially lower sum than claimed by CB.  I see no basis for treating Multiplex’s valuation as attributable entirely to steel which was fully erected.  An even distribution of variation work across all categories represents the best and fairest estimate that can now be achieved. </p>

Mr Underwood explained (and Multiplex now accept at paragraph F 8.25 of their closing submissions) that the explanation is as follows: as a consequence of the hotel variation, less metal decking was required in phases 11, 12 and 18 than before.

The roof, like the bowl, was a complex structure and subject to extensive change.  The appropriate wastage factor is 7.05%. </p>

The first issue (upon which I am not sure that any money turns) concerns dates.  Multiplex concede that in relation to item 1 of the purchase order CB are entitled to payment for fabrication work completed up to the date of repudiation.  That is because there is no payment mechanism linked to interim applications and certificates.  In relation to item 2, however, Multiplex point to the reference to clause 4.7.  They submit that this brings in the payment mechanism of the subcontract.  Accordingly, CB are only entitled to payment for fabrication work done under item 2 up to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2004 (the date up to which certificate 37 runs). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept this argument.  Item 2 expressly incorporates clause 4.7 of the subcontract, namely the yardstick for valuing variations.  It does not, however, either expressly or impliedly incorporate any other provisions of the subcontract.  In particular, it does not incorporate the payment mechanisms of the subcontract (interim applications and certificates).  Accordingly, I hold that CB are entitled to payment for fabrication work carried out under item 2 up to the date of repudiation. </p>

The record of shipments at T21/190 shows that the fabricated and partly fabricated steel was shipped back to England on various dates between January and March 2004.  The discrepancy between 1,922 tonnes on shown on SGT’s spreadsheet and the total of 1,897.5 tonnes derived from the shipping invoices is not one which the parties or I can explain.  It is clear, however, that the two tonnages relate to the same subject matter.  Possibly the discrepancy is due to an accumulation of small errors in the shipping invoices.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">The first issue is whether CB are entitled to be paid under the purchase order for completing the fabrication of partly fabricated steel sent back from China.  In my view such steel falls within the meaning of “China steel returned unmade”.  It can be seen from the spreadsheet at E9/36 that of that 219 tonnes (a) 137 tonnes related to phases 13 and 17, (b) 82 tonnes related to phases 14 and 16.  The purchase order applied to steel for phases 13 and 17, but not to steel for phases 14 and 16.  I therefore conclude that CB are entitled to be paid under the purchase order for completing the fabrication of 137 tonnes of partly fabricated steel relating to phases 13 and 17.  CB are not entitled to be paid under the purchase order for completing the fabrication of the other 82 tonnes.  Nor are CB entitled to be paid for fabricating the additional 51 tonnes, which have somehow found their way into the PMS reports under code 430 China.  There is no evidence that that steel was “returned unmade from China”.  Therefore the latter quantities of steel fabrication (the 82 tonnes and the 51 tonnes) fall under the schedule 1 (b) lump sum. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view CB are entitled to be paid for completing the fabrication of the 137 tonnes at half the contractual rate under the purchase order.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">I now turn to steel fabrication recorded under code 430A. CB were entitled under the purchase order to be paid at the agreed rate for steel which they fabricated up to the date of repudiation.  They had no contractual right to be paid for steel which was in planning or in fabrication on that date.  The purchase order neither expressly nor impliedly entitled CB to be paid in respect of steel which was not fully fabricated.  Accordingly CB are entitled to be paid under the purchase order for fabricating 237 tonnes of black steel returned from China.  CB are not entitled to be paid for the 394.24 tonnes in planning or the 53.68 tonnes in fabrication. </p>

See paragraphs 161 – 162 of CB’s written closing submissions.

Once Multiplex have reimbursed CB (or become obliged to reimburse CB) for the purchase of black steel, it cannot sensibly be suggested that Multiplex should return such steel to CB merely because CB have stored or fabricated or painted that steel but have forfeited the right to payment for such services by reason of repudiation.  Steel which Multiplex have paid for but which CB have worked upon is not analogous to the builder’s materials in <span style="font-style:italic">Sumpter v Hedges</span>.  Furthermore, given the time and the circumstances of CB’s repudiation, Multiplex had no real option but to retain that steel.  Nor is there any evidence that CB would have welcomed the return of steel members fabricated or partly fabricated to fit the bowl of Wembley Stadium.  CB never suggested that they would like to receive the Wembley steel back. </p>

This shows that 1,712 tonnes of steel were in planning and 704 tonnes of steel were in fabrication.  The term “in planning” means that the steel was in the preparation bay for the purpose of cutting holes, drilling and so forth: see paragraph 243 of Mr Underwood’s fourth witness statement and paragraph 27 of Mr Underwood’s fifth witness statement.  The term “in fabrication” means what it says.  CB contend that the figures for steel in planning and steel in fabrication should be added together (producing 2,415.95 tonnes) and that the total should be halved in order to reach an amount of assumed fabricated steel for the purpose of this exercise.  I regard that approach as unduly generous to CB.  It is reasonable to assume that, on average, the steel in planning was half way through the cutting and drilling process; the steel in fabrication was half way through the fabrication process.  I must therefore assume that 856 tonnes of steel had been cut and drilled, and that 352 tonnes had been cut, drilled and fabricated.  In other words 856 tonnes are assumed to be less than half way through the whole process and 352 tonnes are assumed to be more than half way through the whole process.  These figures are all approximations, because no record survives of how far any particular piece of steel had actually progressed through the fabrication process on the critical date.  Doing the best I can on the basis of Mr Underwood’s factual evidence, I find that the total quantity of steel in planning and steel in fabrication represented the equivalent of 805 tonnes having been fabricated (i.e. one third of 2,415 tonnes).  I shall therefore subtract 805 tonnes from the figure of 9,551 tonnes calculated above. </p>

However, it is clear from the factual evidence that on occasions steel was delivered in the wrong sequence and that this caused significant delay and disruption to CB’s work.

Mr Buckingham took Mr Green through those diaries in some detail in cross-examination on the afternoon of day 21.  I was not persuaded by Mr Green’s assertion that all of the problems for which he blamed “Darlington” in his diary were really attributable to design changes by Mott.  Mr Osborne accepted in cross-examination (as summarised in chapter 3 above) that some of the blame for these matters rested with CB.  Having considered Multiplex’s recent letter of claim against Mott, Mr Green’s diary and the oral evidence, I consider that there were two causes for the mishaps which Mr Green recorded so eloquently in his diary: mistakes by CB at Darlington or Scunthorpe in assembling loads and design changes by Mott both before and after 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.  </p>

Thus it is necessary to apportion non-destructive testing costs between those welds which are to be characterised as fabrication and those welds which are to be characterised as erection and site works. </p>

Following the trial I have received written submissions on this issue, which (although unwelcome) I have carefully studied.  Each side contends that the apportionment should be at least 90% in its own favour.  The documents relied upon by each party were not referred to during oral evidence and argument.  The picture which emerges is far from clear.  Doing the best that I can on this material, I shall apportion non-destructive testing costs equally between clause (b) and clause (c). </p>

It appears from Go Data that CB subsequently purchased 96.11 tonnes of steel for the arch.  It is not at all clear why this steel was purchased.  Dr Mastrandrea might be correct in his speculation that this steel was obtained for the purpose of rectifying defects.  CB have failed to prove on balance of probabilities that this steel falls within clause (f) of schedule 1.  This head of claim is dismissed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the fixed roof, I have gained assistance from a number of contemporaneous documents.  One such document is DLT’s assessment of July 2004.  This showed that in relation to the north roof, the design of phases 51, 52, 57, 58 and 59 were 100% complete; the design of phases 53 and 54 was 98% complete; the design of phases 55 and 56 was 99% complete.  In relation to the south roof, DLT’s assessment showed that the design of phases 65, 66 and 69 was 100% complete; the design of phases 61 and 62 was 98% complete; the design of phases 63, 64, 67, 68, 81 and 82 was 97% complete.  Mr Hargreaves put this document in cross-examination to Mr Boks, who had no reason to doubt its accuracy: see day 11 page 135.  Another relevant contemporaneous document is Mott’s email to Multiplex dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2004 (QC 41/ 82).  That email reviews the north roof and the south roof in some detail and makes it clear that the overwhelming majority of the permanent works design and drafting had been carried out by CB. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">I have come to the conclusion that CB cannot rely upon any notional benefit from using the toblerones on the Antwerp Ring Road project for two separate reasons.  First, on the evidence, CB have not yet been awarded the Antwerp project; although I wish CB well in relation to their tender, my overall assessment of the Antwerp evidence is that CB’s chances of success are less than 50%.  There has been an ominous silence from the main contractor (a Belgian/ Italian consortium) since the time when CB were shortlisted: see day 24, page 7.  Secondly, the Antwerp project and its specific requirements are special circumstances which were not in Multiplex’s (or indeed CB’s) contemplation at the time when the Wembley subcontract was executed.  Thus any loss referable to the Antwerp project falls outside the second limb of <span style="font-style:italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span> (1854) 9 Exch 341: see the judgment of Alderson B at 354 – 355. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, Mr Forrest’s evidence, which chimes with that given by Mr Taylor, does satisfy me that the toblerones could have readily been adapted for re-use by CB on other projects generally.  Furthermore, this is a matter which would have been appreciated by Multiplex, CB and the industry generally.  Indeed both Multiplex and CB appreciated that the toblerones could be re-used at Wembley. </p>

This is calculated by taking £710,000 as referable to a total period of 70 weeks, and then allowing an appropriate proportion for 18 weeks.  See item G on page 2 of Multiplex’s re-amended Scott schedule 2 (which is not elaborated in the re-reamended additional particulars and explanations).  Dr Mastrandrea slightly increases Multiplex’s pleaded figure on the basis that the relevant period was 19 weeks, not 18 weeks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">The actual costs which CB incurred (whether more or less than the allowance within the £12 million lump sum) are irrelevant to this issue.  In my view CB are only entitled to an appropriate proportion of their on-costs, bond and insurance costs.  CB are not entitled to recover those costs which are attributable to the period after repudiation.  Multiplex only received the benefit of CB’s on-costs, bonds and insurance in respect of work done prior to repudiation.  If CB had not repudiated, it is reasonable to assume that they would have been engaged upon the various works comprised in clause (b) of schedule 1 to the Supplemental Agreement for a period stretching substantially beyond the summer of 2004.  In assessing what that period would be, I must disregard any delays flowing from design changes by Mott after 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.  The best assessment that I can make is a period of one year from 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004.  On this basis CB are entitled to recover 36.5% of the lump sum allowance for on-costs, bonds and insurance.  I therefore award £259,150 under this head.  </p>

The final paragraph of schedule 1 to the Supplemental Agreement (set out in chapter 17 above) makes it clear that costs payable to Enob fall outside the £12 million lump sum.  However, there is no similar provision in respect of Babtie’s fees.  Since the parties specifically turned their minds to provisional sums, they would have included such a provision in respect of Babtie if that was intended. </p>

I say “in principle” because, as events turned out, Multiplex actually saved money by employing ZNS to fabricate, paint and deliver to site the repudiated subcontract steel.  The sums which Multiplex paid to ZNS for providing those services were substantially less than the sums which Multiplex would have paid to CB under the subcontract (as amended by the Supplemental Agreement) if CB had fully performed.  This curious result arises in part from Multiplex’s success in relation to schedule 2.  As a consequence of the terms of the subcontract (as amended) Multiplex do not have to pay for fabrication and painting done by CB after 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and Multiplex do not have to pay for work in progress as at that date.  In other words, as a result of the repudiation, Multiplex receive at no cost the benefit of certain fabrication and painting done by CB, but Multiplex must give credit for that benefit when claiming damages.  Thus the assessment exercise which I must undertake in relation to schedule 4A will produce not a sum of damages due, but a sum for which Multiplex must give credit in their damages claim. </p>

The reasons why ZNS refused to commit themselves to the proposed terms during the course of the works were twofold: first, the price of steel was escalating (see van Gils, cross-examination at day 11 page 45); secondly, ZNS were in a strong bargaining position following CB’s departure from the scene.  When I refer in this judgment to “contract WP 2755-1”, it should be noted that strictly speaking I am referring to a draft contract whose terms were not finalised until March 2006.  </p>

In making this finding I have had to reconcile, as best I can, many inconsistent pieces of evidence.  In particular, Mr Perkins’ schedule at QC 51/49 – 50 indicates that as at 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September Oakwood would need to do 3,749 hours work to complete the design and drafting of the bowl.  On the other hand Mr Boks at paragraph 23 states that most of the design and drafting of the bowl was complete by December 2004.  According to appendix 4A Oakwood only did 1,166 hours work on the bowl up to December 2004 (reduced by Dr Mastrandrea in his appendix 2.4A to 1,076 hours).  According to Mr Boks, after mid-October most of the work done in relation to the bowl merely consisted of obtaining approvals from Mott, who were rather slow in responding: see day 11, pages 105 – 107.  Having considered all of the evidence referred to in chapter 24 above, as well as the material cited by the parties in relation to schedule 4C claim 3, I conclude that there were about 3,000 hours work outstanding on the design and drafting of bowl steelwork when CB repudiated.  The remaining work done by Oakwood during the relevant period must have been related principally to the design and drafting of roof.  See the cross-examination of Mr Boks. </p>

Accordingly, Multiplex’s “loss” under schedule 4C claim 3 lies in the fact that they have had to pay Hollandia for 3,000 hours of design and drafting of bowl steelwork, rather than 1,500 hours.  Oakwood’s average hourly rate in respect of this work was £30.20 per hour. After adding a 10% mark up and then allowing for the compromise factor, I quantify this loss at £47,887. </p>

Indeed this is apparent from the site works instructions and attached sketch plans in bundles M1D-1 to M1D-5.  In addition to the pure design/drawing work, Hollandia also had to survey the steelwork in order to identify the defective and incomplete items.  Bearing in mind (a) the nature of the remedial works and (b) the evidence adduced in relation design and drafting costs in Scott schedule 2, I conclude that it would be reasonable to allow an average of twenty hours for Oakwood in relation to each item fully proved in schedule 1D and an average of ten hours for Oakwood in relation to each item partially proved.  On this basis Multiplex are entitled to recover the costs of Oakwood working for 820 hours.  Oakwood’s average hourly rate was £36.58 per hour in respect of this work, to which Hollandia reasonably added a 10% mark up.  Therefore the total cost of those 820 hours was £32,995.

No claim is made in respect of the design and drafting work carried out by Hollandia in respect of the moving roof: see paragraph 34 of the claimant’s reply to the defendants’ amended response to schedule 4C (A2/1045).  Multiplex’s decision to exclude the moving roof from their claim is obviously sensible, in view of the substantial changes made by Mott to the primary design of the moving roof after the date of CB’s repudiation.  Furthermore the design and drafting for the fixed roof involved about three times as much work as the design and drafting for the moving roof: see Mr Wilkinson’s cross-examination at day 18, page 144. </p>

Accordingly Hollandia increased the width of packs to 20 mm.  Mr Boks supports this criticism of CB’s design in paragraph 86 of his witness statement.  In crossexamination Mr Boks was asked to consider paragraph 146 of Mr Taylor’s witness statement.  In that paragraph Mr Taylor asserts that CB’s allowance of 10 mm was reasonable, given CB’s erection methods, and that the change to 20 mm was simply a consequence of Hollandia’s different approach to erection.

As can be seen from the roof plan, these two rafters form part of phases 63 and 65 of the south roof.  They run between the PPT and truss T7.  Multiplex plead that CB’s connection designs at each end of these rafters allowed insufficient tolerance to facilitate erection.  Mr Boks supports this criticism at paragraph 86 (b) of his witness statement.  He explains that the PPT and truss T7 were installed before the rafters.  In order to enable the rafters to be installed, Hollandia adopted two measures.  First, they fabricated the rafter connection plates over size, so that they could be cut to size on site.  Secondly, they omitted the pin holes when fabricating the plates, so that these holes could be cut on site in the correct position.  In cross-examination Mr Boks was asked to consider paragraphs 151 and 152 of Mr Taylor’s witness statement.  In those paragraphs Mr Taylor states that CB and Hollandia had different methods of erecting rafters R6 and R7; both methods were feasible; the changed connection design was simply a consequence of adopting Hollandia’s method of erection.  Mr Boks said very frankly that he did not have sufficient knowledge to say whether Mr Taylor was correct.  See day 12, page 30, lines 20 – 21. </p>

This is the massive truss which sweeps across the stadium from east to west and supports the northern edge of the south roof.   CB’s design provided for the main members of truss T7 to be welded on site.  Multiplex plead that Hollandia did not have confidence in this approach and therefore resolved to build the truss in large sections at their factory.  Mr Boks supports this criticism in paragraph 86 (c) of his statement.  He states that the joints would have taken a considerable time to build on site and that there was a serious risk the joints would not be sufficiently precise in terms of tolerances.  Mr Boks maintained that view in cross-examination: see day 11, pages 97 – 99. 1473.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span> Mr Taylor holds the opposite view, as set out in paragraphs 177 – 182 of his witness statement.

CB’s intended erection methodology was perfectly feasible.  It would have been successful if CB had remained as erectors.  Hollandia, as the new erectors, perfectly reasonably adopted a different methodology.  The differences between the two methodologies arose because of (a) the preferences of different steelwork erectors and (b) in some instances (e.g. truss T7) reasonable differences of opinion as to which course would be more advantageous.

By 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, whatever the contractual position may be, it seemed impracticable to Mr Muldoon for Hollandia to do the erection and for CB to do the erection engineering.

If the contractual rights which he has lost were capable by the terms of the contract of being rendered either less valuable or valueless in certain events, and if it can be shown that those events were, at the date of acceptance of the repudiation, predestined to happen, then in my view the damages which he can recover are not more than the true value, if any, of the rights which he has lost, not having regard to those predestined events.” </p>

For my part, I think it plain that the risk of a fire of this kind was, on the face, well within the scope of outcomes which the respondent’s contractual duties were intended to avoid. So much appears, I think, from the catalogue of obligations cited by the judge at paragraph 38 which I have set out. Accordingly, even if the letter of 21 January 1997 and the enclosed fax did not constitute a warning of a risk of fire of the kind which occurred on 9 March 1997, a question to which I will come in a moment, it was a warning of an outcome which the respondents themselves should have prevented from happening . I find it very difficult to see how the giving of such a warning ought to transpose the burden of avoiding that very outcome, from the respondents, who owed a duty in effect to prevent it, to the appellants who were the beneficiaries of that duty.” </p>

The contractual benefit for the loss of which the victim of the breach can seek compensation cannot escape the uncertainties of the future. If, at the time the assessment of damages takes place, there were nothing to suggest that the expected benefit of the executory contract would not, if the contract had remained on foot, have duly accrued, then the quantum of damages would be unaffected by uncertainties that would be no more than conceptual. If there were a real possibility that an event would happen terminating the contract, or in some way reducing the contractual benefit to which the damages claimant would, if the contract had remained on foot, have become entitled, then the quantum of damages might need, in order to reflect the extent of the chance that that possibility might materialise, to be reduced proportionately. The lodestar is that the damages should represent the value of the contractual benefits of which the claimant had been deprived by the breach of contract, no less but also no more. But if terminating event had happened, speculation would not be needed, an estimate of the extent of the chance of such a happening would no longer be necessary and, in relation to the period during which the contract would have remained executory had it not been for the terminating event, it would be apparent that the earlier anticipatory breach of contract had deprived the victim of the breach of nothing.” </p>

Megaw LJ’s statement was entirely correct, for the event was predestined to happen and the consequence which he set out in the passage which I have quoted had to be regarded as following. It might be doubted whether Megaw LJ intended to enunciate a general rule limiting consideration of subsequent events to those predestined to happen, seen from the date of acceptance of repudiation, and it may be observed that neither Lord Denning MR nor Edmund Davies LJ went so far as to tie the consideration of subsequent events to those which could be seen at the date of repudiation as certain to happen.

Both these cases illustrate circumstances in which post-repudiation events can be taken into account as reducing the damages recoverable for repudiation.  The width of the principle that may be derived from these authorities is a topic which may need to be explored in future cases.  For present purposes, however, I can look at the matter quite narrowly.  In my view the principles stated in<span style="font-style:italic"> The Mihalis Angelos </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> The Golden Victory </span>can be applied by analogy to construction contracts.  I derive the following proposition.  If a contractor (D) repudiates at a time when the employer has resolved to remove certain of D’s obligations and has already engaged another contractor to perform those obligations, the court in assessing damages should disregard D’s failure to perform those particular obligations. </p>

Multiplex was obliged to enter into a costs plus contract with Hollandia in respect of engineering and design work.

Multiplex had already engaged Hollandia to undertake erection engineering before CB repudiated and had no intention of allowing CB to perform that task.  It is clear on the evidence that Hollandia were not willing to enter into a fixed price contract for erection engineering.  In view of the design changes emanating from Mott and the looming major changes in erection methodology, such a fixed price contract would not have been feasible in or after August 2004. </p>

If a contractor (D) repudiates at a time when the employer has resolved to remove certain of D’s obligations and has already engaged another contractor to perform those obligations, the court in assessing damages should disregard the D’s failure to perform those particular obligations.  That proposition must apply both as between employer and main contractor and as between main contractor and subcontractor. </p>

If CB had not repudiated, by what means would Multiplex have removed erection engineering from CB’s lump sum works under the Supplemental Agreement, and what would have been the financial consequences?  Mr Muldoon believed that he was entitled to issue a variation instruction, omitting erection engineering and adjusting the £12 million lump sum accordingly.  However, as Mr Williamson demonstrated in his supplementary note submitted in January 2007, that belief was not correct.  A variation clause entitles the employer to omit work which he no longer requires.  Absent specific provision to that effect, a variation clause does not entitle the employer to omit work for the purpose of giving it to another contractor.

In this somewhat confused situation what resolution would have been reached between the parties, absent repudiation?  Mr Williamson submits that erection engineering would have been removed from CB and that no adjustment would have been made to the £12 million lump sum: see day 36 pages 175 – 180.  Mr Stewart submits that CB would not have been willing to do a fair and reasonable deal; but if such a deal had been done, then a substantial deduction would have been made from the £12 million lump sum under schedule 1 (b) of the Supplemental Agreement: see day 36 pages 181 – 183. </p>

From his analysis of Multiplex’s programmes Mr Crane maintains that construction of the east and west tunnels were the driving activities for the critical path in August and early September: see paragraph 5.5.1. </p>

At no time did the problems concerning the tunnels in fact hold back steelwork erection, as Mr Hunter explained at day 29, page 26.

Nevertheless, it is common ground between the parties to this action that there were serious shortcomings in Mott’s performance and these shortcomings had the effect of seriously delaying and disrupting the rate of steel erection on site.

It becomes less surprising, however, when one bears in mind: (a) the attenuated nature of CB’s obligations as at the date of repudiation; (b) the fact that less than a week before repudiation Multiplex changed erectors (a decision which was bound to cause delay, disruption and expense); (c) Multiplex’s success on certain valuation issues, which impact negatively on damages. </p>

He refers to the minutes of CB’s board meeting on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2004.  According to those minutes, Mr Grant outlined two options to the board, the second of which was stopping work.  One consequence of the second option was noted as being a potential liability in damages up to £6 million.  I do not see any force in this argument.  In late July 2004, the respective legal positions of the parties were unclear and a number of views were possible.  It was obviously sensible to draw the attention of CB’s board to CB’s possible liability in damages.  However, nothing in those board minutes or the surrounding documents undermines my conclusions on Scott schedule 4, which have been reached after many weeks of oral evidence and legal argument. </p>

The Technology and Construction Court exists to provide a dispute resolution service to the business community and pre-eminently to the construction industry.  In many cases, of which the present is typical, both parties are members of the construction industry; they have a dispute about a final account and usually a cross claim for damages.  The normal and sensible way of resolving such matters is for the court to decide questions of principle and for the parties then to sort out the financial consequences.  This approach generally leads to the resolution of multi-million pound disputes at proportionate cost, and enables the parties to get back to their real business. </p>

Neither party has won an outright victory.

However, instead of reaching a sensible resolution at that mediation, the parties spent the next two years litigating about two matters, namely Multiplex’s claim for damages and CB’s claim for a final account.  Multiplex’s claim for damages was subject to a £6 million cap and has, in the event, been assessed at £151,309.   CB’s claim for a final account involved a host of valuation issues, of which – inevitably – some went in favour of CB, some went in favour of Multiplex, and many were assessed at a figure somewhere between the extreme positions adopted by the two parties.  A resolution broadly along the lines of this judgment could have been arrived at by the parties at fractional cost, if both parties had instructed their advisers to go through the accounts together in a constructive spirit taking as their starting point the court’s decision on issues 1 to 10. </p>

A trial bundle of some 550 ring files has been assembled.  The cost of photocopying alone is approaching £1 million.  The pleadings, which incorporate schedules, counter-schedules and appendices, run to literally thousands of pages.  Each side has fielded a team of experts, solicitors, leading counsel and two or three junior counsel.  There have been two rounds of preliminary issues (the second to deal with new matters pleaded in August 2006), two trips to the Court of Appeal, innumerable applications, cross-applications, amendments to the pleadings and finally a three month trial of all valuation and damages issues.  Every little point has been fought out, some orally and some on the basis of written evidence and argument.<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>Since 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006 (when issues 1 to 10 were decided) the parties have run up costs of some £14 million.

That level of expenditure far exceeds the sums which (after stripping out the froth) are seriously in dispute between the parties.  Furthermore costs were only limited to that level by reason of the fact that (a) there was a “chess clock” agreement to limit the length of the trial to three months, (b) counsel on both sides worked prodigiously hard to compress their oral presentation into that narrow period. </p>

Over the last two years both parties have brushed aside repeated judicial observations on the wisdom of settling this particular litigation.  Each party has thrown away golden opportunities to settle this litigation upon favourable terms.  Those golden opportunities continued to arise during the run up to trial and even during the first month of trial.

Once this court has decided questions of principle, the parties can save themselves and their shareholders many millions of pounds by instructing their advisors to agree reasonable figures for quantum, if necessary with the assistance of a mediator unconnected with the court.  If one party is not prepared to negotiate, then the other party can protect its position by making a timely and realistic offer under Part 36.  The court’s decision on preliminary issues should be used by both parties as a basis for sensible discussion or at least as a basis for sensible assessment.  It should not be used as a platform from which the victor on the preliminary issues launches new and ill thought out claims in order to transform its case on quantum.  Finally, I wish to place firmly on record that what has happened in this case is in no way typical of litigation in the Technology and Construction Court. </p>

That was after the signing of the Heads of Agreement but before the execution of the Supplemental Agreement, i.e. during the interregnum.  The bond was in the sum of £1,514,732.53, which was less than 5% of the subcontract sum.  In those circumstances Multiplex did not release the entirety of the retention monies to CB, but only an amount equivalent to the value of the bond.  In other words Multiplex continued to retain the amount by which the retention monies otherwise due exceeded the value of the bond.  In 2007 disputes arose between the parties as to whether Multiplex were entitled to make calls upon the bond.  Those disputes were settled on the basis that CB would pay (and did in fact pay) to Multiplex the value of the bond, namely £1,514,732.53.  Multiplex held that sum as retention in lieu of the bond. </p>

Multiplex’s new position is that they are entitled to retain the full 5% retention until such future time as a notice of making good defects is issued under the main contract.

Both parties could, if they had wished, have advanced more ambitious submissions about retention.  If any of the arguments outlined at the hearing on day 42 had been raised during the trial, a number of factual issues would have required investigation (as demonstrated by Mr Williamson on day 42).  Mr Martin (whose statement was served in September 2008) would have been called and cross-examined.

In view of the fact that the evidence was called and the trial was concluded some three months before the parties adopted their present positions, each party would be gravely prejudiced if the other were allowed to resile from previous admissions.  The Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Sowerby v Charlton</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1610 gave guidance on how the court should exercise its discretion when dealing with an application to withdraw admissions: see in particular paragraphs 35 to 36.  In my judgment, the present case is about as strong a case as one can imagine, in which neither party should be allowed to withdraw previous admissions concerning retention.

In other words, Multiplex were entitled to retain the items until steel erection was complete.  It appears from the photographic evidence that that time arrived on or about 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006.

As from 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006 CB’s indebtedness to Multiplex was reduced by £740,103 (the amount awarded in chapter 26).
