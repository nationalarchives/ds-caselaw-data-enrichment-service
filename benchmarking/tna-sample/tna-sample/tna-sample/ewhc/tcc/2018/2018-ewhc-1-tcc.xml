	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">This is a dispute about the quality of the fabrication of steel piles (“MPs”) and transition pieces (“TPs”) for an offshore wind farm in the North Sea. The Claimant (“Fluor”) is an engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management company registered in England (and is a subsidiary of Fluor Inc, the US multinational construction company).  The Defendant (“ZPMC”) is a well-known steel fabricator, based in Shanghai with a major manufacturing base at Changxing Island.  ZPMC has an international reputation as a heavy duty equipment manufacturer, in particular ship to shore container cranes.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">This judgment concerns the issues of quantum, which are made much more difficult because in June 2010 substantial elements of Fluor’s claim were settled by an agreement set out in two letters, known as the “waiver letter” and the “warranty letter”.  Accordingly, this judgment is not concerned only with the assessment of the damages to which Fluor is entitled - an exercise difficult enough in itself - but also with the extent to which the entitlement to damages which Fluor might otherwise have had has been curtailed or extinguished by the settlement agreement.</p>

As before, I am very grateful to them all, and their teams, for their very carefully prepared submissions and for ensuring that this difficult and complex trial ran so smoothly.  I owe a particular debt of gratitude to the solicitors on each side who went to enormous lengths - seven days a week - to provide me with the documents that I needed when I needed them.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">By the terms of the contract made between Fluor and Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Ltd (“GGOWL”), known as the BOP Contract, Fluor agreed to engineer, procure and construct the foundations and infrastructure to support 140 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) which were to be installed in the North Sea approximately 26 km off the coast of Suffolk.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Each foundation consisted of an MP, which was a massive steel structure composed of individual “cans” of rolled steel plates which were then welded together to form a cylindrical column, typically 65 m in length, 5-6 m in diameter and weighing between 550 and 700 metric tonnes. Each of these MPs was to be driven approximately 32 m into the sea bed. At the top of each MP sat the TP, each one of which was approximately 23 m in length and 5 m in diameter. The TP provided the connection between the MP and the structure above it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Fluor’s plan was to fabricate the MPs and TPs in Shanghai and then ship them to Vlissingen in the Netherlands.  Vlissingen was to be a staging port, where Fluor would receive the MPs and the TPs after fabrication, carry out certain work to the MPs (“the base scope works”) and install the requisite electrical equipment in the TPs, including transformers, and then load the MPs and TPs onto special-purpose vessels for transportation to the site and subsequent installation.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In order to ensure the quality of the welds in the MPs and the TPs the BOP Contract provided for non-destructive testing (“NDT”), one form of which was ultrasonic testing (“UT”).  UT involves several different techniques known as scanning patterns: these are discussed in some detail in the Liability Judgment and so I do not propose to go into any more detail about them in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the BOP Contract and, in turn, the contract between Fluor and ZPMC, provided that welds were to be scanned by a UT technique known as E scanning.  This form of scanning turned out to be unable to detect certain types of transverse cracks in the welds.  Unfortunately, the welding carried out by ZPMC contained a significant and, on the face of it, an unacceptable amount of transverse cracking, particularly in the circumferential welds. This was discovered by GGOWL when it arranged for some random testing to be carried out at Shanghai in March 2009 and, a few weeks later, on some of the MPs in Shipment No 1 shortly after its arrival at Vlissingen.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">It was common ground between the experts, and I found, that the extent of the cracking in the MPs was such that they could not reasonably be installed in the seabed by Fluor unless either the cracks were repaired or Fluor obtained an Engineering Critical Assessment (“ECA”) that the structural integrity of the MPs (and TPs also) was not adversely affected by the presence of the cracks.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">On 3 June 2009 (or 4 June – the precise date is in dispute) GGOWL issued a Non Conformance Report (“NCR”) on the MPs in Shipment No 1.  Similar NCRs were issued in respect of Shipments Nos 2 and 3 on 29 July and 7 August 2009, respectively.  Although these NCRs, on their face, referred only to the MPs, the view apparently taken at the time by Fluor was that for all practical purposes they applied to each shipment in its entirety - both MPs and TPs.  Another slightly unusual feature of the NCRs was that, although they referred to a need to revalidate the NDT of the welding, the method of revalidation was not stated. However, GGOWL soon made it clear that it would only accept the revalidation if it was done by a technique known as D scanning, instead of E scanning. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">This gave rise to an allegation by Fluor, supported by ZPMC, that this method of testing was “extra-contractual” with the result that Fluor, and therefore ZPMC down the line, was entitled to be paid for it. This was disputed by GGOWL and so Fluor commenced an arbitration against GGOWL for appropriate relief.  Fluor was unsuccessful: by a Partial Award issued in November 2012 the arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”) found in favour of GGOWL.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In this judgment it is not necessary to embark on any detailed explanation of the issues in relation to the NDT regime and the dispute that arose out of it: it is all set out in the Liability Judgment. All that needs to be said for present purposes is that E scanning and D scanning were broadly similar techniques. To the extent that it is necessary, I accept the evidence given by Mr Hans Ho, of Fluor, to the effect that if in the first place Fluor had been required to carry out D scans instead of E scans, that would not have been materially more time consuming than carrying out E scans.  It is true that in order to perform D scans it might have been necessary to carry out some grinding or smoothing of the weld caps, but once that had been done it only required one pass with the probe along the line of the weld as opposed to carrying out separate passes on either side of it.  The problem at Vlissingen was that the entirety of the MPs had to be retested and, where necessary, repaired before they could be loaded out for installation in the seabed.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The existence of the cracks in the welds, and the consequent issue of the NCRs, threw the project into complete disarray.  Fluor had anticipated that it would be able to receive the MPs and TPs at Vlissingen and thereafter prepare and install them at sea in an orderly sequence. In fact, by early August 2009 it found itself having to accommodate three shipment loads of MPs and TPs at Vlissingen and with a massive inspection and repair operation on its hands.  In effect, what was intended to be a staging port had to be turned into a major manufacturing facility.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Once it became apparent, in early June 2009, that the MPs (and possibly the TPs also) in Shipment No 1 were going to have to be retested and repaired, Fluor arranged to hire a substantial labour force to carry out the required testing and weld remediation.  In addition, it had to lease extra space at Vlissingen, hire tents in which to carry out the work and buy or hire (or extend the hire of) additional plant and equipment - such as positioners to rotate the MPs (so that they could be worked on), scaffolding and cranes. ZPMC, for its part, also sent over to Vlissingen a substantial number of welders to carry out repairs, principally on the MPs.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The expense of all this was enormous, but matters were made worse because Fluor had to bear extensive charges by way of standby costs for vessels that had been chartered to carry out the installation of the MPs and the TPs but which were left largely idle.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Two further factors added to Fluor’s troubles. The first was that a very substantial proportion of the MP’s had “out of roundness” defects, namely that the upper rim of the MP was not within the prescribed tolerances (i.e. was not perfectly round) which meant that the cylindrical hammer which was to be used to drive the MPs into the sea bed might not fit properly.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The second problem, which emerged in late July/early August 2009, was that there was a defect in some of the transformers that were to be installed in the TPs.  During pre-commissioning of these it was found that a few had a high resistance defect, suggesting some form of loose connection within the transformer.  The defective transformers were returned to Waterford in Ireland where they had been manufactured, but after inspection and discovery of the defect, the manufacturer, ABB, was unable to say how widespread the fault might be.  As a result, ABB advised the recall of all the transformers to Waterford for inspection and, if necessary, repair.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">But fate was not smiling on Fluor. When the transformers were returned to Vlissingen it was discovered that they suffered from a different fault that had been caused during the process of inspection and repair in Waterford. As a result, all the transformers had to be returned, yet again, to Waterford to have the new fault put right. The first batch of (two) transformers that had had these “second round” repairs were not returned to Vlissingen until 5 January 2010<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In the meantime, both Fluor and ZPMC had concluded (Fluor having by then engaged various experts) that the cracking in the welds did not actually impair the structural integrity of the MPs or TPs and, on 1 October 2009, Fluor announced its intention of resuming installation on site irrespective of whether or not the MPs and TPs had been repaired.  It now appears that they were right: it is no longer asserted by anyone that the MPs and TPs were not good for their 25 year design life.   It seems that they had been sufficiently overdesigned so that they were well able to withstand the likely imposed loads in spite of the cracks in the welds.</p>

These discussions culminated in a meeting in Shanghai on 20 April 2010. At this meeting Fluor presented ZPMC with the two letters to which I have already referred - the waiver letter and the warranty letter. The former, which concerned “<span style="font-style:italic">the joint pursuit of the substantial additional costs both Fluor and ZPMC have incurred as a result of the MP and TP weld testing and repair protocol required by [GGOWL]</span>”, provided that ZPMC would assign to Fluor its claims for the costs it had incurred arising out of the “<span style="font-style:italic">enhanced testing and remediation of the MP and TP welds it has been required to perform</span>” and that Fluor would in turn waive its claims against ZPMC for “<span style="font-style:italic">the additional costs and delays it suffered as a result of NCRs 006, 008 and 009 issued by GGOWL</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Fluor’s position was the contrary: its case was that the effect of the settlement agreement was in fact very limited.  It submitted that it did not agree to waive costs and delays that it would have incurred had there been no NCRs: it said that it did not suffer any significant costs or delays “<span style="font-style:italic">as a result of the NCRs</span>” because it would have had to carry out all or the bulk of the additional testing and remedial work in any event.  This was a somewhat surprising argument, since no less than four senior representatives of Fluor had given evidence to the contrary before the Tribunal.  In the arbitration Fluor’s case was that all the testing and remedial work was the result of the issue of the NCRs.  In the Liability Judgment I concluded that on this point Fluor’s case in the arbitration was correct and I therefore rejected the arguments put forward by Fluor at the liability hearing.</p>

Shipment No 2 is in a different position because NCR 008 was not issued until 29 July 2009, one month after Shipment No 2 had arrived at Vlissingen. I shall discuss the consequences of this later in this judgment and, in particular, Fluor’s argument that the waiver did not apply in the case of any MP (or TP) on which work of testing or repair had begun before the relevant NCR was issued.</p>

In the ordinary course of events that position would then be compared with the position in which Fluor actually found itself.  In this situation the assessment of Fluor’s damages - albeit difficult as a matter of detail - would be a relatively straightforward, if complex, exercise.</p>

I will give two examples.  The first is the problem in relation to out of roundness of the MPs.  The second concerns the defects in the transformers.  Whilst the out of roundness might have been the result of a breach of contract by ZPMC, no such breach has been pleaded in these proceedings – because Fluor’s cause of action in respect of any such breaches appears to have been compromised during the negotiations for the final account. </p>

However, ZPMC contends also that the ability to install the MPs from Shipment No 2 during July 2009 was adversely affected by the issue of NCR 006 and so, to that extent, Fluor’s claim in respect of Shipment No 2 has been waived.</p>

I accept that, if and insofar as remedial work to correct the out of roundness of any particular MP in, for example, Shipment No 1 could not be carried out until the additional NDT and any consequent repair work required by NCR 006 had been carried out to that MP, the cost of the delay so caused would be a result of the issue of the NCR and therefore excluded by the waiver letter.  However, if it was the case that Fluor, distracted by the discovery of the cracking and the issue of NCR 006, did not address the out of roundness problem with the urgency that it would otherwise have given to it during June and July 2009, I do not consider that that can be said to have been caused by the issue of NCR 006.  That NCR did not require Fluor to postpone its consideration of the out of roundness problem: that was simply a foreseeable result of ZPMC’s breaches of contract in relation to the welding, albeit one compounded by the issue of NCR 006.</p>

Taking Shipment No 2 as an example, Mr Morgan has considered how the weld defects in Shipment No 2 affected the overall progress of the onshore works at Vlissingen to the Shipment No 2 MPs and TPs during the period 29 June to 29 July 2009.  In other words, how they affected the progress of that as built work and, in turn, the actual critical path of the MP/TP installation as a whole.  This was referred to as the <span style="font-style:italic">“but for”</span> approach.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">One aspect of this approach arises in relation to Fluor’s claim for the loss of the opportunity to install MPs in the seabed during July 2009 (prior to the issue of NCR 008) as a result of the weld defects in Shipment No 2.  An important parameter in the analysis of this loss is the rate at which <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin </span>would have been able to install MPs during July 2009 (assuming favourable weather conditions).  What actually happened was that for the first sixteen MPs installed, the rate was, on average, 1.7 days per MP (at least, I will assume this – it is in dispute).   For the subsequent installation that rate improved to 1.5 days per MP (or less) – presumably, it was suggested, because by then the operators involved benefitted from the learning curve.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>In fact, Fluor challenges the notion of the learning curve because it points out that the first three strings to be installed were programmed to take 1.5, then 1.6 and finally 2 days per MP, respectively.  However, whilst these figures do not support the existence of a learning curve, they do not rule it out because other factors, such as the geographical layout of the MPs, may have played a more significant part in the amount of time required.</p>
	      </authorialNote>  When considering the rate at which the first few MPs from Shipment No 2 would have been installed during July 2009 if those MPs had been delivered free of defects, Mr Morgan has taken the former figure.  This is because, he says, that provides the best indication of the rate at which the first MPs would have been installed.</p>

As I have already said, Fluor’s claim for the loss of the opportunity to install the MPs from Shipment No 1 during June/July 2009 has been waived.  However, if the claim had not been waived, the effect of the learning curve on the rate of installation of the first few MPs would have been a factor to be taken into account when formulating and quantifying the claim (the effect of taking it into account would have been to reduce the claim).</p>

In the hypothetical “counterfactual” scenario the starting point is to consider the position as if the contract had been properly performed - not just that part of it relating to Shipment No 2 - and then to compare it with what actually happened in the light of the breaches.  In terms of the assessment of damages, the question of what costs and delays have been settled by the waiver letter falls to be taken into account at a later stage.  That said, I accept ZPMC’s submission that when considering, for example, Shipment No 2, the court must be careful not to award damages in respect of any disruption to the work to Shipment No 2 that was a direct result of the issue of NCR 006 in relation to Shipment No 1.</p>

I should make it clear that this conclusion is not a criticism of Mr Morgan: I have no doubt that the approach that he adopted was one properly taken in the light of legal advice from ZPMC’s legal team on what are essentially questions – and difficult questions - of law and causation.  Although, once one has arrived at it, the answer may seem reasonably obvious, the analysis that has led me to it is one that I reached only after considerable deliberation.</p>

Although he was responsible for the production of the relevant figures, he was unable to explain how some of the relevant percentages had been derived because it seemed that they had been provided by Fluor Corporation and so, I assume, were based on US market conditions with which he was not particularly familiar.  One example was a mark up of 7.5% for liability insurance: Mr Johnston could not explain how this percentage had been arrived at.  Whilst I have no reason to doubt Mr Johnston’s honesty, for these reasons I shall have to treat some of the figures that he has put forward with a little caution.</p>

Similarly, his evidence as to how Fluor would have dealt with the transformers had there been no defects in the MPs or TPs was, essentially, evidence of opinion - albeit based on his experience of many years of employment with Fluor.  I am not prepared to disregard such evidence simply on that ground, but it does diminish the weight that can be given to it.</p>

I am not prepared to resile from that view, but in the light of his evidence at this hearing I consider that he gave evidence in the arbitration that was not in fact correct.  I am quite satisfied that those on the ground at Vlissingen in June and July 2009 considered it very likely that further examination of the TPs would reveal similar welding defects and that, sooner or later, the issue of an NCR on the TPs was more or less inevitable.  In those circumstances I do not think that at the time anyone addressed his mind to the question of whether, for example, NCR 006 covered the TPs in Shipment No 1 because, by one route or another, further NDT and repairs of the welds of those TPs was going to be necessary.</p>

When at this hearing Mr Ayres was shown an e-mail from Peter Reilly, of Airtricity (but effectively GGOWL), dated 19 June 2009, in which Mr Reilly referred to “<span style="font-style:italic">waiting until all of the repairs have been done on a MP or TP and then releasing it to GGOWL</span>”, Mr Ayres said that he thought Mr Reilly had “<span style="font-style:italic">made a mistake on the “or TP” side of things</span>” (Day 9/156).</p>

He may also be correct in saying that GGOWL never gave an unambiguous instruction for further testing and repair of the TPs but, as I have just explained (and discuss further in the section dealing with the TPs below), it seems to have been taken for granted on the ground that no distinction was to be drawn between the MPs and the TPs.  Further, whether it was entitled to or not, GGOWL appears to have made it clear that it would not lift the NCRs until the TPs, as well as the MPs, had been similarly tested and repaired.  In these circumstances, Fluor, rightly or wrongly, assumed that the NCRs covered the TPs as well as the MPs, or were to be treated as doing so, and acted accordingly.  Thus its case in the arbitration was that the NCRs did extend to the TPs and the Tribunal agreed with it.</p>

He was, properly and understandably, embarrassed by and apologetic for this change of position.  Part of his difficulty, which was understandable, was that by the time he prepared his evidence for the liability trial, the events in question had taken place seven years earlier and so his recollection of those events was substantially coloured by what he saw in the contemporaneous documents that were provided to him.</p>

He was also questioned in some detail about the claim for additional NDT costs in Shanghai.  Essentially, what was put to him by Mr O’Sullivan was that the claim had been prepared by simply taking the NDT costs actually incurred by Fluor and subtracting the amount that it expected to incur by way of NDT costs.  The point behind this was that it was said that Mr Ho’s approach overlooked the fact that the use of D scans should have been part of the original scope of the NDT work and therefore should not have been included as part of the extra costs claimed because it was work that would have been carried out in any event if the contract had been properly performed.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Mr Ho’s answer to this was a simple one, namely that D scans and E scans take the same time and so the substitution of one for the other would make no difference.  What caused the increase in expenditure, he said, was the cost of the extra manpower required to carry out 100% NDT, as against a 2-3% spot check which was what he said was anticipated originally.  This seems to me to be a satisfactory explanation and I accept it.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The MPs were to be driven into the seabed by a hammer mounted on a vessel borne crane.  The hammer took the form of a cylindrical sleeve, about 2.8 m long, with heavy “shoulders” at its upper rim which took the force of the impact.  As I understand the procedure, the sleeve was lowered so that it fitted just over the top of the MP and then released so its shoulders, acting as a hammer, struck the top rim of the pile.  Thus there had to be a fairly tight tolerance for the external diameter of the top 2.8 m or so of the MP in order to ensure that it did not jam on the inside of the hammer sleeve.  The specified diameter of the top of the MP was 5100 mm.  Although the internal diameter of the hammer sleeve was originally specified as 5126 mm, it was in fact 5130 mm. </p>

However, the increase in the internal diameter of the sleeve meant that the tolerance for the diameter at the top of the pile could be increased by 4 mm to 5107 mm.   In a Fluor internal e-mail dated 17 June 2009, summarising a conversation with Seaway Heavy Lifting (“SHL”), the owners of <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin</span>, the latter was recorded as saying that the hammer supplier had installed piles with a 20 mm clearance, with the result that there should not be a problem with a pile diameter of 5110 mm and, further, that there might not be a problem with diameters up to 5114 mm.   </p>

Apart from the fact that, if this happened, it would have to be cut off, a potentially more serious problem was that the vessel carrying the hammer would become tied to the MP which could put it at risk if the weather turned rough.  However, the documents do not suggest, and I do not consider, that there was any risk of this happening unless the pile diameter was well in excess of 5110 mm.</p>

For present purposes, the relevance of this provision is that it shows, first, that the parties contemplated that piles with a diameter in excess of 5107 mm might be presented and accepted for installation; and, second, that the decision whether or not to install or to continue to install a particular oversized pile rested exclusively with SHL.  Fluor, therefore, could not require SHL to install an out of tolerance pile.  To the extent that Mr Eisman was to be taken as saying that Fluor would have been prepared to take the risk of installing out of tolerance piles, this could only have happened if SHL, too, was prepared to take that risk.  </p>

There would have been no good reason not to, because this would have provided the 20 mm clearance that was apparently acceptable to the hammer supplier.  Further, in the light of what actually happened (as explained below), I think that it is likely that in particular instances SHL, might have been prepared to drive an MP, using the original hammer, with a maximum diameter up to about 5115 mm.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The “waviness” in the circumference of the MP presented a more difficult problem.  The first difficulty was that of measurement: the elastic deformation of the MPs when they were horizontal made it very difficult to measure accurately the extent of the “waviness”.  As Mr Eisman put it: “<span style="font-style:italic">the whole thing was pretty loose in its engineering reliability”</span> (Day 8/97)<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>  There was nothing to contradict that evidence, and I accept it.  The second difficulty was that it was not elastic deformation and required heat treatment and/or the fitting of a device called a stiffener ring in order to rectify it.  Heat treatment had been used by ZPMC in Shanghai to remedy any out of roundness discovered during manufacture but, as the measurements taken at Vlissingen demonstrated, not always with sufficient success.</p>

By the end of May 2009, after Shipment No 1 had arrived, it was recorded that there were not enough MPs within tolerance for there to be three available to load out onto <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin’s</span> barge: as a result, the first load out – previously scheduled for 2 June 2009 - had to be postponed pending review of the out of roundness measurements (Fluor’s Site Weekly Report of 1 June 2009).</p>

During early June 2009 Fluor’s preoccupation, quite understandably, was the need to make - as a matter of urgency - the arrangements necessary to facilitate the required testing and repair of the welds.  That is not to say that the out of roundness problem was forgotten: my impression from the evidence as a whole is that it was seen as an issue of secondary importance to that of the cracking in the welds.  This is unsurprising - out of roundness did not affect the structural integrity of the MPs, only the method of installing them.</p>

It would, for example, have made no difference in my view to the degree of priority given to the out of roundness problem if NCR 006 had not been issued on 3/4 June 2009, but, say, two or three weeks later.  The out of roundness problem had nothing whatever to do with the state of the welds, but the latter affected the degree of priority that was given to it.</p>

I bear in mind the fact that at this point in time there were no welders from ZPMC on site at Vlissingen, and so ZPMC’s prior experience of heat straightening would have been of limited value.  Nevertheless, I would have expected Fluor to have found, by the beginning of July 2009, a method of heat straightening that could be used to remedy the piles that were only slightly out of tolerance - by which I mean with a maximum diameter of up to 5115 mm - so as to bring them within a tolerance of about + 10 mm (i.e. to a maximum diameter of about 5110 mm).  For the reasons I have already given, I find that this would have been sufficient to enable the MPs to be installed in the seabed using the original hammer: indeed, in the light of what happened I consider that an MP with a maximum diameter 3-4 mm greater would probably have been installed also.</p>

I consider that the delivery of MPs whose roundness was out of tolerance was probably a breach of contract, but Fluor has not made any allegation of such a breach in these proceedings - for the very good reason that any disputes about out of roundness were resolved when ZPMC’s final account was agreed.  Accordingly, to the extent that any out of roundness problems were the result of breaches of contract by ZPMC, Fluor’s cause (or causes) of action in respect of those breaches has (or have) been compromised.  So, when considering what would have happened to Shipment No 2 if there had been no weld defects, any loss or delay caused by out of roundness has to be absorbed by Fluor and therefore taken into account - by which I mean that, in terms of out of roundness, when considering the hypothetical scenario the MPs in Shipment Nos 1 and 2 must be taken to have been delivered in the condition in which they were actually delivered.</p>

The first is to consider how many MPs from Shipment No 2 would have been available (in terms of tolerance) for installation by 29 July 2009.  The second is to consider, in the light of this and other factors affecting installation, such as weather, how many MPs Fluor could actually have installed by 29 July 2009.</p>

This suggests either that SHL was more relaxed about the tolerance than might have been expected or that the measurements are simply unreliable (as Mr Eisman suggested).  However, I am a little puzzled by the fact that an MP with a maximum diameter of 5129 mm was driven, even with the first replacement hammer.  I suspect, although there is no evidence about it, that SHL’s dimension check may have shown a lower figure.  However, even if its true maximum diameter was less than 5129 mm, it seems likely that it was still well in excess of 5117 mm.</p>

Relevant parameters taken into account by both experts include matters such as: downtime owing to weather, the rate at which MPs could be installed, the length of time required for out of roundness correction (where required), to what extent out of roundness correction could be carried out in parallel with the base scope works, whether or not the installation of the jacket would have been postponed and the precise impact of the redeployment of <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin</span> on other work (a Gaz de France project, for which SHL on giving proper notice was entitled to deploy the vessel during the contract period). </p>

Of the 10 MPs in the first three batches of Shipment No 2, two had stiffener rings fitted.  As I have already mentioned, ZPMC submitted that it should be assumed that stiffener rings would have been fitted to every MP.  Whilst I do not think that Mr McKibbin’s assumption is entirely satisfactory, because the MPs were in fact driven with the larger hammer, I consider that it is to be preferred to ZPMC’s suggestion.  As I have already mentioned, in the light of what actually happened it seems that SHL may have been prepared to exceed the acceptable tolerance by a further 4-5 mm.

However, a further problem arose in relation to the design of the stiffener rings with the result that the fitting of stiffener rings was subsequently put on hold pending a new design solution.  Mr Eisman agreed that this was so, but then said that the MPs that were not “<span style="font-style:italic">so badly out of tolerance</span>” could be rectified by heat treatment without the need for a stiffener ring - an observation that, although apparently in conflict with the evidence that he had given the previous week, I did not understand to be challenged (see Day 8/27) and I accept it.  Heat treatment took less time than fitting a stiffener ring: in an e-mail from Paul Pashley dated 24 July 2009 he recorded having been told by Mr Ayres that it took 48 hours.

However, Mr Morgan assumes that all MPs in Shipment No 2, save for the first batch of three, would have required the fitting of a stiffener ring (taking 4 days) and that only one stiffener ring could be fitted at a time.  The effect of this, for batches 2 and 3, is that the time taken to complete the base scope work and out of roundness correction to each MP is pushed back by a further four days each time.  Since I have rejected the suggestion that stiffener rings had to be fitted to all MPs that were out of tolerance, I regard this scenario as over conservative (that is, in favour of ZPMC).</p>

This is for two reasons.  First, the lack of a design solution for the stiffener ring until the second week of July 2009 meant that a stiffener ring could not have been fitted to any MPs in the first, and possibly second, batch.  Second, the one MP in Shipment No 2 which was within tolerance, IGE 02, was one of the last to be unloaded on 5 July 2009, and so no base scope no work could have started on that MP until 6 July 2009.</p>

This is because, as Mr McKibbin notes, the MPs were offloaded directly onto Self-Propelled Modular Transporters (“SPMTs”), rather than offloaded directly onto the quay.  He has assumed, in my view realistically, that once offloaded they would have been taken directly to the laydown area.

On Mr Morgan’s approach, only six MPs can be installed if a period of 1.5 days per MP is used throughout.  On Mr McKibbin’s approach, it would be seven MPs using the same installation rate.  It appears also that Mr Morgan has used discrete blocks of one day for the various activities (for example, loading out the barge and transport to site is treated as an activity lasting a whole day - even though the same time from Vlissingen to the site was not more than 15 hours).  This is one of the factors that permits Mr McKibbin to assume that seven MPs can be installed during the period from 10-24 July, whereas Mr Morgan considers that only six can be installed during this period.  Another difference is that Mr McKibbin assumes that in some cases the full 1.5 day period would not have been required. On these aspects, I consider that Mr McKibbin’s scenario is plausible and realistic and I accept it.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In the context of the time required for the installation of an MP, the other principal difference between the two experts is whether or not a further MP could have been installed between about 05:00 hours on 24 July and 05:00 hours on 25 July 2009 (when <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin</span> had to sail for the Gaz de France site).  Here I prefer the view of Mr Morgan. Whilst Mr McKibbin may well be right that it would have been “<span style="font-style:italic">possible</span>” for a further MP to be installed during this period, that conclusion does not in my view provide the answer. I consider the question is not whether or not it would have been possible (assuming that even that is good enough), but whether or not SHL, the owners of <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin</span>, would have been prepared to take the risk of the operation taking longer than 24 hours and thereby delaying the departure of <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin</span> for the Gaz de France site.  </p>

I consider it unlikely that SHL would have been prepared to take the risk of installing a final MP if it had only about 24 hours in which to do it.  I doubt very much that it would have been willing to tolerate any risk of delay to the departure for the Gaz de France site.</p>

Fluor’s quantum expert, Mr Stephen Ross, calculated that for every day of installation time lost during July and August 2009 Fluor would have to pay an additional 1.23 days in respect of time lost through bad weather if the installation had to be carried out between October 2009 and January 2010.  </p>

Whilst I accept that the court has to seek to adopt as precise an approach as is practicable when making an assessment of how many MPs could have been installed during June/July 2009 if the MPs in Shipment Nos 1 and 2 had been sound, I consider that overall the cost to Fluor of the loss of the opportunity must be considered on a broader basis (however, as it happens, in terms of the additional time caused as a result of having to install the MPs later in the year, the approach of Mr Ross and the first approach of Mr Morgan differ by very little).  I therefore consider that Mr Ross’s approach is to be preferred and so I adopt his figure of an additional 1.23 days for every day that was lost in July 2009.  On the basis of the loss of the opportunity to install four MPs, I consider that 6 days were lost during July 2009, so this produces approximately an additional 7.5 days of vessel time, making 13.5 days all told.</p>

The cost of unloading those MPs would be a cost incurred as a result of the NCR and therefore waived under the terms of the waiver letter.  By contrast, if there had been no weld defects in those MPs the cost of loading them onto the barge would not have been wasted.  Accordingly, instead of lying idle on that day the barge could have been properly used.

Not only did all offshore installation activities relating to the foundation works come to a halt, but even when we ultimately made the decision to cease the retesting and repair effort in Vlissingen, the construction schedule was destroyed. Once we decided to restart the construction phase, we had to remobilize contractors (such as SEPAM) and procure vessels to perform the work, or modify existing vessel contracts to account for the delays. Because offshore work can generally only be performed during certain times of the year due to adverse weather in the North Sea, much of the work that we had planned to perform during the 2009 construction season could not even begin post-October 2009 (e.g. TP installation), or, if it could begin then, it was at a much higher cost to Fluor (e.g. MP installation).”</span>

These were constantly adjusted by a computer in order to keep the vessel in the same position. However, vessels which use a DPS cannot tolerate bad weather as well as a jack up vessel. Accordingly, there were drawbacks in employing <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin </span>to install TPs during winter months.  A further difficulty, which was peculiar to the installation of TPs, was the difficulty of carrying out grouting operations in cold weather.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">

So far as the 31 May 2009 programme is concerned, that is correct: IGE 02 was to be the third TP installed.  However, a table prepared by Mr Morgan (Table G-5 in Appendix G to his first report, dated 24 March 2017, at paragraph G.6.1) shows that the electrical fit out to the TP for IGE 02 was not completed until 16 February 2010 and was the ninth TP to be completed that month.  I did not understand this table to be disputed.  A revision to the construction programme dated 5 January 2010 provided for IGE 02 to be installed between 22 March and 5 April 2010. In fact, the Jumbo/Fluor Daily Progress Reports dated 29 and 30 March 2010 for the Installation of the TPs record that the TP for IGE 02 was installed by <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span> on those days.  Indeed, as Fluor itself pointed out,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">

	      </authorialNote> in early 2010 it seemed that <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span> would not be able to begin the installation of TPs until late May 2010.  This information suggests that the as built sequence departed substantially from the original as planned sequence and that, as at early January 2010, there was no particular urgency about the removal of the stiffener ring from IGE 02.  </p>

By this time, of course, the 42 Phase 1 MPs had been installed - the last one having been driven into the seabed on 28 December 2009.  However, although this issue has generated much discussion, I doubt if it makes much, if any, difference in the long run because what really mattered, so far as TP installation was concerned, was the availability of <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span> or a similar vessel.  </p>

The transformer takes the power from the WTG and turns it into a high voltage electricity supply which is fed via the export cables to the grid.

I find that had such equipment been installed prior to the remedial work then, in order to avoid damage, it would have had to be removed or protected before the repair of any defects was carried out.  The disruption of the TP fit out programme meant that the fit out operatives had little to do and so, in order to keep them occupied, they were directed to carry out some pre-checks on the transformers which were at that stage lying in a warehouse. This was Mr Eisman’s evidence (at Day 8/33) and I accept it. </p>

According to Mr Eisman, this was on about 27 July 2009 (Day 8/34).  However, Mr Trevor Plummer, of Fluor, in a witness statement prepared for the arbitration dated 30 March 2012, said that the fourteenth transformer to be commissioned failed on 21 July 2009, and that the eighteenth failed on 27 July 2009.  This latter failure was recorded in a contemporaneous e-mail dated 29 July 2009.

During the following week ABB sent two engineers to inspect the four failed transformers, which were then returned to ABB’s factory in Waterford (there were not the facilities at Vlissingen to dismantle the transformers in order to investigate and repair the fault).

At the lower end of these links it was found that some or all of the bolts connecting the links to the fixed bus bar had worked loose, so much so that some were missing.  The bolts were used with a clinch type nut which was designed to embed into the bus bar and it was clear that some of these bolts had not been properly tightened at some point in the past.  In each case it was noted that the flexible copper links consisted of ten laminates, rather than eight laminates as shown in the design drawings. It appeared that the bolt length was not long enough to engage all the threads on the clinch nut when the ten laminate flexible links were used. </p>

No loose connections were found.  During the discussion following the meeting Mr Rohan explained that it was not possible to check the quality of the connections using resistance measurements: it could only be done by visual inspection.  Mr Rohan said that it was ABB’s view that the connections had become loose because the flexible copper links were too thick for the bolts used.  Significantly, Mr Rohan said that it was not possible to identify from the recorded manufacturing data which units had the 10 laminate copper links.  Thus the extent of the problem in the remaining transformers could not be predicted.  ABB therefore recommended that all units already delivered to Vlissingen should be returned to Waterford.</p>

Mr Rohan’s own report, dated 31 August 2009, noted that scoring on the bolt thread indicated that only two or three threads were engaging the nut (apparently the clinch nut is obscured from view when tightening the bolt).  Mr Rohan concluded that during transportation to Holland some of the connections had worked loose.  Under the heading “Recommendations” he noted that “<span style="font-style:italic">an apparently good resistance reading can still have some loose bolts in the connection</span>”.

The repaired transformers (the “first generation transformers”) were returned to Fluor in instalments. They had all been returned by 9 November 2009 and thus the need to send them away had no impact on SEPAM’s progress.  Because the repaired transformers were returned to Fluor in instalments, by the time SEPAM started fit-out of TPs in mid-October 2009, there were sufficient transformers on site for SEPAM to commence their works without experiencing delay.</span>

The reason is simple. By the time the issue was discovered in late August 2009 Fluor would have already installed 2-3 batches of TPs (i.e. 12-18 TPs). ABB’s report was then not received for several weeks after this.  Fluor’s priority would have been to maintain the installation programme, even if this meant that it was likely that Fluor would have to swap out the bad transformers offshore at a later date and at an extra cost. The alternative would have been for Fluor to allow the Javelin (the TP installation vessel) to sit idle and pay enormous standby charges, which Fluor was obviously determined to avoid, and Fluor would have sought to recover the replacement costs from ABB in any event. Had we not returned the transformer (sic) to ABB in September 2009, the second transformer issue would never have arisen as this was caused by ABB’s own remedial works.”</span>

	      </authorialNote>  In other words, I am assuming - in Fluor’s favour - that the realisation that the high resistance faults discovered during actual commissioning - as per the scenario - might present a serious problem occurred after fewer transformers were commissioned (about 12-15) than was the case during the pre-commissioning that was actually carried out during June, July and August 2009 (after the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> transformers were checked).  I have said that this assumption is in Fluor’s favour because it assumes that the transformers would have been taken from the warehouse for installation in TPs in a different order, such that the problem was discovered earlier during the commissioning process than was in fact the case.

I have taken the other dates from paragraphs 5.64 to 5.74 of Appendix G to Mr Morgan's first report, which contains a helpful summary of the sequence of events which for the most part I did not understand to be challenged.  However, at paragraph 7.3 of his first witness statement, Mr Eisman said that the repaired transformers had all been returned to Vlissingen by 9 November 2009, but Mr Foster says that when the first second generation fault was discovered in late November 2009 some of the transformers with the original fault were still at Waterford and had not been returned.

By this stage, of course, on this scenario the installation of further TPs at sea would have been at a standstill since about mid-October and further installation of TPs would probably have been prevented by the prevailing seasonal weather conditions in any event (see paragraphs 170-171 above).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">So far as the transformer problem is concerned, my overall conclusion is that Fluor might well have been left no better off in the counterfactual scenario than it would have been as a result of the events which actually happened.  However, this conclusion is only relevant if the NCRs did not apply to the TPs.  If the NCRs did apply to the TPs, then Fluor’s inability to install any TPs before 2010 was the result of the issue of the NCRs and the problem with the transformers was simply another cooperating cause. I now turn to the question of whether the NCRs did apply to the TPs.</p>

Neither the evidence of the witnesses nor the contemporaneous correspondence show precisely when this understanding arose in relation to each shipment, but I consider that in relation to NCR 006 it did so within a week or two of its issue and, in relation to the other two NCRs, probably less.  What is clear from the evidence of Mr Dekker to which I have referred above is that the understanding existed when the work was being carried out.</p>

In my judgment, Fluor cannot be permitted to do so because that would be an abuse of the process.</p>

It may well be that if Fluor had not done this, but had proceeded to follow the guidance given in the e-mail 2 April 2009, GGOWL would have been estopped from contending that such testing was not required by NCR 006 - but in my view that would not have detracted from Fluor’s right to have the instruction clarified if that is what it had chosen to do.</p>

Mr Dove’s report appears to suggest that the scanning carried out that day was confined to the scanning of the welds that had been ground.  Assuming that this was in the form of D scanning, this would not be work that necessarily went outside the procedures already being carried out by Fluor and ZPMC - because D scanning was specified as the method to be used when welds were ground flush (see paragraph 288 of the Liability Judgment).  That appears to be consistent with what Mr Ayres said he told Mr Hardie to do.  However, so far as ZPMC was concerned, that would have been subject to the concession given by RFI 34 - which relieved ZPMC of the requirement to perform a D scan on a ground weld if that weld had been the subject of an E scan before grinding.   </p>

On the contrary, it was an instruction to redo work that GGOWL contended had not been carried out properly the first time round.  Accordingly, it was not work the costs of which fell within the scope of the waiver letter.</p>

There has been an extensive debate about the correct approach to delay analysis.  Mr Morgan said, and I would accept, that a prospective analysis - in other words considering the critical path at any particular point in time as viewed by those on the ground at that time - does not necessarily produce the same answer as an analysis carried out retrospectively. The former is the correct approach when considering matters such as the award of an extension of time, but that is not the exercise with which the court is concerned in this case.

However, the effect of the waiver and warranty letter is that to a large extent the NCRs “trump” those breaches of contract by relieving ZPMC of the consequences that would ordinarily flow from those breaches.</p>

A particular example is the loss that flowed from the unavailability of <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span> after 19 September 2009.  The NCRs did not require Fluor to refrain from extending the contract period for <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span>, but the practical effect of the issue of those NCRs was to make it impossible for Fluor to install any TPs until well after 30 September 2009, when it decided to disregard the requirements of the NCRs and to proceed with the installation of MPs whether repaired or not.

Indeed, the way in which Fluor put its case on delay in its Closing Note (from paragraph 398 onwards, and in particular at section 4.2.4) makes the exercise unnecessary.  For example, whether or not, in June 2009, the critical path lay through the fit out and/or installation of the MPs (which I prefer) or the fit out and/or installation of the TPs does not matter because in my view the course of the critical path during the relevant period was determined by the events of August and September 2009.</p>

Since no further testing or repair of MPs was to take place, there was a supply of MPs ready for installation and thereafter the rate at which the MPs could be installed was determined by the efficiency of <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin</span>: the position is illustrated graphically in the table at paragraph 7.3.8 of Mr Morgan’s first report.

For TP installation work to progress there had to be (a) an MP installed in the seabed (with any stiffener ring removed), (b) an installable TP (although efficient installation would require a batch of TPs that matched the capacity of the installation vessel) and (c) an installation vessel.  The return of <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin </span>had been scheduled for 30 June 2010, but this was later brought forward to 26 March 2010 under the terms of what was known as the Early Start Agreement.  The only alternative steps which Fluor could take, and did take, were to implement modifications to <span style="font-style:italic">The Leviathan </span>to enable her to install TPs.  But I suspect that this act of mitigation was a gesture of hope rather than expectation, since it would (and did) take some time to install the appropriate equipment and fittings in <span style="font-style:italic">The Leviathan</span> and, even then, she was only able to install TPs at the rate of one every 3.5 days, if that.  Thus to install 42 TPs would take at least 21 weeks, assuming suitable weather conditions.  But during the period January to March 2010, suitable weather throughout was not a possibility. </p>

This is because there was likely to be a significant time lapse between installation of the MPs and the subsequent installation of the TPs: as Mr McKibbin put it, at paragraph 6.9.5 of his first report, “<span style="font-style:italic">the sequence of the MP installation became immaterial as it was clear . .  . that all the Phase 1 MPs would be installed before any TP could be installed</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Mr McKibbin has concluded that there were 232 calendar days critical delay to the project between 20 May 2009 and 7 April 2010.   Of this, he says that 127 calendar days were lost between 20 September 2009 (the day after <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin’s</span> first operational period expired) and 17 March 2010, and a further 8 calendar days were lost between 18 March 2010 and 7 April 2010, making 135 days in all; although he said that the cause of this additional 8 days delay was “<span style="font-style:italic">unclear</span>”, he expressed the opinion that its most likely cause was ongoing disruption to the TP installation (see paragraph 6.11.2 of his first report).  Mr McKibbin has not considered the delays to the project after 7 April 2010, which was the start of the IA cable installation.  This is because his instructions were that Fluor was not making any claim in relation to delays to the project caused by ZPMC’s breaches of contract after that date.</p>

I regard Mr McKibbin’s attribution of the cause (namely, “<span style="font-style:italic">ongoing disruption to the TP installation</span>”), even if correct, as being too vague to justify a conclusion that this period of delay was a consequence of any breach of contract by ZPMC.  However, for the reasons I have already explained, whilst I consider that the 127 calendar days that were lost as a result of the unavailability of <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span> were caused by ZPMC’s breach of contract, the resulting cost has been waived.</p>

Accordingly, there is no need for me to consider critical delay beyond this date.</p>

The decision as to which vessel to supply and use was made by Jumbo. Jumbo was pushing to start the installation of TPs as early as possible as they had vessel availability. While we considered bringing on the installation vessel earlier, a number of factors/concerns militated against it:</span>

This shows that the electrical fit out to those TPs was completed between 1 February and 26 February 2010.  However, the length of time it took varied between 72 days and 183 days.  Following completion of the electrical fit out, a further two weeks was required for commissioning and loading out prior to installation (see paragraph 1.6.2 Mr McKibbin’s Note on Counterfactual dated 10 July 2017).  So it appears from this that, even if the TP fit out had been extended by 23 days for the Shipment No 2 TPs, that did not cause any delay to any other activity because, by that time, the TP fit out was effectively in float (because <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span> was not available and the only installation vessel available was the much less efficient <span style="font-style:italic">Leviathan</span>).  As Fluor put it, at paragraph 395 of its Closing Note, “<span style="font-style:italic">a steady stream of TPs were available for the Javelin upon its return</span>”.  Accordingly, any delay that there might have been to the fit out of the TPs was absorbed by the float created by the delay in the return of <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin</span>.</p>

However, I consider that Fluor did suffer a loss, in that during July 2009 its TP fit out workforce was not usefully employed on the fitting out the TPs and were redeployed on other tasks, which did not have to be done, such as the pre-commissioning of the transformers.  Although, for example, the SEPAM workforce was demobilised as a result of lack of work, that did not happen until about mid August 2009.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">“The handling of MPs and TPs which could not be installed required very large additional storage areas and associated infrastructure (including crawler mats and gravel dykes, laying sand, gravel and specially made concrete supports for TPs). Fluor was forced to contract for additional self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) and cranes. The atmospherically-controlled warehouse was too small for the increased demands, and an additional warehouse was procured and air conditioning and atmospheric controls installed. Additional costs were incurred in respect of fork lift trucks and fuel for the additional generators required to provide power for the welding. As the number of subcontractors on site expanded dramatically, Fluor had to contract for additional storage, canteen and sanitary facilities to accommodate them and their materials, housed in a new contractor park. The division of the sums paid to VZT between works to MPs, TPs and site-wide costs (and various sub-categories of costs within those heads) is explained by Mr Ross in his first report.”</span>

At the time when it submitted its closing submissions ZPMC did not know whether or not Fluor was making any further claim in respect of the positioners or materials (see paragraph 180.5 of Appendix 1 to its Closing Submissions).  As I have said, Fluor was effectively allowed to amend its claim to include the cost of the initial positioner, which ZPMC admitted, but I consider that it is too late now for this head of claim to be enlarged any further.  There has been no agreement of the figure now claimed, and ZPMC had no opportunity to address it before submitting its closing submissions.

In cross examination Dr Mastrandrea agreed that some of the costs in respect of the dayworks should be allowed, but he was unable to say how much.  On that basis, he allowed nothing.  However, the experts have helpfully agreed the relevant daily rates for the appropriate periods.  Mr Ross’s approach has been to consider the number of MPs being worked on during each operative period, which he has translated into a percentage of the agreed rate. For period (C) this is 52%, and for period (E) it is 19%.  This seems to me to be a realistic approach and I accept it.  Fluor is therefore entitled to recover the sums claimed.</p>

It was anticipated that these would be off hire at the end of the 2009 season, but as a result of the defects in the welding they remained on hire until all the loading out was complete in about May 2010.  A very substantial sum, of the order of €3.8 million, was paid for the hire of these cranes.  The experts have helpfully agreed the rates for period (F) and the proportions of those rates attributable to the MPs and the TPs.  Dr Mastrandrea originally excluded these sums in their entirety on the grounds that they were referable to period (F) onwards and therefore fell within the waiver.  However, in cross examination he agreed that Fluor should be entitled to recover a proportion of this sum paid, but he was not able to say what it should be. </p>

This is the 20 day period from 10 to 29 July 2009 when, on the counterfactual scenario, Fluor would have had the opportunity to load out and install MPs.  I accept this head of claim in principle, but I do not see why ZPMC should be liable for the three days (17, 18 and 19 July 2009) when bad weather brought installation of the MPs to a standstill.  In relation to the MPs, there would have been nothing for the cranes to do during this period, but that was not the fault of ZPMC.  </p>

This claim is for the additional costs of storing MPs during the same additional period of weather related downtime.  In principle, this seems to me to be a valid head of claim.  In their Third Joint Statement, the quantum experts have agreed the figures for the cost of MP storage and associated dayworks (in respect of labour and equipment) for the months of August 2009 to December 2010.  However, Fluor correctly points out that the relevant months must be October, November and December 2009 (because installation of the Phase 1 MPs was complete by the end of December 2009).  In relation to MPs, the daily averages for each of these months were €25,411 (October), €25,422 (November) and €9,535 (December).  Fluor adopts the average of these three figures, namely €20,065.  For 7.5 days, therefore, this amounts to €150,488, and I consider that Fluor is entitled to recover the sum.</p>

Whilst I am prepared to accept that there was the possibility of litigation against someone in August 2009, I do not consider that the dominant purpose of this testing was for use in litigation. At best, I consider that was merely a possible purpose.  By late July 2009 Fluor was beginning to reach the conclusion<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="33">

As a result he did not feel able to extract the appropriate figures from the invoices and so instead he produced an average cost per MP and then multiplied that average cost by the total number of MPs in the shipments that were not yet the subject of an NCR.  </p>

In fact, the cost code was described as “<span style="font-style:italic">MP &amp; TP remedial work</span>”, but no explanation was given in the Job Bulletin that set up this new code as to what was meant by that expression.  On the face of it the cost code would include remedial work by way of out of roundness repair.  Mr Ayres said that the new cost code was set up because he believed “<span style="font-style:italic">that there would be a pending claim somewhere</span>” (Day 9/169).   He went on to say how difficult it was to get people to complete timesheets properly, let alone using the correct cost code (Day 9/172-173). </p>

In the next two paragraphs he went on to explain that later he went through the time records in Fluor’s accounting system in order to determine whether the time charges were appropriate and assigned to the proper cost code. Sometimes he had to adjust the allocation of an individual’s time to a particular code in order to reflect accurately what Mr Ayres knew that person to have been doing in Vlissingen. In addition, he identified individuals who had not recorded their time to the new cost code but whom he knew to have assisted in the “<span style="font-style:italic">NDT and weld repair efforts</span>”.</p>

I can find nothing in the evidence to suggest that any distinction might have been drawn between repairs that were the result of defective welding and repairs that were necessary to correct out of roundness.  It seems to me that what Mr Ayres described as the “<span style="font-style:italic">repair effort</span>” could, in the minds of many operatives, have included any activity that constituted repair to an MP or TP for whatever reason. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I consider also that a significant amount of management time would have been required to deal with the base scope work in the absence of any problems with the welding.  Take, for example, the case of Mr P I Hall: he is described as the quality manager prior to the arrival of Mr Mike King, when he became a quality superintendent under Mr King’s supervision.  It appears from the spreadsheet prepared by Mr Ross that Mr King arrived during the first week in July 2009.  During the last four weeks of July 2009 Mr Hall is recorded as having worked on MP and TP repair for 73, 64, 65 and 66 hours per week, respectively.  So it looks as if all his working time, or almost all of it, for that period was being charged to MP and TP repair.  This suggests that he spent no time, or virtually no time, during that month on the work which he had been initially employed to perform.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In addition, and probably more significantly, I have no doubt that a considerable amount of management and supervisory time was spent on dealing with out of roundness issues.  Shortly after the issue of NCR 006 the further NDT and repair work that Fluor was directed to carry out was clearly specified and everyone concerned knew what was required, even though doing it called for a lot of organisation.  By contrast, out of roundness proved to be a much greater problem than had been anticipated and a ready solution was not available.  The contemporary documents show that significant time and effort was put into the task of finding an appropriate method of repair.  I would expect a manager or operative who had been dealing with out of roundness repairs to enter the time spent under the cost code for MP and TP repair - there being, so far as I am aware, no instruction to the contrary. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In my view, the result of the breaches of contract by ZPMC in relation to Shipment No 2 TPs, so far as the work done by SEPAM during period (C) was concerned, was that SEPAM’s work was disrupted with inevitable inefficiency and waste.  There is no means of evaluating the extent to which the sums paid to SEPAM were wasted, it has to be a matter of assessment.  It is clear that Fluor managed to keep SEPAM’s workforce occupied on work in relation to the project that was, I assume, mainly productive.  Based on the evidence, the material in the contemporaneous documents and my own experience of disruption claims, and taking into account my conclusion at paragraph 294, I would assess that 25% of the sums paid to SEPAM during period (C) was probably wasted as a result of the disruption.  However, the work involved the MPs of both Shipment No 1 and Shipment No 2: any loss in respect of productive work to Shipment No 1 MPs following the issue of NCR 006 either falls within the terms of the waiver or was base scope work within the terms of the original contract (for which there can be no recovery).  According to Dr Mastrandrea, and I am not aware that it is disputed, the sum claimed in respect of period (C) does not relate to any period that precedes the week ending 19 July 2009.</p>

Had there been no defects in the welds of the TPs in Shipment No 2, thereafter SEPAM would have been wholly deployed on the Shipment No 2 TPs but instead SEPAM was put to work on the MPs, building a mock-up TP and some exterior base scope work on TPs in order to prevent its workforce from being idle: see the first witness statement of Mr Eisman, at paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Since the payments in respect of which this claim is made did not relate to any period before the week ending 19 July 2009, none of the sums paid to SEPAM for the remainder of period C can have been in respect of fit out work to TPs, as ZPMC suggests, so the payments made to SEPAM after this must have related to work on the MPs from Shipment Nos 1 and 2 and, possibly, some non fit out work to TPs.  However, I find that one head of loss suffered by Fluor during this period was the loss of productivity that occurred as a result of the disruption to SEPAM’s work caused by Fluor’s reasonable decision not to employ SEPAM on TP fit out work during the second half of period (C), but instead to employ its workforce less efficiently on the MPs and other tasks.  I assess this at €69,194 (€276,776 x 25%).  Of the balance, €207,582, I am prepared to accept Fluor’s submission that about 50% of the work was in respect of MPs from Shipment No 2 (the other 50% attributable to Shipment No 1 MPs being irrecoverable).  However, I consider that it is likely that some of this was in respect of base scope work and some of it was in respect of NDT or repair related work (Mr Kampman accepted that from the invoices alone he could not say which - at Day 5/72): of these, only the latter is recoverable.  In the absence of any clear evidence, I can do no better than assess this split as 50:50, and so I consider that Fluor is entitled to recover a further €51,896 in respect of remedial work to MPs of Shipment No 2 during this period.  That makes €121,090 in all.</p>

However, Fluor claims only 19% of this sum, namely €17,271.  Adopting the same approach in relation to disruption, but allowing for the likelihood that the extent of it would be reduced as time went on and, I consider, by the beginning of period (E) to about 15%, Fluor is entitled to recover 15% of the total sum as wasted expenditure, namely €13,635.  In addition, taking 19% of the balance (€77,264) and, again, adopting a 50:50 split, produces a further €7,340.  This gives a total of €20,975.  I appreciate that this is actually a little more than the sum claimed by Fluor but, as explained in paragraph 339 above, I have added an amount to reflect wasted cost through disruption, so the comparison is not like for like.</p>

Mr Frampton said (at paragraph 7.6 of his witness statement) that Fluor then used the dive team on other work, such as diving on seabed anomalies that had been identified by a sidescan sonar.  To this end, on 7 July 2009, Fluor entered into a contract modification with Red7Marine, the company that supplied the divers, for a remote operating vessel so that the divers could conduct seabed survey work.

So the installation of the J-tubes would gradually drift further behind the installation of the MPs.  Whether or not Mr Connolly’s estimates were accurate does not matter, because the general trend that he postulated was reflected in the programme: this showed that the first J-tube was installed about 5 days after the first MP, whereas the last J-tube was fitted about three months after the installation of the last MP.</p>

However, a claim put in this way is unsustainable for two reasons. First, on any view the installation of MPs from Shipment No 2 could not have begun before 11/12 July 2009, and so the first J-tube could not have been fitted until a few days after that. Accordingly, the dive unit could not have been engaged on fitting J-tubes to Shipment No 2 MPs before mid-July 2009.  Since the claim is based on the premise that the dive unit was carrying out survey work when it would otherwise have been fitting J-tubes, there can be no claim in respect of the Shipment No 2 MPs before mid-July 2009. </p>

However, in reality if 7 MPs from Shipment No 2 had been installed between 11-29 July 2009, the J-tubes would have been fitted to those MPs between 20 July (the adverse weather would have prevented an earlier start) and early August 2009 - allowing 2 days per MP.</p>

In relation to Shipment No 3, NCR 009 was issued before any MPs could have been installed, so the use of the divers on survey work (instead of fitting J-tubes to the Shipment No 3 MPs) on the days in respect of which the claim is made is a loss consequent upon the issue of NCR 009. It has therefore been waived.</p>

	      </authorialNote>  I think that this approach is too simplistic. The reason why the installation of the MPs from Shipment No 2 did not start on 11/12 July was the existence of the defects in the welds of those MPs. By this time the dive unit had been engaged and Fluor was committed to pay for it until about September 2009.  Accordingly, Fluor’s options were either to let dive unit stand idle for several weeks or to use it for other work.  There has been no suggestion that in opting for the latter Fluor acted unreasonably.</p>

Whilst it is true that there is no evidence that Fluor took any steps prior to June 2009 to arrange for a sidescan sonar survey, it is equally true that there is no evidence as to the date by which it would have been expected to do so (see the intervention by the court and Mr O’Sullivan’s response at Day 6/140-141).

The subsequent agreement by Fluor to pay acceleration costs to SEPAM had two causes. First, a recognition from the outset (May 2009) that late delivery of the TPs and increased secondary steelwork and coating works meant that some degree of acceleration of SEPAM’s works was required in any event. Second, the need to make up the time lost between June 2009 and remobilisation in October 2009.</p>

The effective cause of the inability to use <span style="font-style:italic">The Leviathan </span>for the installation of WTGs in September 2009 was that the issue of NCRs 006, 008 and 009 brought all construction work to a standstill until Fluor decided at the end of September 2009 to go ahead and install the MPs (and TPs) whether repaired or not.  As I have already mentioned, fit out works to the TPs from Shipment No 1 were put on hold in mid-July 2009, and fit out works to the TPs from Shipment Nos 2 and 3 were put on hold in early August 2009, so there was no prospect of there being any TPs available for installation until well after the period of hire of <span style="font-style:italic">The Javelin </span>was due to expire.  </p>

Thus, on the usual principles, and subject to the steps being reasonable, the expense of that mitigation would be recoverable.  Fluor submits that cancellation of <span style="font-style:italic">The Leviathan </span>charter was not an option because it had no right to do so, and so put <span style="font-style:italic">The Leviathan</span> to use as best it could.

This 21 days is derived from an analysis of the counterfactual scenario in period (C) which is set out at paragraph 83 of Fluor’s Closing Note.  I have already dealt with this in some detail, but, by way of brief recapitulation, Fluor submitted that between 10 and 25 July 2009: <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin </span>could have installed 8 MPs, a further 3 MPs could have been loaded onto <span style="font-style:italic">The Stanislav Yudin’s</span> barge and a further 3 completed MPs could have been delivered to the quayside.  Given an installation rate of 1.5 MPs per day, this, submitted Fluor, equated to a total of 21 days MP installation that never happened and were therefore wasted.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The fatal flaw in this formulation is that it confuses lost opportunity with critical delay. The counterfactual scenario for period (C) is an exercise to determine how many MPs could have been installed during period (C) if the contract had been properly performed, that is to say if the welding defects which gave rise to the issue of the NCRs had not been present.  The loss to Fluor during that period was, in my view, the loss of the opportunity to install MPs in the seabed.  Indeed, it has advanced a claim on that basis which has, in part, succeeded.</p>

Since at that stage the installation of the MPs was an activity that was in float, even with the 21 days delay, this would have made no difference whatever.</p>

I would have no hesitation in accepting ZPMC’s point if all that had happened was that Fluor had used the same number of NDT supervisors to check ZPMC’s performance of D scanning instead of E scanning.  But that is not Fluor’s claim. What Fluor is saying is that in the light of the history of poor welding of the MPs and TPs in Shipment Nos 1 to 3, it had to take additional steps to supervise the NDT of Shipment Nos 4 to 8.  As I have already indicated, I find that it should have taken no longer to carry out D scans than it did to carry out E scans.  Accordingly, the change in scanning method should not, of itself, required any greater amount of time be spent on supervision.  What required the additional supervision was the history of poor workmanship in relation to Shipment Nos 1 to 3.</p>

It submits that references to “<span style="font-style:italic">increased extent</span>” of NDT do not advance matters because “<span style="font-style:italic">everyone accepts</span>” that D scanning led to transverse indications being identified, which in turn led to repairs and then further NDT.  The submission, in my view, misses the point.  This claim is not concerned with the further NDT that would have to be carried out by ZPMC in order to carry out the base scope work, which is to what ZPMC appears to be referring, but rather the change in regime from one of spot checking ZPMC’s work to one of checking 100% of it. </p>

He reduced the sums claimed by Fluor in respect of outside subcontractors from $2,705,095 to $2,322,019, the larger part of his reductions concerning increases in rates for which he could see no justification.  I am not satisfied that in this situation this is really the province of a quantum expert: there is no suggestion that otherwise the rates are unreasonable in themselves.  However, Dr Mastrandrea has raised a point in relation to business tax, which appears to have been charged by some subcontractors and not others.

However, in a Quantum Schedule prepared for the hearing of the Counterclaim in the arbitration Mr Ross commented on the application of business tax by saying that there were instances where subcontractors rightly included taxes in the invoices. He said that the circumstances were reviewed by Fluor in advance of making any payments. No-one, so far as I am aware, has since refuted this explanation.

These costs arose because GGOWL refused to issue WFWCCs when Fluor said it should have done on the grounds that the welds in the MPs and TPs were defective.  The evidence of Mr Ayres, which was not challenged on this point, was that GGOWL refused to issue WFWCCs only in relation to those structures where the MP or TP had not been repaired and in respect of which Fluor had refused to carry out offshore NDT of the MP/TP in response to GGOWL’s letters of 30 April and 23 December 2010.</p>

First, I am satisfied that Fluor’s decision on 1 October 2009 to install the MPs and TPs was a step that mitigated its loss caused by ZPMC’s breaches of contract.  The fact is that if Fluor had continued with the testing and repair regime required by the NCRs, which in turn was caused by ZPMC’s breaches of contract, the loss it would have sustained would have been vastly greater than it was.  Viewed with the benefit of hindsight - since there is now no suggestion that the MPs and TPs are not fit for their purpose - and, indeed, probably viewed from Fluor’s position at the time given that it believed the MPs and TPs to be sound, the decision to install the piles was an act of mitigation.  By acting as it did, Fluor avoided a substantially greater loss.  I find it difficult to see how anyone could assert that Fluor’s decision was unreasonable, even though it may have involved a risk.</p>

But not only was that the case, but I consider that it was also the case that this was foreseeable.  Assuming that ZPMC had no knowledge of the terms of the contract between Fluor and GGOWL, it could have been expected to know that such contracts typically require the issue of a certificate when completion of a particular structure or, sometimes, part of the structure, is achieved.  It would also be expected to know that if there was a serious complaint about the quality of the structure as built, the employer might refuse to take it over and withhold the relevant completion certificate.  In that situation the contractor would normally remain responsible for the preservation and, if appropriate, maintenance of the structure until it could be handed over.  I find that all those things would have been known to ZPMC, or at least would have been reasonably foreseeable to a sub-contractor in its position.</p>

If, in order to avoid one or other of those direct losses, the purchaser mitigates his loss by taking some alternative steps, the cost of such steps would in my view be equally recoverable (subject, of course, to reasonableness): I do not see how steps reasonably taken in mitigation could be described as indirect and/or consequential damages.</p>

Dr Mastrandrea said that this should have been at least an invoice for that sum and, preferably, proof of payment.  The estimate from Siemens dated 2 March 2011 was for the re-certification of equipment on 10 TPs and equated to £1,674 per TP.  Fluor applied this rate to all 52 TPs in Shipment Nos 1-3, which produced the figure of £87,050.  In a report prepared for the counterclaim in the arbitration, dated 12 March 2013, Mr Ross said that he had been directed to certificates issued by Siemens’ sub-contractor, Lift-Rite, in relation to this claim.  The trial bundle for this action contains some 200 pages of invoices, reports and certificates issued by Lift-rite relating to numerous TPs.  Having said in his Reply Report dated 10 April 2017 (at paragraph 42.77) that this claim should have been capable of being corroborated by relevant invoices, which is perfectly reasonable, Dr Mastrandrea later (at paragraph 42.85) referred to the fact that he had seen invoices - presumably from Lift-rite - issued in July and August 2011 (and therefore in the period ending on 31 January 2012).  However, he did not say at that point that he had looked at these invoices or at other documents in the trial bundle and found them wanting: instead what he said was that he had not seen the Lift-rite contract in order to confirm the daily rates which had been charged.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">At this point it is perhaps worth observing that Fluor is the UK subsidiary of a very sophisticated international contractor and, as the evidence shows, has the benefit of sophisticated systems for approving and placing orders, processing invoices, making payments and so on.  It is inherently unlikely that, apart from the odd isolated instance, Fluor would have paid sub-contractors for work that had not been done or without having satisfactory documentation to justify doing so.  I can more readily accept that Fluor, like many other litigants in this type of dispute, may be advancing claims in respect of work that in truth it would have had to have carried out anyway or where there is duplication or overlap between claims for different items, but that is a different thing and the court must be astute to ensure that any award of damages takes such matters properly into account.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Reverting to the claim under consideration, Dr Mastrandrea also raises the question of why in some cases work has been done at variation rates and not at cost.  Rates for varied work are often higher than the basic rates in a tender for several reasons: for example, because the work may be carried out under disruptive conditions, it may involve disproportionate set up costs or it may simply be that the contractor hopes to recover through variations a level of profit that he was not prepared to include in his tender.  Without going into the matter in fine detail I see no reason to assume - in the absence of demonstrated examples - that the rates claimed by Fluor are inflated.  However, I have removed 15% to reflect the profit element of the mark up (see below), and that may go some way to meeting Dr Mastrandrea’s point that a profit element may have been included twice.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">A point that Dr Mastrandrea makes that seems to me to be a good one is in relation to two items, one of which is a claim for £16,300 for personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and the other of which is for “SE and Permit issue” in the sum of £9,085; in each case the sums claimed are for items which are stated to have been already included in the relevant sub-contractor’s labour rate (see paragraphs 42.50 and 42.45).  I therefore propose to disallow these sums.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I do not know how the 17% mark up for overheads and profit has been made up: it is a rate that was agreed with GGOWL and which was applied to most of the claims for varied work. The evidence of Mr Johnston in the arbitration showed that Fluor’s bid for this contract included a margin of 8.2% on the anticipated project revenue.  In his first report in the arbitration, dated May 2012, Dr Mastrandrea concluded that this gross margin was made up of 2% in respect of overheads and 6.2% which he regarded as gross profit (paragraph 32.30).   I can see no reason why Fluor should not be entitled to recover the cost of its general overheads as part of the costs of steps taken in mitigation, but I have some difficulty in seeing why it should be entitled to recover in addition an element in respect of profit.   It is entitled to recover its costs of such steps, not their value.</p>

This, submitted Fluor, was self-evidently a reasonable settlement.  Further, Fluor submitted that it gave up (or sacrificed) various other claims that it had against GGOWL which, Fluor asserted, had a value of about £20 million (or £30 million - its position changed during the litigation). Since Fluor received a net payment under the settlement of about £10 million, its pleaded case was that it gave up about £20 million in respect of the sacrificed claims.  But if this is correct, it means that Fluor in practice paid £52.325 million to settle a claim stated to be worth about £65 million.

Third, how is that apportionment affected by the fact that Fluor gave up (or sacrificed) some other claims of its own against GGOWL?</p>

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">“Unless the claim is of sufficient strength reasonably to justify a settlement and the amount paid in settlement is reasonable having regard to the strength of the claim, it cannot be shown that the loss has been caused by the relevant eventuality or breach of contract. That is not to say that unless it can be shown that the claim is likely to succeed it will be impossible to establish that it was reasonable to settle it. There may be many claims which appear to be intrinsically weak but which, common prudence suggests should be settled in order to avoid the uncertainties and expenses of litigation.  Even the successful defence of a claim in complex litigation is likely to involve substantial irrecoverable costs.  It is thus an every day event for shipowners or their P&amp;I clubs to settle cargo damage claims based on allegations of bad stowage or unseaworthiness for well under 50% of the claim when the alternative explanation of the damage is the inherent condition of the goods or some other cause for which owners are not liable. Unless it appears on the evidence that the claim is so weak that no reasonable owner or club would take it sufficiently seriously to negotiate any settlement involving payment, it cannot be said that the loss attributable to a reasonable settlement was not caused by the breach by reason of which the goods are in a damaged condition.”</span>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">That was a case where the owners settled a claim by the cargo insurers for US$ 600,000, although it was likely that the cause of the damage to the cargo was not one for which the owners were responsible.  This represented 25% of the value of the claim.  Although the arbitrators held that to settle for 25% was reasonable in the circumstances, they concluded that the total damage sustained was contributed to by the failure of the owners to take proper steps for the care of the cargo once it was seen to be overheating.  They concluded that, had it not been for this, the claim by the cargo insurers would have been for US$ 1.6 million, and not US$ 2.4 million. Accordingly, the arbitrators concluded that the amount of the settlement sum attributable to the breach by the charterers was US$ 400,000 and that was the amount they awarded.  Colman J upheld the award.</p>

There was a dispute between a contractor and a sub-contractor. The contractor, Jarvis, had entered into a settlement agreement with the employer on terms which expressly stated that no value was included in the settlement for the sub-contractor’s works.  There was a “pay when paid” clause in the sub-contract and so the contractor asserted, as against the sub-contractor, that it had not been paid anything in respect of the sub-contractor’s works with the result that nothing was due to the sub-contractor.  The settlement agreement had been drafted by counsel for the employer but included the terms required by Jarvis as set out in an e-mail from its solicitors.  The Judge said that the relevant clause singled out Durabella’s work “<span style="font-style:italic">and, exceptionally, places a figure on it, solely for Jarvis’ purposes, as Mr Ward had to admit.</span>”</p>

Having established that, the court must then consider whether or not that proportion of the settlement sum was reasonable, taking into account that Fluor had assumed a very substantial potential liability under the warranty - albeit one the risk of which was thought to be low.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Fluor reminded me of the authorities on the construction of contracts that were cited in the Liability Judgment.  These are, of course, relevant when the court is concerned with finding the true meaning of a contract as between the contracting parties. Here the question is that of establishing the reality of the position as against third parties, which in my view is not the same exercise.  The point can be illustrated by a simple example. Clause 11.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the parties will not in any future claim or proceedings “<span style="font-style:italic">seek to re-open or challenge any decisions, awards or findings of the Tribunal in relation to the Proceedings</span>”.  Whilst the meaning of this, as between GGOWL and Fluor, is self-evident, ZPMC has not submitted, rightly in my view, that this prevents Fluor from challenging a decision of the Tribunal in litigation against ZPMC.  Such a challenge may, in certain circumstances, amount to an abuse of the process of the court: but that is a question of fairness, justice and public policy, not of the true construction of the contract made between Fluor and GGOWL.</p>

Fluor submitted that the authorities on the construction of contracts, to which I have just referred, did not permit this. In my view, that submission is misconceived.  The extent to which prior negotiations can be taken into account when considering the terms of a contract is clearly established by the authorities. However, I do not consider that what is known as the exclusionary rule has any application in a situation where the court is considering whether a sum paid in a settlement between A and B, or part of it, was paid as a direct result of breaches of contract by a third party, C.  When considering a global settlement, such as this one, the court is entitled, and in my view bound, to look at all the material available to it.  Apart from anything else, this is a matter of elementary fairness.  A third party, in this case ZPMC, should be liable only for the direct consequences of its breaches of contract, and not consequences that are the product - or said to be the product - of an agreement between two other parties into which it had no input.</p>

Fluor’s liability for those costs would clearly be a substantial sum.  Another seemingly strong claim was the Esbjerg claim which arose out of Fluor’s failure to collect the WTGs from Siemens Esbjerg in accordance with an agreed schedule, which gave Siemens a claim against GGOWL. This claim was apparently settled by GGOWL for £7.5 million, a figure representing about half the sum claimed (I am not clear why in subsequent negotiations GGOWL included it at only £7 million).  Fluor’s case in the arbitration was that this liability was a consequence of the NCRs, and therefore not one for which Fluor could be liable. However, as ZPMC has pointed out, this was a position that became difficult to sustain in the light of the First Partial Award.  On 4 March 2013 Fluor noted, in relation to this claim, that it should be “rejected at this value”: I do not know on what basis Fluor considered the settlement to be too high.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">It is worth noting that at this point GGOWL was putting forward additional claims related to the project - items (6) to (9) - totalling £12.7 million.  So far as the Siemens Delay Claim and the Lock off claim were concerned, Fluor considered that these should be rejected in their entirety or as a matter of principle.  The claim for WTG storage at Harwich was accepted in principle, subject to substantiation.  Fluor considered that the other disputed project claims (£6 million) should be rejected.</p>

There was also the question of the legal costs of GGOWL’s counterclaim: its costs were said to be just over £5 million and Fluor had incurred costs of about £2.3 million.  Although at this stage Fluor was reasonably optimistic about its prospects of defeating GGOWL’s counterclaim, this was not certain and I find that ultimately each party was prepared to bear its own costs of that part of the arbitration.</p>

However, it contended that its claims for the cost of completing the work, its legal costs of defending Fluor’s claim in the arbitration and its other project claims should be settled for a similar amount so that no money would change hands.  GGOWL indicated that its legal costs and project claims amounted to about £20 million.

The claim of £10 million for historic weld dispute costs, which I understand was largely made up of historic monitoring costs, was sound in principle - since the presence of the weld defects had been found to be a breach of contract - subject to any argument about the quantum.  This claim was originally put forward at a little under £20 million and so I would not have thought that £10 million was an unreasonable figure to place on it at the time of the mediation.</p>

For the purposes of a settlement I would have expected Fluor to attribute a fairly modest value to those other claims (bearing in mind that they had already been reduced in value from £12.7 million).   In all, I would regard the settlement value of the claims being advanced by GGOWL as just under £30 million.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="38">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>That is to say: costs of defending the claim, £10.85 million, the Siemens Esbjerg claim, £7 million, historic weld dispute costs, £10 million, and other project claims, say, £1.5 million.</p>
	      </authorialNote>  In addition, once it was agreed that GGOWL would take over the completion of the work, that obligation had a value.  At the beginning of April 2013 internal e-mails still suggested that Fluor estimated the costs to complete to be of the order of £20 million.  However, this figure was put forward at a fairly early stage and the work was continuing as negotiations proceeded. Mr Bruno said that at the time of the settlement he understood (from Fluor internal documents) that the cost of completing the work was between £3 million and £4 million.  I am prepared to accept this as a minimum figure, but not as one that would have been regarded as reasonable by GGOWL, who were, after all, about to assume the risk.</p>

The same assertion was repeated at several points in its Closing Note.  But, as ZPMC pointed out, this conflicted with the case pleaded, by way of re-amendments in January 2017, in which Fluor alleged that the value of the claims sacrificed was “at least £30 million”. This shift in position over the period of some three months does not inspire confidence.  I now turn to the principal claims relied on by Fluor.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The Harwich work stoppage claim arose out of a tragic fatal accident during the loading of a turbine blade when the root end frame became detached and swung down killing one person and seriously injuring another.  Fluor has advanced an arguable case that, as between itself and GGOWL, the latter was liable for the consequences of the accident because it contracted to ensure that its subcontractors carried out their work safely and competently.  However, ZPMC has produced a compelling argument to the contrary (see section A2, paragraphs 9-20, of Appendix 2 to its Closing Submissions).  I do not consider that it is either necessary or appropriate to go into the detail of these arguments, because no one came close to doing so during the mediation.  So far as I can tell, the issues were dealt with using a much more rough and ready approach. Balancing these factors, and putting myself in the shoes of a hypothetical assessor in GGOWL’s camp at the arbitration, I consider that Fluor’s Harwich claim would have been seen as having about a one third prospect of success.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The claim, as formulated by Fluor, was substantial - some £20 million.  Fluor regarded the strength of this claim as being a major plank of its submission that its sacrificed claims were worth at least £20 million.  However, it is worth noting that the actual period for which Fluor was effectively prevented from carrying out installation works was from 21 May to 14 June 2010, some 3.5 weeks.  Yet the claim is based on a period of delay of 63 days, some 9 weeks. At first blush, therefore, I would expect the hypothetical assessor in GGOWL’s camp to conclude that it looked substantially inflated.  If that person had looked a little more closely into the claim, he or she would then have realised that the claim had in fact been advanced on a prospective basis, and not in the light of what actually happened.  This would simply reinforce the suspicion that the claim was inflated.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Looking at the position very broadly, I would expect this hypothetical assessor to regard the quantum of this claim is probably being worth about 50% of its stated value.  Applying a discount of two thirds to that reduced value (to reflect my assessment of the prospects of success), would leave a settlement value of between £3-3.5 million.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The second largest claim is for the costs occasioned by adverse weather, although prior to the mediation it had never been submitted to GGOWL.  Fluor’s witnesses were unable to provide any satisfactory explanation for this.  It was said to have a value of nearly £18 million.  ZPMC’s principal criticism of this claim is that under the terms of the BOP Contract two conditions had to be satisfied in order to make a claim based on adverse weather and that this claim only purported to satisfy one of them, as Mr Connolly readily admitted.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Fluor’s response to this is that it is only necessary to satisfy both conditions if the claim being made is one for delay; it submits that it remains open to it to make a claim for any other form of costs occasioned as a result of adverse weather by satisfying the first condition only.  But even if this is correct, and I regard it as no more than arguable, Fluor has not advanced its claim in this way. It has simply added up the number of days when there was adverse weather and, by implication, asserts that on each of those days the relevant vessels would have been productively employed. However, Fluor has not attempted to show this.  It is by no means self-evident that this would have been the case: indeed, from what I have seen of this case generally it seems that from time to time vessels were not productively employed for reasons unconnected with the weather (for example, because of the need to carry out repairs or maintenance).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">ZPMC makes the further point that it is impossible to tell the extent to which this adverse weather claim may overlap with other claims.  For the purposes of illustration, I can take an example from the present litigation: Fluor’s claim for the loss of the opportunity to install Shipment No 2 MPs during July 2009.  That claim is made up in part of additional days that would have been lost through adverse weather as a result of having to carry out installation during winter months instead of during the summer.  Any claim against GGOWL that had been put in a similar way would likely have involved duplication with the adverse weather claim.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In my view, there are some fairly formidable stumbling blocks in the way of this claim, which might explain why Fluor had never previously submitted it.  Far from having a significant settlement value, as asserted by Fluor, I consider that it would have been regarded as little better than a nuisance claim.  I would regard its settlement value as being between £2–2.5 million.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">These two claims had between them a stated value of £38.178 million.  The stated value of all Fluor’s sacrificed claims was said to be £42.229 million (paragraph 103 of the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim), so the remaining claims had between them a value of about £4 million.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="39">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>The total of Fluor’s claims was £45,479,072, but Fluor deducted £3,250,000 of potential liabilities<span> </span>(punchlist items valued at £300,000 and warranty claims valued at £2,950,000), leaving a net value of £42,229,072.</p>
	      </authorialNote>  These included the TP maintenance claim, which I have assessed as being worth £582,645 (on a full liability basis).  In its “last offer”, made on 8 March 2013, GGOWL was prepared to attribute a value of £5 million to the remainder of Fluor’s project claims (although at that point the adverse weather claim was valued at only £1.8 million).  However, I consider this was both mistaken - claims with a net value of about £4 million could not possibly have a settlement value of £5 million - and in any event overgenerous: I consider that the settlement value of these residual claims, including the TP maintenance claim, was about £2.5 million, and certainly no more.</p>

GGOWL’s allowance for those claims of £9.75 million was overgenerous.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I am quite unable to follow the logic of the first part of this reasoning.  It seems clear to me that GGOWL was disappointed at its lack of success in negotiating a wider form of warranty and, as a result, held out for a higher payment from Fluor (which is what Mr Bruno had indicated in the answer that he gave to me that is quoted above).  It is quite artificial to suggest that all the remaining claims between the parties were simply settled for no consideration over and above a mutual release: in my view, the settlement ended, as it had started, by being a global settlement which did not particularise any of the individual heads of claim which formed part of it.  As I have already mentioned, GGOWL’s draft settlement agreement was prepared after these “<span style="font-style:italic">occasions, circumstances and developments</span>” that occurred in mid April.</p>

Mr Bruno’s evidence (which was supported by GGOWL’s evidence in the arbitration) was that the claim for monitoring costs represented not only the costs of carrying out testing, but also the loss of revenue as a result of the interruption of power generation during the tests.  This may well be correct (it is consistent with evidence given on behalf of GGOWL in the arbitration) and it may be that it suited GGOWL to describe the compensation in terms of lost revenue so that it could be attributed to that head in its accounts - but that is pure speculation.</p>

I infer that the reason for this was that it was thought that this description might make it easier to recover all or part of that sum from ZPMC.  Indeed, that description is the central plank underlying Fluor’s submissions at this hearing.  The suggestion that these changes of wording completely altered the nature of the settlement is to my mind quite inconsistent with what actually happened.  There would have to be a very compelling case to persuade me that this is what occurred.  </p>

It submitted the £10.85 million claimed in respect of these costs could not have formed part of the £32 million paid by Fluor because the parties agreed to deal with those costs in a different way.  Fluor relied on clause 11.2 of the Settlement Agreement which provided that the Tribunal would be asked to make no further award in relation to the arbitration.  In my view, there is nothing in this point.  Not only is it plain that GGOWL had a clear entitlement to its costs of the successful defence of the claim, but also the sum of £10.85 million was already the result of a discount of one third.  I can see no reason whatever why GGOWL would be prepared to forego its claim for these costs.  The agreement to invite the Tribunal to make no further award was no more than a provision to achieve an orderly closure of the arbitration.</p>

As I have already indicated, I have little doubt that, when making these amendments, both parties were taking advantage of the agreement that they had reached earlier in relation to cooperating in the structuring of the final settlement agreement so as to satisfy their respective internal accounting, tax, and other requirements.  Of course, I accept that if when drafting a settlement agreement the parties choose to give a particular obligation a label (as opposed to a definition), that may constitute, if taken by itself, some indication of what the obligation was intended to represent.  However, what I cannot accept is that the court is required to turn a blind eye to the surrounding circumstances if those circumstances indicate that a particular payment obligation was in fact in respect of something different to or more extensive than what is indicated by the label.</p>

Of these, as against ZPMC (1) was a cost that Fluor had agreed to bear under the terms of the waiver letter, and it was not suggested that (3) and (5) had anything to do with the defective welds.  The Siemens claim was a consequence of delays caused by the additional testing and remediation required by the NCRs.  It was therefore a cost that was waived by Fluor as against ZPMC.  The historic Weld Dispute costs of £10 million were in relation to the unrepaired piles and therefore fell outside the waiver agreement.  Accordingly, if at that point Fluor had agreed to pay a sum to settle these claims, on the face of it at most only £10 million of that sum would have been attributable to costs that had not been waived resulting from breaches of contract by ZPMC.</p>

Its only offer was that the parties should “<span style="font-style:italic">walk-away</span>” from their project claims and that Fluor would pay £10 million in respect of the defects and outstanding snagging items (but excluding the transformers, the Tekmar seals and the Met Mast defects).  At that point, therefore, the parties were about £40 million apart.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">As I have already said, on 10 April 2013 Fluor offered to pay £26 million in settlement of all GGOWL’s legal fees and project claims but on the basis that GGOWL completed all the remaining work.  However, in addition, it was forgoing its own project claims which I have assessed had a settlement value of about £8.0 million, making a total cost to Fluor of £34.0 million.  Had the true value of the costs to complete at the time when this offer was made been a £4 million, then Fluor’s offer would have been very close to matching the sum for which GGOWL had been asking.  However, I doubt very much if GGOWL’s estimate of the costs to complete would have been as low as Fluor’s, particularly as it would probably have had to engage other contractors to carry out some of the work. </p>

Whether this was a misunderstanding by GGOWL of the nature of the warranty that Fluor had been prepared to offer hitherto, or whether it was a tactical gambit to extract more money from Fluor, I cannot say.  It appears that it was presented as the former, but I am left with the suspicion that it may have been the latter - but for present purposes it does not matter which.</p>

Mr Bruno’s evidence about the amounts going up “<span style="font-style:italic">in terms of cash</span>” and that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">just dollars being traded</span>” seems to me to be entirely plausible.  A settlement depended on Fluor bridging its side of the gap between the parties or at least going a long way towards doing so.  ZPMC submitted that this was not the case, but I see no reason to doubt what Mr Bruno said on this point even if it was said for the first time during his evidence.  In relation to the costs to complete, I consider that it is probable also that GGOWL was looking for a figure closer to the £10 million that Fluor had previously offered rather than the £4 million assessed by Fluor.</p>

The analysis that I have carried out shows that the reasonable settlement value of GGOWL’s claims was very close to the sum paid or foregone by Fluor, so on that basis alone that aspect of the settlement was self-evidently reasonable.</p>

I have read those submissions with care, but I do not consider that the answers to the questions that I have to decide are to be derived from a minute and detailed analysis of the merits of those claims, still less to embark on a series of paper mini trials or evaluations.  This is because the question is not what would have been the outcome if the particular claim had proceeded to judgment, but how robust the claim would have been seen to be - in terms of both liability and quantum - by a reasonably well-informed opponent.  In settlement negotiations such as these, where there are numerous issues and claims, parties tend to take a broad and commercial approach.  I was unable to conclude that any of the claims were plainly hopeless, although I regard Fluor’s adverse weather claim as coming fairly close to it.  In this case the task has been made a little easier since each party attributed values to the principal claims being made by the other and, on the whole, it seemed to me that those values were as good a starting point as any.</p>

If support for this first ground were needed, it is provided by Mr Bruno’s evidence that he instructed Hogan Lovells in 2009 because the contract was subject to English law and he was concerned that GGOWL might apply for an injunction in the English courts to prevent the installation of the unrepaired piles (Day 8/116-117).  </p>

Regardless of the fact that the Claimant’s litigation against ZPMC did not ultimately materialise and Fluor instead pursued arbitration against Gabbard, the fact remains that the draft reports now being sought by the respondent were prepared in contemplation of litigation and are accordingly subject to the protections of the litigation privilege . . .  The Welding Institute’s role changed such that by mid-June 2009, as detailed above, it was actively engaged in providing the claimant with technical substantiation for its then contemplated claims against ZPMC.  Additionally, the Respondent’s characterisation of TWI and Ibsoe as “technical advisers” rather than “experts” is both incorrect and immaterial. The critical point is at the time they prepared their reports, regardless of the label the respondent ascribed to them, such reports were prepared for the dominant purpose of substantiating claimant’s legal claims which at first contemplated by ZPMC but were later re-directed to Gabbard once Fluor determined that the NCRs were not justified.”</span>

If the costs of purpose A are not recoverable, but the costs of purpose B are recoverable, the costs that can be recovered must be less than 50% of the whole.  Thus if purpose A is truly the dominant purpose, I cannot see how the costs of purpose B can ever exceed about 40% of the total - but it could, of course, be some lower proportion.</p>

As I have indicated, in the absence of any cogent submissions to the contrary, I propose to adopt the approach that where the descriptions of the work done after 1 October 2009 indicate that a significant proportion was in connection with the ECA, Fluor should be entitled to recover up to 40% of the relevant expert’s fees as being attributable to the ECA, although the proportion might be lower if the relevant invoices do not suggest that such proportion is justified: to allow more would be inconsistent with the claimed dominant purpose of providing expert evidence in support of the arbitration - a position that MDMC reiterated in October 2011 (see its letter to Nabarro dated 18 October 2011).  </p>

I do not disagree.  However, I agree with ZPMC that they are costs of pursuing the Weld Dispute Claims: it was all too likely that the pursuit of the claims for the costs of the additional NDT and repair work would not only be resisted by GGOWL but also met by a counterclaim in respect of the risk presented by the unrepaired MPs and TPs.</p>

The final sentence of the clause provided that if those costs exceeded the amount of the award, the difference would be borne by Fluor.  The “Arbitration” was defined as the proceedings in which Fluor was to pursue the Weld Dispute Claims against GGOWL by way of arbitration in London.  In my view, that definition clearly includes any counterclaim that GGOWL might bring in response to the claim.  Since Fluor recovered nothing by way of any award, the consequence is that it must bear the costs of the arbitration.  Accordingly, I reject Fluor’s claim to recover the costs incurred in defending GGOWL’s counterclaim because, by the terms of the waiver letter, it agreed to bear them.</p>

I propose to apply a reduction of a further 20% and to reduce the figure to £140,581.  Thus I allow £183,097 in respect of Hogan Lovells’ fees.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Mr McKibbin attributed 232 days of the delay to the Phase 1 Foundations Works to breaches of contract by ZPMC, of which he said 97 days were attributable to breaches of contract the consequences of which did not fall within the settlement.  In its Closing Note Fluor submitted (on the basis of the counterfactual scenario) that 47 days of critical delay were caused by ZPMC’s breaches of contract in relation to Shipment No 2 the consequences of which had not been settled.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">So if GGOWL had chosen to deduct liquidated damages at the contractual rate from, say, the Phase 1 Foundation Works Target Date onwards, the contractual cap for Phase 1 would have been reached after 262 days delay (17 January 2011) if all the WTGs in that phase were affected by the delay.  So, ZPMC contends, however one looks at it, in relation to the Phase 1 Foundations Works, that the contractual cap for liquidated damages would have been reached irrespective of any delay caused by ZPMC’s breaches of contract.</p>

The letter relevant to this claim was dated 23 July 2010 and is contained in the trial bundle at [18.13A/5087]. It notified Fluor that GGOWL was levying LDs in respect of the Phase 1 Foundation Milestone (i.e. that which Fluor alleges was delayed by ZPMC's breaches) from the date that the milestone had been missed (1 May 2010) onwards to the date of the letter (a total of 84 days).

	      <span style="font-size:11pt">ZPMC is correct that LDs accrued against the Phase 1 Infrastructure Milestone prior to this (¶33 of its most recent note) but neglects to mention that GGOWL did not seek to levy them from the point that the Phase 1 [Infrastructure] Milestone was missed and instead levied LDs in respect of the Phase 1 Foundations Milestone.  At the time that it did so, only £12,696,912 of LDs had been levied (i.e. only c25% of the cap was exhausted).</span>

However, as I have already found, to the extent that such delay was caused by the issue of the NCRs (leaving aside whether or not it may also have been caused or contributed to by other matters for which ZPMC was not responsible), the costs of it - for which ZPMC might otherwise have been liable - have been waived by the agreement reached in June 2010.  </p>

In that situation, Fluor would have incurred a liability for 15 days liquidated damages, for which ZPMC would have been responsible: subsequent events could not eliminate it.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">However, the insuperable difficulty in the way of Fluor’s claim for liquidated damages is the fact that I have already held that the installation of the Phase 1 MPs was in float by December 2009, because by then the critical path lay through the fit out and/or installation of the TPs (see paragraph 398 above).  Accordingly, even if the installation of the Phase 1 MPs had been achieved 15 days earlier – that is, just before mid December 2009 – Fluor’s achievement of the Phase 1 Foundation Milestone would have been unchanged.  For these reasons, Fluor’s claim for liquidated damages based on this 15 days delay must fail.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">By way of background, I should mention that I have not yet heard submissions on costs and so I do not consider that I should speculate on what the ultimate order in relation to the costs of this litigation might be, but it is certainly not obvious that the outcome might be an award in ZPMC’s favour which could justify a refusal to direct an interim payment or a reduction in its amount.  Further, I note that CPR 25.7(1)(b) specifically excludes any assessment of a sum of money by way of costs from giving rise to an interim payment, which suggests that a likely order for costs in favour of one party or the other is not a ground for making (or refusing) an order for an interim payment.</p>

It opposes conversion of sums in other currencies into US$ on the ground that this option is not permissible.  I accept this point.</p>
