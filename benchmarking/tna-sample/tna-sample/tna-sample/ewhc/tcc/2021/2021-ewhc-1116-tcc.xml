	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">At first sight, these can be simply seen as proceedings with an entirely conventional background, explained as being a claim both for breach of contract and in negligence against professional engineers, Canham, in respect of the design of foundations at a site in Burwash, Sussex (“the Site”). The Site was used to construct two separate PassivHaus blocks, and these are referred to as Blocks A and B. Each block contained a small number of houses, connected to one another, as what are sometimes called terraced houses. PassivHaus is a proprietal term for a particular type of housing, constructed both in timber and brickwork, originating in Germany. Canham designed the foundations for both blocks, using pad foundations and ground beams. The type and depths of these foundations, their dimensions (particularly of the pads themselves)<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#D13438">,</span> and the way in which the different elements of the foundations are connected, are important features of the design. The Site was in an area of Wadhurst clay, with a relatively shallow layer of topsoil above that, prior to the commencement of the construction works generally. It was important that the foundations were sufficiently well designed (and also constructed) such that the two blocks, once built, would be sufficiently resistant to movement that would otherwise occur. This meant that foundations were required of sufficient robustness for this particular Site.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The design of the foundations by Canham was, in some respects, negligent; some of the particulars of negligence are effectively agreed by Canham’s expert structural engineer. The design, in certain respects, fell below the required standard of a reasonably competent engineer exercising due care and skill. The Particulars of Claim state that “while the Claimants were seeking to complete the Works, they discovered significant deficiencies in the design and, therefore, construction of the foundations and lack of adequate connection between the foundations and the ground beams and structure….” and so they “decided, reasonably and in order to mitigate their loss, to demolish and rebuild both Blocks”. The total losses claimed in the pleading were approximately £3.7 million, including the full cost of rebuilding following demolition. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">BPN and NPS are related in the following way. NPS and a company called Beattie Passive Build System Ltd (“BPBS”) formed a construction joint venture company, that company being BPN. NPS is therefore a shareholder of BPN. Someone called Mr Ron Beattie (who was not called as a witness by the claimants) was at the time a director both of BPBS and also BPN. BPBS has the licence for the Beattie Passive Build System, which is a PassivHaus approved system of construction.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In early 2014, BPN tendered to design and construct Block A and Block B at the Site. That tender was made to another company, called Hastoe Homes, which the witnesses of fact for the claimants referred to as “the client”. The Particulars of Claim plead that “Mr Ron Beattie on behalf of the First Claimant and/or on behalf of the Second Claimant and BPBS engaged the Defendant to carry out the civil and structural design”. That averment plainly elides together a range of potential contractual relationships, all into one rather general statement. It cannot be right, and I do not accept, that one person was acting on behalf of all three different companies at the same time, in engaging Canham as the designer. It is now accepted by Ms White for the claimants (quite correctly and sensibly) that Canham was engaged by BPN, the date of that being agreed as 20 April 2014.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Beattie Passive Construction Ltd (“Beattie Construction”), another company in which Mr Beattie was involved, was contracted by BPN to perform the construction works. BPN was engaged by Hastoe Homes on 15 May 2014. Beattie Construction was engaged by BPN on a JCT Design and Build 2011 Contract on 12 August 2014. Mr Ron Beattie was a director both of Beattie Construction and also BPN (as well as being a director of BPBS). This contractual arrangement is described by the claimants in their submissions as being “back to back”. This expression means that the contractual obligations of Beattie Construction to BPN matched the contractual obligations that BPN owed to Hastoe. BPN must therefore have been engaged by Hastoe on the same JCT terms.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The groundworks were commenced in September 2014 for Block A and Block B, the foundation works being performed by Foxdown Engineering Ltd (“Foxdown”), a groundworks sub-contractor. Foxdown had been engaged as a sub-contractor by Beattie Construction. To be fair to Foxdown in this judgment (which as with all judgments, will be publicly available), the most recent revisions of the drawings issued by Canham to BPN, the company that engaged Canham, do not seem to have been issued for construction by Beattie Construction to Foxdown. Foxdown were issued with an earlier, superseded, set of drawings. Although Beattie Construction and BPN appear to be controlled by the same people (or some of the same people), there is limited evidence available concerning the exact working of the relationship between them. There is therefore limited evidence about whether BPN (who received the Canham drawings from Canham) issued them onwards in a full and timely fashion to Beattie Construction. Whether they did or not, Beattie Construction did not pass them on to Foxdown. That is clear on the face of emails originating from Foxdown. Foxdown used the Revision A version of the drawings for construction, and these were issued to Foxdown “for construction”. Foxdown cannot, therefore, be criticised for using them for construction. This factor became known in about 2016, well after Foxdown had constructed the foundations, and is heavily relied upon by Canham in these proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Regardless of the reasons for this happening, the Revision B drawings were clearly not used by Foxdown when constructing the foundations. Hence the foundations were constructed by Foxdown at a time when Revision B drawings with certain foundation depths, and dimensions of pads, had in fact been produced by Canham (and had been issued by Canham to BPN), but were not made available to Foxdown. Foxdown only had issued to it by Beattie Construction the Revision A drawings with shallower depths, and smaller dimensions of pads. This version of the design is therefore the one that was used for each of Block A and Block B, which meant that the foundations as constructed did not match the foundations as designed in the Revision B drawings for the two blocks.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Two further factual complications are present in this case. Firstly, the works that were performed by Beattie Construction in terms of the building of both Blocks A and B generally (including the superstructure) were found to be defective. The degree to which they were defective – namely, whether they were seriously defective such that the whole of the structures required demolition in any event, or merely defective such that they required remedial works short of demolition – is in issue. The decision to demolish Block A was made in May 2016 and demolition of that block commenced in July 2016. Remedial works were already underway to Block B when the demolition of Block A took place, as those remedial works had commenced in May 2016. A decision to demolish Block B was then made in September 2016, part of the way through the remedial work for that block, and that demolition commenced in November 2016. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, Beattie Construction had its engagement under the JCT Design and Build Contract form terminated by BPN on 27 August 2015. The works were therefore left uncompleted and another contractor, RG Carter Ltd (“Carter”), was engaged both to inspect the works performed by Beattie Construction prior to its termination, and also to complete the works<span style="color:#D13438">,</span> left unfinished by Beattie Construction as a result of that termination. There is, again, extremely limited evidence concerning the process whereby one company, BPN, decided to, and then did, terminate the contractual engagement of another associated company, Beattie Construction, where both of those companies had at least some directors in common, not least Mr Ron Beattie. However, the investigation by Carter of the work actually performed by Beattie Construction, and also investigations by Canham itself, following the termination, led to conclusions that remedial works were required to Block B. Block A seems, on the evidence, to have been in something of a hopeless state generally, and the decision was taken to demolish that in May <span style="color:#D13438">2016 </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#D13438">2016, </span>as I have explained. It was obviously thought at one stage that Block B could be remediated, those works commencing as I have already explained. A couple of months after that work commenced however, the decision to demolish Block B rather overtook the progress of those remedial works.  </p>

The Defence alleged that the Particulars of Claim represented “a gross distortion of the circumstances of the decision to demolish the two Blocks”.

Canham also alleged that the two blocks, constructed by Beattie Construction (one of the three companies involved of which Mr Beattie was a director) were woefully defective – the term used in cross-examination was “catastrophic” in terms of the extent and type of defects present. A very long list of defects that could not be the responsibility of Canham was relied upon by Canham, essentially to make good the point that the blocks would have had to be demolished in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It was asserted by Canham that as a result of the very poor administration of the project by Mr Beattie – again the word used was catastrophic – the quality of both the sub-structure and superstructure works at Block A, in particular, was so shockingly bad that it had to be demolished in any event. Block A was not the only block with problems. It was discovered that Building Control had not even been invited to inspect the Block B foundations prior to the concrete being poured, and so had not done so. This would be a clear breach of the building regulations, as Building Control is required by the regulations to inspect foundation footings before the foundations are constructed. It also was the case at the time that further, serious, defects in Block A were discovered during the process of demolishing it. The Defence asserted that so little of the entire structure of both blocks had been built as designed, and/or had been built so defectively, that the demolition of the blocks was inevitable regardless of the conditions of the foundations. Canham also relied upon the fact that BPN terminated the engagement of Beattie Construction under the JCT terms. Given Mr Beattie was involved in both those companies, that could be described as a curious factual situation. Remedial works were actually underway to the Block B foundations when a decision was taken to demolish that too, and even though causation is challenged, Canham allege that those remedial works (which were very limited, and would have cost about £10,000 only) would have been the reasonable solution for the admitted breaches of duty concerning the design.  </p>

Each side called its own expert structural engineer, namely Mr Hughes for the two claimants and Mr Owain Evans (no relation to Mr Evans of Canham) for Canham. Each side had a quantity surveying expert, and these experts had helpfully agreed quantum prior to the trial in the somewhat lower sum than that claimed, namely £1.4 million. However, in the event, Mr Higgins for Canham elected not to call any quantity surveying evidence, and therefore Mr McIver, the claimants’ quantity surveyor, was the only expert of this discipline to give evidence. Also, he was not cross-examined and therefore simply proved his report in evidence in chief, together with confirming his views as they were contained in the Quantity Surveyors’ Joint Statements.  </p>

However, if claimants are companies, and their directors do not sign such statements, all that the Statement of Truth means is that the party putting forward the document believes the facts in that document to be true; this is stated in CPR 22.1(4). In this case, given that the Statement of Truth was made by the solicitor and not a director of one of the claimant companies, this probably explains why Mr Higgins for Canham chose not to cross-examine either Mr Hersey or Mr Gawthorpe in any great detail on the absence in the Particulars of Claim of any reference to Beattie Construction’s varied failures of its own contractual obligations to BPN.

There were no fewer than four entirely different trial bundles. These were the Core Bundle; the Supplemental Bundle; the Supporting Documents Bundle; and the Remaining Documents Bundle. Each bundle contained multiple volumes. This regrettable failure to organise the trial documents correctly, and by agreement, caused a degree of difficulty in terms of efficiency. Both counsel were highly professional in dealing with the potential confusion and distraction caused by this failure of the necessary co-operation required by the parties and their solicitors in advance of the trial. However, such a state of affairs simply should not occur for any trial, and particularly not in a multi-million pounds professional negligence claim in a specialist list in the High Court. The transcription service was only arranged on 3.00pm on the very day before the trial started. This shortage of time again caused some difficulty in terms of organising and testing the necessary audio link.

Some further disclosure was given by the claimants arising out of cross-examination on 3 March 2021, together with submissions based on a contemporaneous email that was produced.

It was necessary to explain to the parties that I intended simply to ignore it, save and in so far as its contents may be repeated in closing submissions. There is no procedural place for sending such material directly to the trial judge during a trial itself in this way, attempting to meet or explain away evidential points made in cross-examination (which in procedural terms leads to evidence, namely the answers of witnesses to those questions) by way of a letter to the judge. Trials are conducted in open court. Open justice is a very important principle. Evidence is what is contained in witness statements, attested to by a witness, and either agreed by the parties or spoken orally in the witness box. Submissions are usually made at the beginning and the end of trials, and sometimes during the evidence, depending upon events. They are not, and cannot sensibly be, made uninvited directly in writing to the judge in letter form during the trial itself in the way adopted in this case. No further evidence of fact was adduced by the claimants after the day when Mr Hersey and Mr Gawthorpe were cross-examined. There was no additional evidence adduced by the claimants to correct what had been said. There were no exceptional circumstances that would have justified giving permission to allow this after Mr Evans of Canham had given his evidence, but whether there were or not, no application was made to call further factual evidence.

I do not know if that is what transpired or not, but if that were the case, it might explain the letter sent to the court to which I have referred at [20] above. Given the conclusions that I draw about the evidence of each of those gentlemen, that is, at the least, a realistic possibility. In some cases, a skilled crossexaminer (which Mr Higgins undoubtedly is) may elicit evidence during a trial that a party had not expected would emerge at all. To use a phrase from Lewison LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">FAGE UK Ltd v Chobani UK Ltd </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 5 “the trial is not a dress rehearsal. It is the first and last night of the show.” Given the central issues in this trial of causation and the decision to demolish, each of Mr Hersey and Mr Gawthorpe may, after their cross-examination, have wished that they had properly and more fully dealt with these central issues in their evidence.

Dunne had full design responsibility to Multiplex, and was in administration. For reasons associated with Dunne’s solvency and the potential risk of non-recovery of any judgment against it, Multiplex proceeded directly against the checker, a consultancy called RNP (or more accurately, directly against RNP’s insurer).

The fact that NPS paid some invoices, and also that some personnel sometimes used their NPS e-mail accounts (which all ended .nps) for some correspondence (rather than e-mail accounts for other companies) does not assist NPS in establishing a direct duty of care to it as a shareholder. Canham had a contract with BPN. Given the nature of the construction project, the services to be provided, and given that Canham was a professional firm of engineers providing design services for a construction project, there was a co-existent duty of care owed by Canham to BPN, in addition to its contractual obligations. However, there is no justification in my judgment to find that Canham, in addition to this responsibility to BPN, the party who engaged it contractually, also owed any of the constituent shareholders of BPN – namely NPS – a separate and direct duty of care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Further, in this scenario, all that this conclusion means in this case is that any liability Canham may have for failures or breaches on its part is owed to the first claimant, BPN, who is, in any event, itself a party to the proceedings. There is no question of Canham escaping from liability for any actionable failures on its part as a result of my finding in [35] above. I do not know why NPS was joined as a co-claimant. It might simply be a further example of what appear to be idiosyncratic business relationships of the type referred to at [6] to [13] above, or there might be real reasons of substance concerning apportionment of financial recovery from Canham (if there is any) between the two claimants. I do not know, there was no evidence about it, and it does not matter. This was an entirely conventional contractual arrangement between Canham and BPN for a construction project in which BPN was the main contractor. There is no just reason to extend the scope of Canham’s responsibility wider than this, to include a separate duty directly owed to BPN’s shareholders. Those behind NPS and BPN chose, for whatever reason, to conduct their business interests through the medium of a limited company, namely BPN. They cannot have it both ways and then, for some reason, properly avoid the consequences of choosing to do so, and construct an artificial direct duty of care to BPN’s shareholders. </p>

Mr Hersey explained that he had been told by the Norse finance department that all of the invoices issued by Canham were paid either by NPS “through the Norse bank account” or from the NPS bank account. He also stated in his witness statement (although he did not provide the source of this knowledge) that “up to June 2015 there was only one bank account for Norse <span style="text-decoration:underline">and all subsidiary companies</span>” (emphasis added). This is an odd state of affairs, given limited companies are distinct and separate legal entities.

I do not know, and it was not explained, why this collection of different companies should have organised their business affairs in this way. However, in my judgment it does not matter. It reinforces (if reinforcement were necessary) that the fact that NPS paid Canham’s invoices does not impact upon the conclusion that Canham did not owe NPS a duty of care.

Emails either sent, or copied, to him at the time in 2015 and 2016 showed that this must have been because Foxdown was not given the Revision B drawings. The earlier Revision A drawings, stamped received and issued for construction to Foxdown, are crucial evidence on what is an obvious and central point. Any claim for damages for negligent design ought, one would have thought, to have at least considered whether that allegedly negligent design was the one actually constructed. Yet even though Mr Hersey was told that Foxdown had constructed to the Revision A design (rather than the more robust Revision B design), he seemed somewhat unconcerned and/or disinterested. This lack of concern and disinterest was both at the time in 2015/2016, and when he prepared his witness statement, and also when he was giving evidence from the witness box in court. I doubt that it came as a surprise to him that the reason this had happened was because Foxdown had the earlier Revision A drawings issued to it for construction. Indeed, he must have known that this was the reason. Given the demolition of Blocks A and B led to further expenditure on the construction project measured in millions of pounds, one would have expected far more from Mr Hersey in this respect in terms of investigating, dealing with, and providing, at least <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> (or, indeed, any) cogent evidence about how this came to occur. The Revision B design of the foundations prepared by Canham was simply not the design of the foundations that were in fact constructed by Foxdown. However, there was no such evidence from Mr Hersey at all. Even when he was asked about it, his answers were extremely limited. </p>

The foundations on Revision B were far more substantial, and had very different dimensions. Mr Hersey also could not say whether anyone else had asked Mr Beattie about this either.

All that was said by Mr Hersey in his witness statement was: “at this point in time, the main contractor’s (Beattie Passive Construction Ltd (“BPC”)) employment had been terminated and, in BPC’s place, RG Carter Ltd were carrying out the works”. That is, in my judgment, an inadequate way to deal with such a major incident on any construction project, but particularly so here where one of the claimant companies, and the main contractor having their engagement terminated, shared a director, and where the contemporaneous documents showed that the works performed by Beattie Construction were so defective. These are telling omissions in the claimants’ evidence of fact. Anyone with any experience of the construction industry would readily accept that terminating the employment of the main contractor on a project is a rather significant event.

Such advice is, of course, privileged, and Mr Higgins quite properly did not seek to explore it, but when the decision to demolish - which is such an obviously central part of the claim against Canham – was being considered, far more is required (both in law, and evidentially) than that this was done after advice was taken from solicitors. The burden is upon the claimants (or BPN, given I have found that there is no proper basis for any claim by NPS) to demonstrate that demolition was caused by the breaches of duty on the part of Canham, and also that it was reasonable. In my judgment, Mr Hersey failed to achieve either of these essential evidential building blocks of the case.</p>

These connected the beams and the pads. They had been missed from the design by Canham (on both the Revision A and Revision B drawings), but this could be remedied by post-construction installation. These remedial works were actually underway at Block B when the decision to demolish it was taken. This expert evidence by Mr Owain Evans is substantiated by the answer given by Mr Hersey above. </p>

Mr Gawthorpe’s response to Mr Higgins above where he asked counsel “are you suggesting that Canham Consulting hadn’t issued the drawings to Foxdown direct and they were issuing them through somebody else?” also shows a lack of awareness of how construction projects are ordinarily administered. Canham were engaged by BPN, and issued their drawings both to the architect (also engaged by BPN) and to </p>

It was not Canham’s responsibility either to issue information to Foxdown, or to supervise Foxdown’s work in constructing the foundations to the design prepared by Canham. Mr Gawthorpe’s evidence (and indeed the whole way the case is framed against Canham) seems to assume that because Canham designed the foundations, they were strictly responsible for everything to do with the foundations, including how they were constructed by Foxdown, and (where, as here, when constructed to the earlier superseded version of the design) the consequences of that.  </p>

The reason for Foxdown doing so was because Beattie Construction (and/or the architect) did not forward to Foxdown the Revision B drawings, and instead issued Foxdown the Revision A versions which were stated to be “for construction”. There is nothing in the documents to suggest that Foxdown were at fault in terms of constructing to the Revision A version. Foxdown did what it was instructed to do. This was clear from the contemporaneous documents, and also from the factual evidence of Mr Hersey and Mr Gawthorpe.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">He attempted to excuse these faults (in relation to bearing pressure) by saying the groundworks contractor Foxdown would not have used bearing pressure as a primary reference when constructing the foundations. Rather they would have used depth, which was specified by reference either to actual depth, or depth into the Wadhurst clay, whichever was deeper. I accept that, because there is no evidence Foxdown (or any other groundworks contractor) would take or assess bearing pressures into account in determining depth when excavating. A ground investigation report prepared by a practice called Listers prior to the works had identified that the foundations were to be excavated to a depth either of 1m below the existing ground level or 0.2m into the Wadhurst clay, the bearing stratum. This report is also referred to at [90] below. However, Mr Evans did not seem particularly abashed at the error in failing to state the correct bearing pressure, and simply referred to the incorrect bearing pressure being shown as “a typographical error”. 100kNm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-2</span> is only two thirds of what the figure should have stated for bearing pressure, namely 150kNm<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">-2</span>. This is a sizeable error for a structural engineer to make, whether it is a typographical error or not. There did not seem to be sufficient (or any) recognition by Mr Evans on this point.  </p>

Structural stability of foundations and their integrity is obviously important, and failures in this respect can (in some extreme cases) lead to collapse and issues of risk to personal safety, and even death. However, these proceedings do not concern such matters, not even remotely, at least not so far as the pleaded allegations against Canham are concerned. The issue in respect of which Mr Hughes gave this answer was differential settlement of less than 5mm, something upon which Mr Marychurch had given expert geotechnical evidence, and which he had explained was well within acceptable limits.

One example of this is his distinction between two different types of Wadhurst clay of different colours, which is nowhere specifically identified as being an important distinction in his report, nor was this point even put to Mr Marychurch in cross-examination. I am confident that Ms White would have done so, had this been a live or relevant issue at the beginning of the second week of the trial when Mr Marychurch was called. The first time this was raised by Mr Hughes as a specific and important feature in any detail was in his oral evidence in the witness box, which was the next day. Another example was his explanation of why remedial works would not be suitable to timber framed structures. He said that repairing foundations to timber framed buildings would damage the structure, as the vibration and impact of the remedial works would cause the nails to vibrate and loosen. Again, this was new, and his report did not identify as a specific (or even general) point that demolition was required because timber structures would be damaged by repairs to the foundations. He appeared to be seeking to bolster the Claimants’ case.  </p>

One single example of this is what occurred in respect of Approved Document A. He had generally referred in his report to breaches of Building Regulations. When questioned, he said those he intended to refer to were contained in Approved Document A, which is a document issued under the Building Regulations 2010. When asked in further detail about this, he answered questions in respect of thickness by reference to Table 10 in Approved Document A (a document not appended to his report, but of which the claimants’ solicitors had multiple copies pre-prepared and hence available). That table is headed “minimum width of strip footings” and has a cautionary piece of text below stating in express terms “The table is applicable only within the strict terms of the criteria described within it”.  Yet the foundations under consideration in this case are not strip footings at all, they are pad foundations with ground beams. They are of a different type to those specified in Table 10. Mr Hughes said that the same table would apply to pad foundations, but there is no relevant entry in Approved Document A that he identified in justifying this assertion. Nor would the text in the document cautioning against using that table other than “within the strict terms” support Mr Hughes in this respect.  </p>

Mr Baghi had concluded that the effect of eccentric loading upon the pad would not be significant enough to impact on the stability of any particular pad. Mr Hughes agreed that Mr Baghi had stated this, but said he disagreed with Mr Baghi. However, both in his written report and also in his confirmatory evidence in chief orally, he had expressly stated that he agreed with Mr Baghi. His report had stated “I have reviewed an expert report written by Mr Hooman Baghi of Diales and I agree with its findings”. For reasons that are not at all clear, he changed this during his cross-examination when he was taken to the specific finding by Mr Baghi in respect of eccentric loading. This suggests to me that because the eccentric loading point did not assist the claimants’ case, he disavowed it.  </p>

The basis for this was wholly unclear, as he had not specified the extent of this in any detail in his report. The basis of his justification for this seemed to be that he, Mr Hughes, disagreed with Mr Marychurch’s evidence that the Wadhurst clay was of medium change potential. However, this is a geotechnical point in respect of which Mr Marychurch’s evidence is to be preferred in any event, due to the nature of the issue and the nature of Mr Marychurch’s specific expertise. However and in any event, this point had not even been put to Mr Marychurch when he was cross-examined, as it ought to have been. It is, however, an example of Mr Hughes going further than was justified in terms of his own expertise. He is qualified in structural engineering and was not called as a geotechnical engineering expert. Mr Higgins submitted that this demonstrates a lack of objectivity on the part of Mr Hughes, a submission which I accept. </p>

Experts should not take positions on contested issues of fact, a point that has been made in many cases, and one that is so obvious as to go without saying. Additionally, if a witness of fact makes a telling concession of this nature in respect of an important or central issue (here, the decision in respect of demolition and Block B), this is something that experts ought to take into account when they come to give their own oral evidence. The effect of such evidence ought at least to be considered. Mr Hughes did not change or alter his opinion in any respect after Mr Hersey gave the evidence I have referred to in respect of the foundations of Block B. He effectively ignored it, again (probably) because it was not helpful to the claimants’ case.

In my judgment, it is completely wrong. These two activities cannot be equated in this way. It is also a red herring. It refers to the following issue.

The dimension showing depth should have been included on the .pdf version of the drawings themselves.

If one were using the autocad programme, one could identify the depth dimension, as it would be included in what is effectively a 3D image within the .dwg file. The computer program permits someone to identify a particular dimension in that 3D design. </p>

This is simply wrong. Scaling off a drawing, and interrogating a digital drawing for a dimension that is included in that digital design, are completely different exercises. The former risks inaccuracy, and most, if not all, drawings will include a warning along the lines of the warning included in the printed drawings in this case. These expressly stated “CAD drawing not to be hand modified or scaled if in doubt ask”. A drawing that is an 2D image only will be in a .pdf file, which will have a suffix ending .pdf. A CAD drawing is usually, and was here, in a file of a different type with the suffix .dwg. CAD means computer aided design. A file of type .dwg is a digital drawing. Asking the autocad program for a dimension included in the design (but not shown as a label on the .pdf drawing) is not the same as scaling off a drawing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In Mr Hughes’ cross-examination, he moved away from equating these two things, and accepted that measuring in Model Space was different to scaling, but explained some difficulties with it. He did, however, accept that “there was nothing problematic in itself” with using the measure tool in Model Space. This subject took up a great amount of time in cross-examination earlier in the case; Mr Evans of Canham had relied upon the fact that the dimension was available in autocad, and seemed to be critical of Foxdown for not interrogating the .dwg file to discover it, although he did accept the dimension should have been labelled on the .pdf drawing too. This led to some debate about whether sub-contractors could be expected to have laptops on site, as a computer is required to interrogate an autocad file.   </p>

This is why the debate in the evidence and in the trial about scaling off a drawing, or not, was a red herring. The dimension should have been identified on the face of the drawing; a point accepted by Mr Evans of Canham, and also by both the structural engineering experts. But if that dimension were missing as a label on the .pdf drawing – as it was here – Foxdown were both obliged, entitled, and expected to ask for that dimension to be provided by the designer. They ought not to be expected to interrogate the file of type .dwg for it themselves. Even if they did do this themselves, it would be sensible for Foxdown to ask or to check with the designer. Foxdown certainly did not become entitled to construct foundations to whichever depth Foxdown wished, simply because the dimension was missing from the .pdf drawing. They were obliged to ask for that information. This is, with respect to Mr Hughes, elementary.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The information was available on the design prepared by Canham. Canham would, had they been asked, have provided it. They did not do so because Foxdown did not ask. Nobody knows if that is because Foxdown were given another dimension by the architect; or whether Foxdown interrogated autocad, found the dimension, and ignored it; interrogated autocad inexpertly, and found another dimension by mistake, and used that one; or did not do any of these things, and chose their own level. All of these alternatives are possible in theory, and it is not necessary to speculate. Given Foxdown were constructing to an older superseded set of drawings, Revision A, which contained shallower depths in any event, the point becomes somewhat academic. This point is addressed further in Part G dealing with causation. I would simply observe that the fact that this lacuna is even present on the documents demonstrates that the supervision on site was not only less than ideal, but appears in some respects to have been entirely absent. This observation is supported by the fact that Building Control did not inspect the Block B foundations after they were excavated. This type of event should not occur on a well-supervised site. The drawings clearly state “if in doubt ask”. Given the dimension that ought to have been included as a label was missing, then that would lead to doubt, which means Foxdown would have to ask. But to approach it as Mr Hughes did is to ignore what ought to have happened. None of it excuses Canham failing to put the required label on the drawings, but it cannot be expanded to blaming Canham for Foxdown constructing the foundations to the wrong depth. </p>

His second witness statement was therefore the only substantive written evidence from him, and it was somewhat sparse, being 14 pages long. Mr Gawthorpe’s statement was even shorter, namely 7 pages long. Quantity should not be equated with quality, but both statements simply glossed over (or wholly ignored) the very real difficulties that were encountered with the other workmanship issues on the two blocks, which were clearly raised in the Defence. These other defects were the responsibility of Beattie Construction, which may be why both Mr Hersey and Mr Gawthorpe chose to ignore them. Indeed, notwithstanding the heading in his own witness statement where Mr Hersey posed the question “What informed the Claimants’ decision to demolish Blocks A and B, what additional issues, workmanship or otherwise, were encountered in the construction of the blocks, and did they contribute to the decision to demolish?”, this was a subject almost completely avoided by him in the passages of his written evidence that followed that heading. Nor was any evidence provided by him in his written evidence about the reasons for the termination of Beattie Construction, or the very widespread incidence of defects that could not possibly be laid at the door of Canham. Nor was anything stated in respect of the assertion that Foxdown had not constructed the foundations as Canham had designed them. Where causation is so fundamentally in issue on the pleadings, this is (putting it at its lowest) surprising. It is certainly an absence of direct evidence on a very important area of the case, if not on the central issue in the case.  </p>

Given there was at least one director in common between both BPN and Beattie Construction, namely Mr Ron Beattie, this absence of evidence or further explanation is most surprising. Mr Gawthorpe in his oral evidence said that the termination was due to “procedural matters”. This refers implicitly to the JCT contract conditions that permit termination under certain circumstances not connected with the quality of work. However, this statement almost raises more questions than it answers. Given Mr Ron Beattie was a director both of BPN and Beattie Construction, the brevity of evidence available in respect of BPN terminating Beattie Construction’s employment does not begin to address, or explain, the very real issue of Beattie Construction’s defective work.  </p>

Siemens settled all the claims up the contractual chain and pursued Part 20 proceedings against Supershield, who had been engaged on a sub-contract to install a sprinkler system. The judge found against Supershield, as he found the probable cause of the flood was a failure of a connection in part of the equipment in a storage tank, and this was because of a lack of sufficient tightening of a nut and bolt connection. He found that Supershield had an obligation both to install the piece of equipment, and carry out any adjustments necessary to ensure it was operating correctly. He gave judgment for Siemens in the amount of the settlement sum with the other parties, having found the settlement reasonable. An associated issue causing the flood had been a blockage in the drainage system, for which Supershield had no responsibility. Notwithstanding this, Ramsey J found that the connection failure caused the loss. </p>

For Block A, it was also the defective nature of the foundations, but they had not been constructed in accordance with the design produced by Canham in any event. In Foxdown’s case, it would be unfair to make any finding adverse to Foxdown that it was at fault in constructing to the Revision A design, because these drawings were clearly issued to it “for construction”.

BPN must demonstrate both that the demolition was required as a result of the negligent design of the foundation, and also that the decision to demolish was reasonable. BPN must first discharge that burden. It has failed to prove both of those essential points. This is for the following very simple reasons. Firstly, there was far more defective with <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> Block A <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> Block B than their foundations. Secondly, the foundations as designed by Canham were not the foundations as constructed by Foxdown, because Foxdown was given the wrong drawings for construction. Foxdown had used the Revision A design for construction; these drawings were issued to Foxdown “for construction”. There were substantial differences between the Revision A and Revision B designs. Thirdly, BPN has failed to show that the demolition was required as a result of the defective foundations on either of Block A and/or Block B, although the factual history is different for each of these blocks. Fourthly, the lack of connections between pads and beams which were negligently omitted by Canham on both the Revision A and Revision B drawings could have been remedied by localised remedial works to Block B. Indeed, this work was initiated at Block B in May 2016. The decision, after that, to demolish Block B was taken as a direct result of what was discovered to be wrong with Block A during its demolition, and also as a result of further consideration of the structure of Block B as a result. The condition of the foundations of each of Block A and Block B was not an effective cause of the decision to demolish each of those blocks. The fact that the Block A foundations were far shallower than designed, even if an effective cause of the decision to demolish Block A, cannot be laid at the door of Canham because that was the fault of Beattie Construction or other entities involved in the construction of Block A, and not the fault of Canham. </p>

The foundations as constructed did, however, not contain the required connections, and this was the result of the failures by Canham to include these. These breaches by Canham were an effective cause of Block B requiring localised remedial works (not demolition) by retro-fitting the dowels. These works were commenced but not finished. During those works, the decision was taken to demolish Block B. That decision was not connected with the condition of the foundations as constructed. The breach by Canham was not an effective cause of the loss sustained by demolishing Block B and rebuilding it. Indeed, it was no cause at all. The cause of the loss was the wholly defective construction of the whole of Block B including its structure.

This omission is agreed by the two structural engineering experts to have been negligent by Canham. Accordingly, if Canham had included dowels in the design, as it ought to have done, these would have been constructed on the Block B foundations by Foxdown, notwithstanding Foxdown’s use of the earlier Revision A design. That means that the failure by Canham to specify the dowel connections in the design was operative as an effective cause of the localised repairs that were required to Block B. The same conclusion does not apply to Block A, as that block was so hopelessly constructed in so many different respects that the decision to demolish was, effectively, inevitable.  </p>

That means that BPN has actually suffered a real loss, namely the cost in fact expended on those partially performed remedial works to Block B.

Mr Gawthorpe explained that “the client” – by which he meant Hastoe Homes – was becoming frustrated with the delays that were being experienced, and he also knew that the work that Beattie Construction had done was extremely defective. As one example only, in one of the blocks, the damp proof membrane or DPM had been installed <span style="font-style:italic">below</span> ground level. Given DPMs operate by means of the membrane preventing dampness from the ground rising through the walls of a structure, to have installed a DPM in the position it was in fact installed here, not only demonstrates abject incompetence on the part of the installer, but similarly abject incompetence on the part of whoever was supervising that work. Mr Higgins also put to Mr Gawthorpe that in addition to its inadequate location, the DPM was (as Mr Higgins put it) “completely shredded”. Mr Gawthorpe agreed that it was “shot”. By each of those terms, they meant that its integrity as a membrane was wholly flawed due to damage to the membrane itself. There were other structural issues too.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Canham point out that the claimants have only pleaded recovery of the expenditure incurred by the demolition and rebuilding of both Blocks A and B, and there is no alternative claim seeking this cost of partial repair. It ought not, strictly speaking, to be seen as an alternative claim. The cost of those works was suffered by BPN notwithstanding the supervening decision to demolish. However, even if I accept that as a technically accurate pleading point, then if strictly necessary I would, to do justice between the parties, allow an amendment to include it. I do not, however, consider such an amendment to be necessary. Both structural engineering experts considered the dowel connections to be required; they both agreed it was negligent of Canham to omit them; and the quantity surveyors discussed and agreed the cost of those works as a whole to Block B. These works were in fact only partially performed. The evidence dealt with this, and there is no prejudice to Canham by going on to consider loss suffered by BPN as a result. The alternative would be to consider nominal damages, and to ignore the factual evidence that BPN suffered a real loss by reason of instituting actual remedial works to install the connections, remedial works that, in fact, caused BPN to suffer a loss. The Latin maxim justifying or describing nominal damages is <span style="font-style:italic">injuria sine damno</span>, which means injury without damage. Here, there is damage; it is simply a limited or small amount of damage caused by a small amount of remedial works, which were later overtaken by events. I do not consider that it is a suitable or appropriate situation to award nominal damages.  </p>

There is no actual evidence of the cost of only the works that were in fact completed. It must have been more than zero, and less than £4,000.

Firstly, there is no distinction between losses incurred by each of the claimants. There is no basis for any recovery by NPS, as I have found. Secondly, the vast majority (if not all) of the losses relate to, or were caused by, the faulty construction of both blocks by Beattie Construction, with the subsequent demolition and rebuilding, which I have found are losses that cannot in law be attributed to the negligence of Canham. Thirdly, the claim for delay and liquidated damages or LADs is not split out into different periods for which there is specific evidence which would allow me to assess how much, if any, was caused by the partial remedial works on Block B.

The parties lodged various authorities in this respect, including extracts from the relevant textbooks such as <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">McGregor on Damages</span>. Nominal damages is a technical phrase which means the court “will have negatived anything like real damage”, but affirms that the innocent party has had its rights infringed. This quotation is taken from the speech of Lord Halsbury LC in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Mediana </span>[1900] AC 113, 116. In the section in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">McGregor</span> headed “amount awarded”, the cases are tracked from the days when the amount was miniscule, such as sixpence or a shilling in the very early 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century, to the amount which eventually crystallised at £2, which as the textbook states was “a figure that lasted for a hundred years”. There was one case in 1944, described by <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">McGregor</span> as “curious”, in which the figure awarded for nominal damages was 5 guineas; this is <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Constantine v Imperial Hotels</span> [1944] KB 693. In that case, heard by Birkett J (as he then was) during the Second World War, a traveller brought an action against an innkeeper for wrongfully refusing to receive and lodge him. The plaintiff was a wellknown West Indian cricketer and he, his wife and daughter were refused lodgings at the Imperial Hotel, where their accommodation had been booked. They were instead lodged at another of the defendant’s establishments nearby, called the Bedford Hotel.  </p>

I would describe the award of nominal damages in that case as simply wrong. It would certainly not be followed today, by awarding a plaintiff in those circumstances (whom the judge found suffered “much unjustifiable humiliation and distress” (at 708)) only nominal damages. It stands, in my judgment, more as an example of a claim that should readily lead to recovery of exemplary or aggravated damages, a plea made on Mr Constantine’s behalf before the judge by Patrick Hastings KC, a former Attorney General. But regardless of that, if I am wrong on my central finding that BPN is entitled to damages of £2,000, and therefore is entitled only to nominal damages, any correction to the damages that I have awarded, to replace that sum with a figure for nominal damages, would consider what the correct figure would be to award. Whether nominal damages would still be £2 in 2021 is not something which this judgment needs to consider.  </p>

This sum has been calculated in the way that I have explained above. However, the decision to demolish the two blocks was not caused by the negligence of Canham. The Block A foundations were constructed to the wrong revision of the drawings, and the foundations were far more shallow than designed by Canham as a result. There were also widespread and serious defects in Block A that were nothing to do with the foundations at all. The Block B foundations were of the correct depth and dimension, a fortunate coincidence. They were, however, missing the dowel connections between pads and beams too, because Canham had negligently omitted them from both the Revision A and the Revision B drawings. This consequence of Canham’s negligence could, however, be reasonably and adequately remedied by retro-fitting these connections. This was work that was actually instructed, and which was underway, when the decision was taken to abandon that work. That decision was taken because BPN decided to demolish Block B too. That was caused by further discoveries concerning the structure of Block B, partly informed by what was discovered as Block A was demolished. It was also discovered that the superstructure of Block B was moving, another problem or defect that was not caused by the foundations designed by Canham. </p>

This work was started, but not completed, because it was overtaken by events, in the sense that a decision was taken to demolish Block B prior to completion of those works.  The breaches by Canham were not an effective cause of the decision to demolish, nor were they an effective cause of the decision to demolish Block A. BPN is entitled to recover the sum of £2,000 in respect of the remedial works to Block B that were performed prior to the decision to demolish that block, as the breaches by Canham were an effective cause of that loss.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally, there is an adjudication scheme for claims in professional negligence, operated by the Professional Negligence Bar Association. It was re-launched in 2017, and if it had been used in this case, would have led to an experienced Queen’s Counsel in the field considering the claims and (given it is not a statutory adjudication) issuing a non-binding decision. It is supported by the insurance industry, amongst others. It is a great pity that the parties did not adopt that method of resolving their dispute in this case. It would have been far quicker, and much more economical, than conducting a High Court trial which lasted over three TCC weeks, with all the costs to the parties that such a trial entails. In essence, this case really concerned issues of factual causation. Although they were not all called, there was a total of six different experts instructed in this case, with a claim against Canham for £3.7 million. The negligence was admitted in certain limited respects (or at least was agreed by the experts in the structural engineering joint statement). There were unusual facts, but in the event BPN have succeeded to the tune of only £2,000. Even though there were contested issues of fact, adjudications can in suitable cases proceed with oral evidence and cross-examination of witnesses. Using the scheme to which I have referred, to resolve a dispute such as this one, would have been a far better way for the parties to have proceeded.  </p>
