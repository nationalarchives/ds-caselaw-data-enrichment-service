The life insurance division was divested and separation of the Co-op Bank was initiated. CISGIL’s network infrastructure, data centre, hardware, software and applications were all shared with the Co-op Bank. They were cumbersome and outdated and, when the Coop Bank left the shared platform, the operation and maintenance costs would be unsustainable. CISGIL considered that access to a flexible and contemporary IT infrastructure would enable it to provide tailored services to its customers and to compete as a market-leading digital and data-based business. Therefore, CISGIL decided to purchase and implement a new IT solution for its business (“Project Cobalt”). </p>

The stated objectives of the IT solution included delivery of a fully managed end-to-end new solution for CISGIL’s business, including core policy administration, billing, claims and enterprise systems, human resources, data warehouse and relationship management. The RFP stated that the IT solution should be a managed service from the provider’s own data centres/hosting facilities with no interfaces or integration with the existing (COM) system. It had to include full disaster recovery capability, comply with all UK insurance regulatory requirements and have the flexibility to adapt to market and consumer changes. Regular upgrades would be required as part of the standard solution. Historical data would have to be migrated into the core applications or as a read only basis for analysis. The IT solution was required to enable the introduction of new products, sourced by CISGIL or by third parties. </p>

At the TES meeting on 18 August 2016, Richard White was introduced as the new transformation director for CISGIL and the MVP2 proposal was discussed. The original plan was to implement the new operating IT system and then migrate the COM products to the new system. The programme assumed that Release 2 would be running by Autumn 2016, enabling CISGIL to exit the COM by early 2017. The new proposal was to re-implement the existing operating model and legacy products in Insurer Suite (excluding legacy technology and processes) so that CISGIL could decommission the existing data centre. Thereafter, new business would be introduced on a minimum basis. Phased data migration would follow once all new build products had been completed.

At an internal CISGIL meeting held on 14 November 2016, Mr Coomer presented TIC’s findings and recommendations. The Pinarello scenario was identified as a contingency option for delivery of the transformation programme. It would result in an increase in delivery costs but a reduction in the charges and support costs over the 10-year service period.  </p>

However whilst our client has not agreed to any changes to the Roadmap or to IBM's various revised draft plans, at best it is disingenuous for IBM to suggest that the Application Gate 5 payment is due now when IBM has failed to deliver on all but the first key milestones and it is suggesting that the Programme is over 2 years away from reaching the stage when the Application Gate 5 payment would be due according to the Roadmap.

Firstly, IG’s approach of copying the base code and customising it for Release 1, rather than developing CISGIL-specific modifications within the source code, required IBM to transfer all the configurations and the source code customisations in Release 1 into Release 2. Secondly, IBM would have to retrofit all defect fixes into Release 2. Thirdly, some customised parts of Release 1 had been made redundant by new functionality in version 7.6, issued on 13 October 2016, such as the portals, aggregators and interface elements. Fourthly, although IG had carried out significant remediation work, IBM would have to carry out any outstanding upgrades required to the FOSS components and maintain them. Fifthly, regression testing, system testing, SIT, and UAT would have to be carried out in respect of the outstanding work. Finally, IBM would be responsible for ongoing maintenance in respect of the system, which was likely to be higher than expected for a newly developed solution as a result of the large number of violations against industry standard guidelines. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">CISGIL’s position is that at termination in July 2017, the project was seriously in delay. User acceptance testing for Release 1 had still not been completed and was about 1 year, 4 months behind programme. Although CISGIL had been told that the date for Release 1 Go Live with aggregators was June 2017, IBM had internally recognised that this would not be achieved before November 2017. Release 2 was still in the process of being built and IBM had put forward no credible plan for completion. On 7 April 2017 the anticipated delivery date for Release 2.0 was September 2018 and the delivery date for Release 2.1 was March 2019. CISIGL considered that the project was out of control. If the time lapse between Release 1 and Release 2 grew significantly greater that or original planned three months, the cost and feasibility of running the business across two platforms would become impracticable. Against the history of missed forecasts, CISGIL had no confidence in IBM’s ability to deliver the project. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">IBM’s position is that as at termination, IG was significantly behind programme, particularly in defect correction, and substantial additional resources would be required to correct the deficiencies in the software but it would have been possible to deliver the IT solution. However, CISGIL’s refusal to pay the AG5 milestone was the tip of the iceberg. It made clear to IBM that not only would the invoice not be paid but that no further invoices would be paid and IBM would be expected to complete the project without recompense, after which CISGIL would claim its losses arising out of the delays. IBM was not prepared to continue the project on that basis. </p>

When interpreting a written contract, the Court is concerned to ascertain the intention of the parties by reference to what a reasonable person, having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties, would have understood them to be using the language in the contract. It does so by focussing on the meaning of the relevant words in their documentary, factual and commercial context. That meaning has to be assessed in the light of (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause, (ii) any other relevant provisions of the contract, (iii) the overall purpose of the clause and the contract, (iv) the facts and circumstances known or assumed by the parties at the time that the document was executed, and (v) commercial common sense, but (vi) disregarding subjective evidence of any party's intentions: <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton</span> [2015] UKSC 36 per Lord Neuberger Paras.15-23;<span style="font-style:italic"> Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank</span> [2011] UKSC 50 per Lord Clarke Paras.21-30; <span style="font-style:italic">Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd </span>[2009] UKHL 38 per Lord Hoffmann Paras.14-15, 2025. </p>

Approval was not automatic; it was dependent on satisfaction of the stipulated delivery requirements in the Implementation SOW. For some of the milestones, approval would not be forthcoming unless there was evidence of completion, such as an agreed plan, evidence that release functionality had been built or that the Release had gone live. The AG5 milestone related to the IBM software licences that were made available in 2015 and 2016. The only pre-condition to the milestone payment was timing; the milestone became due at the beginning of January 2017. Contrary to CISGIL’s submissions, CISGIL did not have any discretion to withhold such approval where the stated delivery criteria were satisfied. In January 2017, Richard White was under a contractual obligation to approve the milestone payment. </p>

The fixed cost of the software licences for the project was initially anticipated to be incurred in 2015. However, as set out above, the parties agreed to structure the payments so that they became due in stages, with the last stage payment for the licences being deferred to January 2017. To facilitate this arrangement, IBM arranged for IG to buy the necessary licences using a loan from IBM Global Financing, which was subsequently to be repaid when CISGIL paid the Application Gate instalments. </p>

Paragraph 11.4(c) of Schedule 5 did not stipulate that the milestone number had to be recited on the invoice; it simply required identification of the relevant payment milestone. Clearly, the reference to IMP-020 was a minor clerical error. There is no suggestion that this caused any confusion for CISGIL. IMP-020 was the AG 4 milestone which had already been paid by CISGIL. It would be obvious to anyone reading the invoice that it concerned application gate 5 and not application gate 4. The invoice expressly stated on its face that it was in respect of application gate 5. The sum invoiced was the value of the AG 5 milestone. That was sufficient to identify the relevant payment milestone and comply with paragraph 11.4(c).  </p>

As set out above, that was wrong. IBM was entitled to the purchase order for the AG5 milestone because payment was not conditional on progress of the project. However, CISGIL’s case on construction of the Roadmap, the relevant provisions of the MSA and the Implementation SOW against the relevant factual matrix, was worthy of scrutiny and could not be considered unarguable.

Trustin Kerwood Ltd </span>[1990] 2 Lloyd's Rep 309 at 310 Lloyd LJ said that for all ordinary purposes, the modern law of equitable set-off is to be taken as accurately stated there. Morris LJ set out the law in these terms: "The position is, therefore, that since the Judicature Acts there may be (1) a set-off of mutual debts; (2) in certain cases a setting up of matters of complaint which, established, reduce or even extinguish the claim; and (3) reliance as a matter of defence upon matters of equity which formerly might have called for injunction or prohibition…The cases within group (3) are those in which a court of equity would have regarded the crossclaims as entitling the defendant to be protected in one way or another against the plaintiff's claim" (at 23). </p>

That emphasises the importance of the two elements identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Hanak v. Green</span>; it defines the necessity of a close connection by reference to the rationality of justice and the avoidance of injustice; and its general formulation, "without taking into account", avoids any traps of quasi-statutory language which otherwise might seem to require that the cross-claim must arise out of the same dealings as the claim, as distinct from vice versa…” </p>

The language of paragraph 11.7 was clear in specifying one route alone for challenging an invoice and providing that unless that route was followed the invoice had to be paid. Paragraph 11.11 provided that if CISGIL disputed any element of the invoice it was required to notify IBM (in writing) within seven business days of receipt of the invoice. Paragraph 11.12 reiterated that it was only a “Disputed Amount” (an invoice or an amount which had been disputed in accordance with paragraph 11.11) that CISGIL might decline to pay. </p>

If, contrary to the Court’s finding above, CISGIL had failed to dispute the AG5 invoice within seven days of receipt, it would have been precluded from challenging IBM’s contractual entitlement to payment. However, the Court must also address the question as to whether CISGIL could nonetheless assert an equitable right of set-off against any such contractual entitlement to payment; that is, whether the right of set-off was excluded on a proper construction of the MSA.  </p>

Evans J held that the contract excluded the defendants’ right of deduction but did not bar the claim. Clause 4 of the agreement did not preclude the defendant from bringing damages claims in cases where they had failed to invoke the clause 4 procedure but it did prevent them from deducting such claims from the fob amount drawn by the plaintiffs which was payable in full subject only to claims made in accordance with that clause: </p>

In my judgment, two factors in particular work strongly in their favour. First, the defendant can hardly be heard to say that it was theirs and the plaintiffs’ intention, when the agreement was made, that they were to remain free to ignore the cl.4 machinery and to make their damages claims or deductions in such other ways as they might choose, either at the time or subsequently within (presumably) a six-year limitation period. Secondly, if it is accepted that ignoring cl. 4 would itself amount to a breach of contract, for which the defendants would be liable to the plaintiffs in damages, the measure of such damages would be practically impossible to calculate...  </p>

Where the language used does not mention set-off, it may be difficult for a party to satisfy the requirement of clarity if the clause relied on does not in terms qualify the payment obligation. Conversely where the provision does expressly qualify the payment obligation, it may readily be construed as sufficiently clear to be effective (as in CocaCola Financial Corp v Finsat Ltd [1998] Q.B. 43; WRM v Wood and Rohlig (UK) Ltd v Rock Unique Ltd [2011] EWCA Civ. 18).

I can frankly see no substance at all in this argument. Perhaps the words "best endeavours" in a statute or contract mean something different from doing all that can reasonably be expected-although I cannot think what the difference might be.

As a matter of language and business common sense, untrammelled by authority, one would surely conclude that they did not. This is because there may be a number of reasonable courses which could be taken in a given situation to achieve a particular aim. An obligation to use reasonable endeavours to achieve the aim probably only requires a party to take one reasonable course, not all of them, whereas an obligation to use best endeavours probably requires a party to take all the reasonable courses he can. In that context, it may well be that an obligation to use all reasonable endeavours equates with using best endeavours and it seems to me that is essentially what Mustill J is saying in the Overseas Buyers case. One has a similar sense from a later passage at the end of the judgment of Buckley LJ in IBM v Rockware Glass at </p>

It is not possible to say, simply on the basis of the architecture, whether the product had been developed for one market or another.

However, as Dr Hunt accepted in cross-examination, the 643 product items in the schedules included some that were not identified as available in release 0 “OOTB”; they would not be provided until releases 1, 2 or 3, indicating that further development would be required.  </p>

This view was based on a comparison between the expected development identified in the fit-gap assessments and evidence of actual development in the Insurer Suite release notes, SubVersion, IBM’s code audit documentation and other documentary evidence. </p>

However, the contemporaneous documents, including Ms Neate’s email of 6 April 2016, suggest that the Adaptive Rating Engine was re-written at CISGIL’s request during the course of the project.

It was delivered in Drop 1, indicating that this area of functionality was built into the base code of Insurer Suite. Following delivery, it transpired that the functionality was defective. IBM conceded that it was defective. The problem was resolved; CISGIL accepted a workaround in the short term, it was fixed at no additional charge and delivered in Release 7.6.

However, in cross-examination she clarified that, under the MSA, additional fit-gaps to support the use of telematics indicated substantial base development and further development was anticipated for aggregators. That indicated that the anticipated base development and customisation was substantial (28 out of 54 entries in Dr Hunt’s Appendix B): </p>

Dr Hunt’s initial view was that such code analysis would not be viable in this case because of the lack of detail in the estimate of base development, the way that Insurer Suite was structured and IG’s approach to customisation. She considered that a comparison of the amount of code in each Insurer base release would give some indication of the amount of new code produced but would not identify any code that had been replaced or re-developed; the ‘copy and modify’ approach to customisation used by IG meant that customer-specific changes were not contained in clearly identifiable modules or areas; the Hotfix area could give an indication of how much code was designated as ‘back to base’ but this was based on IG’s subjective decisions about what to place in this area. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">CISGIL is critical of IBM’s failure to secure a contract with IG that was on a full back-to-back basis with the MSA. IBM challenges CISGIL’s legal analysis of the IG contract and contends that it was back-to-back in essential respects. It is not necessary to resolve that dispute because it is immaterial to the steps which were reasonable for IBM to take to satisfy itself as to the risks concerned with contractual performance. Under the MSA, IBM had full responsibility for the performance of its sub-contractor, regardless of the terms on which its sub-contractor was engaged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Drawing together the above evidence, it is apparent that the parties engaged in very substantial due diligence and fit-gap exercises that enabled IBM to satisfy itself as to IG’s capabilities to meet CISGIL’s requirements. Pre-contract, there was a very long period of collaborative working to ensure that the parties understood what was required and what would be supplied. The results of that collaborative working were the agreed fit-gap schedules. IBM obtained estimates for the time and effort required by IG to carry out the necessary base code development and to meet the requirements in the fit-gap assessments. It interrogated IG’s estimates for resourcing the project and considered the technical and financial risks associated with the same. No fatal flaw was identified in IG’s proposals for organising its work or its methodology. IBM took all reasonable steps to satisfy itself as to the risks, contingencies and circumstances concerned with its performance of the MSA. </p>

The benefits that CISGIL hoped to derive from Project Cobalt were substantial; they included increased competitiveness, cost savings, regulatory approval and a solution to the loss of the shared platform with Co-op Bank. However, prior to any commitment by executing the MSA, CISGIL would have paused if informed that those benefits might be in jeopardy. There remained the “lift and shift” option which, although inadequate to provide the business improvements desired by CISGIL, would have allowed it to exit the legacy platform prior to December 2017 and explore alternative long-term solutions. </p>

CISGIL submits that if IBM had sought to implement the core insurance functionality and had not sub-contracted it to IG, IBM would inevitably have had all IG’s knowledge about Insurer Suite. Clause 18.5(a) ensures that IBM cannot avoid liability because it subcontracted to IG and therefore did not acquire that knowledge itself. The flawed assumption is that IBM would have had IG’s knowledge about Insurer Suite. If IBM had not sub-contracted to IG, it would have had no knowledge of Insurer Suite. Almost certainly, it would have struggled to perform the MSA because it did not have the in-house knowledge and expertise to do so; hence the use of a specialist subcontractor. But it is unrealistic to suggest that IG would have handed over its intellectual property rights in Insurer Suite to allow IBM to ‘have a go’. CISGIL’s argument is a bad point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I reject that evidence. By June 2015, CISGIL had committed significant time, resources and funding for the MSA. Mr Summerfield accepted in cross-examination that if it had terminated the MSA immediately, or soon after execution, CISGIL would have incurred losses of about £57.6 million. More significantly, CISGIL had told stakeholders and the regulators that Project Cobalt was a response to the PRA assessment that <span style="font-style:italic">“the firm’s current business model is not sustainable”</span>. It could justify abandoning the project prior to entering into the MSA, as the outcome of careful due diligence. It would be very difficult to justify abandoning the project immediately after the conclusion of the contract and would have a destabilising effect on CISGIL. </p>

If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting. Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it had it been suggested to them. Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. However, and thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon’s first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable. Fourthly, … although Lord Simon’s requirements are otherwise cumulative, I would accept that business necessity and obviousness, his second and third requirements, can be alternatives in the sense that only one of them needs to be satisfied, although I suspect that in practice it would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied. Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is ‘vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care… Sixthly, necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment… the test is not one of ‘absolute necessity’, not least because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. It may well be that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon’s second requirement is … that a term can only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence.” </p>

Although such an implied term might be reasonable and equitable, it is always open to the parties to allocate risk in a commercial contract. Such a term is not necessary to provide this contract with commercial or practical coherence and would contradict the express requirements for notice of delay to be given as a pre-condition to any relief. The above contractual provisions set out a complete code for the dates by which IBM was obliged to achieve the Milestone Dates, the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, it would be relieved from such obligations. There is simply no necessity to imply a term as alleged. </p>

We realised that milestone IMP-018 would be affected but all parties wanted to keep the Go-Live date the same. Over the next few days we came up with the 3 drop approach which gave CISGIL more time to provide the business information whilst ensuring IG had sufficient time to complete the configuration. Also, by delivering Release 1 in drops, it allowed some of the System Integration Testing (“SIT”) to start. In order to maintain the original Go-Live date, SIT had to start on time but would run for longer to accommodate the 3 drops. This was not normal but an attempt to keep to the schedule.

Delivery of documents into SIT was delayed by five and a half months until July 2016. Dr Hunt’s view was that IBM was responsible for three months of this delay for two reasons. Firstly, IG had sufficient information to deliver at least some documents for Drop 2, which would have allowed the Kofax interface to be tested in SIT and would have made the development of the remaining documents more efficient. Secondly, by March 2016 IG had been given all the specifications and IBM predicted delivery by the end of April, but in fact did not deliver all documents into SIT until late June 2016. Dr Hunt considered that CISGIL was responsible for the remaining two and a half months’ delay for document delivery into SIT but this had no impact on IBM’s ability to achieve IMP-18c because delay in providing the Kofax interface meant that neither IBM nor CISGIL were able to test the documents until after the suspension of UAT 1. </p>

Dr McArdle considered that this decision was premature. Such observation must be correct, given the status of SIT, but neither party at the time suggested that UAT should be postponed beyond this date, no doubt because they were optimistic that further delay could be minimised. </p>

She carried out an independent assessment to identify the root cause of each defect, such as a defect in the base code, a configuration error or a testing error. She then assessed the severity of each defect, using the criteria set out in the Defect Management document (rather than the DLV-013 document). Dr Hunt found that approximately 23% of these defects in UAT were duplicates (incorrectly identified as defects) but she considered that this was well within the normal range of error. Of the correctly identified 67 defects, IG/IBM were responsible for 64 defects, which Dr Hunt classified as 12 critical, 19 high and 33 medium severity. </p>

However, that is not the case where the contractual benefit is non-pecuniary.

Generally, CISGIL operated with a buffer of 130%. In the autumn of 2014, CISGIL’s financial indicators were that it would fall below 120%, prompting questions from the regulator. It was agreed with the regulator that CISGIL should increase its capital buffer to 140% to support the new risks to the business by the transformation programme.  </p>

It does not accept, however, that the amounts paid to it in relation to the Oracle finance implementation (‘Hyperion’ and ‘Fusion’) have been wasted by reason of any breach by IBM. It submits that those costs have been wasted for the simple reason that CISGIL has chosen not to use the system.  </p>

Mr Eastwood interrogated the costs included in the Programme Ledger, checking 79% of the pre-termination amount by value to underlying records such as invoices, 95% of the amount by value to records of contemporaneous approval, and 95% of the amount by value to evidence of payment. He reviewed the system within CISGIL for authorising expenditure through the issue of purchase orders and approving invoices.   </p>

First, CISGIL’s accounting processes were not sufficiently robust to allow meaningful validation that costs on the Programme Ledger actually related to the project (rather than to other aspects of CISGIL’s business) and were properly incurred. Secondly, the testing that Mr Eastwood carried out to support the claim was superficial and inadequate. Mr Eastwood failed to investigate how the contractors responsible for approving costs actually did so, and to take any independent steps to verify that the figures presented to him by CISGIL were (i) properly to be treated as costs incurred in relation to the project and (ii) those costs were wasted by reason of breaches by IBM. </p>

Rullion contractors recorded their time on Rullion’s time recording platform. On a periodic basis, it would send timesheet extracts of the time recorded by the contractors and their associated costs to CISGIL, showing (i) the name of each contractor; (ii) the time and cost relating to the contractor; (iii) the period to which the cost related; and (iv) the CISGIL cost centre to which the work related. CISGIL would centrally review and update the Rullion timesheets and send them to the individuals responsible for the cost centres to which the costs related. The NOM Project Management Office would review the Rullion timesheet and, if satisfied that the time and costs were correct, approve the costs relevant to their cost centre once all entries on the timesheet were approved.

Mr Phillpott and Mr Rielly were Rullion contractors. The two individuals who authorised the largest portion of costs as part of the Rullion timesheets were Victoria Symms and Ric Wood, both of whom were Rullion contractors. No dishonesty has been alleged but I agree with Mr Ilett that this calls into question whether these contractors may have had a conflict of interest in approving the costs of Rullion without adequate review and/or challenge. This concern is highlighted by Mr Ilett’s identification of expenditure by CISGIL of £701,551 above the maximum rate of £700 per day specified in the Rullion rate card. These concerns would lead the Court to exclude from the claim the excess expenditure of £701,551. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">IBM submits that CISGIL is not entitled to costs based on overall programme or IT project delays because its pleaded case is based on delays to specific milestone dates, in particular, the Release 1 and Release 2 milestone dates. That argument fails to appreciate the link between the Key Milestones in the Roadmap. When IBM failed to meet the Release 1 build complete milestone IMP-018c, it had a direct delaying impact on the Release 1 Go Live date (IMP-022) and the Home Data Bulk Migration milestone (IMP-025). Similarly, when IBM failed to meet the Release 2 Go Live date (IMP-026), it had a direct delaying impact on the Motor Data Bulk Migration milestone (IMP-028). For the reasons set out under Issue 4 above, IBM was contractually responsible for the failure to meet all those milestone dates. I accept IBM’s submission that it does not automatically follow that CISGIL is entitled to all costs incurred, effectively an attempt to recover wasted costs by an alternative claim; it must prove causation. CISGIL is entitled to the costs incurred as a result of the above breaches of contract.    </p>

This includes some of the elements claimed as reporting failure losses, which in truth are prolongation and disruption losses. The quantum experts have not carried out any investigation into the causal link between the delays to the project and any additional costs incurred. The parties have been content to approach quantum on assessments made by factual witnesses with cross-checks against some of the underlying documents. Necessarily, that results in the Court considering each part of the claim on a similar basis. IBM has not put forward an alternative analysis of the costs caused by the delays to the project; the high-level points made in its submissions are not sufficient to undermine the factual and expert evidence produced by CISGIL. </p>
