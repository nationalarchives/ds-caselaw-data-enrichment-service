It is not in dispute that UCR 2016 applied to the procurement competition in question, which was run using the negotiated procedure under Regulation 47 of UCR 2016. HS2 is a very well-known and highprofile infrastructure project to construct a new high-speed railway to connect London with destinations both in the Midlands and the North of England. Phase One is to construct four new stations, and approximately 140 miles of new high-speed rail track, between London and Birmingham. Two of the stations are in the south, and two further north, with the terminus in Birmingham. Journey times by rail between the two cities will fall from 1 hour 21 minutes, to about 50 minutes. Phase Two will then continue the high-speed rail link onwards, north of Birmingham, in the shape of a letter Y, connecting onwards to Manchester, and to Leeds. Some of that phase will use existing track. Once completed, London will be at the base of the letter Y, with Birmingham at the junction before the two limbs go on towards the North East (as far as Leeds) and to the North West (to Manchester). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The trains will run at speeds in excess of 250 mph. As a project, it is very high cost, and the current estimate is somewhat in excess of £100 billion. The duration of the works for Phase One is about 8 years, with Phase Two expected to open about ten more years after that. It has proved to be a controversial project, as major infrastructure projects often are. In 2019 there was a Government review into its future. There are those who strongly support it, those who strongly oppose it for a variety of reasons, and many more somewhere in between those two points of view. Although the project has been controversial for reasons associated with both the total cost, the increase in the originally predicted cost, delay and also its environmental impact, these proceedings are not concerned with any of those very wide issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This litigation is much more narrow in scope, and concerns the procurement competition conducted by HS2 to decide which entity should be the Construction Partner (or “CP”) with HS2 for Old Oak Common, one of the two Southern Stations (the other being at Euston in London). There is currently a disused train maintenance depot at Old Oak Common, which was utilised as a construction materials marshalling facility for Crossrail. Old Oak Common is located to the west of London, about 600 metres from Willesden Green. The two Northern Stations for Phase One are to be Curzon Street in Birmingham, and another one to the south of Birmingham, which is to be called simply Interchange. This litigation concerns only Old Oak Common, known as OOC in all the documents. The procurement competition was run separately from, but at the same time as, that for the other Southern Station, Euston. The Euston competition was Lot 1, and that for Old Oak Common was Lot 2. Originally Bechtel was pre-qualified to bid for Lot 1 too, but withdrew from that competition by way of a formal withdrawal on 7 March 2018. The reason for the withdrawal was that Bechtel, having conducted a detailed review of the Invitation to Tender (or “ITT”), decided to concentrate all its collective efforts on its bid for Lot 2. Another bidder, whom it is not necessary to identify, took the same decision in relation to withdrawing from Lot 2 to concentrate upon Lot 1.  </p>

The other eight platforms will be on the surface and will interchange with the West Coast Main line, Heathrow Express and Crossrail (now called the Elizabeth line). The West Coast Main line currently goes from London Paddington to Bristol, Plymouth and beyond. All these lines will therefore interchange with HS2 at Old Oak Common.  </p>

This undoubtedly will make it one of the most expensive railway stations ever to be built in Europe, although still somewhat less than the cost of the New York World Trade Centre Transportation Hub in the United States, said to be the most expensive railway station in the world (at a cost of US$4 billion). The budget for Euston is even higher than that for Old Oak Common, and is in excess of £1.5 billion. Both station projects are, evidently, highly complicated and consequently expensive. </p>

More detail on the scoring is provided below, but in overall terms in the procurement evaluation, BBVS scored 75.38% and Bechtel scored 73.76%. Although Bechtel scored higher than BBVS on some areas of the evaluation – these being Technical, Behavioural Assessment, Commercial and Staff Rates – it was substantially outscored by BBVS on the fifth area, Lump Sum Fee. On that one area of the evaluation, which was worth a maximum of 10%, Bechtel scored only 5.76% and BBVS scored 10%, the maximum score for that Question. That score is therefore 4.24% higher than the score Bechtel achieved on this area of the evaluation. Due to the way the ITT was designed, this means that BBVS tendered the lowest Lump Sum Fee of the four bidders, as the maximum score was to be given to the bidder tendering the lowest Lump Sum Fee. Given the overall difference in the total final scores of these two bidders was only 1.62%, it can be seen that the single difference in score on Lump Sum Fee alone, accounts for a considerable difference in the overall scores between Bechtel and BBVS. Bechtel was the bidder that achieved the second highest score overall. In these proceedings Bechtel challenges the outcome of the procurement competition. BBVS is an Interested Party in the litigation but took no part in the trial, given the issues to be tried at this stage of the litigation are essentially those of liability.  </p>

There are a vast number of different documents and personnel involved in considering, submitting and evaluating a bid for a project such as this one, and putting together a bid of this nature involves a large team of specialist people working in very great detail. Similarly, evaluating such tenders is an arduous task, involving Independent Assessors, Moderators and other personnel. This judgment will not address all the different documents, nor all of the evidence adduced by the many witnesses called by both parties, but only those sufficient to address the issues necessary to resolve the litigation. The most important document (although to refer to it as a single document is potentially misleading, as it has many different volumes and appendices), which governs the procurement competition is the Invitation to Tender or the ITT. This is the document that (amongst other things) sets out the rules of the competition, explains how the tender should be prepared, and gives the scoring methodology. Evaluations must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the ITT. That is a different way of stating that the competition must be evaluated in the manner identified in the ITT, and notified to the bidders. The most important part of the ITT for these purposes is Volume 0. However, I will refer to that simply as the ITT. </p>

At its heart, Bechtel alleges that HS2 was in breach of its obligations under UCR 2016 in the way the evaluation was conducted, and in the result of the competition as a result. It maintains both that its own tender, and that of BBVS, were not evaluated correctly. In some respects it maintains that BBVS should have been given a lower score on some questions, and that Bechtel should have been given a higher score on some. It criticises the BBVS bid as being what is called in the regulations an “abnormally low tender”, and contends for certain adverse consequences for BBVS in the competition as a result. Bechtel maintains that had the evaluation been performed correctly, without manifest error and in accordance with the obligations upon HS2, Bechtel would have been the first-ranked bidder, would have won the competition and would have been awarded the contract.

It maintains the competition should have been re-conducted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">HS2 has four broad lines of defence. These are, firstly to deny that it was in breach in any of the different ways alleged in terms of the evaluation, and to maintain that the score awarded to Bechtel is correct and that BBVS was the overall winner. Secondly, it denies that the BBVS tender was abnormally low, and maintains that the ITT was specifically designed to require a <span style="font-style:italic">minimum</span> Lump Sum Fee of 7% (what is called the Fee Collar) to ensure, expressly, that no bids could be, or should have been, abnormally low if they exceeded the Fee Collar. Thirdly, in respect of some of the questions in the procurement where complaint is made by Bechtel of the evaluation, HS2 maintains that the challenges that Bechtel wishes to bring in these proceedings are time-barred (under the very strict time limits for bringing procurement challenges). Fourthly, it maintains that Bechtel’s claim fails for causation reasons, because Bechtel included a very substantial and significant – the word used in some of the cross-examination was “fundamental” – qualification to its tender that was not acceptable to HS2. Had Bechtel been given the highest score, HS2 maintains it would have been entitled under the terms of the procurement to disqualify Bechtel as a result of this qualification, and would have done so. Overall, although this is not advanced as a separate line of defence, HS2 draws attention to the very different – and higher - level of Lump Sum Fee included by Bechtel in its tender, compared to the lower level tendered by BBVS. For reasons explained in Section B of this judgment, Confidentiality, that particular area is considered in Confidential Appendix II. However, given the difference in fee level tendered, and given the higher scores awarded to Bechtel on so many other areas of the tender, it can be concluded simply on the face of the documents that had Bechtel tendered a fee lower than BBVS (but still in excess of the 7% fee collar) it would have won the bid. This is because the tenderer who tendered the lowest fee was to be awarded the maximum score available of 10%, and BBVS had the lowest fee in their bid, therefore achieving this percentage in the evaluation. Given this was the highest score available for that part of the tender, BBVS obtained a considerable advantage in its overall score as a result of its keen pricing in this respect. Bechtel was awarded only 5.76% in the evaluation of its Lump Sum Fee, and was therefore outscored by BBVS by 4.24% overall on this single area of the evaluation. This is far in excess of the difference in evaluation score between the two bids overall. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Tender competitions such as this one are aimed at securing the most economically advantageous tender (sometimes referred to as “MEAT”). Losing tenderers may often, with the benefit both of hindsight and the type of disclosure provided in proceedings such as these, revisit both their own tender evaluation and that of the winning bidder, and seek to have the court examine different areas of the evaluation. During the cross examination of Mr Blair, Bechtel produced an exhibit C1, which showed that had different figures been included within the Lump Sum Fee calculation, this would (or could) have led to Bechtel outscoring BBVS both on the evaluation of this area of the procurement, and therefore as a result overall in the competition. This is considered in more detail in Confidential Appendix II, due to the different percentages, including the levels of profit sought. However, I consider such an exercise to be wholly redundant. The law, considered further below, is clear: the court will only interfere in the evaluation if there has been manifest error, or other breaches of obligation (such as that of equal treatment). It is no function of the court to re-evaluate the different bids absent manifest error or other breach. It must be remembered that a procurement exercise such as this is a <span style="font-style:italic">competition</span>, with the different bidders competing against one another to secure the contract. The bid that is evaluated with the highest score will, assuming that it is evaluated in accordance with the ITT (and absent manifest error), win that competition (absent breaches of the principles of fairness, equal treatment and transparency). Hindsight is of no assistance in proceedings such as these. Exhibit C1 was plainly an exercise in hindsight put forward to show that, given different figures, Bechtel could have won the competition. That is all very well in terms of internal analysis at Bechtel investigating how it is that BBVS came to win the competition, but is of no assistance in these proceedings. </p>

Bechtel issued proceedings later that month in February 2019, and what is called the automatic suspension under UCR 2016 then operated, so as to prevent HS2 from entering into the contract with BBVS. After a delay of some months, HS2 issued an application to the Court to lift the automatic suspension, and Bechtel indicated its opposition to that application, and also served evidence to contest it. In August 2019, shortly before that application was to be heard, the parties sensibly compromised it. Bechtel consented to the lifting of the automatic suspension on certain terms which it is not necessary to set out in detail. The contract was therefore entered into between HS2 and BBVS. One of the remedies sought by Bechtel in these proceedings, in addition to its claim for damages, is a declaration of ineffectiveness in respect of that contract. These proceedings contend for different relief, but the parties were sensibly agreed at an early stage that liability should be dealt with first; the court agreed. Appropriate relief will only therefore be dealt with in a later round of the litigation, if one is necessary, in a subsequent trial. </p>

However, in my judgment, the phrase “suitable recognition of the institutional competence” of decision makers usefully encompasses the way in which the court, in a procurement challenge (grounded as it is in the relevant Regulations and the public law landscape), will approach challenges to evaluation. The High Court recognises the competence of evaluators, in particular those who are what is called Subject Matter Experts or SMEs. SMEs evaluate details in a tender that are in their specialist fields; that is why they are experts. They are likely to know the subjects in which they are expert. That is not to say that they can never be wrong. However, the court will recognise their competence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Some procurement competitions are not governed by the different sets of regulations, but can be subject to judicial review. Some procurement challenges start life both as Part 7 proceedings in the Technology and Construction Court, and also judicial review challenges in the Administrative Court. In those circumstances the cases will proceed jointly before one single judge, but one with the necessary authorisation to sit in both courts. Judicial review proceedings require a claimant to obtain permission to bring judicial review as a preliminary filter. There is no matching preliminary filter in the Regulations for Part 7 claims to be brought, although a defendant can apply to have allegations struck out. Regardless of the precise nature of the claim or the underlying procurement, the approach of the courts will be broadly the same. Challenges to evaluations will only be upheld if there has been manifest error, taking into account the margin of discretion available to the decision-maker, or other breach of obligation. There are parallels, as I have explained, with the test of irrationality in public law proceedings. Not only that, but breaches have to be “sufficiently serious” within the meaning of what is called the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Francovich</span> case law (the subject of Issue 23 below) in order to entitle a claimant to damages.

In some cases, the conduct of the procurement has been somewhat stark, and in breach of the Regulations. I will not list specific cases, but examples include failures to advertise sizeable procurement competitions <span style="font-style:italic">at all;</span> potential bidders learning of the existence of competitions only from press announcements once the contract has been actually awarded; clear failures to treat bidders equally; manifestly wrong evaluations; and failures to disqualify bidders who obviously ought to have been disqualified. However, the number of successful challenges is likely to be a small proportion of all the procurement competitions conducted each year in this jurisdiction under the different sets of Regulations. The scope of potential remedies available to a disgruntled bidder is comprehensive, and include some powerful orders available to the court in the event of a successful challenge. On the other side of the scales, providing balance, these powers are exercised with restraint. Challenges are considered by the court with the supervisory jurisdiction in mind. The court approaches these challenges with the “suitable recognition” to which I have referred above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">HS2 raised, as an overall defence to the entire claim, the assertion that the Bechtel bid, by reason of the qualification of its tender in respect of Clause 6.2 of the draft Conditions of Contract, could have been disqualified. HS2’s case was also that, had Bechtel been the overall winner of the competition, Bechtel <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> have been disqualified in any event. I find that this line of defence succeeds. I accept HS2’s case as to the fundamental nature of the qualification, which would have entirely shifted the financial risk profile of the Construction Partner contract. That risk would have been shifted substantially to the detriment of HS2, and would have markedly reduced the intention of the contractual arrangement proposed by HS2 in the procurement, which was that the risk of budget and programme was to be borne by the CP. I also accept HS2’s evidence as to what would have occurred had Bechtel won the evaluation overall. The nature and effect of the Bechtel qualification was such that for HS2 to have accepted it, this would have led to a contract entirely different to the one HS2 wished to award. That different contract, including as it would have done the amended clause 6.2 proposed by Bechtel, would have been directly contrary to the whole commercial rationale of the procurement, which was intended and carefully designed to enable HS2 to construct Old Oak Common Station within the budget set of £1.054 billion (“the Incentive Target”) and to the Programme Target.  HS2 was not prepared to enter into such an amended contract, and gave Bechtel several opportunities to withdraw its qualification. Bechtel declined to do so. The Bechtel bid was, as a result, tendered on a basis not in accordance with the terms of the ITT, and on a different basis, one that was contrary to the commercial ethos of the HS2 procurement competition for OOC (and for that matter, for Euston too). This finding alone means that the Bechtel claim in these proceedings fails. It should also be observed that the emails disclosed show that Bechtel knew at the time that there was a real risk that it would be disqualified. It seems that, collectively, there were those at Bechtel almost holding their breath in anticipation of, potentially, being disqualified, although those personnel obviously hoped that Bechtel would not be. Even had HS2 issued a Withdrawal Ultimatum (which was not done) I find that Bechtel would not have withdrawn its qualification; there is no evidence available that it would have done. I also observe, in passing, that had Bechtel won, and had HS2 accepted the qualification, the contract between them would have been so markedly different to that tendered, as to have entitled all the other bidders to challenge, and potentially overturn, that decision in any event as it may have contravened the principle of equal treatment. However, that latter observation was not argued and does not govern my findings on this important part of the case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">HS2 also raised limitation as a defence, in respect of three different areas of the evaluation challenged. These were all in the Technical Envelope and are in respect of Bechtel’s score for E004, E007 and E009. HS2 maintained that the legal challenge was not brought within the period required in the Regulations and that Bechtel had sufficient information to do so from the standstill letter of 5 February 2019 and its associated 195 pages of feedback. I find that the contents of the standstill letter, which was extraordinarily comprehensive, contained sufficient information for Bechtel to have brought claims related to its own score in its original pleadings. However, limitation is raised by HS2 in respect of the comparison exercise raised by Bechtel with the BBVS bid. It challenges its score based on how the BBVS tender was scored on certain questions in comparison with its own. In order to do that, Bechtel required the BBVS tender itself, not merely the explanation in the moderation rationale for why it had been scored as it had. Bechtel did not have this document when the original claim was issued, and was not given it until 1 May 2020. Under the terms of the consent order granting Bechtel the right to amend and include the comparison exercise (in Annex 3 of the Amended Particulars of Claim), HS2 said it would not raise any limitation defence in respect of matters arising out of standard disclosure. These areas of the challenge are not therefore time-barred and can be advanced by Bechtel.  </p>

This Bechtel has failed to do, in respect of any of the separate challenges to the evaluation, either in respect of its own score (to have that increased) or BBVS’s score (to have that reduced). I find that there were no such manifest errors by HS2 on each of those different areas of the evaluation, nor were there any other breaches of obligation. Bechtel has failed to establish that any of the evaluations are in error, let alone manifestly in error in the manner required. Nor are there any findings, on the evidence, in Bechtel’s favour, of unequal treatment or lack of transparency in the evaluation of the bids. The breaches alleged by Bechtel of HS2’s duties of equal treatment and transparency all fail. The scores in the evaluation of the tenders both of Bechtel and BBVS therefore remain undisturbed. </p>

A proper written record should have been kept of what occurred, and this was not done. Minutes of the meeting, in the sense that term is ordinarily understood, were not kept. Some notes were kept but no proper minutes were prepared; nor were draft minutes circulated for approval by the HS2 attendees. HS2 has failed to provide an adequate explanation for this; it appears to have happened almost by accident. The failure in record keeping is partly explained because nobody was clearly identified as the taker of the minutes of that meeting. Mr Pybus, who was the person present whom other witnesses from HS2 told me had occupied that role, told the court that he did not know that he was supposed to be doing so, and he took only sparse notes. No typed minutes were even created until February 2019, 6 months after the meeting. Oral evidence from those present was necessary in order to ascertain what took place at that meeting. However, I find that both the holding of that meeting, and its content, were proper and permitted within the terms of the ITT and the Regulations. BBVS was the winning bidder before the meeting, and the meeting resulted in its final qualifications being withdrawn, and explanation being given by BBVS to HS2 of certain matters, including BBVS’ management resource level. This isolated failure in respect of record keeping does not therefore assist Bechtel in its claims against HS2.  </p>

The contract data in the executed contract is therefore different to that contained in the ITT, in terms both of dates and also BBVS’ MRS. However, not only is this sufficiently minor as to be of no importance in a project such as this one, and indeed may even be said to be entirely expected, but I find that this was permitted under the terms of the procurement competition itself. In no way can it be said to constitute HS2 and BBVS entering into a materially different contract to the one the subject of the procurement.

There is a short timescale for proceedings to be commenced before they become time-barred, which is 30 days, and by issuing proceedings the contracting authority becomes subject to the automatic suspension preventing contract award to the winning tenderer. This means that it is not unusual for the claimant (an unsuccessful tenderer) to be seeking a range of remedies, including seeking to prove that it should have won or (as here) that the winner should have been disqualified and/or that it is entitled to a declaration of ineffectiveness. Bid information may include matters of commercial confidence arising in the claimant’s bid that are relevant to the same procurement (should it be re-run) or could be relevant to other competitions in the near or mid-future. Therefore, properly to plead or argue a case, or to comply with disclosure obligations, may involve the use of confidential information.   </p>

These orders are usually established by consent, and require review by, and the approval of, the court. They entitle the parties and their advisers fairly to contest the litigation, whilst preserving confidentiality.

It is contrary both to open justice and transparency to have trials conducted even partially in secret, and doing so is prima facie contrary to these fundamental principles. There must be very exceptional circumstances to justify such a course, which is a departure from how trials should be conducted. Similarly, judgments need to be readily comprehensible and include reference to all the relevant material and reasoning of the judge. If it is strictly necessary and cannot be avoided, some parts of a judgment can be put in a separate confidential appendix or schedule, but again that must only occur when there is no alternative, and where to provide the details included in the appendix publicly would run the real risk of destroying justified confidentiality in commercial issues.  </p>

Documents that are read out in open court, or which the judge is specifically invited to read outside court, or which it is clear (or expressly stated) that the judge has read, are of a different character in terms of being subject to the court’s inherent jurisdiction, to documents that are merely contained in the trial bundle; <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Cape Intermediate Holdings Ltd v Dring</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 1795 per Hamblen LJ (as he then was) at [112]. However, the widespread redaction of documents in any trial bundle, particularly a vast trial bundle such as this one, will only usually come to light when those documents are deployed in the trial itself. It became increasingly clear to me in this case that there were numerous passages within directly relevant documents that were put to witnesses in evidence (these were usually HS2 documents) with large areas within them redacted.

If legal professional privilege were not the reason for the redactions, HS2 would either disclose an unredacted version or explain (and therefore seek to justify) the basis of the redactions. This process almost invariably led to unredacted versions regularly being produced during the trial following each such review. It would also sometimes be the case that the original reason for the redactions was wholly unclear, and HS2 could not itself explain why the redactions had been made. This demonstrated, however, that the original scope of redactions was far too wide, and had been done with insufficient consideration of the proper grounds for making redactions.  </p>

That exercise could certainly not be done, in any event, during the actual trial itself.  </p>

Many of these passages, in respect of which someone must have made a positive decision to redact due to confidentiality, simply contained no confidential information at all. As an example, one such allegedly confidential passage included reference to HS2 being built in two phases, with stage one going to Birmingham. Such information has been in the public domain for some years. It is not remotely confidential. Redacting such obviously non-confidential detail should never have happened; and it is very difficult to see how this can have occurred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The following point is an important one, and it is particularly important in the field of procurement law when a public body under obligations of transparency and fairness seeks to redact documents in this way. Redactions from documents in the trial bundle that are going to be put to a witness should only be done by a qualified solicitor or barrister, who is taking account of the correct legal test for an assertion of legal professional privilege, and its proper scope. It would also make sense, where redactions are made, for an index to be compiled by the lawyers performing these redactions, of the documents that have been redacted, and the justification for this. That would save much time, and confusion, when such documents are considered in open court. It would also mean that a ready explanation would be available for the court and for counsel when redactions are queried. However, I am satisfied that the exercise I have described, in this case, did not interfere with the fair disposal of the issues in this case, and also did not prevent Bechtel from properly considering the contents of HS2 documents that it was entitled to see.    </p>

The Work Package contractors would perform the physical works necessary for the completion of the OOC station project. The “fixed maximum budget” set out in the ITT was £1.054 billion, which is the same as the Incentive Target. The CP would effectively contract with HS2 that the station could be built for that budget, and to the programme identified. Failures by the CP to achieve either of those important matters – the Incentive Target or the Programme Target - would result in the application of financial disincentives, which would mean that the CP would be financially disadvantaged as a result of any failure to meet either the budget or the programme. As a rather simplistic summary of complex contractual provisions, HS2 would, by reason of the terms of the contract with the CP, be entitled contractually to have the project constructed both to its budget and its programme, and would not have to pay any higher fee to the CP if the station cost more than the budget. This would have the effect of diluting the level of fee the CP would receive. Both the cost and duration of the project were risks that would be transferred from HS2 to the CP. It was concerns about these risks that led Bechtel to qualify its tender by proposing an entirely alternative version of clause 6.2 of the contract.  </p>

The price to be paid for a construction project is an important component part, for any size of project. For the OOC station project, and indeed the whole HS2 project in general, budget is of considerable - if not fundamental - importance. So too is programme.

There is a vast array of different construction industry contracts available which, within them, have very detailed contractual machinery to deal with price and cost. Without reproducing all of the intended terms for this contract verbatim, the structure of the contractual arrangements was to be as explained in [47] and [48] above. As well as the specific budget, the programme for HS2 is highly complex because there are so many other contracts involved, such as Main Works Civils, Route Wide Railways Systems, Rolling Stock and Depots. Constructing Old Oak Common is not a project being performed in isolation. The other contracts for the other elements of the HS2 project, with their different programmes, are all interlinked in the sense that they are all working towards completion of the overall infrastructure project.  </p>

This is because Bechtel was unwilling to enter into the agreement with HS2 to become CP on the terms that I have broadly identified and summarised above. Bechtel wished to become the CP for the OOC station project, certainly, and submitted a detailed and careful bid. However, Bechtel was particularly concerned with the way that HS2 sought to transfer the risk of budget and programme to the CP in the proposed contract terms. Bechtel was concerned that, following the design of the station, it might not be possible for Bechtel to achieve construction within the fixed maximum budget available and the programme. In other words, Bechtel wanted to deal with the potential situation whereby the station may turn out as costing more to build than HS2 wished to provide for in the contract itself as the budget, and/or taking longer to build that the programme target. Bechtel did not wish to bear the burden of contractual risk in terms of the achievability of budget and programme, and the potentially reduced fee in the sense that if cost went above the Incentive Target, the payable fee to the CP did not increase. That was why it qualified its bid in the terms it did, proposing an alternative, and entirely different, version of Clause 6.2 of the contract. </p>

I shall therefore only deal with those areas of the bid relevant to the challenges brought by Bechtel in this judgment. Appendix 1 sets out both the different Questions, and the different Factors.

The score from the Commercial Envelope went together with the score from the Technical Envelope to give the bidder’s overall percentage total in the competition. Assuming the pass/fail part of the competition were passed by the bidders, the winner of the competition would be the tenderer with the highest score. Analysis of the Lump Sum Fee of both BBVS and Bechtel appears in Confidential Appendix II. Together, these two elements were described as “Price” in the ITT and explanation was given in section 6.11. This included explanation of the so-called Fee Collar at 6.11.19 to 6.11.23: </p>

The way the tender was structured is that these rates then, by reason of the way the spreadsheet operated (through the formulae contained within it), generated data that could be considered by HS2 independently of the volume of resources proposed by the tenderer. As will be seen below, the volume of resources (rather than the rates for those resources) were considered (and scored) in the evaluation in the Management Resource Schedule or MRS, which was part of E001. However, due to the way the procurement was designed, the rates proposed by each bidder for the type of resources it would provide were considered separately to the adequacy of those resources, and the rates were evaluated within J001.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have explained in Confidential Appendix II – which recites the precise percentages and money sum equivalents of the BBVS and Bechtel bids for the respective Lump Sum Fee including profit – BBVS scored more highly in the Commercial Envelope, particularly on the Lump Sum Fee, than did Bechtel. BBVS tendered the lowest fee of the different bidders, and was therefore given the score for first place of 10% for J002. However, given the scoring matrix, the percentage score to be allocated to the other bidders for their Lump Sum Fees was affected by the amount by which their particular fee was higher than that of the lowest bidder. This means that the greater the divergence of fee tendered by any other bidder, which would be higher than the lowest fee tendered (in this case by BBVS), the lower the score would be for that other bidder on Question J002. This method of designing the scoring matrix had the following consequence, which would have been obvious to an RWIND tenderer. The bidder that tendered the lowest Lump Sum Fee would not only achieve a straight score of 10% - which is a sizeable amount for a single element in any evaluation – but the lower that its fee was, the more likely it was that there would be a larger differential with its nearest competitor on fee. The larger the differential on fee, the lower the next cheapest bidder on fee would score on J002. There was no fixed score of x% for the second lowest bidder on fee on Question J002; it was the differential with the lowest bidder that mattered. This scoring system has the plain and obvious consequence of granting the bidder who was lowest on fee, a very sizeable scoring advantage towards the overall total. It could also, theoretically, encourage bidders to consider how low they could set their percentages. It therefore had one potential disadvantage, namely it might potentially encourage unrealistically low bidding. However, given the creation of the Fee Collar, bids on fee had to be <span style="font-style:italic">above</span> the percentage set by HS2 above that threshold. The potential disadvantage of unrealistically low bidding on fee was therefore avoided.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">This scoring system and its potential consequences, in my view, was plain and obvious from the terms of the ITT itself. There was no hidden feature of how it would work; the summary in [56] and [57] above was set out in section 6.11 of the ITT. Bechtel would not have known in advance that BBVS (or any other bidder) would necessarily outscore it on J002 by as much as 4.24%, because it would not know by what amount its fee would be higher than the lowest of the fees bid by all the bidders. However, both Bechtel, and indeed any RWIND tenderer, would have known from reading the ITT itself that there was the potential for any tenderer to be heavily outscored on J002, which was only a single element of the tender. Bechtel, and any RWIND tenderer, would also know that this outscoring would depend upon the differential level of fee tendered by Bechtel; the higher the fee that was tendered, the greater the potential for being outscored on this element would be. The fee tendered by BBVS (the precise figures are contained in Confidential Appendix II) was above the Fee Collar. However, the fee tendered by Bechtel can, in my judgment, correctly be described as very substantially above the Fee Collar. That higher fee proposal would mean, if Bechtel won the tender overall, that Bechtel would be paid by way of fee a far higher level of remuneration by HS2. That much is also obvious. However, by doing so, it made the potential for being heavily outscored on J002 by another, lower bidder, that much more likely. Matters of commercial judgment of this type are made by the senior members of bid teams of commercial organisations in almost all large scale procurement competitions. They are, however, matters of judgment based on the contents of the ITT and the scoring matrix adopted by the contracting authority, in this case HS2. They are clear on the face of the documents and they would have been clear to an RWIND tenderer. </p>

Whether the full impact of this was actually, subjectively, known at Bechtel during the procurement does not matter; what matters is whether an RWIND tenderer would have known this. I find that such an RWIND tenderer plainly would. Indeed, as I have explained, this is clearly explained in the ITT itself. </p>

AWARD is a secure system whereby notes, reasons and scores are kept and recorded, and this can usually only be accessed under conditions of security in certain locations. This is to preserve the integrity of the process and provide an audit trail of communications between the bidders and HS2. The different bidders were referred to by code words; here, both letters of the Greek alphabet (Kappa for BBVS and Zeta for Bechtel) and also in places, the names of different cheese (Gorgonzola for BBVS; Stilton for Bechtel). Again, the use of codewords is not unusual and is to preserve anonymity, avoid any subconscious bias, and maintain the integrity of the competition.

The ITT stated that the Contract would be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender on the basis of the evaluation criteria and weightings and that the ratio of Quality to Price was 80/20.

The Technical Questions which are in issue in these proceedings related to the following technical issues.

If a bidder were given even a single score of Major Concerns, the whole bid could potentially be rejected. If simply a score of Concern, it depended upon how many of  these were awarded to an individual bidder, but if two or more were awarded, then the whole bid could be rejected. Bidders would be astute to avoid submitting a bid that might achieve a score of any Concerns or Major Concerns. Quite apart from the low contribution of that score to the overall score (which for Major Concerns would be zero) the very fact of achieving such a score could lead to serious consequences to that bidder.  </p>

As described in Part 6.8, in evaluating a response to each ITT Question, HS2 Ltd will consider the extent to which and how well (a) the ITT Question has been answered; and (b) each factor in the accompanying Evaluation Guidance has been addressed and then HS2 Ltd will award a score based on the confidence level it has in the response as a whole taking into account the criteria and factors set out in the score descriptors in Table 6.8. In relation specifically to the last factor in the ITT Questions in section E concerning alignment, HS2 Ltd is keen to ensure that each response in section E is consistent to give HS2 Ltd confidence that the Tenderer has considered and proposed a holistic overall proposition. Accordingly, in addition to the two subject matter expert Assessors who will evaluate individual responses to ITT Questions, HS2 Ltd has also engaged a ‘technical lead’ whose role is to review all responses to section E to ensure responses align. To the extent a response to an ITT Question in section E is not consistent with the rest of the responses to the ITT Questions in section E, HS2 Ltd will in the first instance clarify any inconsistency or lack of alignment if appropriate in accordance with the provisions in ITT Volume 0 and the Utilities Contracts Regulations 2016. If a clarification is not appropriate or does not resolve any inconsistency or lack of alignment, then HS2 Ltd may reflect a material lack of inconsistency [sic] in its score for that ITT Question in accordance with the relevant score descriptors depending on the extent of the inconsistency (for example, does it represent a minor concern or does it just reduce confidence from ‘Very good’ to ‘Good’).” </p>

Indeed, the Staff Rates exercise (which was for J001, one half of the score in the Commercial Envelope) was precisely designed so that those rates could be considered absent resource levels. This was made clear in the ITT and also can be seen from the way that the Rates were drawn out of the bid and imposed (the technical term is populated) into a table automatically by use of the Rates Template. This enabled the rates themselves, independent of resources, to be evaluated by HS2. </p>

The relevance of this will become clearer after the dispute in these proceedings is considered in respect of BBVS’ answer to Question E001, and what happened after the tenders were submitted, in terms of reassurance provided to HS2 by BBVS at the meeting of 5 September 2018. </p>

What was provided by any tenderer in the MRS Template as part of the tender was to be the “basis for agreement”, but this did not fix that level of resources for Years 2 and onwards at the same level as those for Year 1, or those included in the MRS at the tender stage. If the parties could not agree, then the Project Manager would determine them. It was also clear that the MRS submitted with a bidder’s tender would be subject to refinement, and that could take place during the post-tender period. This is all clearly set out in the ITT. </p>

Bechtel drew comfort from, and prayed in aid of its case on its qualifications, the fact that HS2 did not issue it with such an ultimatum. HS2 did however request that Bechtel withdraw its qualification to clause 6.2, and on numerous occasions. Following each request, Bechtel did not withdraw the qualification. Perhaps internally Bechtel had decided it would not do so, unless and until HS2 issued a Withdrawal Ultimatum, and because none was issued, it had no need to withdraw its qualification. However, that is speculation and, in my judgment, the reason for Bechtel declining to withdraw the qualification does not matter. HS2’s evidence on this was that a decision to issue such an ultimatum would itself be a major issue, could itself lead to litigation, and would have been done had Bechtel won the competition. Given Bechtel did not win, there was no need for HS2 to go through all of these different steps, including getting internal authorisation to do so (which would have been required at a high level), and potentially dealing with an expensive legal challenge, for something that was purely academic.  </p>

Their initial draft scores were never intended to be more than drafts. Even if their draft scores were the same as one another, they properly considered the factors and correct scores, and were prepared to move from their draft initial scores to a different score reached consensually. Those who gave evidence and were crossexamined about this explained, perfectly sensibly, how points made to each of them by their co-evaluator in the evaluation process had changed their view, which was admittedly only an initial view in any event. The final moderated score was reached much more carefully, and after discussion with their co-evaluator, whereas the initial draft score was precisely that – a draft.

The contract award date was delayed to February 2019 due to an extended period of governance and delay in obtaining approval from the Secretary of State. Other Key Dates were also changed. HS2 also relies upon the automatic suspension caused by the issuing of proceedings as part of the justification for this delay.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">He was questioned about Bechtel’s understanding of the mechanism of the contract, including the Guaranteed Maximum Management Price (“GMMP”) and the MRS. In particular, he was asked about the attempts HS2 made to have Bechtel withdraw its qualifications, the fact Bechtel would not (or did not) do so, and also about his understanding of the Fee Collar and how Bechtel calculated its level of fee. This involved not only profit, but also 25 other different areas of overhead, all of which fed into the calculation performed to arrive at the Lump Sum Fee. He was also challenged on how Bechtel had dealt with some of its variable overhead, and what was said, by Bechtel, to be a mistake in their submissions. This particular mistake was said to have been made by a fee estimator where items that should have been individually identified were not, but were spread across general overhead instead. This mistake was not apparent on the face of the Bechtel tender. Mr Roberts accepted that at least three items had been entered at zero as they were included elsewhere, but Guidance Note 5 to the template expressly stated that “<span style="color:#00000A">Where a value is not entered against an item, for example not applicable, included elsewhere or zero, then the tenderer must include a commentary explaining why.” This also applied “Where the commentary indicates the value for the rows [was] included elsewhere.” Mr Roberts accepted that Bechtel had not complied with this Guidance Note and had included nothing in “Comments”. </span></p>

Further, given Bechtel’s acceptance that it had not complied with the Guidance Note, in my judgment they are not entitled now to rely upon this mistake, even if doing so would benefit them in these proceedings. However, even if Bechtel can rely upon this mistake, it does not benefit them in these proceedings in any event. The way the MRS was to be scored, and the way the Fee Collar, level of fee and also Rates under J001 functioned was set out in the ITT. Mr Roberts’ evidence was basically that if Bechtel had known how HS2 was going to approach the MRS (and subsequent changes thereto) then Bechtel could or would have constructed its own bid differently. That is not relevant to the issues in this case. He also confirmed that “the bottom line percentage” would not have changed in any event, and none of the six items relied upon were resource-dependent in any event.  </p>

The way that the MRS formed part of the answer to E001, and the impact (if any) upon other elements of the bid, are matters that can and ought to be taken from the ITT itself. The subjective understanding of a bidder, or of a senior person within the bidder such as Mr Roberts, are of no legal relevance to how the procurement was constructed or intended to operate.

Profit was only one part of how the fee would be calculated, and it was the level of Lump Sum Fee or LSF tendered by the bidders that was important in question J002. Without being unduly dismissive, with the exception of the requirement for the LSF to be above 7% (explained further in Section J Abnormally Low Tender below), HS2 would not have been particularly interested in the background workings to how each tenderer approached its internal business calculations in terms of recovery of overhead. The LSF was to be expressed as a percentage of the Incentive Target. What HS2 was interested in, and what was to attract a percentage score in the evaluation (up to a maximum of 10%), was the <span style="font-style:italic">actual</span> LSF percentage tendered by each bidder. That is what a commercial competition of this nature involves, certainly when it is organised as this procurement was, and given the terms of the ITT. Therefore, the fact that Bechtel utilised a global infrastructure rate, and this may have had an impact upon how it calculated the level of Lump Sum Fee to put in its tender, may potentially be interesting from a business point of view, but would be of no interest at all to HS2 when scoring J002. It is of limited, if any, interest or relevance in a legal procurement challenge. </p>

The fact that – as Mr Roberts explained – Bechtel would have constructed its resource levels differently for its bid had the dates been different, is not of great, or any, importance. The ITT explained that HS2 retained the discretion in terms of dates. I appreciate that these date changes are alleged to be impermissible substantial modification and/or material change to the basis on which HS2 invited final tenders for the contract, and that Bechtel alleges these were in breach of HS2’s duties of equal treatment and transparency. They form the factual subject matter to Issues 14 and 15. However, that must be determined from the contents of the ITT itself, and the nature of the changes. The fact that Bechtel, subjectively, might have approached matters different does not of itself answer those issues. </p>

The exact figures are included in the Confidential Appendix. The higher level of profit sought by Bechtel (the precise figure is in Confidential Appendix II) compared to BBVS cost Bechtel such a differential in the marks awarded to each of these bidders on J002. This was not caused by any marked difference in the level of resources included in the MRS. As it happened, Bechtel came in third place both on Lump Sum Fee on J002, and also Rates (called “Rate Card Price”) in J001. This was set out in the Quantitative Commercial Evaluation – </p>

This shows that Bechtel was awarded only 5.76% on fee, and 6.11% on rates, a total of only 11.87% on the Commercial Envelope (against a potential total of 20%). Neither of these scores is explained away by concentrating on the level of the resources included in the MRS under E001. The scores are explained by Bechtel being outscored in commercial terms by two other bidders. It is of note that the winning bidder, BBVS, came in first place on fee (therefore gaining the maximum score of 10%), and second place on rates.  </p>

Prior to becoming involved on this bid, he had been heavily involved in the Crossrail Project and managed 13 of Crossrail’s advanced works and main works contracts.

In particular these related to Questions E004, E007, E009 and the moderation process. Broadly, Mr Watson was of the view that the Bechtel responses were more complete and detailed. For each of the factors, he explained what he considered to be the relative merits of the different answers, and that the Bechtel responses were far better than those of BBVS. It is not correct, in my judgment, to describe Bechtel’s scores as being “adjusted”. The initial scores were only drafts, and were steps along the way to reaching a single consensus score from the two assessors for each question.  </p>

It is not necessary to describe this further. This Bechtel tool was to be used in terms of delineation of the works or construction packages. Mr Watson contrasted this (unfavourably for BBVS, in his view) with the less sophisticated response from BBVS which proposed to enter directly into multiple large "Tier 1" contracts with works contractors, with the "Tier 1" contractors thereafter appointing Tier 2 subcontractors. In his view, this would drive supervision of the works into the supply chain (i.e. the Tier 1 contractors) and away from BBVS itself, which he considered would dilute (not his word) the level of management input and oversight from BBVS. </p>

This type of “ranking” approach was only to be used in one sense and for two Questions, namely those in the Commercial Envelope for the level of the Lump Sum Fee tendered and the rates. The lowest was to be given 10% in the evaluation, with the others scored a percentage based upon the differential level between their bids and the lowest. For all the questions in the Technical Envelope, the scoring was to be done in accordance with Table 6.8 in the ITT, namely whether HS2 had Major Concerns; Concerns; Minor Concerns; Moderate Confidence; Good Confidence; Very Good Confidence; or Excellent Confidence. Depending upon which of these was awarded, a certain score was attributed for that question. The level of confidence the assessors had in the answers would lead to the relevant score. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is not a comparative exercise and would not have been understood by an RWIND tenderer as a comparative exercise. The evaluators for the questions in the Technical Envelope were not supposed to compare the answers of Bidder X and Bidder Y (and Bidder Z), decide which was “better”, and then rank them in some way. They were not supposed to compare the answers at all. The answer of Bidder X to each Technical Question was to be considered independently of the answers of Bidder Y. If an answer gave the assessors a certain level of confidence, they would be scored (for example) with Good Confidence, and that bidder would receive the appropriate score towards its total. The fact that, say, for one factor within Question E009 Bechtel identified seven key areas, and BBVS gave only four examples, is not relevant. What is relevant is the degree of confidence that the answers by the bidders gave the evaluators when considering the different factors for each question.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I deal with the issue of the Bechtel qualifications in Section G, Qualifications below, due to its importance. However, two important points can be made from Mr McMonagle’s evidence on this subject. Firstly, the decision to include the qualifications to clause 6.2 was not a decision that was made by him, it was made at a higher level within Bechtel. It follows that the decision on whether to withdraw those qualifications, or not, was not one that he could make alone either. Indeed, Mr McMonagle did not claim that he was the decision maker in this respect. Secondly, when Bechtel were asked to withdraw the qualifications – a request made more than once by HS2 - Mr McMonagle explained that Bechtel wished to have a meeting with HS2 about this. The repeated requests by HS2 to Bechtel to withdraw the qualification, were met with repeated requests by Bechtel for a meeting. Bechtel did not tell HS2 that the qualifications would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> be withdrawn or removed; equally, Bechtel did not withdraw them either. Bechtel seemed to me to “hedge its bets” in this respect. It did not want to withdraw the qualifications, and therefore did not do so. On the other hand, specifically to refuse to withdraw them could have potentially restricted Bechtel’s options going forwards, so Bechtel was also very careful not to refuse expressly. Requesting a meeting enabled it (or it must have been thought at Bechtel that it enabled it) to tread a careful middle ground. However, regardless of its specific motivation, the bare fact remains that Bechtel did not withdraw the qualifications, even though it was asked on several occasions by HS2 to do so. In my judgment, the evidence demonstrates that Bechtel is to be treated as leaving these qualifications in place in its tender. There is no evidential basis whatsoever for Bechtel to be treated as though it had withdrawn its qualification to clause 6.2; or for it to be treated as being prepared to withdraw its qualification, whether it was issued with a Withdrawal Ultimatum or not.  </p>

This arose because Bechtel found out that one of the other bidders had been asked by HS2 to attend a meeting. This was the meeting of 5 September 2018 which took place between HS2 and BBVS for clarification purposes (there was a similar meeting on the same day with the winning bidder for Euston, one meeting being in the morning, one in the afternoon).

Bechtel were suggesting, by use of the phrase “where the team and corporate commitment to the confidence of outcome is as important to that conveyed in the written proposal” that there was the need for some sort of subjective consideration required by HS2 for it properly to understand the written bid response, and that it was necessary to have a meeting for Bechtel to provide this. That would be contrary to the principle of equal treatment. No meeting was required between HS2 and Bechtel for HS2 to understand Bechtel’s bid – or for HS2 to understand Bechtel’s qualifications, either. Indeed, in my judgment such an event would be contrary to the regulations governing procurement competitions. These are required to be conducted fairly, transparently and with equal treatment between bidders. All of the necessary detail was both in the ITT and in Bechtel’s bid. </p>

Bechtel wished to win the bid for Old Oak Common; it is a high profile project, the overall project sum was over £1 billion, and the Lump Sum Fee would be very sizeable. However, Bechtel was not prepared to bid for it on the important terms as to budget and programme which HS2 required – the Incentive Target and the Programme Target. It knew, within the terms of the competition, that the qualification it included with the alternative proposed clause 6.2 was a fundamental and central qualification, and changed the commercial risk profile very significantly. It changed the commercial risk to Bechtel, and made it a far more palatable set of contract terms from Bechtel’s commercial point of view. It would not, however, lead to HS2 having the contract with the CP on the terms that HS2 wanted to achieve, set out in the procurement competition. Those involved at Bechtel could not, however, bring themselves to accept that HS2 would actually disqualify Bechtel as a result of this qualification. They simply could not believe it. They found it very frustrating that HS2 held the line on this point. As Mr McMonagle said in cross-examination, the team putting together the bid at Bechtel had worked on this for two years. Those individuals must have wanted to win the bid. Yet this important qualification remained in place.  </p>

Bidding on a project like this is time-consuming, expensive and important, particularly within an organisation such as Bechtel that had expressly chosen not to bid at all for Euston, and to put all its collective effort into winning the OOC contract. Were Bechtel to win, the company would be involved in the project for many years; those involved wanted to win the bid. The exclamation marks and internal communications demonstrate to me that those involved at Bechtel were not finding it amusing, nor were they being flippant. They were, metaphorically, on the edge of their seats, waiting to see what would happen. As Ms Chartouny put it, Bechtel were “finding <span style="color:#00000A">it hard to accept a scenario where we are completely out!” Yet they were consciously running the risk of that scenario due to the inclusion of the qualification to clause 6.2 to reduce Bechtel’s risks in terms of the Incentive and Programme Targets. By Bechtel choosing to run that risk, HS2 became entitled to disqualify the Bechtel bid.</span></p>

How tender documents are to be construed is not something that is approached subjectively; evidence from a tenderer that it subjectively believed a particular provision to have a particular meaning is of no relevance. What matters, as a matter of law, is what those provisions would mean to a RWIND tenderer.

In my judgment, her decision not to cross-examine on so much of the evidential material advanced by Bechtel was justified. Much of the statements were inadmissible; or at the very least, if not technically inadmissible, of such marginal relevance to the issues as to play an extraordinarily limited role in assisting resolution of this case. The Bechtel witnesses could speak to the documents, and did so, and they explained the thinking at Bechtel behind matters such as the qualifications which were included in the Bechtel tender. They could also give their subjective opinion as to the evaluations that were performed by HS2. However, just because a Bechtel witness thinks that the evaluation of a particular question was too low for the Bechtel answer, and/or too high for the BBVS answer, does not advance the case appreciably.

It may also have to explain detailed aspects of the project subject  matter, and technical terms. However, in circumstances where (as here) so much depends on the particular evaluation by the contracting authority of the claimant’s bid – and sometimes (again as here) on the evaluation of the winning tenderer’s bid – a great amount of the documents speak for themselves. The most important areas are usually as follows. The terms of the competition contained in the ITT; the scoring methodology; the detailed contents of the bids themselves; the records of the evaluations and the way that the procurement was conducted. Some of these may be areas where a claimant’s witnesses do not have very much direct knowledge at all, which will inevitably affect the extent of their relevant evidence. A claimant’s witnesses will know about the terms of the ITT, the scoring methodology and the detailed contents of the claimant’s own bid, but absent technical explanation, only the latter of those three aspects of their evidence is likely to require substantial evidence from them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">One major aspect of the challenge brought by Bechtel related to the level of management resources proposed by BBVS, which Bechtel maintain were insufficient. This occupied much of the oral evidence. Not only do Bechtel maintain this, but it is complained that HS2 effectively knew the resources proposed by BBVS were, or were likely to be, insufficient, which is why BBVS was given a score of only “Concerns” for this aspect of Question E001, and a score of “Concerns” for E001 overall. Bechtel maintain that BBVS ought to have been given a score of “Major Concerns”, and also that BBVS should have been disqualified as a result. There is no doubt that BBVS did not do well on this part of the evaluation on Question E001, the title of which was Organisation. This is a conclusion which can perhaps be discerned from the score awarded – that for “Concerns”. This specific issue was further discussed at a meeting on 5 September 2018 held for clarification purposes between HS2 and BBVS. I deal with that meeting below at [260]. </p>

I have chosen the risk description for illustrative purposes.  However, although the award of Concerns has been seized on by Bechtel – and there is no doubt that so far as the MRS is concerned, it was not BBVS’ finest hour – far more than that is required to demonstrate manifest error by the evaluators. Bechtel must show that the assessors were in manifest error in assessing that the risk posed by the resources in BBVS’ MRS constituted a significant risk, and that they should have assessed the risk as substantial. When one considers that assessors are granted a margin of discretion on matters within their subjective professional judgment, it can be seen that the task Bechtel face in so doing is difficult. </p>

He did not moderate, evaluate or score the bids, save for one element of the Behavioural Assessment. His evidence dealt with changes to the Contract Data by HS2, keeping of records by HS2 and the Bechtel qualification. In respect of the latter he described this as a “showstopper” and explained it would have given Bechtel as the CP significant commercial leverage at the Consolidation Point. He also described the qualifications by Bechtel as significant qualifications. This was challenged by Mr Bowsher on the basis of colour coding used in one particular document but Mr Gilbert was clear that it was “flagged red” in some of the presentation documents used in the governance process described in [147] below. Had Bechtel been the winning bidder, HS2 could not have contracted on the basis of the qualification; Mr Gilbert explained that it would have had to be removed. I accept this. </p>

The intention of HS2 in the design of the procurement was to ensure that tenderers could be evaluated on comparable rates across all bids, not resource levels. This was what led to the Staff Rates template and the way that Question J001 was designed. Rates, or the rates card, were to be considered by using a rates template that was in spread sheet form. This was fully explained by Mr Blair. It enabled HS2 to compare rates across the different bids, in isolation from the resource levels bid by each tenderer. I find that this is what the template and Question J001 achieved. </p>

Also, because of the way that Key Performance Indicators or KPIs were awarded, failure to achieve the targets of budget and programme would not entitle the contractor to earn all of the fee. Financial incentives were therefore built into the structure of the contract to encourage the CP in terms of meeting both the Incentive Targets. It was this that the qualification to clause 6.2 of Bechtel was aimed at. I find that the qualification was aimed to avoid or reduce Bechtel’s exposure to the commercial risks associated with meeting the two Incentive Targets.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">He also explained how the Fee Collar was designed and its purpose in avoiding any tenderer submitting a bid with an unsustainably low level of fee, and to ensure that the successful contractor would achieve a fair level of profit. He explained that anything below the Fee Collar of 7% would be considered abnormally low. He also gave evidence about the abnormally low tender assessment which was performed on the only two elements of the bid that a tenderer could reasonably price at the outset, namely rates and the fee (or J001 and J002). Given the nature of the contract, which was of the management contractor type, I find that this is a correct assessment by Mr Blair. All of the other elements of the ultimate overall price that would be paid by HS2 for the construction of the station would be costs incurred by the Works Contractors, and these could not be included in the bid at tender stage, not least because the station was not yet designed. The different bidders were not bidding to construct the station, they were bidding to be the Construction Partner in doing so. Mr Blair also supervised Mr Kwok Chan (also called as a witness before me) who performed an analysis of resource profiles to assist the evaluators of Question E001, which contained the MRS. This analysis included graphs with days per grade, and days per year across the life of the project.  </p>

He took some limited notes but was not the designated note taker, and he did not know if any of the HS2 attendees was given that role. The notes that he made suggested that BBVS may have been intending to offload some of the management resource to the supply chain (which means using personnel at the Works Contractors to do some management) and also that there may have been a confusion. This confusion or mistake was due to the fact that the programme period for Year 1 was 13 months, which meant that BBVS had allocated a greater amount of particular grades’ time to month 1, namely over 100% (the entry was 175%). This is evidently a physical impossibility. It was however capable of ready clarification (the purpose of the meeting) and correction; it was done to reflect the fact that month 1 was longer than an actual month, and nearer two months in duration (it was actually 7 weeks). This certainly does not invalidate the bid by BBVS in some way, or the score. I find that the clarification given was permitted by the ITT, which gave HS2 the right to hold such a meeting.  </p>

The point can be identified and decided by studying the make-up of the ITT, the way that the evaluation scores were arrived at, and in particular studying the working of the rate card (the name given to the template which was derived as part of the function of evaluating Staff Rates in J001).

The contract starting date and Key Date 1 changed, from 11 September 2018 to 25 February 2019, and 19 July 2019 to 9 September 2019, respectively. This change therefore required a revision to BBVS’ tendered MRS. The first GMMP period was changed from a little over 12 months (it had been 12 months and 3 weeks) to 8 months. Mr Chan pro-rated the resources by about one third to do this. He also formatted the GMMP into a printable PDF version, broken down into Annexures 1 and 2 to align with the Contract Data Part 2. </p>

The exercises he had done, in terms of spreadsheets and analysis, were all internally coherent and fully matched his oral evidence, and his explanations of what HS2 sought to achieve. Particularly his evidence in respect of J001 and J002, and how the level of resources had no impact on rates or fee, were of considerable relevance. It also shows that HS2 took substantial steps to deal with the potential for abnormally low tenders. HS2 fully satisfied itself that the BBVS tender was not abnormally low, an evidential conclusion, but one that I accept.  </p>

Certainly an RWIND tenderer would have had to analyse and assess the requirements of all the questions in the tender without the benefit of evidential explanation from Mr Pybus. I accept that the provision of an MRS was not intended to bind the tenderer to a final definitive level of resource that could be employed in the operation of the actual performance of the works and the project. It was plainly intended to allow HS2 to decide how much confidence HS2 had in the structure and logic of the tenderer’s approach to resources, and whether HS2 considered the tenderer had provided appropriate staffing levels for the anticipated tasks across a range of disciplines.

After a detailed moderation discussion on that factor, Mr Botelle accepted as part of that moderation discussion that he had over-emphasised the lack of confidence in his original rationale, and he had considered and described in his individual assessment that there was a "significant delivery risk". That description equated to the reference to "significant" risk referred to in the Scoring Descriptor for "Concerns", rather than "substantial" risk referred to in the Scoring Descriptor for "Major Concerns". Mr Botelle had also decided he had higher or better than ‘no confidence’ (which would or should equate to a Major Concerns score) in the Tenderer’s overall response to Question E001, when considering the question as a whole. The assessors therefore reached a consensus view that the BBVS response to Factor 5 would be scored as "Concerns", as that was the Scoring Descriptor that reflected their joint view. One had moved up; the other had moved down. I accept that evidence, which was consistent with and corroborated that of Mr Avery and Mr Botelle. That was also the score for Question E001 overall. </p>

There is no basis for approaching the initial draft scores reached individually in this way, or granting them this elevated status.

They were not circulated amongst the attendees after the meeting (whether for correction, comment or approval) either, another customary feature of minutes of most meetings. When, in February 2019, it was realised within HS2 that no minutes of the meeting of 5 September 2018 had been kept – something which I find remarkable, in terms of the length of time it took HS2 to realise this – two documents were typed up and used as minutes. These were the agenda for the meeting (also referred to as a script, in that it preceded the meeting and set out what points were to be covered by the HS2 attendees) and parts of Ms Serrelli’s notes. Mr Pybus’ notes were not used, and this reinforces my conclusion that he was never tasked with keeping minutes. His notes were not minutes, and never intended to be.

This part of the case involves Bechtel finding a weakness in one part of the bid of BBVS – namely the “Concerns” awarded due to the MRS – and maintaining that weakness, or low score, ought to have been reflected across and into other scores awarded to BBVS on other questions in the Technical Envelope. I reject that argument, for which there is no proper basis. Mr New also rejected the approach contended for in Annex 3 of the Re-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim which was a comparative exercise, subjectively seeking to demonstrate that Bechtel’s bid was better than that of BBVS on certain questions, and using this to demonstrate that the scores ought to be changed.

Nor is there any breach of the obligations of equal treatment or transparency in the way these answers were scored by Mr New.  </p>

He has 18 years of experience in the industry and joined HS2 in March 2017, although he has been working on the project since 2012. He is a Senior Project Manager and selected the team members to be assessors on all the technical questions in the Technical Envelope which included E001 to E010 and I001. He also was the assessor himself on some of them. Mr Botelle was his line manager. In terms of those the subject of these proceedings, he was an assessor for E001, E002, E004, E005 and E006. He and Mr Botelle were the two personnel who assessed E001 jointly. Mr Avery performed these assessments in the sequence E002 to E006, and then E001, as this was the order in which the moderation meetings were timetabled to take place.  </p>

Exceptions were E006 and E001 where access to E005 was provided to check one of the sub-factors. Actually, some factors expressly referred to other questions, but these were isolated. As the co-assessor with Mr Botelle for Question E001 (which included the MRS) he had jointly awarded the score of Concerns given to BBVS. So far as this question was concerned, he considered the resources proposed by BBVS in the MRS were, as he put it, “very light” but not in all disciplines, predominantly in the areas of Project and Commercial.  </p>

He also noticed and identified that 175% had been applied to the core hours for the first month for some categories; he concluded this was an error. His initial view on Question E001 was one of “Moderate Confidence” in his draft score but when he considered the factors and scoring descriptors in moderation he concluded his initial score should have been “Minor Concerns”. Mr Botelle had scored it “Major Concerns” at the individual draft stage, and at moderation they discussed and agreed the final consensus score which was “Concerns”. His explanation of the process and the meeting was thorough and credible, and I accept it. I also find that this is an example of how two assessors would be expected to reach a single joint score; they might (and in this instance, did), individually, have each awarded different scores to one another, but those initial scores were simply drafts. In discussing the answers together in moderation, the intention was that the two assessors would arrive at a single score reached consensually. That this may be (and in this instance, was) different from the initial draft scores does not, in my judgment, matter. It certainly cannot be relied upon to demonstrate any manifest errors in evaluation. </p>

They could deliver, especially at the beginning, as they have actually proved to have done so.

This was because of a lack of significant detail on Factor 4. His explanation was that the initial assessments were only draft scores; and the scoring was not an average of the scores for each factor. The assessors were using their judgment, collectively, when deciding the final consensus score, based on their view of the different factors, and this might be different to those initially considered. Indeed, the final score <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> different. Bechtel expressed themselves, through Mr Bowsher, at being “puzzled” as to why the final score was only “Moderate Confidence”. However, Mr Steward showed that the Bechtel response did lack significant detail on factor 4, which related to maintenance, testing and handover, and as he expressed it this “had quite an impact on the whole of the technical assurance for” that particular question.

He accepted that the low score for E001 meant there was a significant risk in terms of resources. It was put to him that it was a “dramatic conclusion” to reach without coming back to the people who had reached that conclusion (the assessors) but he accepted there was nothing factually incorrect about that and said “it obviously got a low score. We’ve all scored it low, so yes”. I find that it is not “a dramatic conclusion” for the author of that report to have reached on the resources proposed by BBVS without consulting the assessors of E001. It is the sort of conclusion that logically flows from the award of a score of “Concerns”, and what that means in terms of the level of risk to HS2 evaluated by the assessors. It must however be remembered that the score of Concerns was in relation to one part of the Technical Envelope, and provided the score was awarded without manifest error, BBVS was entitled to be treated in accordance with the terms of the ITT. </p>

It was just effectively moving working time and parallel working, etc. What was made clear, and I think it was Jon Wagstaff who reiterated it, is that HS2 might come back and ask them to do a submission, a detailed submission, but there was no requirement for it in the meeting. I think if you go to the previous document we were looking at, I think one of the items, it just says: "We may require you to put in a submission."  I don't think we ever asked for that submission.”</span>

However, the terms of the ITT permitted HS2 to seek clarification in this way, and it did so. Mr Botelle explained that his concerns were resolved in his mind at moderation. He said “that was the process, and that was made very clear to me; that the moderation was the closure of that assessment process”. A different way of expressing this is to state that nothing that took place at the meeting changed the assessments made by the assessors, or the scores. Mr Botelle said that the meeting “wasn’t to go over my evaluation and revisit the moderation, and that was made very clear to me by the procurement team in advance of this meeting. It was completely made clear that that was not to be picked up by this meeting”. He said that this justified his initial view, which was to ask why it was even necessary for him to attend.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It was put to him, somewhat critically, that he was “happy to proceed with the MRS that you had criticised” in terms of how matters proceeded after this meeting. However, in my judgment, this avenue of attack is misconceived. It is to elide two completely different things. The first is the evaluation of each of the different tenders, treating them all equally and transparently, following assessments across a wide range of different Questions, both technical and commercial, to arrive at the most economically advantageous tender. It was entirely possible for different assessors to be critical of elements of any bid, given the scoring matrix, yet that bidder win the competition overall. The second is Mr Botelle’s subjective views, whatever they might be, as to sufficiency of resources or BBVS’ likely performance once the contract was awarded and underway. Subjective views of that nature have no place in second-guessing, or overturning, the outcome of an evaluation once it is completed. BBVS had won the competition. The clarification sought by HS2 at the meeting of 5 September 2018 was for precisely that purpose – to clarify. It was not to entitle or oblige HS2 to go back and change the assessments, or the scores that had been finalised. Indeed, to have done so would have been potentially unlawful. As Mr </p>

It would have been entirely wrong, and unlawful, for HS2 to have interfered with the outcome of the competition because BBVS had been awarded a score of “Concerns” on E001, or because the assessors concluded that the MRS presented a risk to HS2, provided the assessments, the score, and the overall result of the competition were reached without manifest error. Even had Mr Botelle, after the assessment had been completed and the score finalised and signed off, been troubled by a potential lack of resources, there was no scope for Mr Botelle to have reconsidered the scoring methodology in the ITT, and to have asked internally “ought we to have made sufficiency of resources a pass/fail?”. Any lack of confidence Mr Botelle had regarding resources was to be evaluated in the score for E001. The competition could have been designed to make adequacy of resources a simple “pass/fail” originally, and had that been done, all the tenderers would have known in advance of submitting their bids how important sufficiency of resources was to be in the evaluation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">He explained that he “considered the nature of Bechtel’s qualifications to be fundamental”. Because HS2 must deliver the stations on time and within budget, it was essential that the Incentive Target was fixed. He explained his understanding of the Bechtel qualification to clause 6.2, which was that the tenderer would be given the option of not agreeing the Incentive Target at the time of consolidation (the Consolidation Point) and – as he put it – “to force a termination” if HS2 was not prepared to amend the Incentive Target. This went to the heart of the consolidation mechanism. He explained that HS2 could not possibly accept this as it would remove the commercial bargaining position otherwise available to HS2 concerning the level of the Incentive Target. It would also risk delays if termination did occur, because HS2 would have to conduct another procurement competition to find an entity to replace the Construction Partner for all the works from the Consolidation Point onwards. I consider the effect of the clause 6.2 qualification further in the section of the judgment “Qualifications”, but Mr Poole is broadly correct in terms of this summary of the effect of the qualification. As might be expected of organisations as commercially developed and well-advised as Bechtel and HS2, those witnesses who gave evidence of their understanding of the effect of the qualification and the new proposed clause 6.2 correctly understood its impact.  </p>

There was no basis for that suggestion; this was simply a threat by Bechtel.

It was substantial, and central to the commercial strategy and risk profile of the whole of the projects for both stations to have them constructed to the Incentive Targets. It was a fundamental requirement of the CP for each station that they accepted this. Equally, HS2 knew that formally disqualifying Bechtel would be troublesome, and may well lead to litigation, further expense and delay. There was simply no reason to do any of that if, in any event, Bechtel had not won the competition. HS2 therefore did not do so.  </p>

The latter was Work Package Strategy or WPS, and in E001 BBVS had stated that its MRS was aligned to the WPS. No specific package was identified by BBVS and so Mr Reading concluded that he could not positively identify this as an alignment.

This exercise done by Mr Reading was to assess whether the resources tendered by BBVS in the tender MRS had been increased. He concluded that 17 of the 20 disciplines in the later versions of the MRS were comparable with the tender version. The other three would require a far more complicated exercise for Mr Reading to be able to come to a conclusion. I accept his evidence on this comparison exercise, but it is of marginal relevance. What is of direct relevance is not whether BBVS have subsequently increased any of its resources; it is whether the evaluations conducted by HS2, including the factor in E001 that included the MRS, were assessed absent manifest error or other breaches of obligation. Part of Bechtel’s case in the proceedings was aimed at demonstrating that the MRS submitted by BBVS contained inadequate resources.

There is no reason why the concerns expressed by Mr Botelle when assessing E001, relating as they did to the MRS and to BBVS’ tendered resource, should have been communicated to Ms Olson, or if they were, why they should have been taken into account when assessing E010. To have done so would, in my judgment, have been to act in error; it would also have involved evaluating the answer to E010 in a way other than set out in Appendix C. Ms Olson demonstrated very clearly that she had assessed E010 correctly, and without error, still less manifest error. The same conclusion arises in respect of I001, which she assessed with Mr Culver, the Head of Commercial for OOC. </p>

Given that this is a question for the court, not for a witness, and also given that a witness statement should be in a witness’ own words and not deal with legal issues, this sentence plainly should not have been included in her witness statement. No witness has any personal knowledge of the margin of discretion available to their own actions or judgments. Solicitors drafting witness statements need to pay proper attention to the rules concerning how these important documents are prepared. However, this does not affect my view of Ms Olson’s evidence, or my conclusion that Bechtel were unable to demonstrate any error in assessment by her, or any breach of the other obligations upon HS2. </p>

The conclusion as to the level of detail that was missing is obviously a matter of professional judgment, in respect of which the assessor is given a margin of discretion. The court, in this case and on this evidence, is in no position to conclude that the assessors were in manifest error in concluding that the degree of detail that was missing ought to have been characterised as “significant”. There was no error shown by Bechtel in the challenge to this witness. The court is in no position to interfere with the final conclusion reached by the two assessors, after discussion by them over a number of hours, challenging one another and exploring their different points of view to arrive at a consensus score. Mr Pang said in re-examination that the whole exercise on E009 was done over two days. Further, the questioning in cross-examination also has, implicit within it, the flawed premise that an individual draft score is to be equated with a final consensus score. There were two assessors for a reason; in this case their expertise was not the same, and their skills complemented one another. Mr Pang started with higher draft scores and moved down; Mr Lalaurette started with lower draft scores and moved up. They arrived at a joint final score different to the ones they started with at the draft stage. This is a good example of the process of moderation working as it was intended to, in my judgment. </p>

None of the factors in E010 related to level of resources. That was the correct approach by Mr Pang, given the way the scoring was explained in the ITT. The MRS was not part of E010 and adequacy of resources was not a Factor for that Question.

For example, delays could be caused to works that have to be done during Christmas possession, what is also sometimes called disruptive possession. Certain critical works can only be done over the Christmas period, when continuous operation time is needed and the lines that are otherwise active can be closed for longer periods. If one Christmas period was missed due to a delay of a few weeks, the works would have to be done in the next Christmas period, one year later.

It is not necessary to provide an exhaustive list of what those reasons might be. As has been seen, on contract award alone, all that was required to cause delay was the issue of proceedings challenging the result of the procurement, which would (and in this case did) lead to the automatic suspension causing delay. Although such suspensions can be lifted by agreement or by court order, each of those steps take time to accomplish.

However, plainly the hypothetical scenario shown in the question and answer at [228] above is precisely that – entirely hypothetical. Of course, different dates could have been included in the ITT, and those dates would have been taken account of by the bidders in their tenders. This is, however, irrelevant. The issue is whether by changing the dates HS2 was in some way acting contrary to the terms of the procurement, or advantaging the winner bidder, or disadvantaging Bechtel, or placing a contract for such a different project that the procurement award was in breach of the regulations. Given the terms of the ITT and the nature of the project, none of these consequences arise. Mr Pang was entirely correct in his answer; had the new dates been known about at tender stage, those were the dates that the bidders would have used. But they were not known until later, so they were not used at tender stage. The dates upon which Mr Bowsher concentrated, namely those of February 2019, were not, in any event, the ones used in the contract because these dates changed again, due to the delay caused by the automatic suspension. However, the point about their lack of relevance remains a valid one. None of the evidence about the changes to any of the dates advances Bechtel’s case.  </p>

This part of his evidence did not seem to be of any relevance, but given it was elicited in cross-examination and not in his witness statement, this is not a criticism of Mr Rooke. He was also asked about documents that recorded reviewing the draft rationale by assessors before moderations took place. He rejected any suggestion that he was trying to influence assessors, and I accept his evidence. The document demonstrated that assessors’ attention had been drawn in some instances back to the scoring descriptors. That does not constitute interference with the assessment or the evaluation, in my judgment.   </p>

Those involved at HS2 also expected Bechtel to “react badly” to such a decision. By reacting badly, I interpret that to mean potentially the issue of legal proceedings. This would lead to distraction from the process of finalising the procurement and also potentially increase costs, which would have to be met from the public purse. She also said that if Bechtel had won the evaluation, and there had been a second placed bidder without qualifications, HS2 would have awarded the contract, not to Bechtel, but to that second placed bidder, due to the qualifications issue.  </p>

Her analysis of the options that would have been available at the Consolidation Point to HS2 under the new clause 6.2 is also correct, although terminating the contract with Bechtel at that point would essentially constitute no option at all.  Her explanation as to the potential or likely consequences had a disqualification ultimatum been issued by HS2 to Bechtel are also, in my judgment, correct. HS2 had requested these be withdrawn and Bechtel would not do so. Issuing an ultimatum to Bechtel when BBVS was the winning bidder was not necessary. On the balance of probabilities, Bechtel would have issued legal proceedings had such an ultimatum been issued. This would have caused extra expense to HS2 and delay.  </p>

I accept that is the correct analysis. I also consider that there was no valid reason why HS2 should agree to such a meeting.

She said clarification was given by BBVS about resources, which could also be described as reassurance, the word used in the report prepared for RP2, and she said there was nothing further dealt with in the meeting of 5 September 2018 than what was included in the agenda, the script for the meeting (pre-prepared at HS2) and Mr Pybus’ notes. She said it had been agreed beforehand that Mr Pybus would keep the notes of the meeting. She had prepared a document herself of matters upon which she sought legal advice, but she did not keep a note of the meeting in that document, it merely happened to be prepared on the evening of the same day as the meeting.

The only part of her evidence that I do not accept is her description of his notes. I accept that it was agreed Mr Pybus would keep notes, but I do not accept that it was agreed Mr Pybus would keep minutes of the meeting. The fact that Mr Pybus’ notes were not used to create the minutes in February 2019 is further evidence of this. In my judgment, nobody was tasked with keeping minutes of the meeting.

Their explanations for their final scores were recorded, and the moderation minutes were reviewed by the moderation assurance team. Mr Bowsher QC for Bechtel cross-examined all the HS2 witnesses closely, and did his best to try and identify areas, in respect of many of the factors that underlay each question, where the assessors had fallen into error. He also attempted to demonstrate interference by the moderators with the assessors and their scoring, and failures by the assessors properly to score the answers both of BBVS and Bechtel, and also alleged failures in explanation for the final scores in the minutes.

It leads to legal arguments being advanced by Bechtel from within an evidential vacuum. The court will not interfere if there are simply errors in evaluation; they must be manifest errors. This is a high bar, as has been said many times. An evaluator has a margin of discretion in any event, but manifest error has a broad equivalent of irrationality.

Further, there was no lack of equal treatment or lack of transparency either.

Mr Blair said that the meeting for Old Oak Common was the one that took place in the morning and lasted a little over one hour (he corrected this, in chief, from the original period stated in his witness statement of two hours). This was a curious correction, given in crossexamination he would, from time to time, state that his memory of the meeting did not extend to certain matters he was being asked about. In my judgment, the actual duration of a meeting that took place two years ago is less likely to be memorable than what was discussed. Further, he seemed when he drafted his witness statement to be clear that it took two hours, which leads one to wonder how his recollection on this subject could suddenly become clearer just before the trial, and when the meeting was further in the past than it was when he prepared his statement. However, it may be that his statement was drafted by reference to the agenda, which stated that the time window for the meeting was to be two hours. In any event, I find that this minor correction does not matter, and certainly does not affect my view of him as a witness.  </p>

There was also a discussion about the fact that the tendered MRS had indicated that certain staff would be operating at 175% utilisation for the first month of the Contract. The explanation for this was not that BBVS intended to utilise the time of any individual team member 175%, as seemed to be suggested in the MRS. The reason for it was that month 1 of the first GMMP period was to cover a period of 7 weeks, as “Year 1” appeared to be 57 weeks long. Month 1 was therefore longer than one month. This was, therefore, an error in the MRS document; although perhaps a more accurate way of expressing it was that this was an attempt by BBVS to deal with the month 1 issue by inserting 175%, which was the error. Regardless of how it is expressed, this was explained by BBVS in the meeting and the explanation was accepted by HS2. “Year 1” in the ITT was indeed longer than 52 weeks; and month 1 was longer than one month. </p>

The reassurances that were provided by BBVS were of a post-tender clarification kind that were expressly permitted by the ITT, and were also consistent with the principle of equal treatment. In my judgment, there is no basis for any suggestion that they were impermissible material changes (or promises to make such changes), or that HS2 was in breach of its duties of equal treatment and transparency, or manifestly erroneous, in respect of them. </p>

Although less severe than “a substantial risk to HS2”, which would have led to an award of “Major Concerns”, “significant” still represents a large risk.

This is a telling omission. If minutes had been taken and lost I would have expected to be told this in no uncertain terms. The other alternative explanations are that there are minutes but that as these undermine DRD’s defence they have not been disclosed.

Bechtel submitted that there were two failures in respect of this lack of minutes. Firstly, this constituted a breach of the obligation of transparency. Secondly, that “a substantive and significant amendment” was made to the MRS tendered by BBVS at the meeting. This submission was made in paragraph 168 of Bechtel’s written opening submissions for the trial. It was submitted that an inference could be drawn from other documents (such as the presentation at RP2) that “BBVS’ resource levels <span style="text-decoration:underline">would need to be</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">would be</span>, amended at a future date, but that it was considered too risky to formalise those amendments prior to announcement of the Preferred Bidder/Contract award” </p>

Firstly, there is no evidence to support these contended-for inferences. HS2 scored Question E001 which included the MRS tendered by BBVS without manifest error. There were obviously concerns at HS2 about BBVS’ intended resource in the MRS. This is what led to the score of “Concerns”. It was sensible to seek clarification in respect of resources, and that was obtained. I find that the clarification that was sought and provided was entirely proper, and permitted within the terms of the ITT. </p>

Secondly, by the point of contract award, HS2 had also issued the Revised Contract Data Part One. This of necessity required amendment to the MRS. I find that nothing that occurred at the meeting of 5 September 2018 affected the outcome of the competition. I also find that, although it is a technical breach of the obligation of transparency that there were no comprehensive minutes kept of that meeting, the breach is in the circumstances a technical breach only, if not <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>, and had no causative effect.  </p>

In my judgment there is a distinction to be drawn between records that show how the scores were reached, and other records of what occurred during the procurement competition as a whole. There is also a distinction to be made between an isolated failure in respect of one set of minutes at one single meeting (such as here), and a widespread failure of the type considered in the  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Lancashire Care NHS Trust </span>case.  </p>

In my judgment, that would be to impose a counsel of perfection upon contracting authorities and utilities of a type that the Regulations do not require, which is wholly unjustified and which has no proper juridical basis. Such a disproportionate result would follow, on Bechtel’s case, even if, after a full trial and hearing oral evidence from multiple witnesses about that meeting, the court were satisfied (as I am) that nothing had occurred at that meeting which was untoward or in breach of any of the regulations, or in breach of any of the relevant principles, or affected the outcome of the competition. In my judgment, there is no authority for such a draconian result flowing from inadequate minutes of the meeting of 5 September 2018.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In that case, the lack of records went to the award of the scores themselves, not to the type of minutes kept of a single meeting held afterwards. In that case, the available records were insufficient to enable the court to discharge its supervisory function. Here, the absence of minutes of the meeting of 5 September 2018 is of a wholly different character. There is an agenda for that meeting, and both Mr Blair and Mr Pybus took notes, of a kind. The absence of proper minutes has made the court’s task more lengthy in deciding what took place, but it is not correct to portray it as preventing the court from exercising its supervisory function. I am content that I have been able to do so, and having heard evidence, I find that no breaches of obligation by HS2 took place in the meeting itself. The rather paltry minutes do not go to diminish the proper records that are available of the evaluation, assessment and moderation, and the sufficient recording and explanation of the scores awarded. The meeting of 5 September 2018 did not affect the scores; it did not affect the outcome of the procurement. It did not last long – about, or slightly less than, one hour – and the HS2 personnel collectively were very careful in terms of what was said. I have heard substantial evidence about the meeting. The single failure is one of keeping proper minutes of the meeting. In my judgment, the failure of HS2 properly to minute that meeting does not entitle Bechtel to any redress, although it may have made these proceedings longer and more expensive than would otherwise have been the case. It may be that it is necessary to consider this further at the costs stage of this liability trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Firstly, however, it is helpful to set these legal matters in their factual context. There is a substantial focus by Bechtel upon the way in which HS2 considered the MRS, for which BBVS was given a score of Concerns in the evaluation. The MRS deals with tendered management resources, and Bechtel relies upon the lack of confidence on the part of the HS2 assessors concerning BBVS’ answer to Question E001. There was some doubt about the adequacy of some of the resources proposed by BBVS in the MRS and whether these would be sufficient. It is this that resulted in a score of Concerns for BBVS for that Question. These points were pursued by HS2 at the meeting of 5 September 2018, in the sense that BBVS were asked for clarification of their resources, and this was provided. BBVS was also asked about what appeared to be (and in fact was) a mistake for the first period, when the MRS had shown a figure of 175% of particular individuals’ times that had been allocated to the project. This was explicable because Year 1 was actually longer than one year, and so period 1 was longer than one month (it was about 7 weeks). BBVS had attempted to deal with this by including the higher percentage of 175% (evidently higher than 100%) for the time of certain individuals, to reflect the fact that these resources would be occupied on the project for longer than one month during period 1. Without an explanation, a figure for deployment that is in excess of 100% would seem to represent a physical impossibility, which is why an explanation was sought by HS2, and then provided by BBVS.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Bechtel, in these proceedings, criticises the way that HS2 considered at the time, and dealt with, the resources proposed by BBVS. This argument is advanced by Bechtel through the medium of a breach of the obligation of good administration. It must be recognised that HS2 did conclude, in the evaluation, that the resources contained in the MRS put forward by BBVS were not adequate. The assessors had “very low confidence” in the MRS, which is why BBVS was given a score of “Concerns”. It is how HS2 then acted upon, or dealt with, that view of the BBVS resources that is criticised by Bechtel. For example, at paragraph 110 of its Closing Submissions, Bechtel states: </p>

That latter requirement can be put to one side here, as there is no suggestion of any point arising on delay. The other two are included, foursquare, within other obligations that are expressly included in the Regulations, namely that of equal treatment. Impartiality and fairness are synonymous with equal treatment, in my judgment. Yet further, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Healthcare at Home v Common Services Agency</span> [2014] UKSC 49, Article 41 of Directive 2004/18 was considered, and the Supreme Court, in analysing the duties upon contracting authorities, did not identify an obligation of good administration.

For example, at [5], Lord Reed JSC (giving the judgment with which the other members of the Supreme Court agreed) said “the RWIND tenderer, as he has been referred to in these proceedings, was born in Luxembourg” and then went on to consider the scope of obligations arising from the EU in some detail.

Such discretion would usually be contained in express terms of the ITT in any event, but regardless of that, it means that in order to succeed, Bechtel would not only have to show that HS2 were wrong to have awarded BBVS the contract (alternatively, were wrong to decide not to abandon the competition, which may amount to the same thing) but that this decision must have been an improper exercise of discretion. In other words, Bechtel must show that it was outside the range of decisions properly open to HS2 as an exercise of discretion.

The role of the court is not to second-guess how the project should be resourced; nor is it to consider whether a score of Concerns should go wider than its impact on the score in the evaluation, such that it ought to have led “any suitably senior and accountable individual within HS2” to consider whether to abandon the competition; or for the court to consider whether HS2 was in manifest error by failing </p>

Although the evaluators of E001 had some doubts about the level of resource in the MRS submitted by BBVS, there is no basis for those doubts to be elevated into serious concerns that BBVS would not be able to perform its role in the project adequately. The score of Concerns for BBVS on E001 was reached without manifest error, and there is no scope for changing that score. A single score of Concerns does not, under the terms of the ITT, require HS2 to act in the way contended for by Bechtel.

The council exercised a discretionary power of selection in the way that the tenders were assessed (by a consulting engineer) that resulted in the tenderer with the “lowest price” not being awarded the contract, due to the consideration of what would be the “likely ultimate cost” (the phrase used at [42] of the Opinion of Advocate-General Jacobs). The court held that the council was entitled to award the tender on the basis of the lowest ultimate cost, as long as equal treatment of tenderers had been ensured, and that pre-supposed that the transparency and objectivity of the procedure had been guaranteed.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, HS2 has complied with its obligation in this case. I would add one further observation, which has not driven any of my findings, but is worth recording nonetheless. The evidence demonstrates that HS2 were acutely aware, when preparing for this procurement competition, of the risk of a challenge from an unsuccessful bidder. The training materials demonstrate that the case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Energy Solutions v Nuclear Decommissioning Agency </span>was not only at the forefront of the minds of those designing the training, but used as a specific example of ways in which procurement competitions could go wrong. Specific deficiencies in the evaluation in that case (a substantial procurement for a contract worth £4 billion for decommissioning Magnox nuclear reactors and associated facilities) had been identified, and HS2 wished to avoid repeating those mistakes. In other words, lessons had been learned. The training in this procurement for Euston and Old Oak Common appears to have been very thorough, and the evaluation was designed comprehensively to be entirely fair. Two assessors reached a score through consensus, and in a process of moderation, all of which was recorded. Bechtel complain in their written Closing Submissions that “The Moderation Minutes generally do not record what has been said by Moderators”. This is not required. Short of tape-recording every hour of moderation – which would be entirely disproportionate – minutes of moderation will inevitably not amount to a verbatim note. But no contracting authority is required to take a verbatim note of all such moderation and evaluation sessions. There must be a sensible limit to what is required of contracting authorities in terms of recording its evaluations. The court’s role is one of supervisory jurisdiction, not one of micro-managing.  </p>

Thus it is suggested, for example, that this principle justifies an approach to the concept of a complete tender in competitive dialogue which allows a reasonable degree of detail to be filled in after choosing the winner of the procedure: such an approach can provide adequately for transparency and equal treatment whilst at the same time avoiding unnecessary procedural costs which will not contribute to those goals but which could prejudice other national and EU interests.” </span>(emphasis added)  </p>

The principle of proportionality means a sensible balance, and limit, is what is required. In reality, I consider that with the exception of the records of the meeting of 5 September 2018 (which I have dealt with at [260] above), there is nothing in the criticism by Bechtel of the HS2 record-keeping in this procurement. In any event, as I have explained, the unsatisfactory records of that single meeting do not have any effect upon the outcome of the competition, and they do not have any effect upon the outcome of this liability trial.  </p>

At that point, the Construction Partner was originally intended to issue a Verification Report to the Project Manager showing that the Accepted Final PWDD Forecast would be equal to, or less than, the Incentive Target. HS2 would accept that, and the Project Manager would issue a Consolidation Notice and the Project would proceed. However, even if the Contractor did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> issue such a report – in other words, if the Contractor was not prepared to verify that the Project could be constructed for the Incentive Target of £1.054 billion -  then the Project Manager could be instructed to issue such a notice and the works would continue. In very brief terms therefore, the original terms in the tender would lead to a contract whereby (through the HS2 version of clause 6.2 in the procurement documents) the winning bidder would be agreeing with HS2 that the Project could be built for £1.054 billion, and to the Programme Target, or at the very least the winning bidder, would be agreeing to bear some commercial risk that these targets could not be met. Therefore, if the cost ended up at being well in excess of £1.054 billion, the Contractor would be paid the cost above the Incentive Target for its management resources, but would receive no further fee uplift (thus diluting the fee in percentage terms) and would also suffer financially through the imposition of KPIs.  </p>

The new Bechtel clause 6.2 would operate in such a way that at the Consolidation Point, if Bechtel was not prepared to issue a Verification Report, HS2 and the Project Manager had a choice. They could either agree a Deed of Variation with Bechtel, and amend those parts of the contract which included the original Incentive Target and Programme Target, and the impact on Bechtel’s fee, replacing them with other terms that would have to be agreed with Bechtel at that stage. Alternatively, HS2 would have a different course of action available - HS2 could terminate the contract with Bechtel. This would mean having to re-procure the remainder of the contract to find a new CP to undertake that function for the construction of the station. A stark way of putting this is that Bechtel’s qualification would, if accepted, lead to the formation of a contract with HS2 whereby no risk (or extremely little risk) would be borne by Bechtel that Old Oak Common Station could not be built for £1.054 billion. If it could not, Bechtel would renegotiate its fee, or have its contract terminated and leave the project. Bechtel would have all the commercial leverage in renegotiating its fee; if agreement </p>

It could either proceed with Bechtel, but only on commercial terms that it would have to agree with Bechtel at that point in the project (which would already be underway), or it could terminate Bechtel’s agreement and re-procure the project, but from the Consolidation Point. That latter choice would, in my judgment, effectively be no real choice at all at that stage in the project. The consequences of such a termination would be extraordinarily onerous for HS2. It would have to re-tender the partially performed project, going through another procurement exercise, but at a later stage, as the project would have been underway for some time. It would have lost entirely (or substantially) its ability to bring the project to completion within the Incentive Target of £1.054 billion (and within the Programme Target too). It would have no commercial leverage in that subsequent procurement competition. Partially performed projects are rarely attractive to other bidders. Further – and this is stating the obvious - there would be the most extraordinary public and political fall-out. For HS2 to terminate a contract with its Construction Partner partially through the programme to construct only one of the two London HS2 stations would be an alternative so unpalatable, as to constitute no realistic alternative at all.  </p>

That would not be the only way in which the OOC and Euston projects would then be out of step with one another. The programme for OOC would have to include a period for potential re-procurement at the Consolidation Point. The work on the two stations would thereafter, potentially, be non-aligned in programme terms. Further, the period for re-procurement would be uncertain; if a losing bidder issued proceedings challenging the outcome of that later competition, the automatic suspension would be imposed, again. </p>

All of them readily apply to the situation in which HS2 would find itself at the Consolidation Point, were it to accept the qualification proposed by Bechtel to clause 6.2. However, the ITT and contract terms as designed by HS2 did not contain such a dreadful future. That alternative scenario would only come to pass were HS2 to contract with Bechtel on the basis of its qualification to clause 6.2. HS2 was not prepared to accept these qualifications, and asked Bechtel to withdraw them on a number of occasions through the Bravo portal. On each occasion Bechtel would not do so. Although Bechtel was careful never expressly to refuse to withdraw them, and answered each such request by HS2 with its own counter-request for a meeting, the effect was the same. Following each request by HS2 to withdraw the qualifications, the qualifications by Bechtel remained.  </p>

She explained that doing so would potentially incur large legal fees as Bechtel may challenge such a decision in court, a cost on the public purse that could be avoided. I accept that. She also gave evidence that had Bechtel won the competition, Bechtel <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> have been disqualified. I accept that evidence too. Mr McMonagle for Bechtel explained why the qualification had been included in the tender, and also why Bechtel desired to have a meeting with HS2. That explanation made commercial sense (when looked at solely from Bechtel’s point of view), and I accept it was an explanation that those at Bechtel who gave evidence before me believed justified their stance on this issue at the time. However, the issue of qualifications is not to be decided on whether there was subjective justification for certain commercial decisions taken within Bechtel. The issue is the terms of the ITT dealing with qualifications, the type of qualification proposed, whether it would have exposed HS2 to significantly greater risk, and whether HS2 would have been entitled to disqualify Bechtel. I find that it would have exposed HS2 to significantly greater risk. It would have also distorted competition between bidders, as not all the other bidders had such qualifications. </p>

In my judgment it is a general right which HS2 retained throughout the procurement. HS2 sought to have Bechtel withdraw the qualification – on a number of occasions - and this did not result in it being withdrawn. HS2 therefore retained that right to reject. The qualification to clause 6.2 plainly exposed HS2 to significantly greater risk. It was also so fundamental that it distorted the principles of equal treatment and fairness between the other tenderers. I consider that the right HS2 had survives, notwithstanding the failure to issue a Withdrawal Ultimatum, and HS2 are entitled to rely upon this right in these proceedings. I find that the qualifications proposed by Bechtel were commercially unacceptable to HS2 for entirely valid reasons, and fall within the terms of this right. HS2 acquired the right to disqualify Bechtel as a result of the latter’s qualification to clause 6.2. HS2’s failure to issue a Withdrawal Ultimatum does not lead to it losing its right to reject.  </p>

The Claimant would thereafter have had carefully to consider whether to maintain or withdraw its Qualifications or adjust its price, including by going through the appropriate internal governance. As no Adjustment or Withdrawal Ultimatum was ever issued, the outcome of that process is hypothetical”. It is correct to identify that as hypothetical. However, I have found that Bechtel was not the winning bidder, but in any event no meeting would have occurred. Even if it had, there would have been no “mutually acceptable outcome” unless Bechtel were prepared to withdraw the qualification.

Bechtel is not entitled to any finding that it was disadvantaged in any way whatsoever by reason of HS2 not issuing such an ultimatum. Firstly, there is no evidence to justify such a finding on the facts; all the evidence points the other way. Such evidence as exists is contrary to Bechtel ever being prepared to withdraw the qualification. Bechtel maintained the qualification, even though asked several times to withdraw it: there is nothing to suggest that position would have ever changed.  Secondly, I find that there is nothing in the ITT itself which restricts HS2’s rights in this way in any event.

Given most communications are done electronically rather than by post, in the vast majority of cases the date of the standstill letter will be the date of communication to the economic operator. This is a short period and deliberately so; the rationale for it is that the potential for disruption to the workings of the economy are such that challenges to procurement decisions need to be brought speedily.  </p>

However, Annex 3 to the Amended Particulars of Claim contains allegations about Bechtel’s own scores and also those of BBVS, but as a comparative exercise between the two. The former are said to be too low, and the latter too high, by relation one to another, given the content of the answers in each bid, and the scores are therefore said to be inconsistent; this is put as a breach of equal treatment. So far as the allegations about the Bechtel scores are concerned, however, HS2 contends there was sufficient information contained in the standstill letter about those scores, and the reasons for them, for Bechtel to have known that it had grounds to bring a claim on the three Technical Questions concerned. It did not do so in the original Particulars of Claim, and HS2 maintains that it ought to have done, and as a result, HS2 submits that these claims are timebarred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the relevant factors that led to the Bechtel scores were concerned, Bechtel knew about these from the standstill letter. For Question E004, Mr Watson confirmed that he knew from the standstill letter that Bechtel was considered by HS2 to have omitted key dates in its tender. For E007, Mr Watson accepted that he knew from the standstill letter that the reasons for the score of Moderate Confidence awarded for Question E007 was that Bechtel had not proposed any form of contract for some of the specific packages nor explained in sufficient detail the contracting approach. Finally, in respect of E009, although Mr Watson maintained that the score was wrong, he accepted that he was aware of the reason for the score of Good Confidence at the standstill stage. These were not concessions or answers in cross-examination that were at odds with the documents; it could readily be seen, from comparing the material sent to Bechtel by HS2 with the standstill letter, that this was the case for each of these three questions. However, that misses the substance of Bechtel’s complaints in Annex 3. Its complaint is that its response to E007 (as an example) was better than the response by BBVS to the same question, and for that reason the score it was given is erroneous. Clearly, the tender response by BBVS is required in order to make that comparison. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The answer to HS2’s limitation argument is that the BBVS tender was – as Bechtel put it - “an essential item of information to enable” these points to be pleaded; that is the term used in paragraph 205 of its Opening Submissions, and the point is repeated in its Closing Submissions. Although Mr Watson’s evidence and answers about having the moderation for BBVS’s score is not addressed in those submissions, I accept that absent the BBVS tender itself, the Annex 3 exercise (which concerns the comparison exercise) could not have been done. Essentially, the Annex 3 exercise maintains that there was an inconsistent approach taken by HS2 to the content of the Bechtel answers and those provided by BBVS. Given Bechtel did not have the content of the BBVS answers when it received the standstill letter, and did not obtain the BBVS tender until disclosure was given, it is difficult to see how Bechtel could have mounted its Annex 3 exercise in its original Particulars of Claim.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, there can be no basis for any finding that these challenges, added by amendment to Bechtel’s claim in June 2020 by reason of their inclusion in Annex 3, are time-barred. I find that they are not. The BBVS tender was not provided until standard disclosure was given on 1 May 2020. HS2 consented to the amendment including Annex 3 on the basis that it would not “<span style="font-style:italic">advance a defence of time bar under regulation 107(2) of the Utilities Contracts Regulations 2016 in respect of any further amendments made to the Particulars of Claim by 26 June 2020 insofar as such amendments are based on facts first discovered by the Claimant in the Defendant’s standard disclosure.” </span>This was included in a consent order by the Court. Given my finding that the BBVS tender was required for the Annex 3 exercise, and that tender was included in standard disclosure, this means that the time bar does not apply and these complaints by Bechtel are not time-barred.

Each of those challenges relate to some, but not all, of the factors within the ITT for each question. Appendix 1 to this judgment sets out all the Questions and Factors separately, as well as identifying the scores awarded, and the different score that Bechtel contends should have been awarded (either to itself, or to BBVS) in the evaluation.

I have also dealt with limitation above in section H in respect of the timebar defence raised by HS2 to some of the challenges to the evaluation.

However, not as much detail is required as would be the case were they to be determinative. This judgment is, in any case, of considerable length, and endless recitation of the argument on hypothetical arguments is not proportionate.

Nor, in my judgment, does the earlier award of a different score in draft shift the burden in some way on to HS2 to demonstrate why the latter final score was correct, or to justify movement from a draft score reached by an evaluator in isolation from the other evaluator. In my judgment, Bechtel retain the burden of proof in terms of having to show manifest error in the score that was awarded, although an earlier (and different) draft score might make that burden easier to satisfy in evidential terms. But there is a limit to how far Bechtel can rely upon a draft score. I have explained above how the draft scores were intended to be a basis for discussions between the two evaluators. Further, both Mr Botelle and Mr Avery in their oral evidence demonstrated to me that, exercising their professional judgment, there was no manifest error (by either or both of them) in arriving at the final score awarded to BBVS of Concerns. Bechtel challenged the approach of the evaluators on the basis of their witness evidence which suggested they were concerned only with the resources for Year 1 of the contract, and not for the whole life of the project. The latter was undoubtedly required by the Question, but I am satisfied that the evaluators did take resources for the whole life of the project into account. They had greater concerns over Year 1, due to the fact that the resources for subsequent years would be subject to agreement going forwards. Mr Botelle said in his cross-examination that Mr Pybus had explained this to him. </p>

Criticism was made by Bechtel of the content of the moderation minutes, and it was submitted that these record the fact that the score was changed, but not the reason. It was also submitted by Bechtel that this was insufficient, in terms of available records, for the Court to be satisfied about what had occurred. It was said by Bechtel that “the Court lacks sufficient cogent evidence to reach any finding, on the balance of probabilities, as to the reasons” for Mr Botelle changing his draft score. I do not accept those submissions. The reason for the score was the decision as to the level of confidence reached by the two evaluators jointly considering the content of the bid submission, and exercising their professional judgment. One part of the minute states that “Matthew and Rob agreed that there are concerns in relation to the Tenderer's proposed approach to delivery regarding the level of resource proposed and that this represented a significant risk to HS2 Ltd and to delivery of the station” and “It was therefore agreed that the level of confidence for this factor was Very Low, leading to a Concerns score…..”. It was also recorded that Mr Avery had moved from his initial score of Minor Concerns, and Mr Botelle had moved from his initial score of Major Concerns. The fact that the level of resource proposed by BBVS was considered to represent a significant risk to HS2 is clearly recorded. The degree of confidence that each of them had was a result of their subjective view as to the level of risk presented by the BBVS MRS. This is what is sometimes called in modern terminology “a judgement call”. There is a margin of discretion available in any event to HS2, but I find that there was no error in their reaching the conclusion that they did.  </p>

That is entirely logical. But that did not merit the equivalent of disqualification for BBVS. It was not a pass/fail score. HS2 could have made it a pass/fail issue, had the ITT been designed in that way in the beginning. However, the way that the ITT was designed permitted a tenderer to score below “Moderate Confidence” in any of the Technical Questions, with this being translated into a lower percentage score, and not automatically into a score of “fail”. Any conclusion by the evaluators that they had low confidence, very low confidence, or no confidence, would result in scores of Minor Concerns, Concerns or Major Concerns respectively for the factors or Questions, rather than the result of total failure in the competition. The consequences of each of those scores were clearly explained in the ITT. </p>

Some other questions, not in the Technical Envelope, were given a pass/fail score. “Concerns” as a score in the Technical Envelope could lead to such a right on the part of HS2, but only in conjunction with another score of “Concerns”, as paragraph 6.8.15(b)(ii) of the ITT required “two or more ‘Concerns’”. A single score of “Concerns” would not exactly be a ringing endorsement of a tenderer’s answer to a Technical Question, given it would show “very low confidence” by the evaluators in that part of the response. However, it would neither justify, nor entitle, HS2 to reject a bid as a result. That must be borne in mind when addressing Bechtel’s reliance upon the deficiencies in the MRS submitted by BBVS in its answer to Question E001. </p>

Inconsistencies, whether of factual content in an answer to a question, or methodology, or any other information provided by a tenderer in its tender, would be assessed by HS2 to ensure that the whole tender worked together to achieve the completion of the project. If HS2 decided, having performed the review required by the Alignment Factor, that one answer was inconsistent, or not aligned, with the other responses, then HS2 would first seek clarification or resolution of this with the tenderer. If that did not resolve it, then the material lack of consistency would be reflected in the score of the question that included the inconsistency, and the score awarded would reflect this. The score as awarded would depend upon the extent of the inconsistency.

In my judgment, Bechtel are unable to change the scoring criteria by using the Alignment Factor in this way. I find that the Alignment Factor, interpreted by an RWIND tenderer in the way I have explained at [365] above, simply does not require HS2 to downgrade the scoring across all (or any) of the other questions in the Technical Envelope to reflect any lack of confidence or concerns under E001 about resources. I also find that there is no inconsistency in any event with the resources included in the MRS.

Bechtel scored Moderate Confidence (which I will call simply Moderate, the word used by the parties in the trial) for this Question; BBVS scored Good. The Bechtel score of Moderate was driven by its answer to Factor 5. In these proceedings, Bechtel maintains it should have been given Good; it also argues that BBVS’ score should have been lower, and no higher than Moderate.

At first sight this looks puzzling, but when the correct status of draft scores is considered, considering a move of score (as did Mr Avery) from Good to Moderate is not such an issue.

This is clearly shown in paragraph 170 of its Closing Submissions where it submitted that “Had the Claimant instead been awarded the lowest of the Individual Assessor scores for these three Technical ITT Questions – in each case “Good” – it would have gained additional marks amounting to 2.2% of the total marks available, bringing its overall score to 75.96% to overtake BBVS as the first ranked bidder.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">That is not relevant. It is correct, of course, that had Bechtel been awarded different scores it would have scored differently. The arithmetic in the submission is correct. Had Bechtel been awarded better scores, its overall score would have been better, and had it gained an extra 2.2% it would have won the evaluation (subject to the qualification/disqualification point which I have already dealt with above). But what is relevant is whether there was a manifest error, or manifest errors, in evaluation, or breaches of transparency or equal treatment in awarding Bechtel the final scores it was given. Bechtel was unable to demonstrate any such errors, in my judgment. Mr Avery had concluded, with his co-evaluator, that there was a lack of <span style="font-style:italic">significant</span> detail. The moderation minutes stated, inter alia, that they agreed that the third limb (ie, ' 'The response gives greater confidence than 'Minor concerns' but is not sufficiently comprehensive to warrant 'Good confidence') of Moderate Confidence reflected the assessment of the Tenderer’s response accordingly. The assessors discussed and agreed that the lack of significant detail and the lack of detail in parts of the response reduced overall confidence to Moderate in the response as a whole. A lack of <span style="font-style:italic">significant</span> detail is within the scoring descriptor for Moderate. This conclusion was driven, essentially, by Factor 5, although Mr Avery stated in his oral evidence that this was a significant contributor, but not exclusively that factor. A debate about what is, on the one hand, a lack of significant detail; compared with what is more correctly categorised simply as a lack of detail, is exactly the type of re-scoring that will not usually be undertaken in proceedings such as these. Bechtel had not even included all the Key Dates in its answer, merely using only a selection of these. Not including a Key Date is, in my judgment, easily (and correctly) categorised as a lack of significant detail. There were only a total of 12 Key Dates, and Bechtel had omitted any reference to more than one – 7, to be precise, were simply not addressed by Bechtel. Only 5 of the Key Dates had been addressed, a point made clearly in Mr Avery’s evidence on this, when the so-called “scoring inconsistency” was put to him:  </p>

However, Bechtel explained that these 5 dates had been dealt with by means of what it called “a more detailed risk analysis”, the term used in its Closing Submissions. But this question in the ITT does not ask for “a more detailed risk analysis” of fewer than 50% of the Key Dates, with the others being omitted or ignored. Factor 5 expressly states “including how Key Dates will be met….” and the evaluators concluded that meant identifying them all. They cannot be said to have been in error in doing so, and I find that an RWIND tenderer would have interpreted the factor in the same way. “Key Dates” cannot sensibly be said to mean to an RWIND tenderer “only 5 of the 12 Key Dates”. </p>

The degree of detail that is present, or missing, is a matter of judgment, which is within the professional sphere of the evaluators. The court will not lightly interfere with these. It cannot be said that the evaluators were wrong to conclude that there was a lack of significant detail in the response. When one adds the margin of discretion available to HS2, the conclusion that Bechtel fails in its challenge to this Question is reached somewhat readily. Bechtel scored a mix of Good and Very Good on the other factors, but the “Moderate” on Factor 5 led to an overall score of Moderate on this Question. That cannot be said to be manifestly erroneous.  </p>

The difference in the two tenderers’ scores is therefore easily understood. The evaluators were not comparing answers to Questions between tenderers, but when this is done, it is easy to see how a tenderer who omitted significant detail (and hence scored Moderate) could achieve a lower score overall than one who considered all 12 Key Dates and scored only Good or Very Good on all the factors.  </p>

The minutes explain, in summary form, what happened in terms of the evaluators reaching their conclusions. They do not recite, over pages and pages, who said what to whom, nor do they recite every part of the thought process.

This solution delivers value for money and allows change and emerging scope to be managed.” Bechtel maintains that this works package strategy would only be practically feasible if there were sufficient management and support resources in place to manage and deliver 51 works and service packages, and relies upon the concerns expressed in relation to the MRS to argue, therefore, that the BBVS answer to this Question should not have been scored as it was. </p>

Further, the level of resource needed to manage the supply chain had to reflect the scale and complexity of each package, as well as their interfaces and timelines. The fact that Matthew Botelle identified BBVS' MRS as lacking resources overall, and in particular relating to construction management (among other areas), would have therefore constituted an area of misalignment according to Bechtel's understanding of the ITT.

Bechtel alleges that this should have affected the score for this question, <span style="font-style:italic">in addition to</span> HS2 scoring BBVS’ resources contained in its MRS in the separate question, E001, specifically designed to analyse and evaluate those resources. I find the ITT cannot be construed in this way, and would not have been construed that way by an RWIND tenderer. Bechtel’s understanding of the ITT is not relevant for reasons I have already explained. Further, I repeat what I have found above; the scoring for the MRS was to form part of the mark awarded to each tenderer for E001.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Bechtel rely on what is said to be unjustifiable interference with scoring and/or unequal treatment and/or lack of transparency in terms of the moderation process. Ms Sumner (who did appear as a witness) and Mr Cuthbert (who did not) were both involved in the Moderation Assurance process. The Moderation Assurance process involved Ms Sumner and Mr Cuthbert providing their feedback on the drafting of the Moderation Rationales and Moderation Minutes by e-mail. These emails were used in evidence, and a greater number are in the trial bundle. I have read all of those identified by either party. The comments in them typically identify some mis-match in language between the scores and the descriptors taken from Table 6.8 of the ITT. Some of Mr Cuthbert’s regarding E006 go to Mr Wagstaff, something Ms Sumner could not fully explain, but there is no reason why she should have been able to, given Mr Cuthbert was standing in for her whilst she was on holiday.</p>

That may not have been how the moderation training suggested this would be done, because one entry in those slides states further moderators would be used if re-moderation was required, rather than the original moderator. It is not clear if that occurred or not. However, there is nothing in the evidence, in my judgment, to justify a finding that either the moderators or indeed the legal teams intervened or interfered with the professional judgment of the evaluators, or that any pressure was applied (either to BBVS’ score moving upwards, or Bechtel’s downwards) to influence the scoring, or distort the documentary record, or inappropriately rationalise scores (all of which are allegations made by Bechtel in its Closing Submissions). Bechtel maintains that “it may have been the scores…..that were wrong” but I reject that submission. The emails demonstrate questions are asked – such as whether they “capture fairly why [Vincent] changed his view” – but I do not consider these demonstrate either interference or impermissible intervention.  </p>

There are a tiny number of entries of text that could potentially be interpreted in that way, and I have identified some of them above, but only if they are taken out of context. One or two are unfortunately worded, for example the latter one, which states “being stricter with the scores” but generally they reflect attempts by those involved in the assurance process to ensure that the entries in the minutes reflect the thinking behind the scores. I interpret that as simply loose language. In any event, in the context of the vast amount of material available, including the moderation meeting minutes, such isolated entries are not persuasive. Bechtel made the most of what was available, and concentrated on such isolated entries or sentences to support their case. However, when looked at as a whole, there is very little, if anything, to support Bechtel’s case in this respect.  </p>

Although Mr Cuthbert was not cross-examined, if he had been exerting such pressure then this would have been upon evaluators I did see, such as Mr Avery, and he was extensively cross-examined.

It complained that an inconsistent and irreconcilable approach had been adopted by HS2 between its bid, and that of BBVS.

Bechtel accepted that BBVS’ response was better, but submitted (in paragraph 213 of its Closing Submissions) that “BBVS’ response was only marginally more detailed than the Claimant’s response.” In other words, it was better, but not that much better. That is not a well-founded submission. BBVS’ response indicated which type of contract it would use for <span style="font-style:italic">each</span> of its Works Packages. All Bechtel did was said it would consider NEC Options A, B or C. That, in reality, is not much of an answer at all. Bechtel accepted that BBVS had a “precise specification” but said that its own high level suggestion was more realistic. The assessors plainly did not agree, and I find that they were not manifestly erroneous in scoring more highly the far more detailed response by BBVS for each of the Works Packages, than the vague sentence provided by Bechtel. </p>

In other words, Bechtel do not quibble with a higher score being given to BBVS per se, but state it should not have been more than one score higher than Bechtel. I disagree that this is the correct approach to scoring - it is certainly not based upon anything in the ITT. The ITT explains that the score for each tender – and each factor in each question – is to be given on a stand-alone basis, and based on the degree of confidence and risk the evaluators conclude is present on that Question. The approach was not to look at different tenders and decide which is better, or which should be scored higher than another, or what the differential in score should be between them.  </p>

I find that Bechtel did not demonstrate any lack of equal treatment. Mr New explained his view of the merits of the two bids; admittedly these could be described as subjective, but that is the whole point of Subject Matter Experts, or evaluators with specialist knowledge.

In order to advance or make good its challenge in this respect, therefore, Bechtel must show that the assessors were in manifest error in coming to this conclusion. Mr Steward gave evidence and, in my judgment, that evidence adequately explained the conclusion that was reached, and certainly does not demonstrate any error. The fundamental and central element of Bechtel’s case amounts, in my judgment, to unwarranted reliance on draft scores. Further, in paragraph 187 of its Opening Submissions, Bechtel explained that HS2 was in breach of the principle of transparency by failing to provide a clear explanation in the moderation minutes as to why the individual Assessors decided at moderation that their original assessment was wrong. However, even here, the draft score of Mr Hooper on Factor 4 was Moderate. </p>

Firstly, it is not correct for Bechtel to characterise the draft scores as correct or binding, such that they have to be “wrong” in order to be changed. I have explained above the process whereby evaluators were to consider scores separately, then come together to reach a consensus. The draft scores were their initial, separate, view. They do not have to be “wrong” in order to be changed. Secondly, even if Bechtel is correct to portray draft scores as having that status, the rhetorical question arises, why should Mr Steward’s draft score for Factor 4 take primacy over that of Mr Hooper? Mr Steward explained in his evidence how the two of them discussed the matter, and he agreed with Mr Hooper’s views.

In any event, the minutes clearly explain the areas in which the assessors concluded there was a lack of significant detail in Bechtel’s bid. There is no error by HS2. Nor is there any breach of transparency. Mr Steward’s evidence is criticised as containing “vague references” to the degree of discussion at the moderation meeting, but I find that criticism misplaced. Mr Steward explained in reasonable detail the method adopted by him and Mr Hooper, and what led to the conclusion that there was a lack of significant detail. Both that conclusion, and the score, are in my judgment matters of their specialist knowledge and judgment, reached without breach of obligation by HS2, and the court will not disturb either.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is a particularly ironic Question, in a sense, given the subject matter of the Bechtel qualification. That qualification could be interpreted as a very clear indication that Bechtel did not intend to meet this key objective, given the proposed change to clause 6.2 and the options that would arise at the Consolidation Point if Bechtel refused to agree that either the Incentive and/or Programme Target could not be met. However, this Question was evaluated by the assessors in isolation from that qualification and Bechtel was awarded Very Good. BBVS was given Good. The two assessors were Ms Olson and Mr Culver. Bechtel maintains BBVS ought to have been given a score of Moderate as a result of proper application of the Alignment Factor.  </p>

I accept that submission, as I accepted it for E010. Further, Ms Olson gave BBVS a draft score of Good in any event, so although her co-assessor moved from Moderate to Good for BBVS, there would be no reason to grant Mr Culver’s draft score some sort of precedence over the draft score of Ms Olson.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I therefore consider this from the point of view of an alleged failure by HS2 properly to apply the Alignment Factor to other elements of BBVS’ bid. The argument by Bechtel is that (as put in paragraph 142 of its Closing Submissions) “given that the OOC Contract was for the provision of a management service (to be carried out by people), each and every one of BBVS’ proposals in response to Questions E002, E004-E010 and I001 relied expressly or implicitly on adequate resources in order to be practically achievable.” </p>

This is because this Question expressly refers the tenderer to WI800 by using the phrase “as detailed within WI800”. That document, part of the Works Information and headed Commercial Management, expressly within it deals both with the Cost Plan, the Cost Plan Strategy, the Management Resource Plan and the MRS.  </p>

Further, the MRS is described in paragraph 6.2.1 of the ITT in the following terms “An <span style="text-decoration:underline">initial</span> Management Resource Schedule is contained within the Contract Data Part 2 and represents the GMMP f<span style="text-decoration:underline">or the first year and is a forecast</span> of all of the management Staff it anticipates to utilise <span style="text-decoration:underline">during that year</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, this demonstrates two things. Firstly, the MRS is only an initial document and is a forecast for the first year. An RWIND tenderer would interpret it in that way. In my judgment, no RWIND tenderer would interpret paragraph 6.2.1 as meaning that the MRS fixed the level of resources for the life of the contract. Secondly, any deficiencies in that MRS would not have any impact on the evaluation of this Question, dealing with the tenderer’s intentions to meet the Incentive and Programme Targets. The answer has to “identify the steps that you will take and issues that you would address…..” Answering this does not, in my judgment, concern the MRS. I accept HS2’s submission that the Question did not ask about management resources or require tenderers to explain their alignment with the proposed MRS at all.  </p>

However, regardless of the proper construction of the former (which in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">SRCL</span> I found was a power but not a duty to reject), in the latter instance the different Regulation under UCR 2016 plainly states the “Utility <span style="font-style:italic">may</span>”.

It would require a different word if the authority was positively under a duty to reject, such as “must”. Therefore it is clear that under the regulations that govern this procurement, 2016 UCR 2016, HS2 had the power to reject an abnormally low tender, but was not obliged to do so. </p>

One constituent element of the tender in this case was resources. However, Bechtel faces substantial obstacles in this area of its case. This obstacle is three-fold. The first obstacle is that the MRS did not feed into either the price or costs proposed in the tender. This point was made increasingly clear as the detailed mechanism of the scoring was examined during the trial. The MRS was a separate factor in Question E001. It had no effect on the Staff Rates; indeed, the template for the rates under Question J001 was specifically designed so that level or amount of resources would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> feed into the Commercial Envelope. It was these rates that were considered by HS2 when evaluating J001. This was entirely understandable, given the services were to be management contract services, and also given the GMMP was to be agreed on an annual basis going forwards. The winning tenderer would be paid on the basis of rates, and also be paid through the mechanism of the percentage Lump Sum Fee. It is also understandable given the Staff Rates had to be considered between tenderers on a like-for-like basis. This is made clear in the ITT, in particular at 6.11.6 which stated: </p>

Bechtel in its evidence tried to demonstrate that level of resources would affect the Lump Sum Fee, because Mr Roberts explained (for example) certain elements in the Bechtel bid would have been different, within the Bechtel template, had the level of resources been different. However, there were six such elements, and three of them had been priced by Bechtel at zero. The others were at very small percentages. But in any event, this evidence does not assist Bechtel. Firstly, it could not demonstrate that the Lump Sum Fee it had tendered would have been different. On all the evidence, I find that it would not. Secondly, on the terms of the ITT, an RWIND tenderer would not have concluded that the level of resources in the MRS under Question E001 would impact upon the level of fee for J002. It was entirely a matter for a bidder how it constructed the level of its own Lump Sum Fee.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">That was the purpose of the Fee Collar, and I find it accomplished its purpose. It must also be understood that, to be abnormally low, both those words must be considered, namely “abnormally” <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> “low”. Here, the BBVS bid was “low” only in the sense that the fee it tendered was lower than Bechtel’s fee. But it was not “abnormally” so. The term means a bid that “must be beyond and below the range of anything which might legitimately be considered to be normal in the context of the particular procurement”, to use the wording from [204] of the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">SRCL</span> case. Indeed, when one considers Confidential Appendix II, the single biggest difference between the Fee submitted by BBVS and that of Bechtel was determined by the different level of profit. Bechtel wanted a higher profit. If that difference is removed, then the two fees are much closer to one another. I find that the difference between them is sufficiently close that the BBVS bid could not be described as “abnormal”; it is entirely of the same order, and in the same range, as that of Bechtel. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that another bidder, Omega, bid a Lump Sum Fee excluding profit only 0.47% higher than that of BBVS. Given BBVS and Omega were so close together on Lump </p>

Physical works were not to be performed by the Construction Partner, but by the Works Contractors. When one considers the level of fee tendered, even absent the Fee Collar, there would be no “reason to suspect that the tenderer will not be able to perform the contract according to the conditions offered”, to use the expression from the European authorities in [460] above. “Perform the contract” must mean for <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> contract, namely the Construction Partner contract, in respect of which no actual costs of the physical works (the Works Packages) were to be included by way of payment to the winning tenderer.

It appeared low in some isolated respects, as Mr Botelle and Mr Avery explained and was, as a result, not sufficient to give HS2 the confidence for it to be scored well. This was reflected in the score it obtained, namely that of “Concerns”, which showed that it represented a degree of risk to HS2. But that is not the same as being outside a legitimate or normal range, or of being abnormal. There is no evidential basis for such a conclusion.

However, even if I am wrong about that and it does, here the BBVS tendered resources cannot be considered abnormally low. Here, the evidence shows that these resources were low in some respects, which led to the score of Concerns. They were, however, when looked at as a whole, not outside the range of what could be considered normal or acceptable. Further, the price, in particular the BBVS Lump Sum Fee (but also the Staff Rates), is not only unaffected by the level of resource, but is plainly not abnormally low either. The Lump Sum Fee bears very close comparison with that tendered by Bechtel, in particular when one takes account of the higher level of profit tendered by Bechtel. As [4] of Confidential Appendix II shows, there is a difference in the two fees of only 1.42%, if the different percentage for profit is removed (which accounts for the majority of the difference). It is very difficult to envisage a scenario where a fee of x% would be abnormally low, yet a fee of (x + 1.42)% is not. Yet that is the finding for which Bechtel contends, if the different level of profit is removed. Not only that, but another tenderer (with the codename Omega) bid a figure excluding profit of only 0.47% higher than BBVS. This is very close, in my judgment, to the winning bid level. It cannot be said BBVS’ bid for Lump Sum Fee, excluding profit, was out of the range of the other tenderers. Profitability is not to be entirely ignored, because it is expressly referred to at [100] of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Belfass</span>. However, where profit alone accounts for so much of the difference between the two levels of Lump Sum Fee, I find it verging on contradictory that Bechtel could rely upon the fact that its profit was so much higher than that sought by BBVS in demonstrating that BBVS’ bid, so far as fee was concerned, was abnormally low. In this case, on these facts, it plainly was not. The evidence was that the rates were broadly comparable across the tenderers, and BBVS was not by any means the lowest across all of them. There is no evidence to suggest that the rates tendered by BBVS were abnormally low either.  </p>

The decisions HS2 made on this subject were entirely rational and free from manifest error. HS2 designed the ITT including the Fee Collar, and then, additionally, performed an ex post facto exercise of review on rates afterwards. Bechtel accepts in paragraph 134 of its Opening Submissions that HS2 has a margin of appreciation in this respect. I find that there is no discernible error by HS2 in its consideration of whether any tender was abnormally low, or its conclusion that BBVS’ tender was not abnormally low.  </p>

In this tender, the level of resources had no impact on price or costs. Each of Issues 4(a) and 4(b) are both answered “No”, and Issue 5 does not arise.  </p>

Regulation 88 applies to contracts modified during their term. Here, the modification – if modification it was – occurred prior to the contract being entered into. The regulation does not therefore prima facie apply.

It is a decision of the Commission made as the regulator of state aid, communicating to the UK what its intended course of action is to be.

The use of the word “negotiated” in the regulation would suggest that such a point is somewhat compelling; utilities are given very wide scope in terms of negotiation. The wording of the regulation is demonstrably wider than that of its counterpart in the Public Contracts Regulation, namely Regulation 29, which is competitive procedure with negotiation. In my judgment, this is to reflect the different type of projects undertaken by utilities, compared to other contracting authorities, who would use the Public Contracts Regulations rather than UCR 2016. Utilities need a wider degree of flexibility because of the different subject matter of the contracts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The conclusion of Professor Arrowsmith is (partly) based on the view of the Commission in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">London Underground</span> case that the utility could, <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> selecting the preferred bidder, negotiate with the winner, including on important issues. This was based on the wording of the regulations, a point accepted by the Commission. Those issues were stated as including “important issues such as risk allocation, the timing and sequencing of the infrastructure work and the performance regime”. The Commission’s decision is of no legal status under the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">stare decisis</span>, but the common sense driving that conclusion is inescapable. I reach the same conclusion based on the wording of the regulations themselves, and not because I am applying a conclusion of the Commission as though it either bound or persuaded me. Given the nature of utilities projects, such as HS2 (the scale of which is obvious) or the London Underground one (in that case it was a 30 year project) it would be far from sensible if, having selected the winning bidder, the utility was not permitted to negotiate, agree, discuss or make  changes with that economic operator. As long as the process that leads to the winning bidder being identified is fair, transparent, treats the bidders equally and complies with the regulatory requirements, then once that winner is chosen, the utility is not bound strictly to contract only on the specific details contained in the tender. The opposite conclusion would make utilities projects unmanageable. Consider, as an example, start dates. Delays are caused by any number of factors. If the start date of a project is moved back by, say, 6 months, I do not interpret the regulations as requiring a further procurement competition to be undertaken reflecting that change. There is no distortion to the competitive process by permitting such negotiation, and I find that the regulations permit this. If this were not permitted, a change of dates would require a new competition. Such a conclusion would be somewhat lacking in any common sense or logic. </p>

Further, the fact of holding a meeting with one of the bidders (BBVS, in September 2018) was, as has been seen from the emails from Mr McMonagle in August 2018, known about by Bechtel about 6 months before it received the standstill letter informing it of the result of the competition. It is therefore far too late for Bechtel to bring any cause of action based either upon the terms of the ITT, or the holding of the meeting of 5 September 2018, now. It was far too late for Bechtel to do so even in February 2019.

Although paragraph 5.8.2 of the ITT stated that the winning bidder’s MRS was “then intended (subject to any refinement during post-tender negotiations) to be the first accepted Management Resource Schedule and the first Accepted Programme as defined and to be used in the Contract” the part in parentheses is highly important.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">There are also the following important points arising out of Bechtel’s reliance on Regulation 88. Firstly, where modifications are not substantial, they are expressly permitted. I find that the modifications made by HS2 and agreed by BBVS are not substantial, and are not contrary to Regulation 88. Even if they are substantial, they are permitted by Regulation 88(1)(a). Further, the changes, had they been part of the original ITT, would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have allowed for the acceptance of a tender other than that accepted, namely that of BBVS, such that they would in any event fall under subparagraph (7) of Regulation 88. BBVS would have been the winning bidder if these dates had been included originally, on the terms of the ITT as drafted and the tenders as evaluated. Secondly, the regulation requires consideration of whether the modifications made would change the economic balance of the contract. I find that they would not. However – and this is somewhat ironic – had HS2 accepted the new proposed clause 6.2 put forward by Bechtel in its qualification, that is precisely the sort of modification that <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> have changed the economic balance of the contract. That is, in the context of this procurement, the sort of change that would <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have been permitted without a new competition. </p>

That is precisely the sort of change which would have distorted competition, as had it been accepted by HS2, one bidder (Bechtel) would have been bidding against a markedly different contractual undertaking than the other bidders (including BBVS). The changes made by HS2 in the instant case to the Contract Data, including the changed dates, and the consequent changes to the MRS, did not. They are changes to details that simply refine matters, and for the most part, simply arise as a result of the passage of time. It took longer to award and conclude the contract than anticipated when the ITT was drafted, and so changes to the Contract Data were necessary. The changes to the MRS were similarly permitted both as a consequence of the contract dates changing, and also by the terms of the ITT. I find that there was no obligation upon HS2 to re-conduct the procurement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Regulation 88 does not assist Bechtel. The changes of which complaint is made were expressly permitted in the ITT. They are not substantial, nor are they material. The changes required to the dates were, partly, necessary because of the imposition of the automatic suspension imposed by Bechtel issuing proceedings. The Bechtel witnesses, in particular Mr Roberts, said the Bechtel tender would have been different if they had known about these changes, but that is far from sufficient for Bechtel to succeed on this issue. Firstly, I find that the Bechtel tender would not have been materially different in any relevant respect. Secondly, even such a notionally different tender would not (and sensibly could not) have affected the two main central elements of the Bechtel bid, which means the outcome of the competition would have been the same, and BBVS would still have won. The first of these is the Lump Sum Fee, in particular the higher percentage for profit sought by Bechtel, and the fact that BBVS was the lowest bidder on J002 and hence awarded 10% in the evaluation for that question in the Commercial Envelope, with Bechtel awarded only 5.76%. The second is the Bechtel qualification to clause 6.2. There is no evidence at all that the changes that were made post-tender would have had an impact upon this decision at Bechtel both to include, and to decline to remove, the qualification. Accordingly, Bechtel would still have faced disqualification.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with that statement and I find that there would be a margin of appreciation available to HS2 in this respect too. Bechtel have not, in my judgment, come close to demonstrating either that there were sufficiently material changes in any event that were not permitted, or if there were, that HS2 should have decided to abandon the procurement, or that a failure to abandon the competition puts HS2 in breach of the regulations. Further, Bechtel has not demonstrated that a failure to abandon the procurement was even arguably manifestly erroneous, irrational, disproportionate, or not justified. The HS2 project is a highly complex one and the contracts for Old Oak Common and Euston are important ones in terms of the overall programme of the HS2 project. To have abandoned the OOC procurement – Lot 2 – and re-conducted it would have caused exceptional delay and disruption to the programme of that major station, and also to the entire project. That part of the works at the southern end of Phase One would have become extraordinarily out of step with the rest of the project, including the station at Euston. In my judgment, there can be no valid criticism made of HS2 for any failure to decide to abandon the procurement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally on this issue, if Bechtel were right in its construction of the Regulations, this would give any bidder with sufficiently deep pockets, who was sufficiently motivated, an extraordinarily powerful weapon in its arsenal where procurement competitions for complex contracts are involved. By issuing proceedings, the automatic suspension could potentially cause delay to a contract award. By reason of that delay, changes to dates such as possessions and contract commencement would inevitably be caused. Yet delay to such dates could (if Bechtel were right), even if anticipated and expressly provided for in the ITT, still lead to a conclusion that the competition had to be rerun. If Bechtel were right, changes of the nature such as those to the Contract Data in this case could potentially be further relied upon by a losing bidder to argue that the procurement competition it had already lost, should be abandoned and re-run in any event. Even without delay caused by the automatic suspension, infrastructure projects often suffer delay. Any delays suffered prior to contract award could potentially undo the entire result of any major procurement, if Bechtel’s interpretations of the Regulations are correct. I do not consider UCR 2016 imposes such restrictions upon utilities, such that the changes to the contract data that occurred in this case must, or ought to, lead to the conclusion that another procurement competition must be conducted. I find that the changes to the contract data that occurred in this case are permitted both within the terms of the ITT itself, and by reason of the negotiated procedure under Regulation 47 being used by HS2.  </p>

I do not criticise the parties for not applying to have that subject dealt with as such, and if there is any blame to be attached to that, it ought equally to apply in the direction of the court in any event. Judges of the Technology and Construction Court take great interest in pro-active case management, and there was no suggestion from me at the early case-management hearings in this case that disqualification ought to be heard as a preliminary issue. This point was thrown into stark relief as the evidence unfolded during the trial. Preliminary issues can, in any event, sometimes not be the attractive short cuts they first appear. In any event, I have considered all the other issues so that the parties can see that, regardless of my finding on the disqualification issue, this makes no difference to the outcome.

This fee by BBVS was above the Fee Collar, and there is no question of the BBVS tender being an abnormally low tender.

In any event, even if it did, this would be broadly equivalent to duties that were owed, namely those of equal treatment and transparency. HS2 did owe the duty set out in the regulations in respect of potentially abnormally low tenders. Whether a tender is abnormally low has to be considered by reference to the particular competition and subject matter of the contract in question. Here, for this competition, a tender could not be abnormally low based on resource levels due to the way the competition was designed and the proposed contract terms; but even if it could, BBVS resources were not abnormally low, nor were its fee or rates. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Issues 4 and 5: There was no breach of obligation by HS2 in not identifying BBVS’ tender as abnormally low. By reason of the way the Fee Collar was set in the ITT, HS2 had set a minimum threshold for fee percentages to be bid by the tenderers for their Lump Sum Fees for Question J002, that threshold being 7%. That figure was not arbitrarily chosen but was based on sound evidence available to HS2 that was directly obtained from, and related to, earlier competitions. The Lump Sum Fee in BBVS’ tender exceeded the Fee Collar and was not abnormally low in any event. The rates submitted by tenderers for Question J001 were also considered, and BBVS’ rates were not abnormally low. No part of BBVS’ resources schedule contained in the MRS fed into either the rates or the Lump Sum Fee in any event. BBVS’ proposed level of resources was not abnormally low in any event. Issue 5 does not therefore arise.  </p>

Inconsistencies, whether of factual content in an answer to a question, or methodology, or any other information provided by a tenderer in its tender, would be assessed by HS2 to ensure that the whole tender worked together to achieve the intention of the project. If clarification were sought by HS2 of inconsistencies and not provided, then the material lack of consistency would be reflected in the score of the question that was inconsistent. The score that would be then awarded would be one which reflected the level of confidence on the part of the evaluators assessed in accordance with the scoring matrix in the ITT.
