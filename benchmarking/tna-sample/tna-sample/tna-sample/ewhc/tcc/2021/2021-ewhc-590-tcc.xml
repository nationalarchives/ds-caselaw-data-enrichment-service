The Claimant, Multiplex Construction Europe Ltd (“Multiplex”), was the main contractor for this project, which comprised what is called a campus of three main buildings around an enlarged public space. The site is two acres in size. Multiplex had contracted with the employer on the basis that it, Multiplex, had design and build responsibilities. Building 1 of the three is a 40 storey tower, situated on the corner of Bishopsgate and Camomile Street. The other two buildings are both 6 storeys high, each connected to Building 1 at what is called the Podium Level. This was therefore a very substantial construction project. The First Defendant, Bathgate Realisations Civil Engineering Ltd, was formerly known as Dunne Building and Civil Engineering Ltd (and is referred to in the pleadings, and all the documents, simply as </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a trial of preliminary issues, set out as ordered at [11] below. They concern the legal relationship between RNP, an independent design checker engaged by Dunne, and Multiplex. There was no contract between Multiplex and RNP, and Multiplex allege that RNP owed it certain duties of care, and also that RNP had provided warranties to Multiplex. Accordingly, Multiplex seeks to advance a claim directly against RNP, notwithstanding the lack of any direct contractual link between them.  </p>

This included the concrete core, which was constructed, level by level, using what is called a slipform rig, which is part of the temporary works. The slipform rig is a constantly moving piece of equipment that permits the concrete core to be constructed incrementally. Originally Dunne was engaged by Multiplex in 2011, but the project was put on hold by the employer until </p>

Multiplex terminated Dunne’s sub-contract, as it was permitted to do, and engaged an alternative specialist sub-contractor, Byrne Brothers Ltd (“Byrne”) to replace Dunne, and to complete the sub-contract works. At that point in mid-2016, Dunne had performed the concrete core slipform works to Building 1 up to level 7, out of the 37 levels required. It is said by Multiplex that those works had progressed only very slowly, but nothing turns on that in terms of resolution of the preliminary issues and any claim against Argo. When Byrne was first engaged, the first thing that it did was to investigate both the works to date, and the slipform rig as constructed on site. Byrne concluded that both were defective. Indeed, not only was Byrne not prepared to take responsibility for the performance of the slipform rig, but Byrne concluded that in some respects it was unsafe and should not be used. Multiplex therefore had the rig replaced, as part of wider works considered necessary at that time in order to proceed with Byrne, and to continue the project. The works thereafter proceeded with Byrne completing those the subject of the sub-contract between Multiplex and Dunne.  </p>

Pepperall J endorsed the approach of the parties in seeking to have these issues determined first, and made clear that issues of breach were not encompassed within the issues that he ordered. Although he gave permission for each party to call expert evidence from a structural engineer, he indicated that he anticipated there would be a large measure of agreement between them and it would be unlikely that either would have to provide oral evidence at the trial of the preliminary issues.

All that the letter of 3 December 2015 does is to show the date when it was sent, the date it was received by RNP, and that Dunne wanted the Consultancy Agreement signed and returned. On the balance of probabilities, that shows that the Consultancy Agreement did not within it include the RNP Terms (which would in any event be inherently unlikely). I accept that on the documents, the sending of the Consultancy Agreement constitutes a counter-offer by Dunne. </p>

It would have been far better had this movement on the pleadings, with amendments and re-amendments, been dealt with somewhat in advance of the trial of the preliminary issues, rather than in the days immediately leading up to the trial (and on the first day of the trial itself). That last minute development of the pleadings was rather reminiscent of the somewhat old-fashioned approach that would have been adopted some decades ago. However, in the interests of furthering the over-riding objective, the best approach is simply to grasp the nettle and deal with contract formation now. </p>

She submitted that it would be a rare case in negligent misstatement if the receiver of the statement never actually received the statement itself, but merely a doctored version of it. This was met by Multiplex arguing that they relied only on the statement made in the certificate, set out at [34], and not the whole of the terms of the certificate.   </p>

The statement made by RNP were the words in, or comprising, the certificate <span style="font-style:italic">as a whole</span>. Further, the statement that Multiplex relies on in these proceedings includes the words “the preparation of this design/check” and “this design/check” and that must be construed as including the notes and observations. The whole document is headed “Design Check Certificate”. The notes and comments are part of the design check performed by RNP. It would be wholly artificial, in my judgment, to focus on one statement or sentence within the certificate, extract it and consider it separately from the other text. Other boxes within the certificate explain and qualify the certificate as a whole. The boxes headed “Description of Check/Calculations” and “Design Criteria &amp; References” put the statement of certification in its proper context. The box “Notes and Observations” does the same. However, my decision that the statement is the whole certificate, and not the small part upon which Multiplex invite me to concentrate, may not affect the answer to the preliminary issues. </p>

Although there was a second certificate issued by RNP, namely that dated 4 February 2016, that was not provided to Multiplex until 22 June 2016. This was a point added to the Defence by way of amendment following the Amendment to the Particulars of Claim permitted by Kerr J on 9 December 2020.

Although the word “issue” is used, in fact this comprised signing forms already prepared by Dunne, although I do not consider that slight difference to be relevant. Slipform is a method whereby the concrete works are constructed incrementally, allowing the concrete at a particular level to be poured (and therefore to start to cure or set) with the works moving gradually up the height of the building. Slipform is continuously moving formwork. These types of works are, as with so many construction operations, potentially dangerous. Temporary works of any type also have a particular level of dangerousness in my judgment, in particular if they are works of this nature.

The check carried out pursuant to BS 5975 is not, in itself, a Statutory Requirement but is a requirement of the CDM Regulations. Mr Nissen sensibly accepted that the CDM Regulations were part of the Statutory Requirements, a point made clear in clause 1.1. of the SubContract which defines these. Statutory Requirements are defined as “any statute, statutory instrument, regulation, rule or order made under any statute or directive having the force of law which affects the Sub-Contract Works or performance of any obligation under the Sub-Contract”.

I cannot accept that submission. Paragraph 43 is concerned with failure to use reasonable skill and care in the preparation of the design check, not the making of  the statement (negligently or otherwise) or the issuing of the certificates. Paragraph 44 expressly states in its introductory wording “further or alternatively”. It cannot be read as re-stating the same subject matter as paragraph 43; it is additional to that. In my judgment paragraph 43 of the Amended Particulars of Claim goes wider than simply negligent misstatement, and alleges a duty of care generally in performance of the design check. This is important in terms of how Multiplex put its case in terms of the law of tort filling a gap in liability under the contractual structure or chain. Multiplex maintain that there is such a gap, and that it, Multiplex, would have no right of recovery against Dunne for a failure to take reasonable skill and care in making the statement in the certificate.  </p>

In my judgment, the important point can be summarised as follows from the contractual provisions. Dunne had direct contractual obligations to Multiplex to perform the design (including the design of any temporary works) using reasonable care and skill, and to comply with Statutory Requirements, which included obtaining a Category 3 check in respect of the temporary works design. Multiplex brings a claim against Dunne, both for breach of that direct duty, and also for failures in identifying what are said to be breaches by RNP in the latter’s exercise of reasonable skill and care.  </p>

Certainly, as a matter of law, Multiplex has a cause of action against Dunne for the same matters advanced against RNP (or its pleading proceeds as though it does). The case against RNP would be an add-on to that main case. As it is, RNP (or more accurately, Argo, RNP’s insurer) may be the only party from whom Multiplex might realistically expect any recovery. This point is relied upon by Argo; paragraph 2 of the Amended Defence makes extensive reference to this, and states that “Multiplex has constructed an artificial claim against Argo in respect of the work carried out by RNP”. It also criticises the claim as seeking “to impose full design responsibility upon RNP in respect of the design of the slipform rig”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Multiplex meets the “artificial claim” point in paragraph 40 of its submissions, which states that “It is commonplace within the construction industry, and business more broadly, for entities who are legally liable for loss to be in liquidation, uninsured or difficult to trace….it may choose to sue any other party against whom it has a legitimate cause of action.” It is correct that a party is free to proceed against any one of a number of other parties against whom it has a good claim. The reason this point is potentially important here is in respect of the matters that must be considered when considering assumption of responsibility and a potential duty of care. The phrase used in some of the authorities is “gap filling”, by which is meant whether there is a gap in terms of a claimant’s contractual relations, which the law of tort might fill. Here, the “artificial claim” point is a more refined, and subsidiary, point which arises under consideration of any gaps. It is not a strict requirement that there be a gap, but here, in my judgment, there is no gap.  </p>

Multiplex puts its case against RNP in the following way. It alleges a failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in considering the design, and particular aspects of this are pleaded at paragraph 35A of the Amended Particulars of Claim. The complaint is that the design check did not identify the defects in design. Various details are given of this, such as RNP is said to have failed to identify that the slipform had inadequate capacity; that there was excessive reliance on redistribution of loads from jacks to neighbouring jacks (which left an insufficient or no redundancy in the system to lift); and an inadequate margin of safety in the system. All of these allegations are disputed by RNP and by Argo. Multiplex also contends that the Category 3 check certificates contained warranties that reasonable skill had been used, and alleges that such warranties were breached by RNP. </p>

This is because the design should be checked for “concept, adequacy, correctness and compliance with the requirements of the design brief” (paragraph 9.2.1 of BS 5975). </p>

It never entered into any contract with Multiplex, or even had direct contact with any individual at Multiplex.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Markham’s statements about the contractual relationship being between RNP and Dunne, and not RNP and Multiplex, are correct. His statement concerning his subjective knowledge of Multiplex’s identity – namely, Multiplex specifically being the principal contractor, rather than simply that there was <span style="font-style:italic">a</span> principal contractor – is not relevant, in my judgment. He knew that there <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> a principal contractor; he states in paragraph 43 of his witness statement that he knew Dunne was a sub-contractor. He also knew that the Category 3 certificates were needed by the TWC; indeed, the British Standard makes it clear in paragraph 9.2.5 (set out at [69] above) what is to be done with the certificate. Indeed, Mr Markham would also have known that, absent the approval provided by the certificate, the temporary works could not take place. This is because the design would not have been approved by the relevant independent third party checker, which is required for Category 3 works. He found out in February 2016, at the time of the revised design check, that Multiplex was the identity of the main contractor.  </p>

At least at this point in the proceedings, it is not possible to decide who removed the notes and comments, or why, or upon whose instructions this was done. However, whoever it was, was it somebody at Dunne. This is because the certificate sent from RNP to Dunne had the notes and comments upon it. The certificate received by Multiplex from Dunne did not.

The full relevance of this would be considered at a later trial, dependent upon the answers to the preliminary issues. The same day as Multiplex was sent the certificate that appears to have been altered, Dunne also provided to Multiplex the Temporary Works Design Brief dated 20 July 2015, and two documents from BRM, namely a Temporary Works Design Brief Certificate and Temporary Works Designer’s Certificate. These documents were part of the package necessary for the TWC to consider. </p>

He explained the detailed chronology and the approval of the design, the work for which was essentially done by a subordinate called Mr Smith, under his supervision. RNP had worked once with BRM before, but Dunne was a new client. Mr Markham also made the point that, in his view, Multiplex did not rely on the Category 3 check, as individuals within Multiplex had themselves independently checked the calculations (as demonstrated by comments sent from Multiplex commenting on these). Actual reliance in fact is not a discrete part of the preliminary issues. Reliance does have to be considered as part of the framework under the first preliminary issue, but in the context of the use to which certificates such as this are to be put, and not whether <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> Multiplex in this case relied on the certificates.  </p>

The interpretation of that wording is a matter of law and is for the court. It is not for an engineering expert to give their evidence to the court that “the meaning of this provision is this” with the court to choose between two competing constructions, each put forward by an expert. An expert engineer can give their expert evidence as to how a reasonably competent engineer would go about the task of performing a Category 3 check, and what is understood as required by the profession. But the legal meaning of the words in a written instrument, even if it is a British Standard, is not something upon which an expert can give admissible evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I start the analysis of the authorities by referring to the three different tests for the finding of a duty of care. These are different routes of analysis, although upon examination, they may not lead to substantially different results. They are the assumption of responsibility test; the three-part test; and the incremental test. Multiplex puts its case on the first preliminary issue squarely as satisfying the assumption of responsibility test. As expressed by Lord Bingham at [4], in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc </span>[2006] UKHL (which I consider further at [142] below), the first step is to ask if there is an assumption of responsibility. It is only if the answer to that is “No” that further consideration is called for. On any analysis, one ought only in the rarest of cases to find that a different answer is thrown up by each of the tests; and this is not likely to be such a rare case. Lord Mance at [86] in the same case stated that all approaches would often lead to the same result, although this was not necessarily so. Application of any of the tests is likely, in my judgment, in the majority of cases, to lead to the same answer. </p>

That is a correct analysis of Multiplex’s pleaded case, clearly shown by the terms of paragraphs 43 and 44 of the Amended Particulars of Claim (which are set out at [50] and [51] above).

I put on one side cases in which the sub-contractor causes physical damage to property of the building owner, where the claim does not depend on an assumption of responsibility by the sub-contractor to the building owner; though the sub- contractor may be protected from liability by a contractual exemption clause authorised by the building owner.

In that case, the House of Lords considered a claim arising out of instructions to change a father’s will, following a family reconciliation, to include legacies in favour of his two daughters, who had previously been disinherited after a quarrel. The reconciliation meant that the father decided the daughters would inherit after all. Those instructions were not, however, implemented by the defendants and the testator died. The appeal by the defendants to the House of Lords, after the Court of Appeal had held they owed the plaintiff daughters a duty of care, was dismissed. Lord Mustill dissented but in doing so, he explained that there were certain situations where the contractual arrangements were “so strong, so complex” that this would exclude the recognition of tortious duties between parties that were not contractually linked. He stated (at 279): </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“If one asks how the solicitor came to be involved in the case the answer is that by accepting the retainer he promised to draw the will with care and diligence. It is therefore proper to enquire whether this source of involvement, and this alone, should create whatever remedies may be given to the plaintiffs for his failure to do what he said. I do not here refer to the argument, forcefully addressed by Professor Jolowicz Q.C., to the effect that so far from the existence of a contract between the testator and the solicitor supporting a tortious cause of action in the plaintiffs, it operates to exclude it. This posits that contractual and tortious responsibilities occupy exclusive domains, and that where the complaint is of a failure to do a promised job of work the law of delict must necessarily be the wrong domain. The argument was advanced before your Lordships gave judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd. </span>[1994] 3 W.L.R. 761, and in the light of the conclusions there expressed cannot I think be any longer sustained. <span style="text-decoration:underline">This is certainly not to deny</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">that where the act or omission complained of occurs between persons who</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">have deliberately involved themselves in a network of commercial or</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">professional contractual relations, such for example as may exist between the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">numerous parties involved in contracts for large building or engineering</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">works, the contractual framework may be so strong, so complex and so</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">detailed as to exclude the recognition of delictual duties between parties who</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">are not already connected by contractual links</span>: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Pacific Associates Inc. v Baxter </span>[1990] 1 Q.B. 993, This aspect of the law is far from being fully developed and I need not explore it here.

	    <p style="margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“The touchstone of liability is not the state of mind of the defendant. An objective test means that the primary focus must be on things said or done by the defendant or on his behalf in dealings with the plaintiff. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Obviously, the impact of what a defendant</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">says or does must be judged in the light of the relevant contextual scene. Subject to</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">this qualification the primary focus must be on exchanges (in which term I include</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">statements and conduct) which cross the line between the defendant and the plaintiff.</span> Sometimes such an issue arises in a simple bilateral relationship. In the present case a triangular position is under consideration: the prospective franchisees, the franchisor company, and the director. In such a case where the personal liability of the director is in question the internal arrangements between a director and his company cannot be the foundation of a director's personal liability in tort. The enquiry must be whether the director, or anybody on his behalf, conveyed directly or indirectly to the prospective franchisees that the director assumed personal responsibility towards the prospective franchisees. An example of such a case being established is <span style="font-style:italic">Fairline Shipping Corp. v. Adamson</span> [1975] Q.B. 180. The plaintiffs sued the defendant, a director of a warehousing company, for the negligent storage of perishable goods. The contract was between the plaintiff and the company. But Kerr J. (later Kerr L.J.) held that the director was personally liable. That conclusion was possible because the director wrote to the customer, and rendered an invoice, creating the clear impression that he was personally answerable for the services. If he had chosen to write on company notepaper, and rendered an invoice on behalf of the company, the necessary factual foundation for finding an assumption of risk would have been absent. A case on the other side of the line is <span style="font-style:italic">Trevor Ivory Ltd. v. Anderson.</span> This case concerned negligent advice given by a one-man company to a commercial fruit grower. Despite proper application of the spray it killed the grower's fruit crop. The company was found liable in contract and tort. The question was whether the beneficial owner and director of the company was personally liable. The plaintiff had undoubtedly relied on the expertise of the director in contracting with the company. The New Zealand Court of Appeal unanimously concluded that the defendant was not personally liable. McGechan J., who analysed the evidence in detail, said, at p. 532, that there was merely "routine involvement" by a director for and through his company. He said that there "was no singular feature which would justify belief that Mr. Ivory was accepting a personal commitment, as opposed to the known company obligation." That was the basis of the decision of the Court of Appeal. In his 1997 Hamlyn Lecture Lord Cooke of Thorndon commented that if the plaintiff in <span style="font-style:italic">Trevor Ivory Ltd. v. Anderson</span> "had reasonably thought that it was dealing with an individual, the result might have been different:" see <span style="font-style:italic">Taking Salomon Further, Turning Points of the Common Law</span>, p. 18, note 50. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Such a finding would have required evidence of statements or conduct</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">crossing the line which conveyed to the plaintiff that the defendant was assuming</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">personal liability</span>.” </p>

In that case, it was held that a classification society did not owe a duty of care to cargo owners in respect of statements made by its surveyor concerning the seaworthiness of a vessel, a bulk carrier. Under the bills of lading which incorporated the Hague Rules, the shipowners owed the cargo owners a non-delegable duty to make the vessel seaworthy at the inception of the voyage. The vessel put into port during a voyage when she developed a crack in her hull. The surveyor of the classification society inspected the vessel, instructed repairs and permitted onward continuation of the voyage, which sank with the total loss of the cargo. The House of Lords decided the case on the basis of proximity and whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care of this nature upon classification societies. One feature that I would emphasise in this case is the statement (at 230) in the speech of Lord Steyn of the purpose of classification societies. “My Lords, for more than 150 years classification societies have classified merchant ships in the interests of safeguarding life and ships at sea”. I draw attention to this because there is a safety element, too, in the performance of a Category 3 check. This is both clear from the terms of the British Standard and is also agreed by the experts. It is clearly sensible, for the design of complex and/or innovative temporary works, to have those checked by an independent entity, in this case (namely Category 3) by a professional wholly independent of the designing organisation. It is also a requirement of the British Standard that this be done. It is clear from the ratio of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Nicholas H </span>that the safety aspect of this is not a determinative factor in favour of there being a duty of care.</p>

If a duty is held to exist in this case as between the classification society and cargo owners, classification societies would become potential defendants in many cases.

First, there are cases in which one party can accurately be said to have assumed responsibility for what is said or done to another, the paradigm situation being a relationship having all the indicia of contract save consideration. <span style="font-style:italic">Hedley Byrne</span> would, but for the express disclaimer, have been such a case. <span style="font-style:italic">White v Jones</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Merrett</span>, although the relationship was more remote, can be seen as analogous. Thus, like Colman J (whose methodology was commended by Paul Mitchell and Charles Mitchell, "Negligence Liability for Pure Economic Loss (2005) 121 LQR 194, 199), I think it is correct to regard an assumption of responsibility as a sufficient but not a necessary condition of liability, a first test which, if answered positively, may obviate the need for further enquiry. If answered negatively, further consideration is called for.  </p>

Whilst recognising, of course, the importance of the underlying general principles common to the whole field of negligence, I think the law has now moved in the direction of attaching greater significance to the more traditional categorisation of distinct and recognisable situations as guides to the existence, the scope and the limits of the varied duties of care which the law imposes." </p>

At best they are but labels or phrases descriptive of the very different factual situations which can exist in particular cases and which must be carefully examined in each case before it can be pragmatically determined whether a duty of care exists and, if so, what is the scope and extent of that duty. If this conclusion involves a return to the traditional categorisation of cases as pointing to the existence and scope of any duty of care, as my noble and learned friend Lord Bridge of Harwich suggests, I think this is infinitely preferable to recourse to somewhat wide generalisations which leave their practical application matters of difficulty and uncertainty." </p>

These phrases are often illuminating but discrimination is needed to identify the factual situations in which they provide useful guidance. <span style="text-decoration:underline">For example, in a case in</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">which A provides information to C which he knows will be relied upon by D, it is</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">useful to ask whether A assumed responsibility to D</span>: <span style="font-style:italic">Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners </span>Ltd [1964] AC 465: <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Eric S Bush</span> [1990] 1 AC 831.

Or in a case in which A provided information to B for the purpose of enabling him to make one kind of decision, it may be useful to ask whether he assumed responsibility for its use for a different kind of decision: <span style="font-style:italic">Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</span> [1990] 2 AC 605. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In these cases in which the loss has been</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">caused by the claimant's reliance on information provided by the defendant, it is</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">critical to decide whether the defendant (rather than someone else) assumed</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">responsibility for the accuracy of the information to the claimant (rather than to</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">someone else) or for its use by the claimant for one purpose (rather than another).

In truth, the case is one in which, but for the alleged absence of the necessary relationship, there would be no dispute that a duty to take care existed and the relationship is what makes it fair, just and reasonable to impose the duty.  </p>

Banks offering what are called “Sharia-compliant” funds must structure them in such a way as to comply with these principles. The claimants were commercial banks based in Saudi Arabia and London; the second claimant was the subsidiary of the first. The defendant was a bank which established an income fund which invested in commercial equipment and received rental payments. The claimants and the bank cooperated in the establishment of a fund. The issues in the case were that the claimants asserted that the bank failed to exercise the necessary degree of care in analysing and evaluating the information about the leases which it received from the asset managers, and hence negligently advised the fund to pay more for the leases than they were, in reality, worth. They also asserted that the bank owed a duty of care in tort directly to the fund.  </p>

Of course, tortious liability is generally subject to less strict statutory limitation bars than contractual liability (as is demonstrated in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Henderson</span> case at 174F to G), but that may seem a questionable reason, in terms of principle, for justifying a co-extensive tortious duty where there is a contractual duty.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">Some apparent support for the view that a tortious duty of care normally has no part to play in the context of a commercial contractual relationship may be found in observations of the Privy Council in a judgment given by Lord Scarman in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tai Hing</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd</span> [1986] AC 80 at 107, quoted by Lord Goff of Chieveley in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Henderson</span> case at 186C to F. Further, in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Williams</span> case at 837F, Lord Steyn said that, at least in the current state of English contract law, "the law of tort, as the general law, has to fill an essential gap-filling role".  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">On the other hand, there are strong countervailing arguments the other way, which appear to me, again, to apply equally to points (i) and (ii). If a duty of care would otherwise exist in tort, as part of the general law, it is not immediately easy to see why the mere fact that the adviser and the claimant have entered into a contract, or a series of contracts, should of itself be enough to dispense with that duty. If a claimant is better off relying on a tortious duty, it is not readily apparent why a claimant who receives gratuitous advice should be better off than a claimant who pays for the advice (and therefore would normally have the benefit of a contractual duty), unless, of course, the contract so provides. One might expect the question to be determined by reference to the contractual relationship on the normal basis, namely whether the nature terms and circumstances of the contract(s) expressly or impliedly lead to the conclusion that the parties have agreed that there will be no tortious duty.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">These arguments have to be assessed in the light of the decision of the House of Lords and, in particular the analysis of Lord Goff, in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Henderson</span> case. It seems clear from the closely reasoned passage in his speech at 184B to 194E that the issue has been resolved, at least in principle, in favour of the latter of the two views that I have summarised. In other words, "the common law is not antipathetic to concurrent liability". At 186C to F, Lord Goff considered and explained Lord Scarman's observation in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tai Hing</span> case. He went on to say that a claimant who is owed a contractual duty of care may also (or alternatively) be entitled to invoke a tortious duty of care, unless it would be "so inconsistent with the applicable contract that, in accordance with ordinary principle, the parties must be taken to have agreed that the tortious remedy is to be limited or excluded" – see at 193H and 194A to B.  </p>

As mentioned above, the principle upon which both points (i) and (ii) rest is essentially this, that the law of tort should not be invoked in a commercial context, at least where there are no gaps, where the parties have contractually provided for a duty, or a chain of duties. More importantly, Lord Goff's reasoning in relation to point (ii) appears to embody the same approach as that he applied to point (i).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">At 193B to C, Lord Goff said "the law of tort is the general law out of which the parties can, if they wish, contract", and that the correct approach is to determine whether there would otherwise be a tortious liability arising out of an assumption of responsibility and concomitant reliance, and "then to inquire whether or not that liability is excluded by the contract because the latter is inconsistent with it". That is essentially the approach he adopted when he turned to consider the contention that "the indirect Names and the managing agents, as parties to the chain of contracts…must be taken to have thereby structured their relationship so as to exclude any duty of care owed directly by the managing agents to the indirect Names in tort" – 195A to B. He then said that he saw "no reason in principle" why an adviser could not owe, at the same time, a contractual duty of care to the next person in the chain and a tortious duty of care to another person further along the chain. He went on, in a passage more fully quoted by Longmore LJ, to observe at 195G that "in many cases in which a contractual chain comparable to that in the present case is constructed it may well prove to be inconsistent with an assumption of responsibility which has the effect of…short-circuiting the contractual structure put in place by the parties".  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">So far as "gap-filling" is concerned, Lord Steyn's observation in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Williams</span> case cannot mean that a tortious duty can only arise where there is a "liability gap": that would be inconsistent with the whole basis of the reasoning and decision in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Henderson</span> case. Lord Steyn's point in this connection was, I think, that there are cases involving contractual duties, where, if the law of tort cannot be invoked, as a matter of policy, there would be a "liability gap" which would be unacceptable (as in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Smith v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Eric S Bush</span> [1990] 1 AC 831 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">White v Jones</span> [1995] 2 AC 207). That aspect of the law of tort has no bearing on the present case: the fact that the law of tort can be invoked where there is a "liability gap" in certain exceptional cases does not mean that it can never be invoked in a case where there is no "liability gap".  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">Thus, the question in a point (ii) case, as in a point (i) case, is whether, in relation to the advice he gave, the adviser assumed responsibility to the claimant, in the light of the contractual context, as well as all the other circumstances, in which the advice was given. The way in which Lord Goff expressed himself in more than one place in his speech in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Henderson</span> case, including some of the brief passages I have quoted, suggests that it is for the adviser to establish that the contractual context negatives an assumption of responsibility, not for the claimant to show that the assumption survives notwithstanding that context.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">Like Longmore LJ, I do not think that the answer can depend on whether one asks first whether, absent the contractual context, there would be an assumption of responsibility, and secondly whether the positive answer to that question is vitiated by the contractual context; or whether one asks the single question whether, in all the circumstances, including the contractual context, there was an assumption of responsibility. Whether or not one adopts the two-stage approach may depend on the facts of the particular case, or even on the way the case has been argued.  </p>

The judgment considers this between [41] to [60], considering both the assumption of responsibility test and the three-part test, and the judge concluded that no duty of care arose under either.

While this was not a communication to Arrowhead, the information which it contains must have been obvious to Arrowhead whose role was to provide finance which was not obtainable from more readily available sources, and is therefore part of the relevant background against which the parties' conduct is to be assessed. Similarly, while Arrowhead probably did not know of the particular express exclusion in KPMG's general terms of business of any third party rights, this was not an unusual term and was the sort of term which a reasonable businessman would expect to find there.  </p>

There was a professional relationship between the parties, albeit one that was not governed by a contract.

Although the existence of a contract is not entirely determinative, it is a highly relevant feature. In my judgment, the closer the situation under scrutiny is to a more conventional or habitual businesslike relationship governed by contractual terms agreed by the parties, the less likely the law will be to answer the questions concerning assumption of responsibility and fairness, justness and reasonableness, in favour of a claimant such as Multiplex who has no contractual relationship with RNP.  </p>

This is because of the purpose for which the Category 3 check is produced. There are a variety of documents that Dunne had to produce to Multiplex in order to be permitted to commence the temporary works; the certificate was but one part.

B also had a contract direct with C (Multiplex) to provide a far wider design and scope of works, of which the temporary works formed but one part.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also considered these conclusions against Lord Bingham’s five observations in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc. </span>These are set out at [144] above. Firstly, this is not a situation where the parties have a relationship with all the indicia of a contract, save consideration. The relationship between “the parties” (that term applying to RNP and Multiplex) does not have the indicia of a contract. This is a situation where the parties do indeed have an actual contract; however, neither of those parties is Multiplex, as the contract is between RNP and Dunne. Secondly, application of the objective test does not assist Multiplex. Objectively, construction professionals would expect the framework of carefully organised contractual obligations to govern their legal relations with one another. Thirdly, this is a novel situation and the three-fold test is accepted by Lord Bingham as providing no straightforward answer. Proximity and fairness are merely convenient labels to attach to the different circumstances which require detailed examination. Matters of wide generalisation do not greatly assist. Even if the three-fold test is adopted, and considering each and every one of the convenient labels, it would not be just, reasonable, or fair to impose a duty of care of the type contended for by Multiplex upon RNP. Fourthly, the incremental test does not provide any assistance to Multiplex, and to be fair to Mr Nissen, he does not rely upon it. Fifthly, the outcome that I have identified is sensible and just. It also results in a situation where RNP is not held liable, for a potentially unlimited liability (in this case said by Multiplex to be restricted to the level of its insurance cover, but only as a result of RNP’s liquidation) on a major and very complex construction project, the details of which were never provided to RNP at all. All RNP was ever provided with (by Dunne) was a very limited set of design information so that it could check the calculations.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Expanding further upon why it would not be just, reasonable or fair to impose a duty of care upon RNP of the type contended for by Multiplex, the following point should be borne in mind. Multiplex chose to contract with Dunne on highly detailed terms. Parties choose with whom they contract, and they also choose whether they require those parties to have any insurance for their design obligations. Multiplex has a cause of action against Dunne, a company that is still in legal existence (albeit one which is in administration). Denial of a duty of care does not mean Multiplex is left without any remedy. Although enforceability of that remedy against Dunne may be a different matter, the law does not determine matters such as justness, and fairness, based on the financial durability of a sub-contractor such as Dunne.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I am reinforced in my conclusions above that RNP did not (on an objective test) assume responsibility to Multiplex, by considering the very modest level of the fee. Of course, that is not a determinative factor; in many of the cases, no fee at all was charged (such as the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Burgess v Lejonvarn</span> case, or in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hedley Byrne</span> itself). However, it is part of the factual circumstances in this case. Further, this is an entirely conventional engagement by a sub-contractor of a design checker to carry out one specific task, namely the Category 3 check of the slipform rig, required by the British Standard in order that the sub-contractor, with full design obligations to the main contractor, could produce a design of the temporary works (of which the slipform rig formed a part) which complied with the CDM Regulations and which the main contractor would then permit to commence. This is not a factually unusual, or less conventional case in the same way that, for example, some of the cases such as <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Burgess v Lejonvarn,</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hedley Byrne</span> itself, or <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Riyad Bank v Ahli United Bank </span>could be described. Those were rather more unusual situations. The instant case with RNP, Dunne and Multiplex is not unusual, and is an entirely conventional arrangement in a major project such as this. Construction projects often involve a great many parties, and the careful arrangement of obligations between them all, one with another, are contained in highly complicated contractual provisions. Some of those parties are central players in the project, such as the main contractor and sub-contractor. Some are players with lesser roles. I would characterise RNP’s role in the latter category.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Where this case does, perhaps, fall out of the norm is the sequence of events following production of the certificates themselves by RNP. One would hope that it would be unusual that sub-contractors such as Dunne remove or delete parts of such certificates, before providing them to the main contractor to obtain permission to commence the temporary works. However, that unusual feature does not form part of my analysis of a duty of care above, which has been performed on the basis of the certificates as produced and provided to Dunne. I accept that there are factually specific issues that occurred after 25 January 2016 that would, if the answers to the preliminary issues were different, require careful resolution at a subsequent trial.  </p>

Further, to adopt the wording of the judge in that case, it is inconceivable that a reasonable businessman (as it is an objective test) would have considered that RNP was voluntarily assuming an unlimited responsibility towards the main contractor on a highly complex construction project, or to any other party involved in that project other than the one with whom RNP was in direct contract, namely Dunne. If the question had been raised in some notional conversation between RNP and Multiplex, it is obvious that RNP would not have been prepared to accept such an unlimited responsibility.  </p>

This much is clear from the British Standard. However, that is not sufficient to justify the imposition of a duty of care. I do not consider that, for the three-part test, Multiplex satisfies the proximity test in any event. On a major construction project such as this, with a careful and interlinked series of different contracts between main contractor, sub-contractor and consultants (and also potentially sub-sub-contractors too), in my judgment RNP was not sufficiently proximate to the main contractor (or to the TWC, if a distinction is to be made between them). However, even if I am wrong about that, and if Multiplex were to be considered sufficiently proximate, I have found that it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on RNP which could result in unlimited liability to Multiplex when it would have been obvious, to all concerned, that RNP chose to contract only with Dunne. It would also have been similarly obvious that RNP’s contractual relationship with Dunne may contain limitations on the extent of RNP’s liability, and potentially an exclusion of liability to third parties. It would also be obvious that a Category 3 check, which is essentially a desk-top exercise performed on a limited range of documents sent to the checker, is itself a limited exercise in terms of assessing the validity of the calculations. The project upon which Dunne was engaged was highly complex, with a great number of parties involved, on a variety of different contractual bases. Failure or defects in the temporary works could potentially have very widespread consequences on the entire project. </p>

The function of such a checker is to assess whether the design brief has been complied with, and if the calculations are correct, or lead to supportable conclusions (the experts agree that an alternative route to the original calculations may be used, which is one of the reasons the checker is not supposed to be given the original calculations from the designer). A main contractor with a detailed and comprehensive contract with its sub-contractor including design obligations would normally be expected to issue proceedings directly against that subcontractor. There may be an arbitration clause, something present in many construction contracts. If in litigation, the main contractor could bring in other entities directly, including a design checker, with whom it has never had direct contractual relations, then this will complicate the recovery process enormously. Fairness and justness would be achieved by the sub-contractor defendant, if so advised in litigation, bringing in parties with whom it has contractual relations by way of Part 20 proceedings.

Dunne was also prohibited from assigning or transferring any benefit or obligation under the agreement without the consent of RNP under clause 13.1.(3).

It is plain that it is to be an objective test. In my judgment, an objective test does not leave room for the subjective knowledge of the person performing (or supervising) the check, in terms of main contractor identity, to be relevant.

The basis of this claim by Multiplex is weak, and there was no evidence called by either party relating to any direct contract between RNP and Multiplex. Indeed, there was no direct contact between those parties until sometime in June 2016, after the second certificate had been issued. Both the certificates were sent directly by RNP to Dunne. Mr Markham did not know that Multiplex was the main contractor until much later.  </p>

He submitted that RNP accepted this offer when it agreed to perform the Category 3 check at Dunne’s request. He submitted that there was an intention on the part of both Multiplex and RNP to enter into direct contractual relations between them, and that there was consideration provided by Multiplex for this. This consideration was payment by Multiplex to Dunne of the sums paid for the temporary works design (as that design required a Category 3 check).  </p>

There is no evidence of any authority being provided by Multiplex to Dunne, the sub-contractor, for Dunne to enter into any contract on Multiplex’s behalf. Indeed, the structure of the sub-contract between Multiplex and Dunne is contrary to any such authority having been provided to Dunne to do so. Mr Bailey’s own witness statement contains evidence that Multiplex contemplated entering into a contract directly with a Category 3 checker, and he even went so far as obtaining a fee proposal from RBG for that purpose. However, his colleague told him that Dunne had contractual responsibility for this under the terms of the Sub-Contract. He therefore proceeded no further. This evidence is inconsistent with an analysis of Dunne contracting with RNP on behalf of Multiplex, and is also inconsistent with any authority having been provided to Dunne to do so.  </p>

That is a different contractual structure to that which would pertain were Dunne to have been granted specific authorisation by Multiplex to conclude a contract between RNP and Multiplex.

As a single example, in clause 2.1.3 it is agreed that “The Sub-Contractor shall pass to the Contractor all approvals received by the SubContractor in connection with the Statutory Requirements”.

The definitions in clause 1.1 specify Multiplex as the Contractor, and Multiplex’s “employees and agents and all other persons employed or engaged on or in connection with the Main Contract Works or any party of them…..excluding….Sub-Contractor’s persons”. If Dunne were contracting with RNP as Multiplex’s agent, Dunne would become both the SubContractor and one of the Contractor’s Persons, a wholly novel and, in my judgment, untenable status. </p>

That statement is correct; it is insufficient to assist Multiplex in this respect. In particular, where, as here, there are detailed contractual arrangements in place between different parties, with multiple contracts and multiple parties, the “contractual setting” must be considered carefully. Such a setting does not, of itself, justify imposing contractual relations where there are none. In this case, the conscious allocation of contractual responsibility by the parties specifically imposed upon Dunne the obligation of obtaining a Category 3 check, a sub-contractor to Multiplex. By Dunne having performed that obligation, the law does not impose contractual liability to Multiplex upon RNP, or clothe statements made by RNP in the certificates as warranties given directly to Multiplex.  </p>

Mr Nissen suggested the consideration comprised payment by Multiplex to Dunne for Dunne’s own sub-contract works (including design) that would somehow cover, or include as an element within it, the payment Dunne would be making, or would have made, to RNP, for RNP’s services. However, I reject that analysis. I do not consider that payments made by Multiplex to Dunne under the sub-contract, to which Dunne was contractually entitled in its own right as sub-contractor for works done, can properly be categorised as consideration for a separate contract between Multiplex and RNP.  </p>

There would be a wide variety of entities involved in such a project. Design checks of this nature could, potentially, be required by a wide variety of entities on such a project, for example by a sub-contractor (as here), or a specialist sub-sub-contractor, the main contractor, or even another design consultant.

There was no contractual purpose in doing so, at least so far as Multiplex was concerned. There is nothing in the contractual arrangements between Dunne and RNP in this case that would take the case, in any way, out of the norm for conventional construction projects, namely that Dunne was the sub-contractor to Multiplex, and utilised the services of others (whether as sub-sub-contractors, designers or consultants) to perform the sub-contract works, including obtaining a Category 3 check from RNP. The scope and extent of Dunne’s contractual obligations is clearly set out in the sub-contract itself. The JCT form of sub-contract is a highly developed and complex arrangement of contractual obligations and allocation of risk, as is the main contract too. It would go entirely outside that detailed contractual framework to construe statements by RNP within the certificates, or the certificates themselves, as constituting warranties given directly by RNP to Multiplex. The fact that RNP knew the certificates were required for the design does not lead to the finding that Multiplex seeks. </p>

Multiplex’s route to recovery against RNP, if there were to be such a route in law, would have been through the avenue of the first preliminary issue. I have rejected that in my answer to that issue. The second route contended for by Multiplex, that the certificates contain warranties in Multiplex’s favour given directly to it by RNP, is one that is not open to Multiplex as a matter of conventional analysis.
