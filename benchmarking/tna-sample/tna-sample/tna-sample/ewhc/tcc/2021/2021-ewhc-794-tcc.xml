	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">This is my judgment following a trial of preliminary issues between the Claimant, Balfour Beatty Regional Construction Limited (“BB”) and the Defendant, Van Elle Limited (“VE”). At the time of the events with which I am concerned, BB was known as Mansell Construction Services Limited. I shall nonetheless refer to it throughout as BB. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The preliminary issues arise in this way: BB was engaged as main contractor for a construction project at a site at Wincomblee Road, Walker Riverside, Newcastle upon Tyne (“the Site”). The Site adjoined the north side of the River Tyne. The owner of the Site was a company originally known as Duco Limited which then changed its name to Technip Umbilicals Limited (“Technip”). It engaged BB to design and construct a sub-sea cable manufacturing facility at the Site. It is common ground that this facility comprised a building which housed a Vertical Helix Assembly Machine (“VHAM”) together with an overhead crane, mechanical and electrical services and, among other structures external to the VHAM Building, two carousels, being the North and South Carousels respectively. The carousels were structures which sat on platforms and their function was to store the cables produced by the VHAM until such time as they were ready to be deployed to specially designed shipping vessels. Those vessels would then transport the cables from the Site to their intended destination. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The structures to be built by BB required a considerable amount of foundational piling. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">It is common ground that BB engaged VE to undertake the relevant piling work which included piling for the VHAM Building and the North and South Carousels, as well as other structures. It is further common ground that those piling works were carried out by VE between about 15 June 2012 and 15 August 2013. It is further common ground that the agreed total price for those works once completed, was £1.239m. There were some further works in early 2014 in the form of contiguous wall piling. It is yet further common ground that all of the foundational piling was required to be of a type known as Continuous Flight Auger (“CFA”). This refers to the piling method which involves injection of concrete through the rig’s screw as it returns to the surface, having drilled down to the required depth. The first piling to be done was in relation to the North Carousel, followed by the VHAM Building. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Shortly after installation, excessive settlement was discovered at the North Carousel piling. BB agreed with Technip that in the first instance, the former would remediate the settlement without prejudice to the question of liability. This involved the dismantlement or removal of the North Carousel itself which had already been installed by then, removing the relevant piling work, replacing it and then reinstating the North Carousel, along with associated works. Technip has intimated a claim against BB for what might be described as business interruption losses as a result of the settlement and the remedial works. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">BB in turn intimated a claim against VE to recover the remedial costs and obtain an indemnity against any liability established against it by Technip for further losses. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">Although, following completion of the piling work, both parties signed a formal sub- contract based on a modified version of the 2011 edition of the JCT Design and Build SubContract (“the Sub-Contract”), the Sub-Contract did not govern the parties’ rights and obligations in relation to the North Carousel piling; </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">Instead, the contract governing that piling was constituted by a written quotation from VE dated 28 May 2012 and accepted by BB by its conduct in providing a piling platform to VE and permitting it to start work at that part of the Site; I refer to this alleged contract as "the 28 May Contract"; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">For its part, BB denies that there was the 28 May Contract and contends that the North Carousel piling works were included in the Sub-Contract. Further, to the extent that there had been any prior contract governing the North Carousel piling works only, this was in any event superseded and replaced by the Sub-Contract. Finally, if (contrary to its case) the North Carousel works were governed by the 28 May Contract and no other, BB contends that Clauses 6.6 and 6.7, properly construed, are of much more limited effect than that contended for by VE. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">By a Deed executed between the parties on or about 12 September 2019, they agreed to have resolved, in the first instance, the issues which I have outlined above. On 9 October 2019 BB had served its Particulars of Claim, and a Defence was served on 5 December 2019. A Re-Amended Reply was served on 15 September 2020. Those statements of case are essentially limited to these initial preliminary issues. </p>

First, VE added in the estimated costs of a contiguous piled wall.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Mansell advised that due to the Vham tunnel construction running through the building the intended programme was to commence on the building footprint then move onto the internal piles as far as possible. This is dependant on the working space required to construct the tunnel. The remainder of the piles within the building would have to be completed once the tunnel is constructed and the area backfilled. John Blyth advised that rather than let the piling rig leave site and then have to pay to remobilise it was Mansell preference to rework the programme to try and keep the rig working by carrying out the piling to the carousel bases and the machine rails. These areas have not yet been fully designed or costed Mansell/Shadbolts are to focus on the North Carousel and the machine rails at the North end of the building and forward details of these to Van Elle for costing. The initial thoughts were that the loadings would be generally the same as the building for which we already have rates per pile. R.Harm confirmed that the order was being placed on the building only and that if we are to work in the external areas this will be treat as variations and instructed accordingly.”</span>

However, on a fair reading, it was clearly contemplating a situation where the VHAM Building piling work could not be undertaken all in one go, as it were. There would have to be a break in piling operations there, and the idea was that the rig already present on site could be used in the intervening period for piling at the North Carousel location. </p>

Instead, piling would commence at the North Carousel location. There was no logistical difficulty in doing this because the VHAM Building and North Carousel sites would use piling of the same size, and the same rig could be used for each. </p>

There is also a reference to a provisional start date of the week commencing 11 June. This reference has been the subject of some debate which I will deal with below. But one thing is clear; as everyone knew by that stage, the works which were intended to start first were the North Carousel piling works, as indeed they actually did, on 15 June, as we shall see. The reference to remeasurement is important because, at the end of the day, VE would be paid according to the actual number of piles sunk, not the amount initially estimated. </p>

It is not in dispute that as at late 2013, it was thought that all of the work was done. In fact, the contiguous wall piling, a further item which had been earlier excluded, came back into the picture in early 2014. It was subsequently executed but it can be ignored for present purposes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The relevant overarching legal principle is that stated in paragraph 21 of BB’s written opening and is not in dispute. It is that the contract must be interpreted objectively by asking what a reasonable person, with all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties when they entered into the contract, would have understood the language of the contract to mean. The unitary exercise of contractual interpretation involves an iterative process by which each suggested interpretation is checked against the provisions of the contract and its commercial consequences are investigated. The court may take into account the existing factual matrix but may not take account of any subjective interpretation on the part of one or both parties.  </p>

That is hardly surprising where, on any view, the intended works to be carried out by the nominated piling sub-contractor were to supply and install the foundational piling for the buildings and structures which were themselves the subject of the Main Contract. It is not as if, for example, the cost of the piling would in principle differ as between locations. The only question was the diameter and length of the relevant piles. The actual cost of the piling was referable in essence only to the size of the piles, leaving aside matters like obstructions found in the ground which would require additional work, and testing. The proof of that principle of “measured work” can be seen from the invoices. The common intention for a single contract can also be derived from the fact that BB was seeking pricing for (at least) the VHAM Building and the North and South Carousels - the only reason it did not get a priced quote in the early stages for the North Carousel was because there was not sufficient detailed information as to the piling specification. </p>

This is the “contract sum build up” which was one of the numbered documents in the LOI and then in the Sub-Contract in the total sum, as amended, of £363,600, the 20 March Figure. But the fact that it is all about uniform rates for piles of a particular size, regardless of location, is proved by Invoice 1 which is concerned with the North Carousel works and which uses the rates from the 20 March Quotation. Indeed, if one looks carefully at the (cumulative) breakdown on Invoice 2 and compares it with the 20 March Quotation, it has reproduced the terms of the latter almost exactly, and simply puts in a zero where a particular item is not used, instead of omitting it. See, for example, the 600 mm X 17m piles and the tension bars. </p>

Paragraph 7.19 (set out above) stated the likelihood (as it proved to be) that the rates would apply regardless of location and it was thought that even the same pile dimensions would apply across the VHAM Building and the North Carousel because the loading (which determines pile size) would generally be the same. At that point, because of the tunnelling works for the VHAM Building which would cause a hiatus in  the piling works, the intention was that piling could be undertaken in the intervening period at the North Carousel using the pile rig already on site. On that footing, the notion that there should be separate contracts, much less (on VE’s case) contracts with different underlying terms and conditions, makes very little sense. That it was not intended that there should be more than one contract is shown at the end of paragraph 7.19 which refers to one order, for the VHAM Building (originally thought to go first altogether) and work in the external areas would be treated as variations thereto. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">It is true that the emergence of this evidence was to some extent made likely by what Mr Handley had said in paragraph 11 of his witness statement, and no objection was taken to his crossexamination (and that of Mr Hughes) on the point. Nonetheless, I think that Mr Moran QC is technically correct to say that even if heralded earlier, a submission based on this evidence is not really of the “private dictionary” variety permissible in the exercise of contractual interpretation, and to which I made reference in paragraphs 74 - 75 above. So it is not admissible on the “comfort” issue, save perhaps to underline the fairly obvious point that in relation to an intended sub-contract of this size, one would normally expect commercial parties to require some clear communication of contractual commitment before the start of work. Where there is to be a formal sub-contract executed at some point in the future and after the work has started, a LOI is a classic example of such a commitment in the meantime. But all of that is plain from the documents discussed above anyway. Accordingly, this particular witness evidence does not take the matter any further and I do not rely upon it for the purpose of concluding as I have done, above. </p>

As to paragraph 3 of the LOI, and in the context of the Main Works referred to in paragraph 2 of the LOI, “the design, supply installation and supervision of the CFA Piling Works” plainly means the CFA piling necessary for the Main Works. No other interpretation makes sense. VE submits that it is a wholly vague expression; for example, it might refer to some of the required piling but not all of it. I do not accept that. The Main Works referred to in paragraph 2 set the scene for the contemplated single piling Sub-Contract. That contemplated Sub-Contract then sets the scene for the LOI which, like most LOI’s of this kind, provides a contractually binding means of payment until the expected Sub-Contract is executed which then replaces it. Thus far, therefore, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the LOI should be interpreted to include the North Carousel works, not exclude them. They also reflect, in my view, the reference to the Main and Sub-Contract Works described in paragraphs 1.0 and 1.1 of the Management Plan. </p>

In other words, again, it was intended that there would be one Sub-Contract only. At that point, of course, having regard to prior correspondence, there was insufficient information to enable BB to instruct VE to go ahead on the North Carousel works. This was no more than a timing point and the necessary information had been provided by 1 June.

This contention is allied to paragraph 13 of the LOI. The formulation there is a familiar way for LOIs to impose a financial ceiling on the contractual commitment pending the making of the Sub-Contract, which can be increased by consent.

In my judgment, it plainly can. It would cover more than the North Carousel works although, it is true, it would not be sufficient, on the face of earlier quotes, to cover both the North Carousel and the VHAM Building. This is not, however, an insurmountable obstacle because increases could be (and were in fact) sought. At this point, it is also worth remembering that at the end of the day, this is all about measured piling according to consistently applied rates. That supports the notion that the £363,600 can (and should) be seen as a contractual maximum which could be increased and which does not inevitably point to the LOI’s scope by reference to particular works and not others, even if the 20 March Quotation was at the time intended to capture the VHAM Building works. Yet further, the object of the clear need for an enabling order to get the works started supports the notion of the £363,600 being little more (by then) than a contractual maximum. </p>

Although some reliance was placed upon it by BB, it does seem to me to be inadmissible on the question of what paragraph 13 of the LOI, with its reference to £363,600 was meant to cover, which is a matter of interpretation, unless, once more, it is to be viewed as admissible shared understanding of the “private dictionary” variety. Here, it might arguably fall within that concept. However, it is not pleaded as such, as Mr Moran QC pointed out and it could have been, since the evidence of the email exchange of 8 June had obviously been available to BB for some time. Both because of that and because, without extended argument, its true admissibility is not beyond doubt, I have proceeded on the basis that this is inadmissible evidence. In fact, and as with the “comfort” issue, the relevant objective evidence is clear enough anyway. </p>

It is not suggested that by 1 June, there were not in fact the relevant drawings and other information required for the North Carousel works because there were, subject to some minor points resolved in the week commencing 11 June.

The reference to a start date of the week commencing 11 June is of some importance as I have already noted because it makes quite clear that the works in question were to start then. The only works to start then were the North Carousel works. Mr Moran QC suggested that the reference to the startdate could hardly be sufficient to displace the 20 March Quotation and the figure of £363,600 for the purposes of determining scope. He also relied upon his cross-examination of Mr Harm about the 11 June letter's reference to a "provisional date" and what had been said about such date at the 15 May Meeting. However, I do not think any of that really assists VE here. In my view, the immediate factual context of the LOI and 11 June letter which includes what works were to be started is very important, and provides the lens through which, as it were, the £363,600 figure should be examined. After all, it is not said that £363,600 as a figure is wrong as such, rather it is to be viewed as a maximum. That is in fact how it is referred to in paragraph 13.  </p>

The further work done was to be treated as a variation to the LOI (as the Management Plan had contemplated) as opposed to the formation of “lots of little contracts” for each of the other works. This approach taken by VE is important because it means that VE accepts that the scope of the LOI was not to be limited to what VE claims is implied by the language of the LOI, in particular the reference to £363,600 or the limited drawings supplied. But if so, then, as a matter of principle, this would encompass the North Carousel works as well, subject only to the 28 May Contract argument, which I have rejected. </p>

Leaving to one side, whether this would not also constitute inadmissible subjective intention, the point is not a good one anyway. Obviously, if one asked the parties what works they were doing, they would say the North Carousel works and if asked what the pricing was, they might well have referred to the 28 May Quotation which applied the usual rates to the North Carousel (albeit that it was later altered). Mr Moran QC also refers to Mr Harm's evidence at Day 1/162, 164, to show that the 28 May Quotation was "internally accepted/agreed". See also his evidence at Day 2/20-21. I am not sure that Mr Harm was going that far, but in any event, this is not the point. The real question is (if the parties were asked) what document contained BB's contractual commitment to pay for such works. On the evidence already discussed, it was, and could only be the LOI. </p>

A similar phrase was used in the Management Plan (external areas) and was clearly seen there to be encompassing other structures which required piling other than the VHAM Building. Accordingly, if external works did not include the North and South Carousel etc then the Main Contract did not include them, which would be absurd. VE rely here on the evidence given by Mr Harm at Day 1/131-132, who referred to BB's main works as including lighting and landscaping  and that he understood the expression "external works" in a building contract to mean works of that kind to the curtilage of the building. However, (a) this was put to him out of context and (b) it is a matter of subjective intent anyway.

Moreover it did not represent work solely on the VHAM Building (as per the 20 March Quotation) because that building work itself had changed and in fact cost somewhat more. It was by now an irrelevant figure. VE is correct to say that there was nothing to stop the parties by then changing the Sub-Contract Sum to represent the total value of the work done by that stage i.e. £1.239m, if that is what was intended. It would have obviously have been clearer and better if they had done so. However, I do not accept that the agreed final sum was simply another piece of administration, of no real significance for the Sub-Contract.

Although VE had in fact been paid considerably more than £363,600 and although the gross valuation was now agreed at £1.239 million, if left unqualified, £363,600 looked like the total sum payable under this contract. Of course, if the Sub-Contract was in truth limited to (for example) the particular VHAM Building works in that precise sum and there were other contracts to cover all the other works (which is VE’s case) the sub- contract sum of £363,600 would be entirely innocuous and require no amendment. The amendment which was provided was plainly meant to qualify this sum so that the cost of the other works was also to be covered. Any other interpretation makes no sense. Both parties agree, thus far. The actual wording is a little odd, but in my view the sense is that there were the costs of other works <span style="text-decoration:underline">“in addition to”</span> the original contract sum - rather than the original contract sum being <span style="text-decoration:underline">“in addition to”</span> the further works, which would suggest that the works contemplated by the £363,600 came later than the “further works”.  </p>

In fact, that is not altogether correct because there was a modest amount of further piling for the North Carousel - see Invoices 9 and 10 and the 7 piles referred to in the 23 November 2012 Quotation. On that footing, a part (admittedly a small part but it could be important if this was defectively executed) was in the Sub-Contract whereas the rest was not. Further, if the Sub- Contract happened to have been sent out, say, 3 or 4 months later, it would mean (on VE’s case) that yet further works would be excluded from its ambit for no good reason. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Moreover, this timing point assumes what it seeks to prove, which is that the Sub-Contract did not cover pre-November 2012 works because there was no need to do so - because the North Carousel works were all subject to a pre-existing contract. But if that is right, then there was no need for the Sub-Contract to cover any of the work done pursuant to the LOI since that was a pre-existing contract as well. The riposte to that may be that the LOI-governed work is different because that was only the VHAM Building which, on VE’s analysis, was truly within the Sub-Contract. But that is only a partial answer because, as already noted, VE also contended that work other than for the North Carousel and the VHAM Building when done, was covered by extensions to the LOI. And if that is not right, such other work must have been done at the time according to some other free-standing contracts. In truth, the notion that there was no need for the Sub-Contract to cover the North Carousel works because they had their own separate 28 May Contract is fundamentally flawed. That is because the clear and objective intention of both parties was that the Sub-Contract should end up as being the only contract. </p>

One would have to read the single period of works of 6 weeks stated in the Sub-Contract as running up to, say, mid July, and then starting again in November. There is no basis for that. </p>

In that regard, I take VE's point that it may be difficult to do so in something of a vacuum, at this stage, and in the absence of the detail of the loss claims as formulated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">I agree with BB that the phrase in limb [a] does in principle cover more than just the "direct costs" of replacement piling as contended for by VE. In fact I am not sure that the phrase direct costs here (as opposed to non-direct costs) is as simple to apply as VE contends, once one gets beyond the cost of the piles themselves. I agree that the costs covered by limb [a], as with [b] and [c], must be clearly and specifically identified, as required by the last sentence of Clause 6.7. But that does not alter the fact that true cost of replacing the piling may go very much further than the cost of the piles or of actually sinking them, once the site is prepared and cleared to enable this. In many cases, the subject-matter of the negligence may only be discovered once the buildings or structures </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">which the piles support have been erected. That is inherent in the nature of piling as foundational work which usually has to be done before any other building work. Work may have to be done to such buildings or structures or (as is allegedly the case here) the structure may need to be removed in its entirety. What limb [a] connotes, in my judgment are the costs of the things that have to be done in order to replace the piles. Provided that this is the object of the exercise in incurring such costs, and they are reasonably and properly incurred (as BB accepts they must be in its formulation) they are <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> recoverable under limb [a]. Thus in principle such costs may include the costs of investigating and designing how to replace the defective piling and the cost of removing anything (including the structure above them) which would otherwise prevent the new piling from going ahead.  In that regard, I do not agree that such costs could only have been recovered if there were additional  words in limb [a] such as "the cost of investigation" or "the cost of dismantling or removing the building".  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">VE is right to say that covering such costs might turn out to be very expensive  for it (or its insurers). But if VE wanted to limit its financial exposure it could have put in a financial limit. It chose not to. I am not prepared to read into limb [a] some narrow construction simply in order to achieve something like the same effect as a financial limit, as VE suggests. </p>

I cannot be sure that all such costs would be covered because it is possible that some mitigation costs might be more akin to providing other ways to enable Technip to keep its operations going, as a <span style="text-decoration:underline">consequence</span> of the re-piling works, rather than a cost of <span style="text-decoration:underline">doing</span>  those works.  </p>

In my view, it is directed to the removal and accommodation of people, whether in a domestic or commercial context. Such costs may occur where the building above the piles is a house or an office. That is the sense of "beneficial occupation" in my view. I do not consider that it extends to the costs of removing and re-siting for continued operations elsewhere, any structures sitting on the piles falling outside that description, as the North Carousel itself would appear to be.  </p>

If it became liable to Technip for the costs of replacing the piling or repairs to a building which would have been covered by limb [a] if BB had itself done or commissioned the work, I cannot see that it makes any difference if it has in effect paid for those works by indemnifying Technip for the cost of them, should it be found liable to do so. Otherwise recoverability turns on the fortuitous question as to whether the sub-contractor or the main contractor paid for them, which seems artificial to me.  </p>
