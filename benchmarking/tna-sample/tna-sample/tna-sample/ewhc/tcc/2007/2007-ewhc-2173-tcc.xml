	      </authorialNote> and an extended costs hearing still to come. This litigation is now, in 2007, in its eleventh year. It was started when Subhash Thakrar (“Subhash”), suing in the name of his then accountancy practice, S K Thakrar &amp; Co (“SKT”), issued the writ in the lead action on 4 December 1996 in the Colchester District Registry claiming allegedly due and unpaid professional accountant’s fees and compound interest. Additional claims and Parties were added to or directed to be tried with this action as the lead action. This action led to trial no. 1 which culminated in judgment no. 1 that was handed down on 29 September 2004 and judgment no. 2 that was handed down on 20 December 2004. The subsequent litigation has been concerned with the procedural, enforcement and other related consequences of judgments nos. 1 and 2. This litigation has spawned a number of additional actions and applications which have been directed to be heard or tried together. In order to identify the scope of this subsequent litigation, a fresh claim form was issued which was directed to be the vehicle or umbrella encompassing all actions, disputes, claims and applications that had either led to judgment nos. 1 and 2 or which had subsequently arisen out of, or were connected with, the original action and the Family Actions. This composite and consolidating claim form, issued on 29 June 2006, describes all these various strands brought together into the current action of what is now referred to as “The Thakrar Litigation”. The present judgment, being no. 5 in the series of the Thakrar Litigation judgments, is the judgment following the first, fact-finding trial of the current set of actions and applications and was handed down after trial no. 2.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Thakrar Litigation now consists of twenty separate Parties.  Five of the Parties consist of two or more separate individuals so that, in total, trial no. 2 has involved 29 separate individuals or companies. These Parties are grouped broadly into two camps, those claiming relief of some kind, who became known collectively as “the claiming Parties”, and those resisting or defending any of these claims, who became known collectively as “the defending Parties”. Only one Party, Glen International Limited (“Glen”) has adopted a apparently neutral stance. That neutrality was changed into a stance wholly supporting the defending Parties for a period at a late stage in trial no. 2 but, on the purported appointment of administrators, Glen ceased to be an active participant. </p>

The actions of, and the documents associated with, Subhash lie at the heart of all parts of the Thakrar Litigation.   He was the principal Party at trial no. 1. He was addressed and referred to as Subhash throughout the Thakrar Litigation and trial no. 1. Many other Thakrar family members, and members and relatives of the Hughes-Narborough family are also Parties to the Thakrar Litigation and they are all similarly referred to by their first names to avoid undue repetition of the Thakrar and Hughes-Narborough family names. Another principal Party, Mr Harjivan, is not a Thakrar family member and he, as with other non-family members of either family, was referred to throughout the trial more conventionally by his title and surname. I will adopt the same convention for these various names in this fact-finding judgment no. 5. </p>

Overriding these two objectives has been the need to provide a dispute resolution forum that enables all the related disputes to be decided in the most proportionate and cost-effective manner given that the resources of most of the Parties are extremely limited.</p>

This prolonged and disjointed trial was brought about by a series of developments which led to the introduction of new issues, Parties and procedural applications. In order to provide a structure and a workable framework to the many disputes that must be decided, I directed that trial no. 2 should be confined to a fact-finding exercise with the aim of my deciding the material disputed facts in a way that will bind all Parties. Following the handing down of this fact-finding judgment no. 5, a further trial, which will be trial no. 4 and which will be concerned with the consequences of those facts, will follow.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">One of the causes of the prolongation of the trial was the need for an adjournment of trial no. 2 while there was tried by another judge, Judge Coulson QC, the issue as to whether, at a late stage in the trial, all Parties had compromised the entirety of the Thakrar Litigation in an out of court, informal final and binding settlement agreement. It was necessary for this issue to be tried by Judge Coulson as trial no. 3 because all Parties were concerned to ensure that I, as the trial judge of the Thakrar Litigation, did not become aware of the details of the negotiations leading up to the alleged settlement if it turned out that no binding settlement took place and judgment had to be given in relation to the Thakrar Litigation. Strictly, it was not necessary for the compromise issue to be tried by a different judge, even if the negotiations leading up to the alleged settlement were conducted on a without prejudice basis. However, I exercised my case management powers to direct a trial by a different judge so as to avoid any subsequent suggestion of prejudice or bias if I had to determine the entirety of the disputes between the Parties having learnt of the details of what had turned out to be an abortive settlement negotiation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Following Judge Coulson’s judgment, trial no. 2 was resumed but was again subject to a prolonged interruption by Glen, a vital Party to the overall litigation. Initially, Glen instructed leading counsel to pursue a full-blown recusal application for which other defending Parties indicated support. The application was based, so I was informed, on allegations of my actual and presumed bias and judicial incompetence in conducting the trial, the alleged unfairness to the defending Parties caused by the disproportionate inequality of arms between the claiming and defending Parties and irredeemable prejudice to them resulting from the trial having become unmanageable. As a result, so it was alleged at that stage, the trial had become an abuse of process. At a late stage before these recusal applications were due to be heard, Glen and most of the other defending Parties withdrew their applications. However, three of the defending Parties, Subhash, Mr Harjivan, and Party 16, SKTL (“SKTL”), informed the court that they were persisting in their abuse of process applications but accepted that they could be determined as part of the overall judgment on the basis of the written materials already served by all Parties. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">One reason for Glen dropping its recusal application was that its directors purportedly resolved on 13 April 2007 to place Glen in administration and they claimed to have made an out of court appointment of administrators.  This resulted in a second cause of the trial’s prolongation. This appointment initially had the temporary effect of the proceedings against Party 14 being stayed automatically. This, in turn, prompted to two applications by the claiming Parties, albeit these were mounted by Parties 1 and 4. The first application was for an order lifting the stay at least in relation to the remaining stages of trial no. 2 including the handing down of judgment and the settling of the order consequent upon that judgment. This application was not opposed by Glen’s administrators and I readily granted it. The second application was advanced by Parties 1 and 4 and was made under paragraph 81 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986. This application was to the effect that the administration was engineered by Subhash, who had no role or involvement in the affairs of Glen, and was in any event voted on and initiated by the directors of Glen with an improper motive so that the administration should be set aside with effect from 13 April 2007. The hearing of these applications and a further application by Parties 1 and 4 challenging the validity of the purported appointment of joint administrators prolonged the trial by four further hearing days with further written submissions and extended the overall length of the trial by seven further months.</p>

He is now bankrupt. His trustee in bankruptcy is, of course, a Party to the Thakrar Litigation but Subhash is a separate Party in his own right. He was summoned to give evidence but on entering the witness box and in the presence of counsel he had instructed to accompany him to court, he declined to answer any questions on the grounds that he might incriminate himself. He was otherwise unrepresented during the Thakrar Litigation although he took to bombarding the court and the Parties with unsolicited e-mails containing huge quantities of submissions, comments, prejudicial and sometimes scandalous allegations and assertions all of which protested his innocence of any wrongdoing whilst accusing the claiming Parties and, for those Parties who were represented, their representatives of all manner of dishonesty and bad faith. Thus, although Subhash and his actions have formed a major part of the investigation at the trial, he has played no significant part at the trial itself. </p>

Judgment no. 1 was essentially concerned with the joint venture that I held had been operated by Subhash and Neil between 1983 and 1987 for the purpose of developing and selling  properties for their sole benefit which had been misappropriated from William’s Estate and SPC Property Company Ltd’s (“SPC”) property portfolio. SPC was a Hughes-Narborough family company which held a large South London residential property portfolio for investment purposes and both SPC and the portfolio were exclusively managed by Neil as an adjunct to his family solicitor’s practice. Subhash’s role was undertaken as an adjunct to his accountant’s practice, one of whose clients was Neil’s firm through whose clients’ account the proceeds of this development venture passed. The principal claim brought by SPC related to the remaining portfolio that was dishonestly acquired from SPC by Subhash in the name of a Thakrar Family member, Ramila. The trial was also concerned with claims that were made by several Thakrar Family members against Neil’s Estate. Neil died in 1995 and the Thakrar Family members pursued claims against his estate for alleged failures by Neil to account to them for the proceeds of sale of some of these misappropriated properties which had been conveyed into their respective names. Finally, the trial was concerned with whether Subhash had any surviving claims for outstanding accountancy fees and accumulated interest. These were pursued against SPC, Neil’s estate under alleged guarantees and two other alleged guarantors of this liability, Kenneth and Rosemary. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The effect of judgment no. 1 was that SPC succeeded in full in recovering its claims from Subhash, Subhash succeeded in recovering a small part of his fees claim against SPC but failed to recover anything from Neil’s estate, Kenneth or Rosemary and the other Thakrar family members, save for those brought in the names of Ramila and Vijaya, failed in their claims against Neil’s estate. Ramila and Vijaya’s claims had been struck out during the trial and a default judgment was entered against each of them. Essential to the judgment in favour of SPC were findings that Subhash had acted dishonestly and fraudulently in procuring the sale of SPC’s property portfolio into Ramila’s name. SPC’s claims against Neil’s estate and Glen were compromised before Part 1 of trial no. 1 in two separate compromise agreements entered into separately and at different times. SPC is now seeking to set aside the compromise agreement with Glen and Ramila it was a Party to on the grounds that it was procured by fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

Following that judgment, Subhash initially attempted to enter into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement and when it failed, then presented his own bankruptcy petition. Both steps appear to have been ploys undertaken in an attempt to avoid any significant payments being made to the judgment creditors. No-one has yet recovered anything from him or his estate and Party 4 has not recovered anything from the other Thakrar family members because the interim payment on account of costs ordered by me as part of judgment no. 2 is presently held in court under an order of the Court of Appeal.</p>

They rely on similar grounds to those that Party 4 contends for in support of its applications to vary the original orders made in their favour at the original trial. Party 4 wishes to have it made clear that the Thakrar family members’ claims were always shams and an abuse of process and were brought by Subhash for his own purposes.  </p>

Party 4 alleges that these new facts show that the Thakrar family members’ claims were advanced entirely in their names by Subhash and that he was using the family members’ actions purely for his own benefit. These applications have some additional significance because the Thakrar family members were granted permission to appeal significant parts of the judgment entered against them and that appeal has been directed by the Court of Appeal to be stood over to await this fact-finding judgment. Party 4 alleges that the appeal is misconceived and an abuse of process because the original claims brought by Thakrar family members were themselves abuses of process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in"> However, the major issue in the Thakrar Litigation relates to the question of who is the beneficial owner of the shares in Glen and Teso International Group Ltd (“Teso”). Most of the appropriated properties were transferred into Glen’s name in the 1990s. This company is a Liberian registered company allegedly managed by a Jersey-based management company that was set up in 1989, one year after Subhash had procured the transfer of all the remaining properties in SPC property portfolio into Ramila’s name. Subhash also procured the transfer into Glen’s name of various other properties that had previously been beneficially owned by SPC. Teso was subsequently set up, so the claiming Parties allege, by Subhash, so as to enable these dishonestly acquired properties to be hidden and “protected” from SPC and the Inland Revenue. </p>

The claiming Parties contend that these transactions were shams that were made for nil consideration and that Subhash was always, and remains, the sole beneficial owner of these shares. Mr Harjivan contends that he is the beneficial owner of these shares having acquired them at arm’s length from Ramila and Vijaya for approximately £12m. Thus, Glen faces claims from two directions. Subhash’s Trustee claims declarations that she, through Subhash, is the beneficial owner of Glen’s shares so as to enable her to realise Glen’s assets for the benefit of Glen’s creditors, including SPC, and, to claim a distribution of any net assets or their value for Subhash’s estate and his creditors, also including SPC.  Meanwhile, SPC claims the return of, or restitution for, the properties it alleges were dishonestly put into Glen’s name by Subhash so as to warehouse them. This information is said to have surfaced during Subhash’s bankruptcy proceedings. These claims are, in part, enforcement proceedings and, in part, direct claims seeking tracing and restitutionary remedies. </p>

In addition, Ramila claims, for herself and her family, an account and reimbursement or damages together with interest equivalent to the monies representing her family’s savings held in accounts under a power of attorney given to Subhash for that purpose and appropriated by Subhash. In judgment no. 1 I found that Ramila’s savings had been appropriated in November 1987 by Subhash, applied as part of the payment to the Inland Revenue on behalf of SPC, and treated or accounted for as the deposit paid for the SPC portfolio<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

The claiming Parties seek to set aside the decision to place Glen into administration on the grounds that that decision was taken for ulterior, dishonest overriding reasons and it should therefore be set aside or cessated.

The other parties are Glen and Teso which were set up to manage and protect the property portfolio that Subhash dishonestly acquired from SPC. A crucial player in action no. 2 is Mr Harjivan who claimed to have bought the shares in Glen and Teso from Vijaya. The Trustee claims the beneficial interest in those shares for Subhash’s Estate. There are also two Thakrar companies set up after Subhash’s bankruptcy and the demise of his sole practice, being SKTL which inherited his accountancy practice, and Simply Lettings and Management Ltd which took over SKT’s lettings and property management business. Finally, there were two professional parties. Firstly, there were the two Receivers appointed under charges held by Teso over Glen and Subhash’s properties and who were removed from office during the trial by order of the court and two administrators of Glen who were appointed on 13 April 2007 during a late stage of the trial.</p>

The individuals into whose name the freehold was passed were to be no more than nominees who took no part in the management of the properties and who would not receive any part of the consideration earned from selling long leases of flats within the properties. That consideration would be paid into the running account held by Neil on behalf of both participants in the joint venture and the net profits split 50/50 between the two. </p>

Given how the two men worked this joint venture, it would seem that, in Subhash’s mind, the monies he received from Neil would be paid into the general pot or used for subsequent purchases by the joint venture. Those monies were certainly not intended to be paid to the individual in whose name a particular property was registered. Registration was a “flag of convenience” and different names were used so as to spread the incidence of capital gains and other taxes. The attraction of a family member domiciled and resident outside the jurisdiction was that the proceeds of sale of properties registered in such family members’ names would not attract any tax on a disposal and other tax advantages accruing to the income earned from the property by what would appear to be a non-resident overseas domiciled property owner<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

Thus, Subhash knew that the thirteen flats in two adjacent streets that remained in William’s estate formed part of that estate, that Neil was the sole effective executor and that he was not entitled to be a Party to the transfer away from the estate of these properties for no consideration. The justification, in Subhash’s mind, for participating in what was a deliberate and unjustified breach of trust and in agreeing to share the proceeds of sale with Neil personally was:</p>

These funds were paid into, and then out of, the joint venture account. At least £70,000 was paid in this way, albeit that the work was poorly managed and was carried out in consequence in a grossly uneconomic and unplanned manner. Following refurbishment, these properties were then “sold” to family members in the sense that they were transferred into the names of family members and then, in some cases, long leases were sold on to third Parties and the proceeds of sale credited to Neil and Subhash’s joint venture. According to Subhash’s evidence that he gave during trial no.1, each “sale” was notionally for a small sum, £5,000 per unit, but no money passed from the family members to the Estate or to Neil and Subhash. Even on Subhash’s version of the arrangement, this consideration was to be deferred and paid by way of deduction from subsequently acquired proceeds of sale. By June 1986, 8 of these properties had been sold yielding gross proceeds of sale of £251,555 the entirety of which went into the joint venture account.</p>

In his evidence, Mukesh stated that in about 1983, when he was in his 20s, his father and Subhash informed him that the family would be purchasing a number of properties from Neil and that he would be purchasing one of them. Mukesh had no say in which property would be purchased by him. The purchase price would be paid for out of the proceeds of sale and the rental income. Subhash would be arranging for the builders to renovate the property. He had no choice in the matter. Mukesh had no role in any of the renovation work and, so far as he understood the arrangements, these were paid for out of family funds under the control of his father and Subhash. As with other family members, Mukesh had contributed to this pot out of his earnings. Subhash then arranged for the flat to be put on the market. Mukesh stated that he raised with Subhash over the following years the fact that he had not received the net proceeds of sale of the two flats which the house was converted into and he said that he would take it up with Neil. He never received any proceeds of sale. Subhash started proceedings in his name in September 1998 to recover the proceeds of sale from Neil’s estate. </p>

In his evidence he gave a very similar account of how he and his brother Kishan purchased jointly a property for £10,000 in 1983. Subhash made all the arrangements, gave them no option about the purchase, decided which property would be registered in their names and stated that the proceeds of sale would be used to fund the purchase. He left Subhash to sort everything out. He likewise asked Neil about the proceeds of sale intermittently over the years and always received the answer: “don’t worry, I will sort it out”. The claim against Neil’s estate was started at the same time as the claim made by Mukesh, albeit in separate proceedings and apart from providing information about the figures, Vijay had little involvement in those proceedings.</p>

She had no view as to whether this particular use of the property was for appropriate family purposes and ended by stating that she left him to use her property’s name whenever he needed to use it.

She did not know, and had not met, her maternal cousins, being Subhash and his siblings, nor her maternal aunt, being Shantaben, whilst she was a child and the two families, living in Tabora, Tanzania and England respectively, communicated by post. Ramila’s family appear to have been, in financial terms, modestly self-sufficient. During the 1970s and up to 1983 and her mother’s tragic death, Ramila worked in the family business run by her mother. This was a small shop, later two small shops, selling garments and shoes. In the 10-year period between the death of her father and mother, the family started to build up a small trust fund in England to provide for those siblings, particularly Nilesh, who was living in England. Nilesh moved to England in 1973 and he encountered financial difficulties which these funds were intended to alleviate.  This trust fund, which does not appear to have been formally created, was arranged by Jayaben with Shantaben and Kanji and was intended to provide a fund to be used to provide financial support for those of Jayaben’s children and grandchildren who were based in England. It is likely that, prior to Kanji’s death in 1985, the fund was administered by Kanji but Subhash had some involvement in this fund, certainly from about 1979 as is evident from the eloquent family letters written by Ramila and Vijaya to Subhash in 1979 which were put in evidence by Mukesh. </p>

They all start: “Dear brother Subhash, Kiranbhabhi (sister-in-law), Rishi and Rupa”. Addressing her cousin and his wife as brother and sister-in-law was a mark of respect. All the letters provided family news of life in Tanzania and all contained long passages expressing anxiety and worry about Nilesh’s life in England coupled with information about the money that Ramila and her family were arranging to be transferred to Nilesh in small tranches from Tanzania to help him through his crisis.  It is likely that the letter-writing stopped once Nilesh had sorted his life out. These letters show that the two families were friendly but not close and are largely concerned with pleas to Subhash to provide comfort and advice to Nilesh in what were clearly difficult personal times for him.  There was no evidence that Subhash or his immediate family provided any financial support to Nilesh although they were clearly in regular contact with him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The fund was created using an apparently legal method of circumventing the strict currency legislation in Tanzania which precluded hard currency being exported. Kanji would find from within the Gujarati community in England someone who wanted to provide payment in Tanzania of a sum similar in size to the sum Jayaben wanted to transfer to England. Jayaben would then arrange to pay that sum to the intended recipient in Tanzania whereupon, Kanji would collect the agreed Stirling equivalent in England and pay that into the account or trust fund being established for the Jayaben children. Ramila believed that about £3,000 to £4,000 per annum in this period was paid into the trust fund in this way. Given the relatively modest circumstances of the widowed Jayaben and those of her children still living with her in Tanzania, it is inconceivable that any larger transfers were made. Ramila was able to produce contemporary evidence of these payments contained in some of the letters written to England in this period by herself, Bhikhu and Vijaya to Subhash. These have otherwise unintelligible references to short and long-sleeved shirts contained within them. Ramila explained that this was family coded language for notification by the Tanzanian family of large or small transfers of funds into the Jayaben children’s trust fund.</p>

The second visit was in 1984 when she again briefly met Subhash. These visits were, no doubt, primarily to attend family gatherings and to see Nilesh. Following Jayaben’s death in 1983, the siblings still involved in running the shops found that it was not economic to continue with them and they closed them down in 1984. Ramila moved to India for a time and, whilst there she briefly met Subhash who was attending a religious festival also attended by other members of his and Ramila’s immediate family. During their brief renewed acquaintance, he asked her to sign a general power of attorney in his favour which she did on 26 December 1985 before an executive magistrate in Jamnagar. Subhash explained that he needed this to assist him in looking after the Jayaben family money that he had received and Ramila, who had little knowledge of the size of the fund or as to how it was being administered, accepted this explanation and signed the document. Subhash’s explanation would have had some credence since Kanji had died earlier in 1985 leaving him as head of the family and, by succession, trustee and administrator of the late Jayaben’s fund and, following Jayaben’s death in 1983, the ownership of this fund would have passed to all of Jayaben’s children. During their time together in India, Subhash made no mention to Ramila of any other property or funds held by him or of any intention to place any property into her name.  </p>

Ramila first met many of the Thakrar family at her wedding reception held in England in January 1991 which was, of course, attended by Subhash. Ramila first lived in Wellingborough and worked in a chocolate factory earning about £3 per hour. Between April 1991 and May 1995 she and Babu lived on a temporary basis in Sidcup, Kent and, from May 1995 until the present they have lived in Mottingham, South East London in a house they bought for £54,995 which they bought with a mortgage of some £38,000 or less advanced by the Abbey National. In that period since 1990, Ramila has had infrequent meetings with Subhash and some of his siblings.

She has always live in modest circumstances and, indeed, she and her husband have struggled over the years since then to make ends meet. Vijaya has only travelled outside Kenya on four occasions in her life. The first such trip was many years ago to Uganda. Some years later she made two visits to England, in 1988 and 2001, and one to India in 2002 when her husband went there for heart surgery. During the first visit to Uganda, she met Subhash who was then unmarried and about to go to England for his professional studies. Vijaya’s second visit outside Kenya in 1988, was to England for a 6-week holiday with her son, then aged 18 months, and her daughter, then aged 5. They stayed with Vijaya’s brother Nilesh and he paid for their travel. During that visit, she met Subhash and Kiran when they invited her to dinner at their home and the following day, at Subhash’s request, she attended his offices where he asked her to sign a general power of attorney in his name. Vijaya was perplexed by this unexpected request and asked why he wanted this. Subhash replied that he wanted it as a favour to him. Vijaya spoke with Nilesh by telephone and he said that it was alright to sign. Vijaya agreed, partly because she was very conscious of her relative financial weakness and because she regarded Subhash as the elder in the family. The document was signed in front of Mrs Barbara Harris in her office which is located close to Subhash’s office and Subhash escorted her round there.   </p>

Subhash asked her, probably in a covering letter, to sign this document in front of a witness without giving her any explanation as to what the document was or why he was asking her to sign it. Vijaya took this document to a local lawyer who tried to explain to her what it was without much success. However, on learning that Subhash was both her maternal cousin and head of the family, the lawyer advised her to sign the document which she did. The lawyer witnessed her signature and she posted the signed document back to Subhash. </p>

On 21 August 1986, Subhash sent Neil the original power of attorney that Ramila had executed in India on 26 December 1985 with a copy of the contract for 34 Burchell Road, London, in which she purportedly granted a long lease to a third Party. This property was the second to be transferred to Ramila, in May 1986, but that transfer, like many of the others, is now only evidenced informally in the notes and informal written exchanges between Subhash and Neil. This was, therefore, the first occasion that can now be traced on which Subhash purportedly acted on Ramila’s behalf in a formal transaction in her name and as her agent. </p>

Subhash stated that Ramila provided funds for some of these developments but I found in judgment no. 1, and I confirm now having heard Ramila’s evidence, that she provided no funds of any kind for any property purchase, development or refurbishment and she knew of no such action because she was never informed at any time that her name was being lent to a series of South London property dealings. I am able to confirm my finding of fact in judgment no. 1 that Subhash had no communication with Ramila about any of these properties and that all the relevant transactions were those of Subhash save for the name on the transfer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There is no direct evidence available to explain why Subhash decided to use Ramila’s name as the transferee of the SPC properties transferred to his appointed recipient by the joint venture. It is not known whether it is significant that the first such transfer related to the first of the SPC properties to be appropriated by the Neil/Subhash joint venture but it seems likely that that does have significance. The properties developed previously had come from William’s estate and were each transferred into a different Thakrar family name: namely into Naina, Sheela, Mukesh, Kanji/ Shantaben, Vijay and Kishan’s names. One was transferred into Vijaya’s name, possibly because of Subhash’s involvement in the Jayaben trust and the fact that, her brother, Nilesh was living in England and was known personally to him. Once his immediate family had each had one property notionally allocated to them, which coincided with the drying up of the William’s estate properties, Subhash seems to have turned his mind to tax saving and asset preservation. His likely thinking was that he needed, for tax-saving and other purposes, an off-shore resident as his nominee owner of the SPC properties developed by the joint venture. This decision was probably taken in late 1985. Ramila’s name was then chosen. In late 1985, Subhash would have known that he was about to meet Ramila in India. He had a ready excuse to persuade her to give him the power of attorney he needed to deal in her name, namely his involvement in the Jayaben trust fund. Moreover, he probably considered that she would never discover that her name had been used in this unorthodox way. Thus, Subhash appears to have decided to use her name and to have obtained her power of attorney in the forthcoming SPC development properties. That would explain why this power was executed in India on an English attorney form. He must have had typed up a blank power of attorney form before he left for India which he took to India with him for Ramila to sign.  </p>

It is significant that, according to Subhash, the rift leading to the assignment to Ramila and the instructions given by Jagani to Neil to deal with the properties as Subhash instructed appear to have occurred in about March 1986, some two to three months after Subhash returned from India with Ramila’s power of attorney<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">

	      </authorialNote>. This coincidence suggests that Subhash was seeking to “regularise” the transfer of properties by ensuring that they were transferred into the name of an existing off-shore resident rather than into the name of a fictitious off shore resident or one whose power of attorney he did not hold<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="24">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span class="FootnoteReference">24</span><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Subhash was not consistent in how he described Jagani. When trying to arrange a bank loan in November 1988 to raise money to enable the IR to be paid off following the winding up petition presented against SPC, and when he was pledging his own assets or those he controlled as security, he was asked about a property being offered which was registered in the name of Jagani. He described Jagani as being “one of the family members”. On Subhash’s evidence at trial no. 1, Jagani was not a family member but was a business associate of Subhash’s brother-in-law.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. At all events, Ramila was never consulted by Subhash about these properties, has never known anyone called Jagani and never took an assignment of properties from, nor paid anything for, properties in South London from anyone whilst living in Tanzania in the 1980s.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have already decided in judgment no. 1 that was given following trial no. 1 that the transfer of properties into the names of family members other than Ramila and Vijaya were as nominees and that the proceeds of sale and any rents and profits earned from the properties following transfer were beneficially owned by Subhash and Neil. These findings are applicable to Ramila and Vijaya’s properties but the findings in relation to both the William’s estate’s properties transferred into family members’ names and SPC properties transferred into Ramila’s name. The evidence of all family members is only consistent with their being nominees in relation to the property registered in their name. In Ramila’s case, she had no knowledge at all of the use of her name and the conclusion as to her is even stronger that she was a nominee owner. Clearly, Subhash did not intend any of the registered proprietors to recover any proceeds of sale or rent from their properties and the only basis for his having arranged for the various family actions to be started can have been that he wanted to recover for himself, in his family members’ names, the proceeds of sale from Neil’s estate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">These findings are now re-affirmed by a weight of further evidence that was neither available nor adduced at trial no. 1. The principal sources of such evidence are the written and oral evidence of Ramila and Vijaya. The totality of their evidence I accept since they were both palpably honest witnesses, their evidence was mutually corroborative and was consistent with all the other non-partisan evidence and it was also inherently true. It is worth setting out a few passages from the evidence of both Ramila and Vijaya so as to obtain something of the flavour of their vehement and angry denials of Subhash’s repeated suggestions in contemporary documents that everything done in their names was done for them as beneficial owners of the property or shares in question and for their benefit. </p>

In particular, he held Ramila out to be a wealthy woman who had provided him with a general power of attorney to invest substantial sums, being part of that wealth which she had remitted to him, in property in England. Ramila still lived in Tanzania in 2003 in the period he was giving evidence, according to his evidence, and she was aware of the nature and extent of the investments that had been obtained on her behalf. These investments had been put into an off shore company, Glen, for tax purposes and that company had subsequently been sold to a third Party unknown to Subhash for a very substantial sum which had been paid to Ramila. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">None of that evidence is true, as is clear from the summary of my findings already set out. The question arises as to why Subhash went out of his way to lie so comprehensively about Ramila, and also about Vijaya, where his lies are similarly untrue. It cannot be said that Subhash might have been mistaken about Ramila’s wealth and where she was living. He had a detailed knowledge of her family circumstances from his mother Shantaben, from Nilesh, from the letters from and the brief contacts with Ramila, from his dealings with the Jayaben trust and from his role as head of the extended Thakrar family. It follows that his evidence was deliberately dishonest and that he must have invented it for a purpose. The obvious purpose was that he invented these lies as a means of covering up that he had placed the properties that he had acquired dishonestly in Ramila and Vijaya’s names as nominees so as to cover up his dishonesty and so as to obtain significant tax relief that would not be available had the properties been placed in his name. These transactions could only have appeared to be bona fide if Ramila was wealthy, had provided him with a power of attorney to act as her investment manager of that considerable wealth, had bought the properties with her own resources, had been accounted to for them by Subhash and was still living abroad. </p>

Thus, Subhash had no option but to maintain this fiction at the first trial if he was to have any prospect of defending SPC’s claims. This could only be done if he also maintained the lies about his cousins. Thus, Subhash appears to have taken a gamble, which succeeded during the first trial, that it would not be discovered by Parties 2 and 4 that Ramila was in fact living in England. This was a considerable gamble since, if anyone spoke to Ramila, Subhash’s lies about the properties and his cousins would have been discovered. Had this occurred, Subhash’s case and the cases of his siblings at the original trial would have been destroyed.</p>

At that point, SPC’s crisis broke. This arose from the Inland Revenue’s winding up petition due to repeated and wilful failures by Neil to submit tax returns. This crisis created the opportunity for Subhash dishonestly to acquire from SPC, with Neil’s agreement, SPC’s remaining property portfolio at an excessive undervalue, little of which was actually received by SPC and none of which was paid for or provided by Ramila herself as opposed to by Subhash using funds distributed to him from the joint venture account that he had then arranged to have been put in her name.

The fraud was, on Subhash’s part, one to procure the sale of SPC’s property portfolio to Ramila at an undervalue and to procure that a significant part of the purchase consideration was unpaid and written off. Neil was not aware that Subhash’s suggested valuation of the properties was in fact a significant undervalue of the portfolio. He was concerned to be rid of SPC’s portfolio. He wanted to be rid of SPC and its portfolio because of his mismanagement of SPC’s affairs, his dishonest misuse of SPC’s other properties, his dishonesty vis-à-vis his siblings, his belief, which Subhash has dishonestly given him, that there was no possibility of obtaining more for the portfolio because only Subhash could procure the funds needed to extricate the portfolio from the hands of the Revenue, and his declining health and weariness which had left him disinterested in SPC and its troubled affairs. Kenneth was not a Party to Subhash and Neil’s fraud, he was merely misled into signing the necessary contract to give effect to the sale of SPC’s portfolio.</p>

The only difference was that this, by far the largest acquisition, was one which had been undertaken by Subhash alone and not by the joint venture and that Subhash was cheating not only SPC but also Neil and Kenneth. </p>

Thus, if he had been acting bona fide under the general powers of attorney he held, Subhash should have informed Ramila and Vijaya of each property acquisition into their respective names as soon as this occurred and provided them with full details on a regular basis thereafter of all outgoings and income attributable to each property. The absence of any information being provided at any time in relation to any property is very good evidence that Subhash was not arranging for these properties or any income or capital derived from them to be owned beneficially by them but was only arranging for the respective properties’ registration in their name as nominees for an ulterior purpose of his own. </p>

Ratification of an unauthorised act cannot occur until the principal gets to hear of the act and is able to take a conscious decision to ratify the act of acquisition. Thus, the registration of these properties into Ramila and Vijaya’s names did not have the effect of passing beneficial ownership of the properties to them. They could have acquired beneficial ownership if they had ratified the transaction since, on ordinary principles of agency, a principal may always ratify an unauthorised act taken in his or her name and thus take both the benefit and the burden of the unauthorised transaction. Unsurprisingly, given their complete lack of knowledge of anything relating to any of the relevant acquisitions, Ramila and Vijaya did not ratify, nor have the opportunity to consider ratifying, any registration or transfer of any property into their names.</p>

Thus, in the period between the registration of any property in Ramila or Vijaya’s name and the transfer of that property to Glen, Ramila and Vijaya cannot be regarded as holding anything more than the bare legal title of each property. The beneficial ownership of, and any proceeds of sale arising from, each property would have been beneficially owned by Subhash, albeit subject to SPC’s overriding interest and tracing rights. This is the inevitable consequence of the fraudulent circumstances in which Subhash had caused all the properties to be transferred away from William’s estate or from SPC to either Ramila or Vijaya in the first place. One way of testing this conclusion is to ask what would have happened had Ramila or Vijaya unhappily died after a property had been registered in their name. In such circumstances, any claim by their estate for the beneficial interest of that property would have been met by Subhash’s contention that the beneficial interest in the property was held by him on behalf of the entire Thakrar family whose interests he was managing and whose assets he was owning and controlling through the nominee ownership of Ramila or Vijaya. </p>

This is for three reasons. Firstly, only the most rudimentary conveyancing was undertaken prior to the transfer of freeholds into Ramila or Vijaya’s name, secondly, many of the relevant documents were never retrieved from SKT's   premises where all the relevant documents were stored and, thirdly, a full search of the Land Registry for each property registered in Glen’s name has not yet been undertaken. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In relation to the properties transferred into Glen’s name that had been transferred initially to Ramila or another family member outside the portfolio sale, all that occurred was an informal allocation of the property to the family member that Subhash had decided would be the nominee freehold owner followed by a re-registration of that property in the name of that individual, usually only as a prelude to the grant of a long lease to a third Party. The consideration was stated to be a relatively nominal sum, for the William’s estate properties this was £10,000. There is no evidence that any consideration changed hands for any of these properties. A contract for sale was executed and the change of ownership from William’s estate or SPC registered at the time of the grant of a long lease to a third Party. The transfer to Glen was, for some of these properties, included in the schedule of portfolio properties contained in the contract for sale of these properties but, for the rest, no formal registration of Glen’s ownership appears to have occurred until 2000 when Mr Harjivan allegedly became the owner of all of Glen’s shares by way of transfer from Ramila and Vijaya. The portfolio properties were sold to Ramila by a contract dated 17 November 1987 that sale was completed by a transfer dated 25 March 1988. A further contract for the sale of the properties by Ramila to Glen was executed dated 30 March 1990 and the properties were then subsequently re-registered in Glen’s name.</p>

This document has not emerged either as an original or as a copy but it is conceivable that Subhash manufactured one immediately prior to the formal transfer of properties from SPC’s portfolio from Ramila’s into Glen’s name. It is inconceivable that Ramila could have signed such a power of attorney, she was living in Tanzania in March 1990 and was soon to marry Babu. Subhash did not travel to Tanzania and there is no evidence of a blank power of attorney form being sent from England to Tanzania. However, a forged or manufactured power of attorney may well have been used to support the transactions dated 30 March 1990, in which case Subhash’s signature supported by that invalid power of attorney is itself invalid on that ground alone. However, the evidence was not sufficient to enable a finding to be made that Subhash had manufactured a power of attorney dated 15 March 1990 or that such a document had been used as the purported authority for Subhash to act on Ramila’s behalf on any occasion.</p>

Soon after the re-registration had been effected, that firm was evidently advised by accountants it used that properties registered in the name of off-shore residents could be subject to inheritance tax if the registered proprietor died and that it was preferable for such properties to be held by an off-shore company owned by the off-shore resident.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On the advice of the formation agents, a Liberian company was formed since this was marginally cheaper than buying or forming a Jersey company. This company was to be administered in Jersey with a full package of directors, secretary, registered office, shareholders and the minimum services to maintain the company by the formation agents. The property management would be undertaken by Subhash and his firm in London. The consequence was that Glen was incorporated on 22 June 1989. Its directors and officers were all based off-shore. On 17 April 1990, 250 shares were allotted to Ramila and to Vijaya and Glen issued share certificates to give effect to this allotment. On 30 March 1990, the SPC portfolio and other properties all registered at that time in Ramila’s name were sold to Glen for a consideration of £1m. The agreement was signed on behalf of Ramila by Subhash and the properties were re-registered in Glen’s name. Later in the year, Subhash arranged for 249 of Ramila’s 250 shares in Glen to be re-registered in Vijaya’s name and the Glen share register records that fresh share certificates were issued to give effect to this transfer. There is no evidence as to the reason for this transfer nor that any purported consideration was paid by Vijaya to Ramila for the acquisition of one half of the shares which would have had, even in 1990 soon after its formation, a substantial value.  As with all the other transactions associated with Glen and the properties transferred into its name, this transaction was not discussed with or mentioned to either Ramila or Vijaya.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In considering Subhash’s underlying reason for setting up Glen and for arranging for the transfer of the properties in Ramila and Vijaya’s name to Glen for a purported consideration it is pertinent to consider two significant events that occurred in 1990 in Ramila’s life. The first was her engagement and subsequent marriage to her husband Babu who was then and remains a British national resident in the United Kingdom. The marriage took place in Tanzania on 13 July 1990. Following her marriage, in October 1990, Ramila moved to England with her husband and set up home in Wellingborough, near Ramila’s brother Nilesh. A large family wedding reception was held in England in January 1991. The entire Thakrar family living in England attended this reception including Subhash, Shantaben, Kiran, Mukesh, Vijay, Sheela, Naina and Kishan. </p>

Babu was also employed, as a fork lift truck driver. Ramila and Babu moved to Sidcup in 1993 and, in 1995, they bought a former council house in Mottingham for £54,995 with a mortgage for some £38,000 or less secured on the house and funded out of Babu’s relatively modest earnings. The mortgage was arranged by Vijay at Subhash’s suggestion.  </p>

He still wished to retain control over these properties and regarded himself as the beneficial owner of them. When the opportunity unexpectedly arose for him dishonestly to acquire SPC’s remaining portfolio, he again arranged for those properties to be transferred into Ramila’s name for the same reasons as he had arranged for the earlier transfers into her name. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Soon afterwards, he was advised of the desirability of setting up an off-shore company for inheritance tax purposes by the solicitors who had acted for Ramila, as they thought, in the portfolio transfer. The advice was given on the basis that the transfer was a bona fide transfer to a wealthy individual resident overseas. Although that was a reasonable view of the arrangement, it was not the correct view as a result of Subhash’s dishonesty. However, the advice must have set Subhash thinking as to whether the then arrangements were satisfactory from his point of view. He was making returns to the Revenue on the basis that the properties were held by an overseas resident so that, if Ramila died, they would pass to her estate and inheritance tax would be payable. Subhash would then lose control of these properties. He therefore appears to have adopted the advice given, albeit to further his own dishonest scheme. Glen was set up and the shares registered equally in Ramila and Vijaya’s names. The properties were then transferred to Glen. Soon afterwards, Ramila married and then moved to England and, as a result, Subhash hastily arranged for all but one of Ramila’s shares to be transferred to Vijaya. This was to enable him to retain control of Glen and the properties registered in its name of which he regarded himself as the beneficial owner. </p>

In summary, Glen was set up in order to strengthen the complete control that Subhash intended to retain over the properties. He was therefore putting up a further screen behind which he was hiding his beneficial ownership of Glen. He did not attempt to arrange for the consideration due to Ramila from SPC for selling it the properties registered in her name to be paid to her nor did he arrange for the consideration that should have been paid to her by Vijaya for the sale to Vijaya of 249 of these shares to be paid over. Indeed, he treated these shares as his own since no consideration was apparently considered or provided for. Only Subhash could have procured this transfer since the Board of Glen only undertook such activities and entered into such transactions as Subhash instructed.  However, this conclusion is merely provisional until the way in which Glen was managed, directed and controlled and the way in which its assets were used after it was formed are examined.   </p>

Managers Ltd who were management companies based in Jersey who were appointed by Strachans, a Jersey-based provider of company management services and related professional services. Strachans had been appointed by Subhash to arrange the incorporation of Glen and to provide management services and a registered office for Glen in Jersey. Three directors were appointed by Strachans, two being management companies based in Jersey. The chairman was a Strachans director who was also a director of Glen. These directors, through their respective representatives, authorised the transfer of the two issued shares to Ramila and the allotment of a further 248 shares to Ramila and 250 shares to Vijaya. SKT, being Subhash’s accountancy firm that was located at Thakrar House, 113, Woolwich High Street, Woolwich, London, SE18 6DN, were appointed Glen’s accountants. </p>

However, the annual accounts, prepared by SKT under Subhash’s direction, made it clear that Glen controlled its activities outside the United Kingdom and did not maintain any branch offices in the United Kingdom. Despite those assertions, the management of the properties registered in Glen’s name was undertaken by SKT and all paperwork relating to the company’s day to day activities was kept at Thakrar House. The company did not employ any staff directly, save for its directors and Strachans but Strachans’ role was a purely formal one of receiving and transmitting Subhash’s instructions. Thus, the management was, in a formal sense, off-shore. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Thus, for the first year of trading, being the year ending 30 June 1990, Strachans were paid management expenses, including directors’ fees, of £15,157 in relation to a company with fixed property assets valued at £889,341. The directors only met, outside the United Kingdom and often by a telephone call, to ratify those decisions and transactions that Subhash had taken or instructed that required a Board resolution or director’s approval. Subhash was able to undertake these roles because he was Glen’s accountant, was acting as the manager of the entirety of Glen’s assets being the properties held in its name and was able to assert that he was the owners’ attorney and was taking all decisions on their behalf. The passive role played by the directors and management company in Jersey arose from their understanding that the company had been set up by a wealthy overseas investor for tax purposes and that their role was to take their instructions from the owner, who they had never met, via the person who appeared to have the owners’ authority to convey their instructions to the directors and the management company.</p>

Thus, copies of two documents were disclosed by Glen which purported to be authorities signed by Ramila, dated 4 October 1991, and by Vijaya, dated 31 August 1993 and which appointed named individuals as their proxies to vote for them and on their behalf at, respectively, the first and third Annual General Meetings of Glen. Vijaya was, of course, resident in Kenyaand never received a copy of this document to sign and Ramila was adamant that she did not receive documents to sign although, at the date of the document purportedly signed by her, she was resident in England. It would be extremely unlikely that Subhash would have arranged for valid signatures to be placed on these documents by either Ramila or Vijaya since it would have risked Ramila and Vijaya discovering the truth about the misuse of their names in relation to Glen and its property holdings. The signatures did not need to be witnessed and I conclude that the signatures were forged by Subhash so as to enable apparently regular Annual General Meetings to proceed using proxy votes. I also infer that, for reasons of Liberian or Jersey law or as a result of Glen’s internal regulations, it must have been necessary for Subhash to obtain the signature of the owners of the shares on the proxy forms. This is because, otherwise, Subhash would have relied on the powers of attorney that he held to provide his signature for and on behalf of the apparent owners of Glen in the same way that he usually operated when undertaking management functions relating to Glen.</p>

Furthermore, on Subhash’s case, the loan account up to November 1990 must have been jointly owed to Ramila and Vijaya as the owner so that each individually was owed half the sum shown in the loan account.

The implication is that the owner’s loan account has been reduced by the proceeds of property disposals.  But that also implies that the sales proceeds were received by Ramila and Vijaya.

Furthermore, the proceeds of sale of two properties allegedly beneficially owned by Glen having previously allegedly been beneficially owned by Ramila were paid to and used by someone other than either of them.

She did not remember the circumstances in which she signed this power of attorney but she could only have signed it on the basis that Subhash stated that it was wanted in connection with the Jayaben Trust. At that time, there was growing concern about the way that Nilesh was apparently failing to account to the trustees of this trust arising out of income from properties bought with trust funds which Nilesh was managing. These properties had nothing to do with, and were not connected with, any of the ex-SPC or ex-William’s Estate properties and no monies associated with those other properties were intermingled with the Jayaben Trust fund. The trustees of the Jayaben Trust were Subhash and Ramila, and Subhash was, as Ramila understood the situation, attempting to regularise the accounts of the trust. It was for this purpose that Ramila thought that she was providing Subhash with her power of attorney. </p>

By 1993, Ramila’s only involvement in Glen and its properties was as the holder of a single share and as bare trustee of properties that had been sold to Glen but, so as to save on stamp duty, had not been formally registered in Glen’s name. It is inconceivable that Subhash would have explained to Ramila that the power of attorney was wanted in connection with either the share or the properties. Thus, although Subhash probably wanted an up to date power of attorney to enable him to complete the conveyancing of the properties from Ramila to Glen, the use of this power of attorney after July 1993 by Subhash was on the same unauthorised basis as his use of the December 1985 power of attorney. </p>

As clear evidence of Subhash’s role in Glen and its shareholding, he never discussed the change of advisors with either Ramila or Vijaya and, indeed, told a clear and unvarnished lie when stating to Mr Egglishaw that he had received a telephone from “the clients”, that Ramila and Vijaya had expressed themselves to be “very very concerned” and had instructed that “their” advisors engagement be terminated and transferred to new advisors. These lies, and the failure to discuss the matter with them or to inform them of the need to instruct new advisors or to introduce them to the new advisors is the clearest possible evidence that Subhash regarded himself as “the client” and as the person entitled to the beneficial ownership of Glen and, through Glen, its assets. </p>

It would appear from their limited involvement in the running of the company and in the absence of Board Meeting minutes recording decisions taken by the directors, that Subhash’s iron grip on the running of the company continued after 1995. </p>

In the years after 1995, neither of these companies held Board Meetings on a regular basis and those that were held were held by telephone and appear merely to have adopted resolutions needed to implement Subhash’s instructions. Most correspondence from Subhash, who is clearly not computer literate and who never himself sent an e-mail, formerly refers to himself as attorney or accountant for Ramila, Vijaya or Mr Harjivan as the case may be, it is clear from the evidence that he never consulted any of these people in relation to any of Glen’s affairs. All correspondence included instructions or complaints and criticisms of the actions of other professionals.

He claimed to have disagreed with instructions in writing on a number of occasions but no such communication was disclosed or emerged from the discovery and document seizure of Subhash’s documents. Mr Shelton even volunteered during his cross-examination to produce copies of communications in which he challenged or disagreed with Subhash’s instructions but although he was subsequently recalled to the witness box for further questioning on other matters and also had every opportunity to search out and provide to the court such documents, none were ever produced. </p>

Each was instructed on the basis of Subhash’s powers of attorney and so he must have repeated the lie that he was acting for Ramila or Vijaya or, after 2000, Mr Harjivan with their knowledge and, often, on their direct instructions, on innumerable occasions. I found no occasion where Subhash stated that he had been instructed by, or had been contacted by, any of these three shadow individuals where the person in question had in fact contacted Subhash or had been informed contemporaneously of the matter in issue. Although most letters contained a statement that they had been copied to the individual allegedly instructing him to send the communication, it was apparent that no such copy was ever sent out. As was also apparent, Subhash resorted to forging either Ramila or Vijaya’s signature on a significant number of documents which were of a kind that they, as owner, would be expected to send or sign, so that the power of attorney would not be sufficient, but which it is clear that they never saw, discussed, had drawn to their attention or were shown. </p>

However, at my invitation, Mr Harjivan produced a handwritten note purporting to identify the families to whom the payments had been made and the amounts paid to each of them. Mr Harjivan prepared this list overnight from memory and name of the family, the country of residence and the amount paid to each family listed in a round lump sum were added. It was noticeable that the family names were all common Indian names. One example, involving payments totalling £3m, was to a family in Uganda called Ruparelia. This sum represented a debt or debts due to that family from Glen. He was instructed to make payments up to £3m to that family by Subhash although it was not stated what level of detail was provided by Subhash on his chitties nor to whom, when or where these debts were paid and what the debts were for was not stated because Mr Harjivan asserted that his memory was poor and the payments had been made about seven years previously. It was also clear that indebtedness to overseas creditors, other than to the owner of Glen, was not carried in the accounts of Glen and was not known about by Mr Shelton.</p>

The process is very unfamiliar to European business people and understandably perhaps difficult to accept because everything is done through third Parties.  The process has a name (“chitty”) which when translated means something like “a small piece of paper”.  It is difficult to give a lot of detail because I am bound by the agreements that I have with those who assisted in this process in that I have agreed not to disclose their details for all sorts of personal and financial reasons.</span>

I would estimate that approximately 60 to 70% of the purchase price was paid in this way.  The balance was raised through personal loans provided on trust through my business associates in India and South Africa.  These were people who were all well known to each other and where trust was very high between us.”</span>

Moreover, this informal note or jotting on the Register can have had no legal effect. Glen’s memorandum and articles provided a clear procedure for the re-registration of share ownership and for the evidencing of that by the issue of new share certificates and the creation of a formal new entry in the Register, all undertaken pursuant to a Board resolution. Although the memorandum and articles provide for the issue of Bearer Shares, there is no evidence that any Bearer Shares were ever issued save the suggestion by Subhash to Mr Shelton that such shares were issued. This suggestion was not substantiated with any evidence and Mr Harjivan denied in evidence that he had ever received any Bearer Shares. Thus, this manuscript note is to be treated as nothing more than a self-serving jotting placed on the Register, probably a note placed there by Mr Callendar as a reminder of what Subhash had told him during a telephone call<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="70">

These documents were required by Anchor Trust’s Compliance Department in order to allow it to formally recognise    a new shareholder in Glen.  Mr Shelton stated in evidence that, if he had been informed in March 2000 that Mr Harjivan had become the new owner of Glen, he would have required the same proof of Mr Harjivan’s identity as he in fact requested in January 2002.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="74">

Subhash stated that the purpose of this loan was to enable Rishi to purchase a flat out of monies which Subhash stated were “banked” with Teso by Vijaya. Subhash also stated that the loan should be interest-free, and not at the rate of 3% over base which Mr Callender had suggested, because such interest should be set off against the interest which Vijaya was owed and had not been paid by Teso “for the substantial shareholder’s loans which have been made over the last 14 years, i.e. from June 1989 to date”. In cross-examination, Mr Shelton agreed that that, if shareholder’s loans were still outstanding to Vijaya in March 2003, logic dictates that   Subhash must have considered that Vijaya was still a shareholder of Glen and Teso in March 2003.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="75">

This extract from Mr Shelton’s evidence demonstrates not only how unreliable Subhash’s statements were that related to the share ownership of Glen but also how unreliable Mr Shelton’s evidence was on the same subject:</p>

Balchan Management Limited duly organised the formation of two BVI companies including Thornbridge Ltd and on 6 July 2004 Balchan Nominees Limited, the registered holder of the sole issued share in Thornbridge, executed a declaration of trust of its registered share in Thornbridge in favour of Mitesh.</p>

Mr Evans’ file note of this conversation recorded Subhash as saying that “the bearer shares issued some time ago to Ramila and Vijaya are now being held on behalf of Mr Mahendra<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="77">

It is also apparent that Subhash intended to refer to Mitesh, because he did not reply to Mr Evans correcting Mr Evans’s reference to Mitesh until some 7 weeks later after the LVT hearing where it was alleged on behalf of the tenant that Glen, Teso and Mitesh were connected persons. In relation to that hearing, it suited Subhash’s purposes to deny that there was any connection between Glen, Teso and Mitesh.   </p>

A handwritten note on the file note states: “Updated.  Taskforce 1/7/04”.  According to Mr Shelton, Taskforce was the software system Anchor Trust used to record details of beneficial ownership and similar details. It appeared from this file note that 1 July 2004 was the date on which Mr Mitesh Mahendra was entered onto this system for the first time.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="78">

Mr Harjivan was merely the mouthpiece of this fiction, albeit, in repeating it, he actively connived in it. In short, they contended that there was no contract between Mr Harjivan as buyer and Vijaya and Ramila as seller for any of these shares. This was because there was no agreement relating to the sale and purchase of these shares, the shares were not Vijaya and Ramila’s to sell and Mr Harjivan did not become their beneficial owner because he did not pay to, or to the order of, Vijaya and Ramila, and Vijaya and Ramila did not receive from him, any consideration for the shares, let alone £12 million.</p>

As was apparent both from his written evidence, despite having been prepared by Subhash, and his oral evidence, Mr Harjivan was wholly confused as to whether Vijaya and Ramila were supposed to have owed monies to Glen and Teso or to have been owed monies by Glen and Teso. Equally, he was wholly confused as to whether his alleged payments were used to discharge the indebtedness of Glen and Teso to Vijaya and Ramila or the indebtedness of Glen and Teso to third Parties or the indebtedness of Vijaya and Ramila to third Parties or all of these things at the same time.  The confusion is symptomatic of evidence that had been made up. Furthermore, it was so vague as to suggest that it was devised in an attempt to gloss over the total lack of any documentary support for Mr Harjivan’s evidence and as a cover for the inability of Mr Harjivan or Subhash to identify any particular payments made or indebtedness repaid.</p>

He accepted in evidence that he had had no direct contact with Vijaya or Ramila or lawyers acting for Vijaya and Ramila in relation to the alleged sale.  He also accepted that he had been given limited information about either company prior to agreeing to purchase their shares. All he claimed to have been shown were some accounting papers relating to Glen. These could not have assisted him in his decision as to whether or not to purchase the company because he knew absolutely nothing about accounts. His decision was an investment decision to provide him with an income for his retirement. He was not a wealthy man and he was unable to provide any documents to establish that his business would have earned him, or could have provided the means of paying, the about £6 – £8 million of the purchase price that he stated that he had provided from his own resources over an eighteen-month period between 1998 and 2000. </p>

By the time he continued his evidence in October 2006, Mr Harjivan was able to come up with a name.  However, this time it was to say that he had not in fact instructed a firm of accountants, but a retired accountant by the name of  “Mr Cunha”. He could give no further details of this retired accountant except his name which is one of the most common of Portuguese surnames.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-right:-0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, according to Mr Harjivan’s oral testimony in July 2006, even his discussions with Subhash were limited.  Apparently he had one telephone call with Subhash who sent him papers: “about some premium and some houses and also the debt that the company was owing”. Once he had received these papers, Mr Harjivan, without more, made preparations to pay the money for the companies. Mr Harjivan changed that evidence substantially when he returned to continue his evidence.  In his fourth witness statement, Mr Harjivan stated that he had only decided to purchase Glen and Teso after a series of meetings and telephone conversations with Subhash about their purchase and Subhash’s advice and information played a crucial part in his decision to purchase these companies.  When asked in cross-examination why he had not mentioned anything about this series of meetings and telephone conversations during his earlier evidence, all Mr Harjivan could say was that “these events were not fresh in my mind” at the time that he gave evidence in July, but “after that, I thought about it again and then all those events, all those facts, came back to mind”.</p>

He stated that Subhash had supplied him with “accounting documentation for the company”, “details of the debts owed by the company together with details of the accumulated interest on those debts” and “a schedule setting out all of the properties owned by the company … with the values that Subhash had provided”, and showed him all of this “in order that all of the information could be taken into account when arriving at a figure for the purchase of the company”; after being shown which Mr Harjivan “agreed to buy shares in the company for £12M; the company was Glen”.  However, that evidence was obviously made up because Mr Harjivan had no idea where the documents he had just referred to were and displayed no understanding or insight as to what might have become of them since, as he explained, the documents had no real meaning or significance for him.

The only accounting documents of Glen that Mr Harjivan could have been shown by Subhash were accounts of Glen prepared prior to Mr Harjivan’s agreement to purchase the shares in Glen and the commencement of the payment of the purchase price in 1999.  The accounts of Glen for the year ended 30 June 1997 show “creditors” standing at £3,185,057 and “overseas loan accounts” standing at £2,907,588. Glen failed to disclose accounts for 1998 or 1999. However, from the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2000 it appears that as at 31 March 1999 “creditors” stood at £4,184,577. The breakdown as between “overseas loan accounts” and <span class="I" style="font-style:normal">mortgage </span>accounts is missing, but even assuming the figure for <span class="I" style="font-style:normal">mortgage </span>accounts remained more or less the same as for 1997, the “overseas loan accounts” would have grown to no more than £3.8 million.  Neither the 1997 figure nor the 1999 figure supports a purchase price of £12 million.</p>

The position as at 31 March 1999 was that the company still had an adverse balance on profit and loss account of £253,889.  By no stretch of the imagination could a company reasonably be valued at a price of £12 million on the basis of those figures.</p>

This evidence was given after Mr Harjivan had previously stated in evidence that Subhash was some one he hardly knew and with whom he did not have a close relationship or even what could be called a relationship at all.</p>

Mr Harjivan could not “remember the numbers” but simply asserted that “there were a lot of businesses I made and I got lots of commission”. From a man who produced no documentary evidence whatsoever of his earnings or income from any stage of his working life, Mr Harjivan’s bare assertion that he turned over £200 million worth of deals in two years appears fanciful.</p>

However, that evidence was contradicted by Mr Harjivan’s own witness statement that he prepared just before resuming his evidence in October that “I have been completely retired for three or four years” and “I no longer take part in any overseas funding arrangements as I did previously when I was in business.

He had agreed this price with Subhash as being the amount of money inclusive of interest that was owed by Glen and Teso to its shareholders.  This figure for the outstanding indebtedness to Glen and Teso’s shareholders only first came into being long after the event of the alleged sale in December 2005 when Subhash was asked to assist Mr Shelton and Mr Barby to prepare the affidavits ordered by the court and the Points of Defence of Glen and Teso. For that purpose, Mr Narinder Sanghera, an employee of SKTL and previously an employee of SKT, prepared a schedule of the debt alleged to be owed by Glen to its owner that was then exhibited by Mr Barby to his second witness statement.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="87">

	      </authorialNote> Unlike the accounts of Glen, this schedule prepared by Mr Sanghera included “rolled-up” interest on the outstanding loans. There was no apparent reason for using compound interest for the first time.  Mr Harjivan’s case was that he paid the sum of £12 million over a period of 1½ - 2 years in 1999 and 2000.  The mid-point of that two-year period is 31 December 1999.  If one looks on Mr Sanghera’s schedule for the cumulative debt figure stated to have been due on 31 December 1999, one sees the figure of £12,079,155.47.  That would seem to match the alleged purchase price which Mr Harjivan said he had actually paid in 1999-2000.</p>

Indebtedness of this amount had not featured earlier, particularly at the time when Mr Harjivan said that he had paid the purchase price. This can be seen from the evidence produced by Subhash himself.  In the course of earlier legal proceedings in November 2001, Glen was required by the court to produce a letter of confirmation of the total debt secured by the Teso charge<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="88">

		  <span style="font-size:8pt">shareholder.  Thus, although sometimes expressed as money owed by Glen to Teso, what is in fact being referred to is Glen’s indebtedness to its own shareholder which was “secured” by Glen granting charges over its assets to Teso, a company also owned by the shareholder of Glen.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"/>
	      </authorialNote>.  For that purpose Subhash faxed to Mr Laffoley of Glen “calculations of the outstanding Glen loans with interest added to 30 September 2002 and still accruing”<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>  According to these calculations, the cumulative debt figure as at 31 December 1999, including compound interest, was £7,211,821.51.  Yet at the time this figure was produced, according to the case now put forward by Subhash and Mr Harjivan, Mr Harjivan had allegedly already purchased Glen by completing payments totalling £12 million to discharge the outstanding shareholder’s loans.  The figure for the purchase price of £12 million is, therefore, clearly a subsequent invention. Indeed, there is no evidence in any of the documents that have emanated from Glen or in any of its accounts as to what size any particular loan was, when these loans were advanced, what their purpose was, to what use the money loaned was put and how the shareholder obtained the loans in the first place. The fact that the precise figure representing the outstanding loans in 2000 was only first produced in December 2005 and that there is no evidence about the loans both cast serious doubt as to whether there had ever been any sale of Glen’s shares to Mr Harjivan.</p>

A further example of Mr Harjivan’s ignorance about the company which he claimed to be the sole owner of occurred in 2005 when Mr Barby was ordered by the court to file and serve an affidavit disclosing the detail of Teso’s assets. Mr Barby had to go straight to Subhash and he prepared the required information from a schedule provided to him by Subhash even though he had personally met with Mr Harjivan for the first time just over three weeks previously on the occasion of Subhash’s daughter’s wedding for “due diligence” purposes connected with Mr Barby taking over management of Teso. <span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Clearly, it would have been expected that Mr Barby would have consulted Mr Harjivan about Glen’s assets when preparing a court-ordered document yet it appears not to have occurred to Mr Barby to ask Mr Harjivan for information about the assets of the company of which Mr Harjivan was supposedly the sole owner<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="92">

This was so even though Mr Harjivan was fully aware that he did not need to give a power of attorney to a firm of accountants simply to appoint them as his or his company’s accountants, because he had already appointed accountants for his business in Lisbon without it being considered necessary to grant them also a power of attorney and also because he was adamant that only Mr Shelton could decide matters affecting Glen because he was a director and Subhash was not. It followed that Mr Harjivan, on his view of Subhash’s role, had no need to grant a power of attorney to Subhash and that in reality, Subhash was taking a power of attorney from someone with nominal powers of management in order to allow himself to act as the real owner of Glen.</p>

In support of that claim, on the last day of his evidence, Mr Harjivan produced a letter that he said he had asked Jagdish Tanna of Nilesh Exim to write concerning the project.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="108">

This suggestion related to a man whose personal financial circumstances were such that, according to him, in 1999 and 2000 he had had to take out loans to pay the bulk of the purchase price of £12 million for his shares in Glen and Teso. It also related to a man who, in 2001, had been unable to give or lend  his children £90,000 in order for them to repay their existing loans and to have some funds to re-equip their shops and who in consequence had had to approach Subhash in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to raise the money in England.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="110">

When he first gave evidence, Mr Harjivan’s evidence consisted of a complete denial that <span class="I" style="font-style:normal">Subhash </span>had had anything to do with the preparation of this document. At that stage, Mr Harjivan was unrepresented. However, once legal assistance, including the assistance of counsel, was provided to Mr Harjivan by order of the court, with an associated order that that representation should be funded out of Glen’s resources, Mr Harjivan served a further witness statement which contained the frank admission that <span class="I" style="font-style:normal">Subhash </span>had in fact written the points of defence in their entirety. Mr Harjivan suggested, by way of explanation for his erroneous evidence, that he had prepared it when he was completely on his own save for the assistance given to him in Lisbon by his daughter who was both an English speaker and a Portuguese lawyer practising Portuguese law in Lisbon.</p>

Mr Harjivan did, however, continue to contend that the substance of his evidence and of the points of defence was correct. The points of defence was a very long document which was written in good English. It amounted to a combination of a pleading setting out Mr Harjivan’s defence, a full witness statement of his supporting evidence and a submission. Thus, the entirety of the incredible explanation of how Mr Harjivan came to be the beneficial owner of the entirety of Glen and Teso’s shares had been drafted by Subhash and Mr Harjivan’s evidence amounted to a repetition and confirmation of this explanation in the witness box. His lies as to how the statement had been drafted and his denial of Subhash’s involvement in that drafting process could only have been both deliberate and calculated. They were only withdrawn after Mr Harjivan had been advised by experienced counsel and an experienced litigator when helping him to draft the further witness statement that retracted his first explanation of how the points of defence had been prepared.</p>

It was therefore necessary to question Mr Harjivan at some length in chief in a non-leading manner in order to get him to explain the context in which his evidence should be set and how the evidence was prepared.

His evidence as to his “notion of the English Language” shows that he accepted that he could understand English reasonably well since, otherwise, he could not have understood the points of defence. This conclusion is supported by Mr Shelton’s evidence that he never had any difficulty in both communicating with, and understanding, Mr Harjivan in English since Mr Shelton does not speak Portuguese. This conclusion provides support for my finding that Mr Harjivan was not confused when initially giving his evidence.</p>

From that evidence, i</span>t was clear that Mr Harjivan had not used this post box for some years before 2002, albeit that it had been his address when he was resident in Mozambique. He had also clearly left Mozambique for good long before 2002. There was, indeed, no evidence that it was still an active address for Mr Harjivan or for anyone else nominated by him. Finally, Mr Harjivan was unable to give any satisfactory explanation as to why he had provided Subhash with a general power of attorney at all or why he had given as his current address this dormant post box address on that power of attorney. What is clear, however, is that Mr Harjivan had no notion, when first giving evidence, that this address was, or should be presented as being, associated with Vijaya. </p>

This was the address that Subhash had given to the solicitor who he was instructing should take over acting for Vijaya in 2002 in the Family Action. That solicitor was Mr Simon Clark of Kotecha &amp; Co. Subhash’s instructions also included the information that Vijaya was permanently resident in Mozambique. Mr Clark was instructed by Subhash to send correspondence for the attention of Vijaya to this postal address.</span></p>

	      <span class="I" style="font-style:normal">When he gave these instructions to Mr Clark, Subhash lied in stating that he was acting for Vijaya as opposed to using her name for his own purposes, that Vijaya was a real rather than a nominal plaintiff in the claim being pursued, that she had a genuine claim against Party 4, that she lived in Mozambique in 2002 and that the PO box address he gave was her postal address. These lies were integral to Subhash’s and the other Thakrar Family’s dishonest conduct of the Family Action. They were also an integral part of his long-running dishonesty in relation to the ex-SPC properties and to the identity of the beneficial ownership of Glen and Teso.  </span>

	      <span class="I" style="font-style:normal">Subhash would have been concerned that Mr Harjivan’s original answers about this postal address could completely undermine all of these dishonest actions since Mr Harjivan’s original evidence supported and corroborated Vijaya’s evidence that she had had no involvement with the properties transferred into her name or with the shares she was said to own beneficially or with the action brought in her name to enforce her apparent rights of beneficial property ownership. It is therefore highly material that Subhash appears to have persuaded Mr Harjivan to change his evidence relating to Vijaya’s involvement in the Mozambique post box. Subhash’s and Mr Harjivan’s actions in this respect support the conclusion that both were acting dishonestly in relation to their suggestion that Mr Harjivan was the beneficial owner of Glen and Teso’s shares.</span>

For this purpose, he represented that he was being paid “20.000” a year by a business of his son Mitesh called Mitesh Mahendra Unipersonal Partnership. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-right:-0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">This was an obvious and blatant example of Mr Harjivan’s dishonesty either inbeing prepared to enter into such obviously dishonest transactions or in being prepared to lie and, in lying, to invent dishonesty in order to seek to obtain a beneficial interest in shares worth many millions of pounds to which he is not entitled. It was also a particularly glaring example of Mr Harjivan’s inability to provide evidence that would corroborate his own evidence. Had he named the lenders, evidence from them could then have been sought and, if Mr Harjivan’s evidence was correct, this third Party evidence would significantly corroborate his evidence. If, however, that evidence was at variance with Mr Harjivan’s evidence, it would undermine if not destroy Mr Harjivan’s case. Thus, Mr Harjivan’s inability or refusal to provide the names of those he had borrowed money from strongly suggested that those lenders did not exist, that Mr Harjivan never borrowed the money at all and that his own evidence that he had borrowed this money was a lie.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-right:-0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence now shows that Mr Harjivan agreed to the misuse of Glen’s assets to pay contributions towards his solicitors’ legal fees in April, May and June 2006 and that he lied to the court in July 2006 as to how he had provided funds to those solicitors. The payments to his then solicitors originated from an account held by Glen in London with the HSBC. This account was entirely under the control of Mukesh and Subhash and was used by them to receive rent payments and other similar income and the only people with authority to run the account were Mukesh and other members of the Thakrar family. Mr Shelton left this account entirely in the hands of the Thakrar family in London and it continued to be operated by Mukesh in breach of the terms of the 2005 freezing orders obtained by Party 1.</p>

These payments were transferred into to Ross &amp; Craig’s client’s account. In the case of the last five of these payments, they were first paid into an account operated by Subhash’s wife or daughter or by Mr Harjivan’s daughter. These payments were made as follows:</p>

No other evidence of this requirement was provided to the court. According to Mr Harjivan, this requirement necessitated further payments to be made from Glen into a personal account and from that account to Ross &amp; Craig. In consequence, three separate payments were made from Glen’s HSBC account into an account held by Kiran, for £5,000 on about 25 April 2006, and into an account held by Rishi, Subhash’s son, for £9,000 on about 27 April 2006 and for £10,000 on about 4 May 2006. These sums were then transferred by Kiran and Rishi to Ross &amp; Craig’s client’s account. </p>

The court retained control on the limit of funds to be provided in this way. The court accepted Party 1’s submission that such payments were not payments being made in the ordinary course of Glen’s business but directed that the payments should none the less be made from Glen’s funds. This direction was made on the basis that Mr Harjivan was entitled to a fair hearing of his case that he was the beneficial owner of Glen and Teso’s shares and that Mr Harjivan should have access to legal assistance to ensure that his case was fully and fairly presented to the court. The only way this could be achieved was for him to be legally represented using funds provided by the company over which he claimed beneficially ownership and whose beneficial ownership was the principal issue to be resolved in the litigation. </p>

However, following that meeting, Mr Harjivan next met Subhash in Tenerife in the late 1980s, having probably met him no more than once or twice in the intervening period at parties or weddings in London. </p>

He sent me all the elements for the business and he explained that the ladies wanted to sell the shares because they were facing some difficulties of making some payments of some debts contracted by them. From that point he gave me some numbers and with these numbers I studied let us say, these numbers and I tried to find at some point, at some time, to do this business in London.

This was Glen’s balance sheet for the period during which Mr Harjivan alleged that he had made the loan to the Thakrar family. This balance sheet is highly material because Mr Harjivan also gave evidence that he:</p>

	      </authorialNote> Mr Harjivan said that he had made a loan of £1.6 million to the Thakrar family and assigned the benefit of that loan to Glen.  Further, it was clear from note 7 to the accounts that  £789,420 of the figure of £965,920 shown as due as at 31 March 2004 was attributable to a loan advance that was plainly not Mr Harjivan’s alleged loan to the Thakrar family. When this was drawn to Mr Harjivan’s attention in cross-examination, he changed his evidence and stated that the loan was not assigned to Glen but to Teso and sought to justify that evidence by drawing attention to a document headed “Summary of outstanding loans due to Teso as at 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005” that he had exhibited to his second witness statement dated 6 September 2006. However, this document did not evidence any assignment of indebtedness to Mr Harjivan from the Thakrar family which he had assigned to Teso since it was no more than a spreadsheet that SKTL produced in December 2005 and it therefore provided no evidence of any liability of the Thakrar family to repay a loan to Teso.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="138">

His cross-examination on this part of his evidence that related to the alleged loan to the Thakrar family did elicit additional features which further highlighted the mendacious quality of his evidence and the improbability that this loan had ever been made or that any investment in this project had ever occurred.

She was liable to pay just under £1 million for the portfolio if the contract for this sale was genuine. Both Vijaya and Ramila gave evidence that no money changed hands when Vijaya was alleged to have bought Ramila’s shares in Glen although the 250 shares would have been worth several million pounds. Finally, Vijaya gave evidence that she received nothing despite Mr Harjivan’s evidence that he paid £12 million for her 499 shares in Glen. </p>

What I would like to ask you, Subhash, there is a large number of questions that I and the claiming Parties will have no doubt have, if every point that you raised were to be discussed, but I have ruled that you had the opportunity to be questioned on many matters, and you, as we now, on advice, claimed the privilege against self-incrimination, and I subsequently invited  you and the claiming Parties whether, in the light of the change of the law, which no longer would enable you     to claim that privilege, you would wish to submit yourself to questioning on all the issues in the case,         and whether the claiming Parties would wish to question you.  You elected not to submit yourself, and the claiming Parties elected not to apply again to cross-examine. In the light of that, it does not seem to me to be appropriate, merely because some of the matters are set out in your statement, to re-open the whole question of your cross-examination.  But having said that, in this statement there is a particularly serious allegation, or evidence, rather, that you give. It's the passage where you're dealing with Ramila and I think Vijaya as well.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-right:-0.07in">324.<marker name="tab"/>Subhash’s answer in the many documents examined during the trial to questions about his role or status in the affairs of Glen and Teso was that he was acting under a power of attorney for the beneficial owner, in other words he was acting as the attorney of Ramila, Vijaya or Mr Harjivan as the case might be. He sometimes held himself out as their accountant. Thus, it was necessary to examine the circumstances and background to the innumerable separate instances when he was acting, purportedly in this agency role since he did not give evidence, save on the last day of the trial in limited circumstances<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="147">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>See paragraph 308.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Thus, the principal way in which I have had to decide whether Subhash was the beneficial owner of Glen and Teso’s shares has had to be by examining all the instances evidenced at the trial of his actions and considering whether each separately and all together are capable of being explained as the actions of an agent for the beneficial owner of the shares in, and hence of, these companies or whether they can only be explained as the actions of the beneficial owner himself. There were, however, many significant actions of Subhash which could be seen only to have been capable of being explained as the actions of someone who was, who was holding himself out to be and who considered himself to be the beneficial owner of the shares. I will address these particular actions and statements in this section of the judgment.  </p>

Equally, the actions of Mr Shelton in relation to every aspect of Glen’s activities were only consistent with his acting under the direct instructions of Subhash and unquestioningly following those instructions whilst exercising no independent decision-making or management function of his own and where wholly inconsistent with his being and acting as a working director of Glen and taking his own management decisions on its behalf. The role of Mr Barby as a director of Teso was equally obviously that of a functionary acting exclusively on behalf of that company’s beneficial owner.</p>

Thus Subhash stated at the original trial that it was Ramila’s solicitor, Mr Roger Smith of Claremont Haynes, who advised him that Ramila, because she was resident abroad, should form an offshore company to shield her from UK inheritance tax. As is now known from the contemporaneous correspondence that was not disclosed at the original trial but was obtained as a result of the search of the premises of SKT under the powers of the search and seizure warrant obtained by Subhash’s Trustee, this idea in fact emanated from Subhash himself.  Thus in a letter dated 31 May 1989 from Mr Smith to Mr Anthony Evered of Strachans, Mr Smith stated:</p>

Further, prior to executing the agreement to sell the ex-SPC properties to Glen, Subhash appears to have obtained a further power of attorney from Ramila dated 15 March 1990.  Ramila had no recollection of having signed this document on that date but it is not necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether it was a forgery or not. In both Ramila and Vijaya’s case, such power of attorney as was signed was not signed with either being conscious at any time that it was to be used for the purpose of acquiring properties or owning shares. Subhash’s only purpose in obtaining these fresh powers of attorney and then using them unilaterally without reference to Ramila and Vijaya or anyone else was to enable him to acquire the beneficial ownership of both the properties and the shares in question for himself using the names of others as his nominees.</p>

Instead,   the shares in Glen were simply transferred to Vijaya. Only Subhash appears to have been aware of this alleged transfer and it was brought about, if it occurred at all, by Subhash. The transfer of shares was unknown to either Ramila or Vijaya and this transfer, in these circumstances, can only be explained on the basis of its having been made by the beneficial owner who, for his own purposes, was changing the nominee holding in some of the share he owned beneficially from one name to another. </p>

Had anyone other than Subhash been the beneficial owner of Glen, that person would have had to be consulted by Subhash first both as to the decision to dismiss the professional manager of his company and as to the identity and terms of appointment of the successor manager.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-right:-0.07in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that Mr Shelton’s only knowledge about Ramila’s alleged loan account with Glen was what Subhash told him. Nonetheless, Mr Shelton believed that he did in fact complete whatever formalities were required of Glen to sign off the loan account. However, despite exhaustive searches in the offices of SKT and in every other location where relevant documents might be located if they ever existed,   no such loan documentation has in fact been unearthed. I conclude that there never was a loan account, that Mr Shelton never sought to “complete any formalities” and that Subhash’s letter was sent to Mr Shelton for some ulterior and dishonest purpose without Subhash having any honest belief that Ramila was or ever had been owed money by Glen. Mr Shelton, I find, merely ignored the letter once he received it.  When asked whether he had any comment about this conclusion, if it were to be made, Mr Shelton had no comment to make about such a conclusion even though such a conclusion would lead to the inexorable conclusion that a potential fraud and deception had been perpetrated by Subhash. </p>

In other words, save in a situation in which Glen’s off-shore status was threatened, Mr Shelton unquestionably did what he was told or turned a blind eye to anything, such as the letter of 27 January 2003, that he knew or sensed was “part of Subhash’s nonsense”.</p>

This price was fixed by Subhash at a time when, according to a letter from Simon Clark of Kotecha &amp; Co to Mr Shelton dated 11 April 2003, it had been valued at less than £8,000. </p>

None of these matters has ever been established by credible evidence nor evidenced in documents that are currently available.

Mr Shelton never attempted to provide any such copies subsequently.

However, this increase was, again according to Mr Shelton, the result of Glen’s property holdings being augmented in the years 2001-2004 by “properties which were originally being held in one of the Thakrar's names at some time or another” prior to the time Mr Harjivan was supposed to have become a shareholder of Glen.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="186">

Mr Shelton had no personal knowledge of the transactions involved but could only assume, consistently with the practice of SKT in crediting the shareholder’s loan account but in the absence of any documentary or first hand evidence to that effect, that Mr Harjivan must have paid the owner for them when he purchased Glen.  However, even Mr Harjivan when giving evidence did not suggest that he had bought from the owner of Glen any property other than or in addition to the shares in Glen and Teso.</p>

The only person who could have been the beneficial owner for these purposes and who could have taken and implemented the decision to augment the shareholder’s loan was Subhash.</p>

While such a provision would be highly unusual, whatever the financial circumstances of the owner, they become incredible if, as was suggested, it was Mr Harjivan who was the owner of Glen given that, according to him, he had no substantial assets outside of Glen. This incredulity was stretched beyond breaking point given Mr Harjivan’s further evidence in cross-examination that he did not receive even any part of the rental income stream from the company from the Glen properties and that that income stream was both received, administered and spent by Subhash through SKT.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="188">

This was to be done by artificially creating the impression that Glen had little or no free assets because its assets were to be shown in its filed accounts as being matched by equal or greater liabilities that were secured by prior legal charges. The “loans” which the Teso charges purported to secure were not in fact loans from Teso to Glen, but the “shareholder’s loan account”, which was an accounting device whereby the owner of Glen put, or purported to put, assets into the Glen.</p>

In other words, the loans were simply another accounting device created and inserted into the accounts by Subhash. From the owner’s perspective, it made no difference whether the net balance of inter-company loans was in favour of Teso or Glen.  However, the circularity went beyond this.  Since, as Mr Shelton informed the Court, Teso did not trade, had no real assets and no real income and had never traded and never had had any real assets or income, Teso could not itself have been the source of the inter-company “loans” made to Glen.  </p>

The properties in questions are set out by Title Number at paragraph 2 of the order of the TCC dated 2 August 2006. By that order, the TCC declared that the Subhash charges were spent and/or of no effect and made orders for the registers of title of Subhash’s properties to be rectified accordingly. The Thakrar Family members’ charges were granted over properties in which one or more of Parties 8 – 13 had a legal or beneficial interest. These properties are listed in Part B to the schedule to the order. No summary order was made in connection with these properties. The same considerations apply to these so that this judgment is concerned to explain and provide reasons for the summary order made on 2 August 2006 in relation to the Subhash charges and to find facts relevant to applications to rectify the registers of title in connection with the Thakrar Family members’ charges.</p>

This was to be achieved by the device of Teso taking charges over the assets of Glen for which it had provided no real consideration. Thus, when Subhash and the Thakrar Family members provided charges which Teso took over their properties, the obvious starting point in considering whether these charges secured any genuine indebtedness was the same as with the Glen charges. In other words, since the charges appeared to have been created in identical circumstances and in an identical manner to those created over Glen’s properties, they were probably created as a device to prevent the Claiming Parties from enforcing their costs judgments in favour of those Parties.</p>

In Shantaben’s case, it is clear that she was not consulted.

Subhash acted in this way so as to be able to start proceedings in both Ramila and Vijaya’s names without them knowing about or being contacted directly by Birkett Long in order to further his fraudulent pursuit of money from the Estate of Neil for himself in relation to properties held nominally in their names. Proceedings brought by the other Family members were started by Subhash at his suggestion and each family member from the outset left everything to Subhash since they regarded the properties held in their respective names as belonging to Subhash and as being placed in their respective names by Subhash for tax or other purposes dictated by Subhash.</p>

He also informed the corporate manager that Glen’s current borrowing was only about £500,000. This information, again, was likely to be accurate given the circumstances in which it was provided. That meant that Glen did not in fact owe many millions of pounds in shareholders’ loans despite the suggestion to this effect in its accounts when they were prepared by Subhash subsequently.

Vijaya telephoned Subhash in England and asked him what the letter was all about. He merely told her that there was nothing to worry about and that she should burn the letter. He also told her that she should burn any further documents that might arrive. He also informed her that he was going to send her £10,000 to help fund any of her children’s education and he subsequently arranged for £5,000 to be sent to a bank account opened by Vijaya for that purpose.

It was suggested in Subhash’s letter that letters from overseas were often opened by the Kenyan authorities and that if a letter contained anything of a business or financial nature, the intended recipient would often be threatened by the authorities with violence due to their jealousy of those with overseas assets.

Specifically, Bowling &amp; Co was to write to Mr Shelton to instruct him that she has disposed of her shares in Glen some years previously and to ensure that Glen’s records were amended accordingly. I also find that Subhash acted in this way because he wanted to provide a spurious air of authenticity to Mr Shelton that Ramila had sold her shares in Glen previously. I further find that this letter was triggered by Subhash having decided, in the light of his fall out with Birkett Long and their direct contact with Vijaya in Kenya and the disclosures that had had to be made in various pieces of litigation about his involvement in the affairs of Glen, that there was a real risk of his fraudulent use of Ramila and Vijaya’s names coming to light. Subhash had, in consequence, hatched his further fraudulent scheme to transfer all properties registered in Ramila and Vijaya’s names into Glen’s name and all shareholdings in Glen and Teso to be re-registered in Mr Harjivan’s name, in both cases using the registered names as nominees. The beauty of this scheme, from Subhash’s point of view, was that he had obtained Glen and Harjivan’s permission to use their names whilst hiding from both Glen and Harjivan the fraudulent purpose of that use.</p>

Moreover, he wanted to avoid the situation that had arisen not long before this CMC in which parties claiming against Glen were able to show that Glen and Subhash were closely connected. All other parties were not told of this decision and only learnt when SPC attempted to serve amended proceedings on Glen and Ramila by serving Subhash and the other family members’ then solicitors, Bowling &amp; Co who remained Subhash’s solicitors after the change of representation for the other family members. All that was ever stated by Subhash’s representation was that there was a conflict of interest arising from Subhash being sued and from his acting as Ramila and Vijaya’s attorney on their behalf in the same litigation. This explanation was untrue, Subhash did not perceive any conflict of interest, merely a risk to his elaborate and dishonest charade vis-à-vis Ramila and Vijaya being discovered.</p>

This finding as to Mr Shelton’s view about the fraud claims is reinforced by the evasive answer he gave when asked to elaborate on his view that the fraud claim was a good one. It is clear from the totality of his evidence that Mr Shelton’s view was based on his concern at Subhash’s paramount involvement in all Glen’s affairs including the action against Glen.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">These issues arise for five reasons. Firstly, Party 4 faces an appeal brought by Parties 8 – 13 against two of my findings in trial no. 1 relating to the claims brought by those Parties against Party 4 (limited to the claims against Miss Harris as Neil’s executrix) and contends that that appeal should be brought on the basis that it is an appeal from a judgment that is brought by the losing Parties who, as is now known, had conducted their case at trial in a dishonest and abusive manner. Secondly, Party 4 wishes to enforce the costs orders in its favour against Party 1, as Party 7’s Trustee in Bankruptcy, and Parties 7 – 13. Thirdly, if the Family Actions were conducted as an abuse of process, because Ramila and Vijaya were put forward as bringing valid claims in circumstances in which they were not Parties at all and had no valid claims and their claims were pursued in their names by Subhash, the judgments and orders (including for costs) against them should, as they claim, be set aside. Fourthly, if the actions were conducted as an abuse of process that would provide additional grounds for SPC’s claim that the compromise it entered into with Glen in trial no. 1 should be set aside as having been induced by fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation. Fifthly, if the actions were conducted as an abuse of process by Subhash, it would provide an additional ground for his being precluded from maintaining a contribution claim against Party 2 in their on-going claims against Glen and Teso and in their enforcement proceedings being brought against Subhash’s Estate and against Party 4.</p>

Three firms of solicitors were involved in these actions. Initially Birkett Long was instructed and Mr Adrian Livesley assisted by Mr Oliver Pryke acted. Mr Pryke gave evidence. When Subhash fell out with that firm, instructions were transferred to Bowling &amp; Co and Mr Jeremy Kleinfeld, who also gave evidence, was the file holder assisted by Mr Simon Clark. A perceived conflict arose between the case being conducted for Subhash in his defence to the main action and those being conducted on behalf of Parties 8 – 13 and instructions for the Thakrar Family Parties were then transferred to Kotecha &amp; Co to Mr Simon Clark who had moved to that firm from Bowling &amp; Co. He also gave evidence. The three solicitors who gave evidence had initially given witness statements for Parties 8 – 13 but those Parties indicated that they were not calling them to give evidence. In consequence, the court directed that they attend to be questioned on their witness statements as officers of the court rather than as witnesses for particular Parties. In addition, on 2 August 2006, the court received a further witness statement from Mr Livesley<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="225">

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">One unsatisfactory feature of the written evidence of the solicitor witnesses who were required to attend to be questioned was the way in which Seddons, the solicitors then acting for Parties 8-13, went about obtaining and preparing the statements in 2005. It appears they were prepared by reconstructing the facts based on an incomplete selection of documents supplied to each witness by Seddons. Mr Pryke’s oral evidence, expressing dissatisfaction with the process, was very clear as to how unsatisfactory that process was. However, the oral evidence of each was clear and the result was to provide the court with a clear account of how the Family Actions were progressed. That evidence was also important as the catalyst for the production of the more than twenty boxes of documents which came to light as a result of Mr Pryke’s evidence. These boxes had been in Mukesh’s custody or control at 113 Woolwich High Street since 2005 but had not been disclosed despite the numerous disclosure requests and orders made in these proceedings.  It is clear to me that this non-disclosure was the result of Subhash having taken steps to arrange for these boxes to be transferred to SKT’s offices and then having instructed Mukesh to keep them from disclosure. It is not clear how these boxes evaded the search and seizure process undertaken in 2005, probably they were only transferred to SKT’s offices after that process had been executed.</p>

Simon Clark gave evidence that as from then or early 2002, when a conflict emerged between Ramila and Subhash, he looked to Mukesh and Vijay for instructions. However the documents, such as the instructions as to what experts to instruct that were given to Kotecha in June 2002 and the testimony of Mukesh, Vijay, Sheela and Naina all pointed to Subhash as the directing and guiding hand in the conduct of the Family Actions and that his guidance was followed by his  siblings. </p>

His instructions and authority were never challenged but were always accepted as ‘guidance’ to be followed, even if dishonesty was required by one or more of his siblings in providing that compliance. </p>

It is clear, and my findings made in earlier sections of this judgment support this conclusion, that neither Ramila nor Vijaya had the remotest inkling that proceedings had been started in their name or that they were Parties to an action in which monies were being claimed in their name. It is also the case, as I have now found that they had no interest in the subject matter of the actions being brought in their names and that the basis of the actions was misconceived in that the actions were based on the assertion that they were the beneficial owners of the properties in question whereas, as Subhash and the other siblings knew, the properties were beneficially owned by Subhash and had been obtained by him as a result of their dishonest misappropriation from SPC and William’s Estate.</p>

They were also locked in to corroborating Subhash’s story that their co-claimant Ramila was in 1987 and remained at all times thereafter a wealthy overseas businesswoman, which was always how Subhash described Ramila so as to explain away her absence and her apparent ability to fund large property acquisitions in England despite her overseas resident status. The Thakrar family sought to explain Ramila’s lack of involvement in the later stages of the proceedings notwithstanding her living in Mottingham and having some contact with some of the siblings by alleging that she had disappeared from the Thakrar family following a family falling-out. This disappearance never occurred but, even if it had, it would not begin to address the fundamental problem for the Thakrar family that they lent their names and their verifying signatures to actions founded on a lie which they knew was being put forward by Subhash.</p>

Why is this guy writing to me here when I told him not to write to me?” I said “I don’t know, I’ll have to enquire about it.” She said “You’d better do something otherwise Lalit is going to kill me or I have to commit suicide.” Lalit is her husband.

Suffice it to say that he found the maintenance of the deception that Ramila and Vijaya were live Parties to the litigation harder and harder to maintain. On one occasion, he had to orchestrate a telephone conversation with Vijaya. On another occasion, someone purporting to be Ramila telephoned “her” solicitor and, since he did not know her, was able to deceive him into thinking it was her who was telephoning when it clearly was not her but someone masquerading as Ramila. He also had to carry off the story that Ramila had disappeared following a family quarrel. Some letters were sent to Ramila and Vijaya but were delivered to SKT’s offices at Subhash’s instructions for him to “forward” them to the relevant cousin. Clearly, these letters never re-emerged from SKT’s offices. The disclosed documents are full of letters written by Subhash to the various professionals concerned with the litigation on behalf of the Thakrar interests which refer to instructions he has received from his client, being either Ramila or Vijaya as the case might be, and which are written on the basis of his having direct and regular contact with these clients. Ultimately, the deception could not continue because direct contact between solicitor and either Ramila or Vijaya became necessary. The consequence was that the action brought by each of them was dismissed due to lack of instructions and non-compliance with court orders.   </p>

Ramila’s and Vijaya’s four actions were finally struck out in August 2003. Before that occurred, the Thakrar family’s lawyers were throughout deceived about the genuineness of Ramila’s and Vijaya’s participation in the litigation and as to the bona fide nature of the Thakrar siblings’ and cousins’ cases. The foreign residence of both cousins was maintained as a fiction. Thus, in resisting a security for costs application against Ramila, her solicitor did not take the first and irresistible point that she was resident within the jurisdiction, no doubt because he had not been informed of this obvious fact by any one of his Thakrar clients, all of whom he was representing. It is clear that the Thakrar family did not have any compunction about their own legal representatives, however innocently, misleading Party 4 and the court. Had the Thakrar family not joined in with Subhash in this deceit, both Ramila and Vijaya would have surfaced, the truth would have been discovered and the Family Actions would have failed on the grounds that they constituted a systematic and fraudulent abuse of the court’s process. </p>

Vijay and his wife attended Shimeer’s wedding in August 2001 and knew Ramila was still living at 8 Ickleton. This led to his being in difficulties in giving evidence about his knowledge as to where Ramila was living at the critical period during the litigation. </p>

Vijay’s evidence was that he had no recollection of those e-mails or of attending to them personally. He did recollect that he and Mukesh took over the role of giving instructions on behalf of Shantaben and the other siblings in the other Family Actions from 2002. These instructions were based on discussions the two of them had with Kishan, Sheela and Naina from 2002.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="232">

Mr Clark must have continued to communicate with Vijay about Ramila and Vijaya because Mr Clark was not told that Vijay was unable to reach her and was unaware of where she was.

Mr Clark also received a conference phone call from Vijay, Mukesh and Subhash on 24 February 2003 in which he recorded that Vijay said that he had spoken to Vijaya, who in turn had said that she had spoken to Ramila and that neither would travel to England to give evidence or travel to give video link evidence. This information about Ramila and Vijaya was all recorded in a contemporaneous witness statement of Mr Clark prepared  to support an application for Ramila and Vijaya’s evidence to be adduced under the Civil Evidence Act 1995 without their giving oral testimony. On 20 March 2003 such a ruling was made in principle, subject to conditions for authentication which the Thakrar family’s lawyers proposed.

Vijay’s evidence was that Vijaya had been called by telephone and, after a greeting, simply said to Vijay “we are not coming”.

This was done, in part, by each of Parties 8 - 13 confirming the total and breakdown details of funding in a schedule prepared by Vijay and Mukesh. This schedule was exhibited to both Vijay’s and Mukesh’s statements as well as to those of Naina, Kishan, Sheela and Shantaben. Mukesh’s statement was to the effect that he and Vijay had been unable to get Ramila and Vijaya to contribute and that that necessarily meant that unless Mukesh was lying in his statement, Vijay had been lying about a matter he realised was important. Faced with that dilemma in cross-examination, Vijay froze and was unable to explain himself or give a proper answer.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="237">

That active deception on the part of the Thakrar family, including that of Vijay, can be traced back to the time when instructions were given to Mr Clark in January 2002 to represent both Ramila and Vijaya, if not before. Mr Clark was instructed because it was no longer appropriate for Subhash and Ramila to instruct the same solicitor and Mr Clark had to look to Mukesh and Vijay for instructions in relation to the Family Actions. Behind the scenes, Subhash continued to instructed Mr Clark on behalf of the Thakrar family members and he remained the driving force behind the Family Actions. Such instructions as Mr Clark’s clients gave him direct were those that Subhash had instructed his siblings to pass on.</p>

It appeared that Mukesh had always been responsible for all matters concerning the management of the Glen properties and the HSBC account through which both rental income and property expenditure passed in the SKT era prior to Subhash’s bankruptcy and he continued that role when SKTL was set up to take over SKT’s business. It is also clear that although Subhash was no longer nominally involved in running SKTL’s business, he continued to control Glen’s affairs behind the scenes after his bankruptcy.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in"> Thirdly, another important factor in weighing the likely credibility and attitude of Mukesh is his attitude to potentially relevant documents. In particular, his reaction and behaviour during the execution of the Trustee’s first search warrant in 2005 suggests that he had much to hide in relation to the affairs of Glen and Teso. The warrant was executed by the Trustee’s solicitor Mr Festenstein and he found files relating to Teso in a car in the car park in circumstances in which it was obvious that these files were about to be unlawfully removed from the premises so that they would not be obtained by those executing the search warrant. Mukesh was confronted in the car park and denied that he was attempting to remove files but was reluctant to identify the owner of the car in question. He also stated in evidence that he did not know whether there were Teso files or Glen files in the office. It was, however, clear that Mukesh was attempting to assist in the unlawful removal of Teso files and to minimise his involvement in, and knowledge of, Teso’s affairs.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="241">

On a later occasion, Mukesh collected over twenty boxes of potentially relevant files from solicitors who had acted for Glen at a time when he would have been aware that the claiming Parties might be about to seek them from those solicitors and then took them to SKTL’s offices without disclosing them. These documents only subsequently came to light. Finally, on a yet further occasion, Mukesh was responsible for the retention of some boxes of documents even when SKT had been directed to hand over to solicitors acting for Parties 1 and 2 all documents in SKT’s possession.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="242">

This loan was supported by a charge she had given over her house.

I conclude that she was coached by Subhash as to what was to be said about the loan and about the source of her contribution to the funding pot. I also conclude that she did not contribute anything towards her legal costs and also knew that both versions of her evidence that sought to explain how she raised the money to make her contribution were untrue and were only being given by her in evidence because Subhash had coached her to give that evidence, initially in written form and later in a changed oral form. I also conclude that she knew that Ramila and Vijaya were not genuine or bona fide Parties to the litigation and that her attitude was that all decisions about the Family Actions and how they were conducted were to be taken by Subhash with no interference or argument from his siblings but with her active assistance when necessary. </p>

His more recent version provided in oral evidence was to the effect that Ramila had disappeared abroad and no-one knew where she had gone to. Kishan’s purpose in giving this oral evidence was clearly to provide evidence to support the proposition that Ramila had not been seen for a long time. Kishan may well have forgotten the ‘family fall-out’ story and he probably simply made something up that would sound plausible. Kishan was clearly attempting to hold the family line and did so to the best of his ability. </p>

However, any document signed in her name would appear to be susceptible to an argument of non est factum or undue influence to the extent that any attempt is made to hold her liable under any document, including the power of attorney signed by her without any understanding of what the document was or of any liability for her that it might give rise to. </p>

However, since 26 March 2006, both Subhash and Sheela have been jointly acting on her behalf. Moreover, Mukesh represented her in court when representing all the Thakrar Family members. To the extent that it was stated that neither Subhash nor Sheela nor Mukesh were acting for her, as was contended in September 2006, a statement which led to my inviting the Official Solicitor to interview her, I find that these family members did not divest themselves of their authority to act. For example, Shantaben finally intimated her agreement to participate in the possible compromise in November 2006. This was done entirely by Sheela taking that decision, no doubt at Subhash’s prompting, on her behalf. Equally, Sheela authorised the application to the Court of Appeal to be made in her name in November 2006. Thus, she was and remains being an active party to the Thakrar Litigation by virtue of her being represented under the powers of attorney held by Subhash and Sheela.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">SPC compromised or purportedly compromised its claims against Glen and Ramila for the recovery of the SPC property portfolio in June 2002. SPC has since become aware of many facts which it could not have known about nor could it with reasonable diligence have ascertained these facts. SPC now contends that these facts show that Glen, through Subhash, materially and fraudulently misrepresented many relevant facts which SPC relied on in deciding to compromise. These facts also show that SPC was defrauded into agreeing to compromise. Thus, SPC contends that Glen fraudulently induced the compromise and, but for that, it would not have compromised SPC’s claims against Glen. It now seeks to set aside or have declared avoided the compromise and the consequent consent Tomlin Order of the court on the grounds of Glen and Subhash’s fraud and dishonesty. </p>

In June 2002, SPC agreed to compromise these claims against Ramila and Glen in return for a payment of £50,000.  Pursuant to this compromise, SPC, Ramila and Glen executed or purported to execute a Compromise Agreement which is undated but which was executed on or before 16 October 2002 (“the Compromise Agreement”). By a Consent Order dated 16 October 2002 (“the Consent Order”)<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span> SPC’s claims against Ramila and Glen were dismissed. The effect of the compromise was that all claims brought by SPC against Glen were withdrawn in full and final settlement of those claims. SPC now contends in a fresh actions being tried as part of the Thakrar Litigation that that settlement, being both the Compromise Agreement and the Consent Order, should be set aside and/or declared to be void on the grounds that it was procured by Glen by fraud and by fraudulent misrepresentation. </p>

All orders and directions made by the court were to be applied and have effect in all actions and all were to be, and were, tried together. Throughout the period of their apparent involvement in the Part 20 claim, Ramila and Glen were represented by solicitors, namely by Mr Clark of Kotecha &amp;Co apparently acting for Ramila and Mr Julian Spalter of Quastels apparently acting for Glen. Both Parties were also represented by counsel, namely Mr Robert Deacon instructed on behalf of Ramila and Mr Jonathan Ferris instructed on behalf of Glen. A separate legal team were instructed to represent Subhash, namely Mr Kleinfeld of Bowling &amp;Co who instructed counsel, namely Mr Derek Sweeting QC and Mr Timothy Walker. Ramila and Glen purported to run separate defences which were based on each being separate from and independent of each other and Subhash and on their alleged separate and successive bona fide purchase of SPC’s property portfolio.</p>

Declarations were sought against both that they held, or had held, these properties on constructive trust for the benefit of SPC and orders were sought that each should transfer the SPC properties back to SPC free of any interest of either to SPC. </p>

Further, as is also apparent from the request in respect of paragraph 35 of the Part 20 claim, Glen was also contesting SPC’s allegations that Subhash had arranged both the formation of Glen and for the transfer of SPC’s property portfolio to Glen. In paragraph 14 of its subsequent defence, Glen did not plead to these allegations but expressly made no admissions in respect of them.</p>

These were significant omissions because Ramila was living in England and was easily capable of being contacted and spoken to since Subhash was fully aware of her address and telephone number and certainly Kishan met her from time to time at Sheela and Shantaben’s house on occasions when Kishan’s visits to his mother coincided with Ramila’s visits to her aunt.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="269">

Ultimately, security for costs was not required since I decided that no Party should give security against any other Party given the relative impecuniosity of all Parties, the serious allegations being made by all Parties against all other Parties that ought to be aired and determined in court and the need to avoid at least some of the claims being advanced being stifled due to lack of funds. However, very significantly, I directed that each Party should serve a funding statement on all other Parties stating what costs had been expended and how those costs had been funded. The purpose of these statements was to give all Parties full knowledge of the resources and sources of funding available to each Party and a clear idea of their potential liability in costs if ultimately directed to pay other Parties’ costs. </p>

In Mr Shelton’s case, he was merely taking the same back seat as he had always taken in relation to Subhash’s controlling influence over Glen’s affairs. In Mr Clark’s case, there was no dishonesty or deception rather, regrettably, a laxness and a willingness to take what he was told by Subhash about Ramila at face value.  In other words, he accepted uncritically all the lies he was told about her absence in Africa, her leaving everything to Subhash and her unwillingness to introduce herself and to become involved even peripherally in the litigation. He also accepted uncritically Subhash’s explanation of the source of her funding, namely that he as her attorney was using funds accruing to her from earned rental income from her United Kingdom-based properties.</p>

This offer was made following a meeting of Subhash, Glen and Ramila’s solicitors which had been convened to enable the co-defendants to discuss mutual co-operation in the litigation and a co-ordination of their respective client’s cases. There would have been what can now be seen to have been an air of unreality within the Subhash camp amongst the three solicitors involved since it is clear that none of them was aware of the dishonest case being advance by Subhash or of the reality that the trinity of Subhash, Glen and Ramila were in truth one and the same person, namely Subhash.</p>

The three solicitors would have known that any settlement would have to be funded by Glen alone since they were informed that Ramila had no assets to pay towards any settlement figure and Subhash was neither able nor inclined to contribute. For this reason, it appears to have been decided that Mr Clark would speak for all three Parties. This may explain why the offer was made by Mr Clark since he represented the only Party who had no means of paying. </p>

Mr Clark was informed that the EGM had resolved to continue the Part 20 claim and was looking for ways of funding that action. Mr Clark then asked whether a so-called drop hands settlement whereby SPC and the defending Parties would drop all claims and pay their own costs might be favourably considered by SPC. This was firmly offered as a settlement proposal to Mr Wheeler in a subsequent telephone call from Mr Clark who stated that the three solicitors for the defending Parties had met and had agreed, on instructions, which I find were the instructions of Subhash, to offer a drop hands settlement. Mr Kleinfeld telephoned Mr Wheeler later that day and repeated this offer. </p>

The letter expressed astonishment that proceedings alleging fraud against Ramila should have been instituted at all and that the prospects of succeeding against her were remote. The letter also expressed equal astonishment that allegations of fraud were being made in a case where SPC demonstrably had little or no real evidence to back up its allegations. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">On 17 April 2002 a meeting was held between solicitors representing all Parties except Party 4 to discuss case management issues. Mr Spalter offered a settlement of £50,000 to Mr Wheeler who counter-offered with a figure of £150,000. I find that the initiative for this further offer came from Subhash, which explains why Glen’s solicitor Mr Spalter took the lead in making it on behalf of all three defendants. I find that Subhash instructed Mr Spalter to make the offer because he wanted it to seem to SPC that Glen was acting separately from Subhash. Mr Wheeler, of course, did not know that Subhash was orchestrating the settlement negotiations or that Glen’s directors were acting as ciphers without making any input into the negotiations themselves. It is also clear that Subhash informed the solicitors acting for all three defendants that the money to fund a settlement, if it was achieved, would be provided by Glen. </p>

Clearly, although this counter-offer was sent to all three defendants, the principal recipient and the Party who would decide whether or not to accept it was Subhash. </p>

No explanation was made as to why this was so. After taking instructions, SPC decided to accept that offer. There was some jousting between Mr Wheeler and Mr Spalter in an attempt to, respectively, raise and reduce the settlement sum before an agreement in principle was reached on 14 June 2002 whereby Glen agreed to settle with SPC for a payment of £50,000. This agreement was subsequently embodied in both the Compromise Agreement and the Consent Order.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">In the course of this concluding telephone conversation, but before the agreement in principle had been reached, Mr Spalter stated that Ramila had no money and was not worth powder and shot. He added that she was only added into the proceedings by SPC “because of the process”. This, in context, was taken by Mr Wheeler to mean that Mr Spalter was stating the view that Ramila’s only relevance to the action was that she had been in the chain whereby the SPC portfolio passed from SPC to Glen through Ramila’s hands. Before reaching the agreement in principle, Mr Wheeler had a Land Registry search carried out which showed that all but a few properties in question were registered in Glen’s name  and those registered in Ramila’s name appeared to be held by her as a bare trustee. Moreover, all the properties were subject to charges in favour of Teso. This confirmed in Mr Wheeler’s mind that there was a weak claim against Ramila since she appeared to be nothing more than a link in the chain of conveyancing of the properties into Glen’s hand or beneficial ownership and, moreover, these were now charged in favour of a yet further Party.</p>

These allegations, we knew, would be defended rigorously and would increase the scope of the subsequent trial immeasurably.  Ramila and Glen gave every appearance, by the way in which their defences to our Clients’ claims were conducted on their behalf, that Glen had an independent claim to the [SPC] properties that was not dependent upon or compromised by the conduct of [Subhash].

A final and significant factor was the emergence of Mr Harjivan and the extensive evidence he gave which showed how closely he, the “some Portuguese people in Mozambique”, was to Subhash and how Glen had neither acquired beneficial ownership of SPC’s property portfolio nor had disposed of it to Mr Harjivan or any other fourth party. </p>

And if you wish to give evidence about what you told Quastels, you are or may well be waiving privilege and the cross-examiner would then be entitled, if he wishes, to call for the complete record of communications because a Party cannot, in fairness, pick and choose which parts of a privileged communication is revealed in evidence.

Scott &amp; Co, the solicitors on the record for Glen, duly traced the Quastels file through the hands of successive firms of solicitors employed by Glen as far as a firm called Jefferies.  According to Jefferies, the Quastels file was one of the files collected from their offices in January 2006.  Notwithstanding that, with the consent of SKTL, a further search was conducted of the offices of SKTL and further Glen files were found, but the Quastels file could not be found.</p>

He is virtually admitting that SPC had a good claim in fraud against Glen and that SPC had let Glen off a liability for fraud. If Glen was liable or even at considerable risk in fraud, in Subhash’s mind, that could only be because he realised that his involvement in the asset-stripping of SPC was itself dishonest. Thus, Subhash was accepting that he and Glen were synonymous, something which he kept hidden from SPC who settled on the basis that Glen and Subhash were at arm’s length and that it would be difficult to prove that Glen had been dishonest. In other words, Glen’s defence was not being run in good faith.</p>

This can be seen in this passage of the unchallenged evidence of Mr Wheeler:</p>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">If I had been aware of these matters in June 2002 I would not have recommended to our Clients to settle the claims against Glen and Ramila for £50,000.  I say this for the following reasons.  In the first place, the settlement did not conclude the action.  Our Clients still had to face [Subhash’s] claims for fees and interest exceeding £1 million and the legal and other costs that would thereby be incurred.  In the second place, had I been aware that Ramila and Glen were effectively [Subhash] in another guise, I could have invited the Court to order single representation for “Thakrar/Ramila/Glen” which would have avoided our Clients’ having to face the prospect of three sets of costs rather than one.  In other words, our Clients could in any event have avoided the costs going forwards that was one of the incentives to settle with Ramila and Glen.  Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, it would have become obvious to my firm and counsel, and we would so have advised our Clients, that if our Clients succeeded in their counterclaim against [Subhash] (in circumstances where the claim and counterclaim were proceeding in any event), they would necessarily succeed also against Ramila and Glen.  They would succeed against Ramila, because she was making no claim to the [SPC] properties in any event, and they would succeed in their claim against Glen because Glen could have no possible defence of bona fide purchaser for value.  At best it was a mere volunteer – the vehicle in the name of which the fraudster, [Subhash], had the [SPC] properties registered.  In other words, exactly the same proceedings which in the event took place and resulted in judgment against [Subhash] would, without more, have resulted in judgment against Ramila and Glen.</span>

It would be a difficult question whether the effect of the procedural barring order made by the court could be circumvented by a fresh contribution claim being made. Moreover, a new claim must be brought within two years of the contribution claim accruing which occurred on 8 November 2004 when the relevant judgment, “damage” in the language of the Contribution Act, was entered. A new claim could only have been started by the Trustee since the claim vested in her when Subhash was made bankrupt by virtue of his property, which includes all things in action and every description of property wherever situated, see sections 306 and 283 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

A fresh claim may no longer be brought since it became statute-barred on 8 November 2006 and therefore had to be started by the Trustee. The Trustee did not start such a claim. No-one else, including Subhash, was capable of starting such a claim, even if they attempted or purported to give notice of a fresh contribution claim.

Witness statements were submitted by Ms Milner, one of the two administrators; Mr Shelton, one of the directors; Mr Stubbs, the partner and file holder of the firm of solicitors, Beachcroft, who had been retained by the administrators to act for the administrators; Subhash; Mukesh and Kishan. Mr Stubbs’ witness statement was not formally prepared but consisted of a note exhibited to one of Ms Milner’s witness statements. Subhash’s witness statement ran to many pages, most of which were not concerned with the administration applications which he had volunteered without being under any pressure or obligation to serve it. He served it on all parties. He was briefly cross-examined on the passages concerned with the administration. Mukesh and Kishan were also briefly cross-examined about the suggestion that Subhash and the Thakrar family provided the necessary funding to initiate the administration having provided some written information at the request of Parties 1 and 4.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The applications advanced by Parties 1 and 4 were advanced against the directors, Mr Harjivan, Mr Shelton and Ms Avni Bhatt. Mr Harjivan was, of course, already a party. The directors applied to me for an order allowing them funds from Glen in order to fund representation to enable them to oppose Parties 1 and 4’s applications. Given the importance to them in both professional and financial terms of this application, I allowed limited funding to be paid by the Receiver of Glen’s rents for this purpose. I also directed that the three directors should be made a new party to the Thakrar Litigation, Party 20. Thus, Mr Harjivan was a separate party for all matters arising from his role as a director of Glen to his role as an individual defending claims to shareholdings in Glen and Teso for which he had an interest or a claimed interest. Mr Arden QC instructed by Scott &amp; Co represented the directors. As it turned out, the directors were not represented on the fourth day of the hearing because their funding had been exhausted and they appear to have elected not to apply for a further tranche of funding. That was a decision that they took and was therefore a conscious waiver of their right to legal representation on that final and significant hearing day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The administrators elected not to appear at the hearing, quite properly taking a disinterested role. Ms Milner was prepared to provide detailed evidence and to be cross-examined on three separate occasions and Mr Stubbs also voluntarily tendered himself for cross-examination on his informal statement. However, when it became clear that the entire validity of the administration was to be challenged and the professional integrity of the administrators and their solicitors were also to be impugned, the administrators appeared by Mr Collings QC instructed by Beachcroft at the fourth and final hearing day and in post-hearing submissions relating to validity. This decision to be represented on the fourth hearing day was an entirely reasonable one, particularly as the directors had elected to be unrepresented on that day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The reason for the protracted hearing was two-fold. Firstly, it was necessary to examine much background material which had emerged in the Thakrar Litigation in order to probe the directors’ contention that they had independently decided to place Glen into administration essentially because it was unable to pay its debts. Much of this material had to be deployed to enable Parties 1 and 4’s case to be put, namely that the administration was orchestrated by Subhash as the last of a long line of delaying tactics aimed at derailing the Thakrar Litigation so as to prevent the inevitable findings of fraud and dishonesty that would otherwise emerge. Given their recent and untutored arrival into the Thakrar Litigation, none of this material had been seen by or known to Ms Milner or the administrators’ legal team and Mr Shelton had been less than forthcoming in revealing it to them or addressing it in evidence or cross-examination.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The second reason for the prolongation of the hearing was that Party 1, in her capacity as Subhash’s Trustee, obtained from the Bankruptcy Registrar, after the close of the hearings, a second search and seizure order and, using that order, searched Subhash’s premises and discovered, obtained and was granted permission by the Registrar to deploy, a wealth of highly material documentation which led to the re-opening of the hearing following a successful application to me. This material has enabled me to be entirely satisfied that the administration really was orchestrated by Subhash for the ulterior purpose of derailing the Thakrar Litigation just as the final whistle was about to be blown and once all else of his abusive behind the scenes manoeuvres had failed. </p>

A novel feature of the then new regime, which has now been in operation for some five years, is the ability for specified persons, including the directors of a company, to make an out of court appointment of an administrator or a pair of administrators. Paragraph 81, which was an entirely new provision, provides the means for any creditor to challenge that appointment. Clearly Parties 1 and 4, with their current entitlement to costs and Party 2, with its claims for damages or restitutionary relief, are creditors for this purpose. This ability to challenge an out of court appointment is particularly important as a safeguard since any such appointment will not have been the subject of prior creditor or public judicial scrutiny </p>

Both administrators are licensed Insolvency Practitioners at Smith &amp; Williamson who are a large firm of United Kingdom-based Chartered Accountants and Mr Cork and Ms Milner are members of its department concerned with administration and similar matters. There was no known previous relationship or contact between Glen and Mr Shelton and any member of Smith &amp; Williamson and the initial contact was as a result of Mr Shelton seeking a recommendation from the solicitor who had acted for Glen in the past, Mr Conway of Dechert LLP, for appropriate Insolvency Practitioners who might act as administrators and he had recommended Mr Cork as someone he might talk to. The first approach made by Mr Shelton to Mr Cork was a day or two before 21 February 2007 and the purported appointment occurred on 13 April 2007.</p>

These documents gave rise to the allocation of a court case number and to the opening of a file under the reference 2706/2007.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">By January 2007, when Mr Shelton contended he first considered the possibility of placing Glen into the hands of administrators, Glen’s Walter Mitty-like existence had been in place for nearly 17 years. Glen had been conceived and has always operated as the means whereby Subhash sought to hide and protect from the world his ill-gotten property portfolio. Until his scheming unravelled during and following trial no. 1, Subhash was the beneficial owner of Glen and its assets who was in sole control of its administration and management and was in sole command of the professional accountants, lawyers and company administrators who acted for Glen or its reputed owners. He had succeeded in this web of deception by hoodwinking those professionals with a repeated series of lies, acts of dishonesty, forgery and deceit into accepting that the company was owned by wealthy overseas clients for whom Subhash had powers of attorney and in whom they had entrusted all management and investment decisions relating to their assets. His success had been built on the silent compliance of his siblings, particularly Mukesh, Vijay, Kishan and Sheela, particularly in the years since 2001 when he had had to appear to have distanced himself from their involvement in the Thakrar Litigation.  Subhash is a very gifted, albeit a very flawed, individual and one of his gifts is an ability to manipulate and control those with less forceful personalities, particularly if they are closely related to him or are in close professional or personal relationship with him.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">By January 2007, Subhash’s grip over Glen had been weakened to virtually vanishing point and his dogged and remarkably persistent attempts to throw off the tightening noose around what he still sees as his assets, namely the property portfolio held by Glen. This noose was in the form of the Thakrar Litigation, particularly in the form of Party 1’s claim to take over and assert her beneficial ownership of Glen’s shares, Party 2’s claim to recover in excess of £5 million under its judgment sum from Subhash and its claimed entitlement to its beneficial ownership of many of Glen’s properties, Party 3’s claim to recover its inheritance under William’s will, Party 4’s claim to huge costs and Party 5 and 6’s wish to clear their name from its unlawful and unasked for use by Subhash in furtherance of his dishonest grand design.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">Subhash was getting desperate by early 2007 because his last remaining attempts to disrupt or derail the Thakrar Litigation had failed. These last two pieces of the end-game were (1) the attempt made by the defending parties to persuade Judge Coulson in trial no. 3 that the claiming parties, by virtue of one letter written by Party 2’s solicitors, had succeeded in achieving a binding compromise of the entire Thakrar Litigation and (2) the attempt by Glen and others to mount a successful recusal and abuse of process argument. Judge Coulson’s judgment no. 3 ended the first of these stratagems and the wholly unsuccessful attempts of Parties 8 – 12, 14, 16 and 18 to mount a recusal and abuse of process argument ended the second stratagem. It is clear that Subhash first decided to instruct or forcefully persuade Mr Shelton to consider the appointment of administrators for Glen once he realised that both of these disruptive and deleting stratagems had failed.</p>

This seriously understated the reasons why Party 1 was appointed by the court, without an application from Party 1, as an interim Receiver of rents and profits following the conclusion of Mr Shelton’s cross-examination on 2 August 2006 when he had revealed that he had no knowledge or control of Glen’s HSBC bank account into which all rents and profits were being paid. Although this account was subject to a world-wide freezing order, it had become clear from other evidence received on 2 August 2006 that Subhash and Mukesh had not only exclusive control of this account but had procured payments out of it in clear breach of the terms of the freezing order. Since Mr Shelton had not sought to take over management responsibility for this account following the freezing order, it was clear that there was no control being exercised and no or inadequate attempts being made to ensure that Subhash and Mukesh complied with the terms of the injunction. Party 1’s appointment was intended to be a short-term emergency measure pending the anticipated handing down of the fact-finding judgment in September 2006 but the antics of Subhash and Glen ensured that the length of the trial was prolonged for a further twelve months. </p>

In fact, Party 1 was only the Receiver of rents, the responsibility for making payments in the ordinary course of business remained with Mr Shelton who had never attempted to exercise that responsibility either before or after Party 1’s appointment. Mr Shelton’s misconception of his role was compounded by his admission in cross-examination that he thought that Party 1 had been appointed as a Receiver and manager whereas she had been appointed by the court for a limited and specific purpose to receive rents as an adjunct to, and as the means of ensuring compliance with, the interim freezing injunctions granted by Lawrence Collins J. 12 months earlier in 2005. </p>

In other words, he appears to have suggested that Glen could and should survive the litigation whereas the litigation was seeking a claim to the entirety of Glen’s assets and to the entirety of the issued shares and was based on the alleged fraudulent asset-stripping by Subhash of one of the claiming parties in circumstances in which Subhash had already been found liable in fraud and had an outstanding judgment for in excess of £5 million which had  caused him to declare himself a voluntary bankrupt as a means of avoiding making any payment towards this liability. He also appears to have explained that he considered that Glen was at serious risk in relation to the fraud allegations being made against it, as was exemplified by his recorded but confidential views about Glen’s potential liability expressed in a memo in 2003 to Glen’s solicitors.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="310">

In fact, Party 1 was only a section 37-appointed Receiver whose role was to ensure compliance with the interim injunction. She was seeking to recover Subhash’s estate which appeared to include the entirety of Glen’s assets so that it was neither part of her role, as an officer of the court, nor realistic, for her to seek to do other than attempt to recover the entirety of Glen’s assets which, in any event, Subhash had obtained and retained in circumstances amounting to fraud. The only live issue was whether the company had been sold to a genuine bona fide purchaser for value without notice, namely Mr Harjivan and, as Mr Shelton knew or ought to have known, Mr Harjivan had no realistic prospect of demonstrating that he was such a purchaser. </p>

Mr Shelton knew that Party 1 and her appointment did not alter anything. In reality, Glen was managed entirely by Subhash from his Woolwich offices and had always been managed in that way. Mr Shelton’s role was solely to persuade the Inland Revenue to accept Glen as an off-shore company for tax purposes notwithstanding Glen’s complete association with and management from within the jurisdiction and its trading activities and assets consisting solely and exclusively with on-shore properties. </p>

Nor did he explain how doubtful and dubious were the claims of Mr Harjivan to be the beneficial owner of Glen’s shares nor his belief that Subhash had, at the very least, a large personal beneficial interest in Glen. These were particularly significant omissions given the presence of both Mr Harjivan and Subhash at the meeting and there being no means of checking that Subhash was strictly and faithfully sticking to the role of interpreter into the Gujarati language. The administrators would undoubtedly have probed very extensively into Subhash’s involvement in Glen had Mr Shelton given them a full and accurate briefing and their advice might have been very different had this been done.</p>

I was worried that the - about the ferocity of the litigation and the costs. I was worried that in the event that decisions were made by his Lordship which went against Mr Harjivan and against the company in relation to Group 2 proceedings, that the litigation would continue on ad infinitum, and I suppose that one of the reasons that I thought that placing the company in administration – one of the – the good that it would do would be that we would have somebody who could not be challenged by either side in this sort of point-scoring exercise that we always seemed to be undertaking between Glen and the other parties, and in particular between myself and Mr Patel, would cease.

Many of these facts were only unearthed by means of the second search and seizure warrant obtained by Party 1 from the Bankruptcy Registrar in June 2007. It is clear from the documents that were obtained from Subhash using this warrant that it was a wholly justifiable step for Party 1 to have taken to have obtained these documents by applying for this warrant. </p>

Prior to that hearing, Glen had, in the main, adopted a neutral stance and had only briefed counsel to argue a recusal application which I had heard in September 2006 and had ruled that I would determine that application as part of my fact-finding judgment. The trial was then, in effect, put into limbo whilst the compromise issue was prepared and then tried and determined by Judge Coulson. I then held what were intended to be the final oral submissions during which Glen’s leading counsel intimated that Glen did not intend to maintain its recusal application. However, Glen then changed leading counsel and it was their new leading counsel who appeared on 1 March 2007 and informed the court that he was instructed to apply for my recusal due, amongst other factors, to the bias that it was perceived that I had shown in dealing with Glen’s interests. Leading counsel also applied for a direction that funds should be released from Glen in order to enable him to examine the entire record and advise on the precise grounds that Glen wished to advance in support of this application. </p>

These were highly material matters that should have been disclosed to the court during its application since it was applying for funding in circumstances in which it believed it could not pay its debts and for a further adjournment in order, ostensibly, to prepare a recusal application whereas, as it is now known, the period of repose granted by my acceding to the adjournment and funding applications, were used to prepare for an administration appointment by the same directors who, certainly in the case of Mr Shelton, were behind the adjournment application. Mr Shelton was in court for at least part of the application on Thursday 1 March 2007 and it was intimated that the application was made with his authority and on his instructions. </p>

At that meeting, Mr Cork informed Mr Shelton that Smith &amp; Williamson would need to be put in funds to the extent of £20,000 before the firm would agree to act. Furthermore, it would be necessary first to instruct solicitors and specialist counsel to advise whether an administration appointment should be made by the directors. Until the funds were received by the firm, no further step could be taken towards the administration appointment. </p>

The “BO” is clearly the beneficial owner and Mr Shelton would have been referring to Subhash in that context, since Mr Harjivan had never undertaken any decision on his own, he had always left all decision-making to Subhash and Mr Shelton stated in evidence that he did not know whether Mr Harjivan was the beneficial owner, he had always relied on Subhash for his belief that Mr Harjivan was the beneficial owner. Moreover, earlier in the trial, he accepted that Subhash certainly had a beneficial interest in Glen. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in"> Subhash then started to take the necessary steps needed to put the prospective administrators in funds and to prepare the ground for their appointment.  Mr Shelton stated in evidence that he had asked Mukesh to prepare the list of Glen’s creditors because all the necessary information was in SKTL’s offices and that firm was Glen’s accountants. In truth, as Mr Shelton showed in his evidence, he had very little knowledge of what debts were owed by Glen. This was understandable in relation to debts that had pre-dated 2 August 2006 when Party 1 was appointed Receiver since he had left all management and administration to SKTL and Mukesh had undertaken the work, albeit under Subhash’s ever-present and watchful eye. However, once the Receiver of rents and profits was appointed, there was no-one who was responsible for these administrative and managerial matters since SKTL were directed to cease involvement in Glen’s affairs by the court and the Receiver was not a manager, merely a collector and protector of rents subject to making available to Glen all reasonable disbursements to enable Glen to carry out its day to day business activities.</p>

Subhash explained that he was introducing himself, as always, as acting for Mr Harjivan, albeit without referring to his status as the holder of his power of attorney. He wanted to know what he should send to Smith &amp; Williamson and to whom he should send it. Ms Milner gave him clear instructions on these matters. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">Although the letter was signed by Kiran, it was written by Subhash. Kiran has always signed e-mails sent to the court which were written by Subhash and the style is unmistakably Subhash’s style. It is to be noted that this letter is somewhat desperate in tone and brings in the wholly irrelevant complaint that Party 1 sold two of his properties at an under-value and had deducted exorbitant expenses from the gross sale proceeds. The letter is tantamount to a letter of instruction and the suggested confirmatory letter from Mr Shelton was never sent. The court documents enclosed were not disclosed by Smith &amp; Williamson but it would appear from the letter that they would have been a highly selective selection of documents from the Thakrar Litigation including the brief submission made by Mr Harjivan’s counsel in support of his recusal application. No mention is made in the letter of Subhash’s liability to pay SPC in excess of £5m or SPC’s claims for the return of over 100 of the properties in Glen’s property portfolio. Finally, it is noticeable that Subhash puts Glen’s assets as being worth £42m, which is a clear indication that he regarded the Teso charges as being worthless. Subhash also sees the role of the administration as being to save Glen from the claims being made against it, there is no mention of the indebtedness which has led to Glen’s current suggested cash-flow insolvency. </p>

This loan had been advanced to the Thakrar family for unspecified wedding expenses for an unspecified member or members of the family. No other details of this loan were forthcoming.</p>

His evidence was that he arranged for SKTL to draw a cheque payable to Smith &amp; Williamson for this sum which Kishan paid into SKTL’s branch of Barclays and it was transferred into Smith &amp; Williamson’s account. The sum in question represented a loan or advance to Mukesh of consultancy fees due to him for consultancy work he had done for clients of SKTL of an accountancy nature. Many different fees or clients were involved. No documents were produced to show who these clients were or that the sum in question was due to Mukesh from SKTL.</p>

On his second version, the loan from Mr Harjivan had been provided in early 2006 to enable Mukesh to put his solicitors Seddons in funds. The money had arrived from people known to Mr Harjivan who either owed him money or were prepared to lend Mukesh money at Mr Harjivan’s request. Mukesh did not know who the three individuals were who lent the money and, remarkably, all three, who were providing about one third each of the sum Mr Harjivan was lending, arranged for the money to be transferred by arranging a personal delivery of cash to SKTL’s offices by an unknown person. Mukesh didn’t meet any of the three messengers, did not give a receipt and could give no other details of the sources of these funds.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.5in">£17,000 was provided by Kishan. It finally emerged that Kishan had drawn this sum from a special personal loan account he had opened for £25,000. He had opened this account at the Sidcup branch of NatWest in June 2006 without security or enquiries about his finances, which were in a parlous condition and was able to draw this sum out in March 2007. This sum was still available because he had also paid into this account £5,000 redundancy money he had obtained when SKT, who had employed him for many years, ceased to trade following Subhash’s bankruptcy and he had been made redundant. Kishan was providing this money, according to his evidence, because he was jointly liable to repay Mr Harjivan his loan of £20,000. </p>

It is necessary to quote a passage of that e-mail so as to show the nature and content of material Subhash sought to place before the court, after any opportunity had passed to question him about it, as a means of seeking to persuade the court that Mr Harjivan was the source of this payment to Smith &amp; Williamson of £20,000.

No such loan was established in evidence. The source of the £20,000 was Mukesh and Kishan through his loan account and both payments were made on Subhash’s instructions. The money was, on analysis,   advanced by the two brothers as a gift or loan to Subhash and, ultimately, the source of the funds was in consequence Subhash. This was provided by him as he is, and always has been, the beneficial owner of Glen and it was needed to enable him to launch what he clearly regarded as his last, and ultimate, poisoned pill or Exocet in order to derail the Thakrar Litigation once and for all.  </p>

As for the first, dated 26 March 2007, he stated that he had helped Mr Harjivan to draft it when he asked him to help him. Mr Harjivan signed it. He drafted it the day after the meeting because Mr Harjivan asked him to do something to record the fact that the meeting had taken place. However, Mr Shelton said that it was not acceptable and it would not be regarded as a proper minute. Mr Shelton said this early the following week when told about the minute. It was drafted because Mr Harjivan wanted to emphasise two points. Firstly, that Marina did not want to be involved with the company any more and secondly that he was, as a director, having made the phone calls from Lisbon, because he had to make various arrangements with Barry Shelton, that’s what he wanted. However, Mr Shelton said, “No, I will deal with the minutes myself because I am the person taking all the decisions and I don’t want anybody else to interfere.”</p>

However, Subhash also confirmed in evidence that the first time that this question was raised, of an office being opened in London, was at the meeting on the 29 March 2007 in Beechcroft’s offices. Subhash could not provide a coherent answer as to why the minute records this question in fact first being raised on 26 March 2007.</p>

He contended that the wrong date had been placed on the document (28 March 2007) and that he had prepared, at Mr Harjivan’s request, a minute of the 29 March 2007 meeting but that Mr Shelton had overruled the use of this minute. When asked to explain how a document which clearly cannot be a record, however inadequate, of the meeting, Subhash resorted to bluster. For example, when asked how it could be a minute of the meeting, which was not a board meeting, even though it is written as if it was recording a board meeting, Subhash merely asserted:</p>

Ms Milner and Mr Stubbs, in their evidence, stated that he did not speak at the meeting except in either Portuguese or Gujarati, they did not know which. It is noteworthy that Mr Harjivan needed an interpreter, as he did when giving evidence, yet he appears to have been able to attend or conduct a board meeting on 26 March 2007 in English and without interpretation. Mr Stubbs was understandably outraged at being shown the minutes of what appeared to have been a separate meeting held on 28 March 2007 at his offices with him in attendance which never took place. When asked what he thought, with hindsight, was the reason for Subhash’s attendance at the meeting held on 29 March 2007, he replied:</p>

The details are set out in full in judgment no. 1. These minutes, in style and layout and in their muddled phraseology are strikingly similar to those forged SPC minutes dealing with meetings in and after 1988.   I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that these two minutes are forgeries concocted by Subhash which he got Mr Harjivan to sign, probably without Mr Harjivan even reading them. It is not clear what purpose Subhash intended to put these minutes to, but they provide an insight into his thinking as to the purpose of Glen’s administration. That was, in summary: </p>

This was a board meeting that it was contended had been conducted by telephone on 13 April 2007 and was the meeting at which the directors resolved to place Glen into administration. What was clearly established was that Mr Stubbs caused to be prepared a draft board meeting minute which recorded the decision to appoint the administrators. Mr Shelton’s evidence was that he telephoned Mr Harjivan and Ms Bhatt in turn and carefully read out the draft prepared by Mr Stubbs and each assented to its contents.  The draft is a carefully prepared three-page document which was signed by Mr Shelton. There is no written substantiation that these telephone calls took place and there was a material discrepancy between Mr Shelton’s evidence just summarised and Ms Bhatt who sent an e-mail which was adduced in evidence which stated that the telephone board meeting was conducted as a three-way meeting. </p>

Had the call been made to Mr Harjivan, he would not have understood what was being read to him. Ms Bhatt was not in the habit of telephoning about Glen’s affairs to anybody and these two facts reinforce my finding. What appears to have happened is that Subhash orchestrated the finalisation of the documents sent by Beachcroft and he must have merely obtained Mr Shelton’s signature. Both would have proceeded on the basis that the decision had already been taken at the meeting on 29 March 2007, indeed Subhash’s evidence was to that effect when he was asked about the “minute” of that meeting. </p>

Had there been such a notification, the e-mail would have referred to that earlier conversation and indicated that it was merely confirmatory of the earlier notification. Moreover, the note of what Mr Shelton said at the meeting on 29 March 2007 suggests that Mr Shelton did not himself assert that he had notified the directors, it states that Glen had the intention of appointing administrators if they received professional advice that this course should be adopted. Until Glen’s directors had actually received that advice and had decided to follow it, all that Teso had been notified of was the possibility that it might in the near future receive a formal notification. </p>

I am not therefore prepared to accept his uncorroborated evidence about this important matter, based as it is on an assertion that a conversation had previously taken place. Furthermore, the wording of the e-mail, couched in terms which suggests that it is the first intimation that Mr Shelton had given Mr Barby of the appointment, amounts to an admission by Mr Shelton that no previous notification had been given. </p>

Indeed, the first that Mr Barby and the directors of Teso came to hear of the administration was by Mr Shelton’s e-mail, sent eleven days after the purported appointment of the administrators. Furthermore, even if Mr Shelton had done as he stated at the meeting held on 29 March 2007 that he had done, that did not amount to a notification, in the language of Paragraph 26(1)(a) of Schedule B1, “ a written notice of an intention to appoint an administrator” both because the notice was oral and not written and because it was not a notification of an intention to appoint but merely a notification that an intention to appoint might arise in the near future. Thus, there was no notification, no written notification and nothing that was said capable of amounting to notification.</p>

There was no document produced in which Mr Barby’s notification of Teso’s waiver was recorded by him because, as I find, no such document exists. The Report does not condescend to detail of how and in what terms Ms Milner’s contact with Mr Barby was effected and, in any event, this contact must have been made some days after the appointment of the joint administrators. </p>

In other words, he continued to as the beneficial owner of Glen who was both unable and unwilling to allow anyone else to take any decisions about Glen or to manage or direct its affairs. He also displayed in that period and since, as he has consistently since trial no. 1,  a remarkable state of denial as to his dishonest conduct with regard to SPC’s properties, the dishonesty he has shown in the establishment of Glen and the subsequent conduct of its’ affairs  and in the repeated and systematic dishonesty he has displayed in seeking to thwart the legitimate enforcement and tracing actions of the many parties who have been wronged by his actions. These parties include, but are certainly not limited to, the many family members ensnared in his deceitful net and the many professionals who have acted for him and his interests and for the interests of each claiming party. </p>

In particular, I must consider his actions in the light of his conduct summarised in paragraph 755 above. In the light of all the evidence I have summarised, which is dealt with extensively throughout this judgment, I am satisfied that he first put Mr Shelton up to seeing whether it would be possible to put Glen into administration, he pushed the decision forward and he took all the steps that I have outlined so as to both procure their appointment and so as to attempt to ensure that their actions led to the fatal interruption of the claiming parties’ cases against Glen and his Estate. Mr Shelton appears to have taken no step himself save for helping to prepare his witness statement and attending court for cross-examination. Mr Shelton was prepared to agree to the administrators’ appointment and it was clear that he adopted Subhash’s motives for this appointment. Moreover, it was Subhash with Mukesh’s assistance who put together the information needed to enable the case to be run that Glen was insolvent, a case put forward, as I find, to mask the fact that there were no good reasons for seeking administration and that administration was being sought first and foremost as an attempted and last ditch means of stopping the Thakrar Litigation and forcing an unwanted and unwarranted settlement on the claiming parties.</p>

Subhash clearly considered that the decision to appoint administrators had been taken by the two directors present at that meeting, being Mr Harjivan and Mr Shelton. Mr Shelton was still somewhat confused about precisely what had been agreed and by whom and on what occasion when giving evidence on two separate days of the hearing. This confusion was undoubtedly the result of his trying to steer a very fine line between giving accurate answers to the questions he was asked but seeing the need to hide the fact that Subhash had driven the exercise of placing Glen into  administration from the outset. Mr Harjivan, who clearly cannot speak anything other than pigeon English, could not have understood anything of the minute had it been read out to him over the telephone and would not have learnt much from the meeting held on 29 March 2007. Subhash could not have spent much time explaining what was happening, it is likely that he was devoting much of his time to coaching Mr Harjivan and to following what was being said for his own purposes. Ms Bhatt, had she been spoken to, would not have followed much of the contents of the minute but, in truth, she was not even spoken to on that day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is first necessary to consider who must be given a paragraph 26 notice. That notice must be given to a qualifying chargeholder, being the holder of a floating charge. Teso is such a chargeholder by virtue of the floating charge imposed over Glen’s assets dated 8 November 1996. This charge has never been lifted although I have found in this judgment that it is invalid. No declaration to that effect has yet been made and the charge is, in consequence, in place and it remains binding on Glen and enforceable by Teso until it is removed or ordered to be removed by an order or declaration of the court. This is particularly so since Glen is a Liberian company whose COMI and place of business have only recently clearly been established to be within the jurisdiction of the English courts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There are two limbs to the statutory requirement of notice. Firstly, a notice in writing must be given of the directors’ intention to appoint administrators, paragraph 26(1)(a), and secondly, the notice must be in the prescribed form, paragraph 26(3)(b). That form is Form 2.9B. It is important to consider both the reason for this notice and the procedure that follows its service. It is clear that the intention is to give a holder of a floating charge an opportunity, before out of court administrators are appointed, of exercising its right to appoint an administrative Receiver under its floating charge. Since directors can only appoint administrators if the company is unable to pay its debts, the company is likely to be in a condition in which the entitlement to appoint administrative Receivers has crystallised. If the holder of the floating charge is unable to appoint its own administrative Receivers prior to the appointment of administrators, its rights under its charge will be, or could be, significantly compromised. In consequence, paragraph 26 is aimed at giving those holders of the floating charge a prior but limited opportunity to exercise their rights before the directors can appoint out of court administrators. If an administrative Receiver is appointed in that limited window of time by the holder of the floating charge, the directors may no longer exercise their own power of appointment. If no such appointment is made, the directors may act and, thereafter, the holder of the floating charge and the indebtedness charged will be subject to the regime imposed by Schedule B1. </p>

Such is common in such situations, for example the notice regime imposed by the Landlord and Tenant Acts relating to the statutory entitlement to renew commercial leases or to prevent that entitlement from being exercised. It is well-known that these notice requirements must be strictly observed and cannot be waived and, if not complied with, the court cannot extend time or grant relief from non-compliance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In this case, no notice was given. The administrators appear to contend that the question for consideration is whether the wrong form was served since the directors are required to use Form 2.10 when lodging the requisite documents at court where there is no qualifying chargeholder and that was done. However, in my judgment the correct question is whether the failure to give notice to Teso, as I have found occurred, precludes the directors from appointing administrators at all. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is clear to me that the requirements of paragraph 26 are mandatory. The purpose of these requirements and the lack of any statutory mechanism to grant relief against non-compliance point inexorably to the conclusion that directors cannot appoint administrators using the out of court procedure unless and until they have complied with paragraph 26 where there is in existence a qualifying chargeholder. These requirements are not mere formalities, they are in place to ensure that the overriding and pre-existing rights of floating chargeholders are not overridden. A floating charge is an essential and much-used method of commercial financing and unless the rights created by these charges are protected from the use by directors of the power to make out of court appointments of administrators, the commercial confidence that allows for the provision of credit to commercial undertakings would be weakened. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The administrators did not seriously challenge the conclusions I have reached. They sought to contend that Teso is not, or should not be treated, as a qualifying chargeholder. They point to paragraphs 14 – 21 of Schedule B1 which sets out the statutory scheme for the appointment by qualifying chargeholders of administrators which only allows for such an appointment by chargeholders where the floating charge is enforceable. They contend that Teso’s charge is not enforceable in reliance on the evidence of Mr Shelton and, no doubt had this issue been argued out following the handing down of this judgment, on my findings. They also contend that these provisions require the reading into paragraph 26 a limitation or qualification that has the effect of interpreting the phrase “any person who is or may be entitled to appoint an administrative Receiver of the company” as meaning “a qualifying chargeholder” and then qualifying that meaning as “a qualifying chargeholder except one whose floating charge is not enforceable”. It also requires a decision as to whether, despite all its limitations and shortcomings, this charge was, on 13 April 2007, one that falls within the description in paragraph 16 of being “not enforceable”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The more natural interpretation of paragraph 16 would be only to exclude as being “not enforceable” those charges which have been declared to be unenforceable in legal proceedings or where there is a clearly established receipt which shows that the entire indebtedness charged has been discharged. Otherwise, the decision as to whether a charge is or is not enforceable is to be left to the subjective judgment of the directors and not on documentation which can be readily verified and obtained.</p>

That litigation was proving to be unsettle able and had been, and would continue to be such a drain on Glen’s resources that it was unable to manage its business in such a way as to be able to trade profitably and meet its debts. </p>

This was coupled with the fact that the entirety of Glen’s business involved managing and investing in properties located in England. </p>

Mrs Jackson’s sole function was to collect in the rents and account for them to the court. She had no role in managing the properties or of the business as a whole. Her appointment did, in fact, throw out the de facto, and probably unlawful, management structure that had existed previously. Since all the properties and the income and investments of Glen were managed by Subhash and Mukesh in Woolwich, Mr Shelton had no involvement in the day to day affairs of Glen. When the freezing injunctions were imposed, they did not appear to be given effect to by Subhash and Mukesh in relation to the HSBC account that SKT held in Woolwich into which all rents and other income was paid and out of which the day to day running expenses were met. This arrangement continued until the Receiver was appointed, indeed the discovery of this arrangement when Mr Shelton was giving evidence and the discovery of clear breaches of the injunction that were occurring through Mukesh’s methods of operation, led to the appointment of Mrs Jackson as interim Receiver in the first place.</p>

She was only a Receiver, not a manager; she was only intended to remain in post for a few weeks pending the outcome of the Thakrar Litigation and had been appointed in an emergency to stem the significant and unlawful braches of the freezing injunctions imposed on Glen’s assets that were occurring due to Subhash and Mukesh’s misuse of the HSBC account; she never interfered with the running of Glen’s business and only paid out those sums which she was asked to pay which she considered were genuine and bona fide day to day commercial expenses of Glen and she appears to have faithfully complied with the terms of her appointment and of the freezing injunctions she was appointed to enforce. </p>

That suggests, given that he was able to obtain legal advice, that his difficulties were either exaggerated or non-existent. However, his omission is more serious still. During the course of trial no. 3, the court directed that a total of £200,000 should be paid to Glen and Mr Harjivan from its own resources to enable it to obtain legal advice and representation. The most significant order was that £100,000 should be made available to pay for such legal assistance to prepare for and present Glen’s recusal application, an order made on 1 March 2007 only days before Glen’s apparent cash flow difficulties led to the appointment of the Receivers. Mr Shelton failed to draw to the attention of the court the cash flow difficulties he now complains of even though, if they existed, they required the expenditure of the funds that, following his application to the court, were redirected to Glen’s legal advisers. His lack of candour, obviously induced by Subhash, is both breathtaking and very revealing as to the alleged problems of Glen in meeting its outgoings as they fell due. </p>

None of this facility had been drawn down and, indeed, the facility was only available in principle but Mr Shelton appears to have been able to arrange it without difficulty. This was possible because he was able to represent Glen as a company with uncharged assets worth at least £34 million. Ms Milner also accepted that the principal indebtedness to the Bank of Scotland, in a sum of about £300,000, was charged and fully protected against a limited number of Glen’s properties. Her contention was that Glen remained in need of administration because its debts were not being serviced. She painted a picture of a company whose loan had not been drawn down who was in the iron grip of both injunctions and freezing orders and had bailiffs knocking at the door.

This had been created a few years earlier at Subhash’s request when he had enquired about a facility from that Bank and was offered huge facilities on the basis of his being the beneficial owner of Glen which was worth many millions of pounds and was unencumbered with debt. The debt was being regularly serviced by Glen on a monthly basis out of income and was charged against a limited number of properties. The loan was called in at the end of October 2006 because these monthly payments were late in being paid. It is clear from the evidence that these difficulties in late payment were occasioned by a failure by Mr Shelton, or through him of Mukesh and Subhash, to inform the Receiver and her solicitor timeously, in the period leading up to the demand calling in the loan, of the need to make these payments. However, the evidence showed that the Bank of Scotland would have been, and may still be, prepared to return to the previous arrangement if its instalment arrears and interest were paid off and the monthly payments were resumed. In any event, the evidence also showed that it was and remains prepared to be repaid by allowing the sale of its secured properties and to await payment of the capital sum, outstanding interest and costs until this security has been realised. </p>

This was called in because the monthly direct debit arranged on Glen’s RBS bank account in Jersey which had been frozen by the injunction. It was Mr Shelton’s responsibility to either make arrangements for this account to be permitted to make payments towards this direct debit or to arrange for the payments to be made by the Receiver by instructing her to make these payments. In fact, the Receiver through her solicitor was notified but only in October and the payments for three months between August and October were paid by the Receiver but, a short time before the payment was made, the loan was called in.</p>

He also made no attempt to arrange for Scott &amp; Co to apply to the court for directions in relation to the injunctions or the Receiver so as to enable Glen to obtain funds held up by these processes, if they were held up in this way, to meet its day to day business expenditure and he does not appear to have sat down with Mukesh and ascertain what liabilities Glen had or to ensure that all bills should be sent to him so that he could arrange for their payment by the Receiver. He was, after all, the manager of Glen’s business as well as its director. In truth, these steps were not taken because Subhash had not, and would not have, authorised them and Mr Shelton and Mukesh remained under Subhash’s guiding hand.</p>

On that day, the Bank of Scotland had served a demand for £282,434.56, it had been served on 30 October 2006 on Glen at SKTL’s Woolwich offices and Mukesh and Subhash had not brought it to the attention of the Receiver, or even possibly Mr Shelton until March 2007. It was therefore unpaid but it seemed clear from Mr Shelton’s evidence that it would have been possible to compound this debt by arranging for a sale of sufficient of the charged properties, numbering 9 in all, charged with the loan account and allowing the interests accruing whilst the sales were arranged to be added to the sum to be paid out of the proceeds of sale. Thus, Glen could have proceeded on the basis that it had compounded, or was readily able to, compound to the reasonable satisfaction of the Bank of Scotland its overall indebtedness to that Bank. The debts that could be said to have fallen due on or before 13 April 2007 that had not been paid did not total more than £50,000 - £60,000 at most and were probably much smaller is size. These could have been met out of income. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is interesting to note that, due to the Thakrar Family state of denial about their liability to claiming parties in the Thakrar Litigation and also about their established liability in other litigation where tenants have succeeded in enfranchising their interest, the “throw everything in” schedule prepared by Mukesh with Subhash’s assistance and pursuant to his instructions, omits reference to existing costs orders in favour of claiming parties totalling £77,000. For similar reasons, it omits reference to Glen’s longstanding liability to meet a judgment debt in favour of Mr Lynch for £92,403.52 arising out of the enfranchisement proceedings in which Subhash and Mr Harjivan acted so dishonestly. Again due to Subhash’s state of denial about Glen’s substantial tax liability to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, there is no reference to impending assessments totalling £346,000 or more. This blind spot stems from Subhash’s pride and vanity at having arranged Glen’s tax affairs, as he believes, so that it has no or very little tax liability. However, Subhash has consistently ignored the fact that his dealings with HMRC have always been based on Subhash’s deceit that has led HMRS to believe erroneously that Glen is, and always has, been an off-shore company with a Jersey COMI which is wholly owned by overseas residents. </p>

I have already concluded that there was no directors’ meeting held on 13 April 2007. I must assume, for the purposes of this application, that the appointment was valid since, otherwise, paragraph 81 cannot be engaged. Thus, strictly speaking, the appointment must be taken to have been that of Mr Shelton. However, it is clear that Mr Harjivan can be taken to have adopted the views of Mr Shelton since he can speak no English and was obviously fully in agreement as to anything that was motivating Mr Shelton. Ms Bhatt does not appear to have had, at the time of the appointment or previously, sufficient involvement in the affairs of Glen to have been capable of deciding in any other way than merely to adopt whatever Mr Shelton advised and whatever was motivating his decision. </p>

He was the beneficial owner of Glen and its assets, he had always been the controlling mind and sole shadow director of Glen and it was he who had been masterminding Glen, Mr Harjivan and his siblings’ involvement in the Thakrar Litigation. Moreover, Mr Shelton had always, as I have also found, unhesitatingly and without question allowed Subhash to take all decisions. There is no evidence to suggest that this particular appointment decision was taken by Mr Shelton with any greater role in its formulation or motivation or with any less influence from Subhash in any other way than all other decisions involving Glen that he had been involved in since his appointment as a director. </p>

This occurred on the basis of their correctly and understandably accepting at face value what they had been told at the meeting on 29 March 2007 and also accepting at face value the list of creditors as being a fair and accurate statement of Glen’s then current indebtedness. </p>

The complaints were that both were culpable in not providing full discovery or information, particularly about the source of the funds that were paid to them, in their failure to approach or co-operate with the Receiver and her solicitors and in their provision of information generally.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">It is easy with hindsight to fault professionals who have been so significantly misled by Glen’s directors. However, the process of appointing administrators is one fraught with potential difficulty. These professionals had to work at very great speed in relation to a company and its tortuous, complex and chaotic affairs, given that it was considering administration at all, of which they have no prior knowledge. They had had no access to documents and had to take what was said to them at face value. There were no obvious indications of how significant was the difference between what they were told and what was the reality behind those instructions. Given that it had been possible to hoodwink so many over the previous seventeen years, it is difficult to start to be critical, indeed it would be grossly unfair to start to be critical, about the possible shortcomings that had occurred over a few days. I find that there are no grounds for criticising the administrators or their solicitors in connection with the appointment of the administrators.  </p>

The first group of applications were all to the effect that trial no. 2 was conducted by means and methods that amounted to an abuse of process or to a denial of justice to such a serious degree that the defending parties are entitled to procedural relief. The second group of applications were all to the effect that I displayed such actual or perceived bias or conducted the trial in such an inadequate manner that I should recuse myself. The effect of each application in each of these two groups of application was contended to be any one of the following, listed in descending order of preference: that there should be a permanent stay imposed on the Thakrar Litigation; or a dismissal of the claiming parties’ applications and claims; or a direction for a retrial. If there was to be a retrial, I should direct that I should take no further part in the Thakrar Litigation. Finally, whichever decision I took, I should not give a judgment on the merits in this action. If I ruled against all submissions, I should nonetheless withhold publishing my judgment until my rulings relating to these applications had been made the subject of an appeal. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">These applications were advanced in three stages. Initially, Parties 8 – 13, 14 and 18 combined together to advance a tri-partite application through counsel being Mr Pettican for Parties 8 – 13, Mr Berkley QC for Party 14 and Mr Coney for Party 18. This application was argued on 14 September 2006. All parties agreed that I should determine the applications as part of my judgment rather than being determined there and then. There were then procedural delays occasioned by Subhash-inspired manoeuvring and Party 14 withdrew its applications. However, Party 7 then started to send to the court a series of e-mails which, by the time I came to hand down judgment numbered over one hundred in total. These amounted to a hybrid of the following: evidence, assertion, submission, comment, hyperbole, invective, attempts to re-open decisions already taken, streams of consciousness and downright rudeness. Within these many missives were occasional references to what could be seen as submissions supporting a mistrial or recusal decision. The third phase started with Glen, by different leading counsel, obtaining permission to submit a new and more detailed and wide-ranging recusal application. This had been formulated when it appointed administrators who rapidly announced that it was being withdrawn. In this third phase, Kiran notified the court that Parties 16 and 17 were aligning themselves with the on-going applications of Parties 7 – 13 and 18 and that that I should regard Subhash as making in his role as Party 7. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">I should record at the outset that none of the defending parties made any detailed submission of law. With such a wide-ranging series of applications, a detailed analysis of a difficult area of law which clearly distinguishes the appropriate tests, which differ, for each type of abuse relied on and addresses the appropriate relief is necessary on a party by party basis. Had I found that any of the applications demonstrated even an arguable case for relief, I would have restored the applications for further submissions of law. Since this is a fact-finding judgment, it is sufficient for me to determine the necessary background facts. I remind myself, however, that recent authorities have made it clear that an applicant seeking to unsettle a trial once it has started must move to apply for a mistrial or re-trial or recusal very promptly after any matter of significant and legitimate complaint has arisen. I would need some persuading that the applications had been made sufficiently promptly to afford relief, even if the applying parties had crossed the threshold for granting relief. </p>

I have added that submission to this judgment as a schedule so that, if any question arises in the future as to the grounds or validity of Glen’s recusal application, there is a record of what would have been argued in order to seek to persuade the court to dismiss that application. I should record that I found these submissions very persuasive and that is putting it mildly.</p>

Mr Harjivan’s involvement as a party in trial no.2 was to face and meet the Trustee’s claim for a declaration that the beneficial ownership of the shares in Glen and Teso were vested in her because Subhash was and always had been the beneficial owner of Glen and Teso. However, and because of the close interconnection with Subhash, the Thakrar family and ‘Ramila’ and ‘Vijaya’, Mr Harjivan was also an important witness in the other actions consolidated with the Trustee’s action. It is necessary to keep Mr Harjivan’s two roles clearly in mind. As a witness in connection with the proceedings other than those brought by the Trustee, Mr Harjivan had no right to representation. Nevertheless, because the court had directed that all the related proceedings should be consolidated, Mr Harjivan had the opportunity to be represented when giving evidence and he had the benefit of experienced solicitors in the lead up to the trial and the benefit of experienced solicitors and counsel for much of the period over which he gave evidence<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="333">

The Trustee therefore had to prove her case beyond reasonable doubt. In relation to the Trustee’s claim against Mr Harjivan, Glen and Teso maintained a position of neutrality and their officers, Mr Shelton and Mr Barby, have given important evidence that helped to undermine Mr Harjivan’s case. However, the most telling evidence against Mr Harjivan came from Vijaya and Ramila.

Mr Harjivan is, in reality, a party to enforcement proceedings and therefore the Trustee will be able to prove her case against Mr Harjivan by putting forward without further need of proof findings made in the earlier trial. It was correctly submitted that it is a fundamental principle of law that someone is only bound by findings in proceedings to which he was a party.

It was contended that in any normal proceedings, the parties at least start off from the same point at the same time. However, the Thakrar Litigation was not normal proceedings. This was because their history went back at least ten years. Originally, there were eleven actions rolled into the Thakrar Litigation, all of which were being heard together. In an interlocutory judgment on 3 July 2003 in an interlocutory appeal application made in the course of action no.1, Hale LJ described the Thakrar Litigation as a “highly complex case”. Mr. Harjivan was served with proceedings joining him into the Thakrar Litigation at the end of March 2006. At that stage, trial no. 2 was due to start on 3 July 2006.  In effect, therefore, Mr Harjivan had only two months to prepare for a trial that was being added to this complex litigation whose purpose was to deprive him of the beneficial ownership of assets worth, on Subhash’s estimate, at least £40 million.  </p>

The case against Mr. Harjivan was part of a much larger overall picture with an extensive background. The Court was asked to draw inferences from a morass of oral and written evidence, some of which pre-existed trial no. 2, some was adduced for it and, in the event, some was also adduced during it.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span> As a party, Mr Harjivan has had the benefit of very experienced counsel and solicitors with ample time and funding to prepare and present Mr Harjivan’s case. It may have been true that in the initial stages of the action from the time Mr Harjivan was first joined, he was at a disadvantage. Judgment in default of the service of his intention to defend was entered but he engaged, funded by Subhash from Glen’s resources, an experienced team of solicitors and counsel who prepared his application to set the default judgment aside. That team then withdrew, just before the hearing of this application, due to lack of funds. It can now be seen that that shortage of funds arose because Subhash could no longer, with Mukesh’s assistance, obtain funds from Glen. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">I then ordered that the application to set aside the default judgment should be joined to the trial no. 2 and heard with it. Thus, Mr Harjivan was to join into the action on the merits and he prepared his lengthy defence document. It is, however, something of a misnomer to state that Mr Harjivan prepared the defence document and its associated “crib” being the document in Portuguese he took with him into the witness box containing a summary of the defence to assist him in refreshing his memory as to the case Subhash had primed him to present. The misnomer “Mr Harjivan’s preparation” arises because the entirety of the lengthy and detailed documentation he submitted as a pleading and used as an aide memoir at the trial is now known to have been prepared by Subhash as part of his conspiracy with Mr Harjivan for Mr Harjivan to present perjured evidence aimed at showing that Mr Harjivan had acquired both Glen and Teso for £12 million. This case was presented without Mr Harjivan being able to produce one document which supported or corroborated the unbelievable story that he put forward. Mr Harjivan had every opportunity to seek out and put forward such documentation as existed in his possession or which had been disclosed. </p>

He was invited to return to give evidence with his son and daughter and he was provided with funding to enable him to be represented at the resumption of his evidence and to prepare for that second spell in the witness box and to seek out any further documentary evidence he wished to adduce to support his case. </p>

No documents were put forward, despite my invitation to Mr Harjivan to provide further discovery and the principal change or addition to his evidence previously given which was otherwise confirmed was the revelation that Subhash had prepared his previous defence documentation. </p>

Mr Harjivan was ultimately a party for eighteen months before the trial was concluded which is more than enough time to formulate his case and evidence on the issue that concerns him directly. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">The court was not asked to draw inferences about Mr Harjivan or his case or his evidence at all, let alone from “a morass of oral and written evidence both pre-existing this trial and adduced for it”.  Instead, the court was asked to accept the relatively brief oral evidence of Mr Harjivan presented without any supporting documentation and having had every opportunity with Subhash and his two separate legal teams to prepare that case. There is no indication that Mr Harjivan has been deprived of an opportunity to access documents he wishes to deploy or a reasonable opportunity to give the evidence he wishes to put forward. Mr Harjivan’s difficulty is that there never were any documents to support his case and, as he admitted in relation to his extraordinary evidence about PO Box 1127, Maputo, Mozambique,  he could not always remember what Subhash wanted him to say.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="339">

The urgency arose out of the fact that Parties 8 – 13 had, and still have at the time of the handing down of judgment no. 5,  a pending appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal have previously indicated that if the present trial was not proceeded with expeditiously, that Appeal would be listed for hearing.</p>

Firstly, I held that those parties had had since October 2005 to prepare for trial and to arrange funding for their representation.  Secondly, those parties could not reasonably complain that the urgency to hold the trial was created by reference to the pending appeal as it was their appeal and it was they who had indicated that they wanted the appeal heard speedily.</p>

However, it goes much further than that because Parties 8 – 13 have had the advantage that Mr Harjivan was deprived of, namely that they have  been involved in the Thakrar Litigation for years and they are familiar with the extensive background, with the documents, and with the allegations that are in play. Furthermore, they were previously advised and represented by lawyers and their evidence was prepared by lawyers. </p>

Adequate preparation could not have been done in the time available.  It is doubtful whether even with a team of solicitors instructing leading and junior counsel, Mr Harjivan’s case could have been ready for trial without it being adjourned. In fact, Mr Harjivan had no representation at all.  Accordingly, what would in any event have been unjust became flagrantly so.</p>

As it turned out, he has had fifteen months of trial time for a trial that has only occupied about 30 working days, most not concerned with issues directly affecting him. In the lengthy gaps between hearings, Mr Harjivan has had the opportunity of funded representation to prepare his defence and to obtain and present any supporting evidence. In fact, he relied totally on Subhash and the coaching Subhash gave him to present a shadow case of Subhash’s which he knew nothing about and which he had difficulty, at times in remembering.</p>

In fact, Mr Harjivan was exceptionally well represented by solicitors and counsel, his problem is and always has been that he does not have an honest defence or a case.</p>

Far from being overridden in this case, this principle has been more than fully honoured with third party funds being made available to Mr Harjivan for his legal representation. In the context of equality of arms, this is in a case where two of the claiming parties are in person assisted by a McKenzie friend and the other claiming parties have exhausted their available funds, are impecunious, have significant outstanding awards of costs in their favour and could only proceed as a result of the generous indulgence of their legal teams with regard to funding. In the case of Party 1, she could only proceed with the benefit of a Conditional Fee Agreement, for want of available funds in Subhash’s estate with which to fund her representation.   </p>

As already set out, it was this: was Mr Harjivan the beneficial owner of Glen and Teso? In the circumstances of this case, this fact based question was: did Mr Harjivan buy the shares in Glen and Teso from Ramila and Vijaya, and, if so, what, how, when and where did he pay for those shares? Mr Harjivan had considerable prior warning and prior knowledge of the litigation before he was joined as a party.  In particular, he attended a two-day meeting at Decherts in December 2005 in the course of which the ‘purchase’ of Glen and Teso from ‘Ramila’ and ‘Vijaya’ was discussed. Although there were numerous pleadings and thousands of documents;   there are very few pleadings and even fewer documents concerning the issue affecting Mr Harjivan.

Counsel raised two specific concerns: </p>

The position of Mukesh was particularly difficult in that he had been, as he saw the situation, subjected to an almost daily barrage of demands for the production of documents without any apparent regard for the impact that they were having on his ability to devote time to the preparation of his own case and to continue to earn a living. </p>

The truth as to the misuse of that account by Subhash and Mukesh in breach of the freezing injunctions and the complete indifference to those breaches and involvement in the management of that account by Mr Shelton led to the appointment of a court-appointed interim Receiver to protect that account. That was the only reason for the appointment of Party 1 as an interim Receiver, it was intended to be a short-term appointment but the conduct of Parties 7 – 14 and 18 unduly prolonged the trial thereafter.</p>

That position is as a potential residual claimant if it be held that he is the beneficial owner of Glen, if there remained thereafter a residual balance of assets after all claims had been met and if he was entitled to that balance notwithstanding the dishonest manner in which he had become and remained the beneficial owner of Glen. </p>

What I propose doing is listing each head of complaint and then making my findings about that head of complaint without addressing the procedural question  as to whether, if the complaint were to be made out, whether it would enable Subhash to obtain relief for himself and, if so, what relief. Subhash’s fire was principally directed to SPC as Party 2, no doubt because Party 2 has an outstanding judgment against him in excess of £5 million and is laying claim for the restitutionary return of over 100 properties in Glen’s current portfolio. In consequence, Party 2 was the only party that addressed Subhash’s complaints. I will therefore address those responses.</p>

A compromise agreement and Tomlin order may both be set aside on the grounds that they were procured by either fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation in a separate action. That is what Party 2 is claiming, in a separate action from the original Part 20 claim.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Subhash was due to be cross-examined for three days but, apart from confirming his name, and in the presence of senior junior counsel appearing for him on the questioning process, he made it clear that he would not answer any questions. I warned Subhash that if he maintained this stance, I would be bound to consider drawing adverse conclusions and he still maintained his silence. The claiming parties waived their right to require Subhash to make good his claim question by question. However, they submitted, correctly, that a party who refuses to answer any question in circumstances where, as here, there is so much for Subhash to provide answers to, should be considered by a court as one against whom it can and should draw adverse inferences where appropriate. Subhash sought to contend that he had only refused to give evidence because his counsel advised him to take that course. However, counsel would only advise taking such a wide-ranging right of silence if he had also advised that Subhash ran the risk of incriminating himself across the whole range of issues being tried. Subhash’s conduct was suspicious in so many different circumstances that he effectively refused to engage in the trial at all and provided clear evidence that he considered that he could potentially incriminate himself across all the transactions being considered by the court in trial no. 2. Thus, Subhash has no effective standing to complain of unfairness when he declined to engage in the trial in these circumstances.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> Subhash maintained that the relief claimed by Party 2 and the basis upon which it is claimed were not clearly set out. A reading of pleadings and other court documents shows that that complaint is ill-founded. Party 2 has, at all material times, set out its case in its statement of case and in its written and oral submissions to the court.  Accordingly, all relevant defending parties have at all material times known or had the means of knowing what Party 2’s case was that any of them had to meet.</span>

In fact, the only parties against whom this criticism could be validly made are Parties 14 and 15. These parties gave disclosure by the production of boxes of documents held at all material times by their solicitors, Decherts but only at a very late stage, mid-way through the trial. Moreover, Mukesh, apparently on Subhash’s instructions, deliberately sought to thwart disclosure by removing documents from Party 14’s solicitors and hiding them at SKTL’s offices.</span>

Further on 11 July 2008 I was informed that all issues in the Thakrar Litigation as between each and all of Parties 1 – 6 and Glen and Teso had been settled and were the subject of a compromise agreement. I made an order by consent including a schedule in Tomlin order form containing the terms of compromise. I was asked by Party 1 (as trustee in bankruptcy of Subhash and receiver and manager of Glen and Teso) to approve the terms of compromise and I did so. Further, on 14 July 2008 I accepted undertakings from Parties 8 – 13 and made an order by consent including a schedule in Tomlin order form providing for resolution of all disputes and issues between Parties 1 – 6 and each of them and Parties 8 – 13 and 17 and each of them. Further on [<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">date</span>] I made an order by consent of the joint administrators, Parties 1, 2 and 4, and Glen, including a schedule in Tomlin order form providing for resolution of all outstanding disputes and issues between Parties 1, 2 and 4 and each of them and the joint administrators.</p>
