	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This action concerns a house called ‘Maison d’Or’ that was built for the Claimant, Mr Ian McGlinn, in St Aubin, in Jersey.    The house took three years to build, between January 1999 and December 2001.   Following the departure of the building contractors in January 2002, when the house was substantially complete, it sat empty for the next 3 years whilst the alleged deficiencies in its design and construction were the subject of extensive investigation by a team of experts and contractors.    In the early part of 2005, it was completely demolished.    It was never lived in.    It has not been rebuilt.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McGlinn was, until very recently, the co-owner of The Body Shop group of companies, when he sold his shares for in excess of £100 million.    At times during the unhappy story of Maison d’Or, Mr McGlinn’s wealth has resulted in events and decisions which would not even have been contemplated by employers of more modest means.    As he agreed in cross-examination, his wealth allowed him to take legal and financial risks which others could simply not afford to contemplate.   Notwithstanding that, there can be no doubt that, contrary to what might be inferred from the Defendants’ submissions, Mr McGlinn was just as entitled as any other employer to a proper  and professional service from those that he engaged – at considerable cost - to design and build Maison d’Or.   This action centres on his allegations that he did not get such a service from the four Defendants.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is at the heart of Mr McGlinn’s case that Maison d’Or was so badly designed, and so badly built, that he was entitled to demolish it and start again.   His claim is for damages for breach of contract/negligence against those that he says are responsible: the building contractors, Waltham Contractors Ltd (“Waltham”); the architects, Huw Thomas Associates (“HTA”); the structural, mechanical and electrical engineers, DJ Hartigan (“DJH”); and the quantity surveyors and so-called Project Managers, Wilson Large Associates (“WL”).   Mr McGlinn’s primary case on damages is put by reference to the actual cost of demolition and the estimated cost of rebuilding the whole house, in a total sum calculated (by the end of the trial) at £3,649,481.34.   The alternative case is put by reference to the estimated costs of repairing the individual elements which are said to be defective, producing a final figure of £2,487,246.29.  There are also disputes concerning an alleged overpayment of HTA’s fees and outstanding fees said to be due to DJH.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although they would doubtless have taken centre-stage at the hearing, Waltham played no part whatsoever during the seven week trial, because they are in administration.   Some of their former employees might have given evidence on behalf of HTA and DJH, but in the event they were not called upon to do so.    For completeness, I should also note that Mr McGlinn has a separate claim concerning the over-valuation of the works which Waltham carried out.   As a result of their absence from the proceedings, that over-valuation claim is pursued against WL and DJH only.   That claim is due to be heard later this year, and thus forms no part of this Judgment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons which are set out below, I consider that, perhaps unusually in a defects case, the events before and during the construction of Maison d’Or are  at least of some relevance to the allegations which are now made.   Thus, following some general observations on the evidence at <span style="font-weight:bold">Section B</span> below, I set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section C</span> some of the key events in the chronology and at, <span style="font-weight:bold">Section D</span>, I summarise the unsatisfactory nature (and almost non-existent records) of the contractual relationships between the parties.   Then at <span style="font-weight:bold">Sections E and F</span>, I consider the terms of the contract between Mr McGlinn and HTA, and analyse each of the breaches of contract/particulars of negligence alleged against HTA in the Scott Schedule.   At <span style="font-weight:bold">Sections G and H</span> I carry out the same, shorter, exercise in respect of DJH, and, at <span style="font-weight:bold">Sections I and J</span>, there is a similar exercise in respect of the specific allegations against WL.   At <span style="font-weight:bold">Section K,</span> I consider the relevant principles concerning causation and the assessment of damages, identify the particular issues that arise in this case, and make a series of general findings on those issues.    Thereafter, at <span style="font-weight:bold">Sections L, M and N</span> I then apply those general findings in an assessment of the quantum of the damages recoverable, respectively, against HTA, DJH and WL.  At <span style="font-weight:bold">Sections O and P</span> I deal with the particular disputes that have arisen in respect of the fees payable to HTA and DJH.    At <span style="font-weight:bold">Section Q</span>, I set out a short summary of my conclusions.</p>

One of my distinguished predecessors in the Technology and Construction Court, His Honour Judge Newey QC<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	      </authorialNote>, often remarked that he had only ever been obliged to complete one full trial on a Scott Schedule, and even that had been due to the incompetence of counsel.     My experience in this Scott Schedule case has been entirely different.   A large amount of material, and a host of detailed technical points, was dealt with in what I regard as an exemplary fashion.    A tight timetable was produced, agreed, and then adhered to.   I am extremely grateful to all those involved for their assistance.</p>

In addition to Mr McGlinn, I heard evidence from Mr Terence Disdale and Mr James Berryman of Terence Disdale Design (“TDD”), who played an important role in the design of the interiors and finishes of Maison d’Or;  Mr Hardcastle and Mr Ellis of Centurion Management Services Ltd (“Centurion”), who managed Mr McGlinn’s affairs on Jersey;  Mr Mark Tanner, who was engaged by Mr McGlinn towards the end of the building works to try and improve what Mr McGlinn saw as serious deficiencies in the performance of Waltham;  and Mr Martin Dobbs, Mr Anthony Holt and Mr Eric Sey, all of Charter Architects, who were appointed by Mr McGlinn to inspect Maison d’Or after the departure of Waltham from site and whose investigations form the basis of the Scott Schedule.    In addition, I heard evidence from Mr Martin Holmes, the managing director of Camerons, the contractors who carried out a large part of the investigative and so-called enabling work, and Mr Richard Sugg of E.C. Harris, the Quantity Surveyor who produced costings of the repair and rebuild options being considered by Mr McGlinn in 2004-2005.   There was also evidence from Fiona Diamond, of TDD, confined to a narrow issue concerning the cost of, and separate claim for, furniture storage.   </p>

I found him to be an honest and straightforward witness, although I consider that he was not senior enough within HTA to have been given, as he was, almost complete responsibility for the day-to-day running of this project on their behalf.   Two of the witnesses who were not eventually called by HTA, namely Mr Hiscock and Mr Prinn were, respectively, the managing director and the contract manager of Waltham.

However, I accept Mr Williamson QC’s submission that there were a number of important matters where the absence of any evidence from Mr Thomas must lead to findings or inferences which are contrary to HTA’s case.

This is not unimportant because, at the outset of HTA’s case, Mr Williamson QC had indicated in writing those matters upon which he would cross-examine Mr Thomas and those matters which he would address via Mr Thornton.   The decision not to call Mr Thomas was not announced until after Mr Thornton had completed his evidence.   Thus the fact that Mr Thornton was not cross-examined on an issue, because Mr Williamson QC intended (and had announced that intention) to cross-examine Mr Thomas on that topic instead, may be of some relevance in my consideration of the HTA evidence.    It is plainly relevant to any complaint by HTA that Mr Thornton was not cross-examined on particular issues.</p>

In general terms, I accept the proposition that, because the case against WL is pleaded on a contingent basis only (being dependent upon HTA’s pleaded references to WL in their responses to the Scott Schedule and the failure of Mr McGlinn’s case against HTA on those Items) HTA’s decision not to call Mr Thomas explains, at least in large part, WL’s consequential decision not to call Mr Richards.

Thus, Mr Dobbs of Charter agreed that he was a demanding client who was “forthright in his opinions … he was blunt and he said what he wanted”.    Mr Tanner said it was not unfair to say that people did not find Mr McGlinn the easiest person to get along with and that it was well known that he used “fruity language”.    Mr Tanner also said of the Claimant that “he knows what he likes” and that he believed he was a man who could take a strong dislike to people.  Mr Sugg of E. C.

During his cross-examination, he was certainly forthright; he was relatively quick to anger; and he plainly took the view, before, during and after the work by Waltham, that since he was paying the bills, he could ask for what he wanted when he liked.   However, whilst these character traits may explain why there were particular disagreements and difficulties on the Maison d’Or project, and why there were so many changes as the work progressed (which may, in turn, explain the genesis of at least some of the items now alleged to be defects) it does not seem to me that they excuse, or could be used to explain, defaults in design and workmanship.</p>

It was clear to me that he had very little recollection of many of the most important events during the design and construction phases of the work.   He kept no records himself;   indeed, as he accepted during cross-examination, there was not a single document in any of the bundles which he had produced, written or signed.    This created obvious difficulties for certain aspects of his case, particularly the oft-repeated theme that, at the outset of the project, he had asked for particular design features and standards which had subsequently not been provided.    His poor memory made it very difficult for Mr McGlinn to counter the evidence of other witnesses who had much better recollections of particular meetings and other significant events between 1997 and 2001.</p>

Precisely the same criticism can be made of HTA:  there was a complete absence of minutes, notes or notebooks kept by HTA during the currency of this major project.   Since they were the architects on this major project, the absence of any records of HTA’s periodic inspections is a matter of particular concern. DJH also failed to keep the sort of detailed records that I would have expected to see.</p>

In respect of the mechanical and electrical matters, Mr McGlinn’s expert Mr Moseby, and DJH’s M&amp;E expert, Mr Sworder, were able to reach such a large measure of agreement that it was unnecessary for them to give oral evidence at all.  In respect of structural engineering matters, the relevant experts were Mr Ross-Gower for Mr McGlinn, and Mr Dibb-Fuller for DJH.  As a result of their agreements, their oral evidence was very limited.  In respect of quantum, Mr McGlinn’s expert was Mr Fitch.   HTA’s quantum expert was Mr Linnett and DJH’s quantum expert was Mr Pontin.   WL had no need for any expert evidence save in respect of quantum, on which their expert witness was Mr Pope.</p>

During the trial, an almost bewildering array of further collections of photographs was produced, in at least another six files.    The absence of any exercise collating all these different photographs by reference to the individual Items in the Scott Schedule created a certain amount of difficulty, which the belated production of Bundle Q2 only partly alleviated.   There have also been problems with the quality of some of the photographs relied on.   For example, it could be said that the Claimant’s own case about the replacement of 10,000 roof tiles (Item 4.1.1 in the Scott Schedule) turned on three photographs taken in March 2002, two of which are of poor quality.

This is really a reflection of the point that I have made in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section C14</span> below, namely that this was not a case where the extensive investigations into the building problems were triggered by actual damage, such as cracks or leaks; here, the investigations resulted from a general level of dissatisfaction with Maison d’Or on the part of Mr McGlinn and which, when they were first carried out, led to the discovery of further defects.  The consequence of this was that the evidence of damage (as opposed to defects) could fairly be described as thin;  although, as I explain below, there was some limited evidence of water ingress and the like, in general terms, it seems clear that this was – if nothing else - a generally sound and secure structure.</p>

I was never able to see Maison d’Or itself; the videos/dvds are of some help, but there is a debate about what precise information I should take from any particular capture from the videos/dvds.   The photographs have not been satisfactorily collated and are scattered throughout a large number of files.   I am conscious, therefore, that I am deciding the Items in the Scott Schedule against a background of secondary evidence which is less helpful than should perhaps have been the case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McGlinn became a resident in Jersey in about 1996.   At that time, he owned a property in St Aubin, a small town with a harbour on the coast of Jersey opposite St Helier.    Unable to get planning permission for the works that he proposed at that house, Mr McGlinn looked round for another property in the same area.   Because of his love of the sea, and the amount of time that he spent on his boats, Mr McGlinn was anxious to remain in St Aubin, where the properties on the hill above the harbour have wonderful views back across the moored boats and the bay.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In late 1997, Mr McGlinn found and bought a property on the western slope above St Aubin known as Villa Gardena.    He intended to demolish this small existing property on the site and to build a much larger house there.   This was the site of what was to become Maison d’Or.   The site was part way up the hill, and faced almost exactly due east.  It looked out across, but was set well back from, the harbour and the sea.    There were other houses below and around the site, as well as a large number of mature trees and shrubs.  It was also surrounded, on the south, west and north sides, by the rising slope of the ridge beyond.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was the Claimant’s case in the litigation that the site was severely exposed and in a hostile marine environment, and that due consideration should have been (but was not) taken of these matters in HTA’s design of Maison d’Or and the specification of the relevant materials.   HTA responded by reference to the criteria in the relevant British Standards, and argued that this site could not be described as “severely exposed” or even “exposed”.  The particular factors which they relied on in support of this argument included the specification of cavity walls and render to keep out the weather, the surrounding slope on three sides, and the trees and shrubs.</p>

However, I should make clear at the outset that I have concluded that Maison d’Or was not an exposed site for design and specification purposes.   I consider that this aspect of the case was exaggerated, first by Charter (who raised a number of criticisms based on their view of the exposure of the site but failed to do any exposure calculation at all) and later by Mr Jowett, who, when assessing the exposure rating of the site, appeared to ignore the design of the walls, the contours of the ground, and the proximity of the surrounding buildings, trees and shrubs.   I find that this was not an exposed site in either the technical or the impressionistic sense of the word.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence was that HTA had a very good reputation on Jersey as competent and sympathetic architects, with a good relationship with the Planning Department.    Mr Hardcastle, of Centurion recommended HTA to Mr McGlinn.   In consequence, Mr McGlinn first contacted HTA whilst he was still in the process of buying the Maison d’Or site.   He met Mr Thomas for the first time on 8 August 1997 and apparently made clear to him his desire to create a new dwelling on the site in what he described as a French Chateau style.   Some RIBA documentation concerned with fees was apparently given to him, although Mr McGlinn could remember neither the meeting nor the fees booklet.   It was suggested to Mr McGlinn in cross-examination that, at the meeting, Mr Thomas showed him a formal RIBA agreement, but that he said he was not interested in such things and threw it into the bin.   Mr McGlinn rejected that suggestion emphatically.   A few days later, on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August Mr Thomas sent him some pages (concerned with Work Stages and fees) taken from the RIBA Architect’s Appointment document (known as the “Blue Book”).   There was never any formal contract between Mr McGlinn and HTA and the precise terms of their engagement are now the subject of fierce debate.   I deal with those issues in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E</span> below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the many disputes between HTA and Mr McGlinn as to the terms of HTA’s retainer is the extent, if at all, to which HTA were responsible for the design of the interiors and finishes of the property.    Whatever the scope of HTA’s original obligations in this regard, there is no doubt that, some time in 1998, TDD were asked by Mr McGlinn to carry out a design function in respect of the interiors and finishes at Maison d’Or.   Although it may have been Mr McGlinn’s original intention that TDD would simply provide suggestions as to interior designs and finishings (because, as Mr McGlinn put it, “Mr Disdale knows my taste, my likes and dislikes”) it is clear that, in reality, they played an increasingly important design role, issuing instructions on Mr McGlinn’s behalf and making design/specification decisions in respect of what Mr Disdale agreed was ‘every room in the new property’.   There was no written contract of any sort between Mr McGlinn and Mr Disdale:   the latter commented that this was a “very unusual” engagement and that his duties “were not defined at all”.</p>

Again, there was no formal agreement of any sort recording the services that they were to provide.   Later, as we shall see, the description of WL’s role was altered when it was announced by Centurion that WL had also been appointed as Project Managers in January 1999.  Again, however, the precise nature and scope of their new obligations (if any) were not set out in writing, and therefore remain the subject of major controversy.   </p>

Mr Thomas produced a series of watercolours about that time which showed the front elevation of the proposed house.   The watercolours compare very closely with the photographs of the completed building taken four years later.  Although there are some French influences, the house was, in truth, an attractive Arts and Crafts domestic building, not dissimilar to the late 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century work of C.H.Voysey and the Scottish architect Robert Lorimer, whose work was and is sometimes referred to (not altogether kindly) as ‘Scots Baronial’.    </p>

The proposed scheme involved replacing the existing small house with the much larger Maison d’Or.  The application for planning permission was made on 30 April 1998.   Planning permission was granted on 6 July 1998.   Mr Jowett said that, in his view, “Mr Thomas did a good job” in obtaining planning permission for Maison d’Or.</p>

As we shall see, when, in 2002 and thereafter, Mr McGlinn was expressing his dissatisfaction with Maison d’Or to his new advisers, a point he repeatedly made was that it had not been designed or built in accordance with the exceptionally high standards that he had asked for.    This, inevitably, led to numerous disputes as to what precisely it was that he had required, given the absence of any written record or clear design brief.    </p>

The most important was the visit to his boat.  There was no dispute that, at some time in the late summer of 1997, Mr McGlinn invited Mr Thomas and his wife to his yacht, Tigre d’Or, which was then moored in the Mediterranean off the French coast.   It was Mr McGlinn’s case that the principal purpose of this visit was to explain to Mr Thomas that he required the same standard of finish on the yacht in the new house in Jersey:  that Mr Thomas would, in his words, “see the quality of it”.    This became known in the contemporaneous papers and during the trial as “the boat standard”, and, to all intents and purposes, it denoted Mr McGlinn’s requirement for something like a perfect standard for all the joinery and other interior finishes.   </p>

He said that he wanted an aged appearance, and for the finished house to look as if it had been there for a long time.  This went as far as an express suggestion by Mr McGlinn that algae should be encouraged to grow on the stonework to give it an aged appearance, and that this could be achieved by putting yoghurt on the stonework.</p>

For a while, the two projects ran in parallel.   On the Sandbanks property, HTA obtained planning permission for a rather different kind of building, with more steel and glass.  It was described during the trial as a contemporary, Frank Lloyd Wright house.   However, on the Sandbanks property, HTA’s retainer was not extended beyond the obtaining of planning permission.   The detailing and construction phases were taken over by The Charter Partnership of Bournemouth.    They were, much later, to become closely involved with Maison d’Or.</p>

It is also relevant because, when Charter were engaged to oversee the detailing and construction of the Sandbanks property, it appears that, from the outset, they were told in clear terms by Mr McGlinn that he required the boat standard of finish.   Mr McGlinn said that he made that clear; that was accepted by Mr Dobbs of Charter.  It appears that, in consequence of this instruction, the Charter Partnership advised Mr McGlinn that such a standard would come at a significant financial premium, and that specialist contractors, from outside the UK construction industry and used to working on boat-fitting contracts, would be required to achieve such a standard.</p>

Their tender was sent under cover of a letter dated 13 November 1998 which emphasised “the congested nature of the site” and made clear that, amongst other alterations to the proposed works, Waltham had priced for “16” x 10” Spanish slates (French slates have not been used on the island for several years)”.   The Waltham tender indicated a contract period of 64 weeks, from 7 December 1998 onwards.</p>

Mr McGlinn said:  “I asked him to look at costs and to see if he could get them down”.

Brief minutes were taken of the meeting by DJH.   A number of possibilities were explored.  In his letter to Mr McGlinn of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>November 1998, Mr Richards said that none of these proposed changes “alter the original design of the house” although, later in the same letter, he said that there would indeed be “some design changes” as a result of this exercise.    The proposed reductions (ten in all) were then set out in a tender report which Mr Richards sent to Mr McGlinn the following day (21 November).    This identified over £548,000 odd worth of savings, getting the total cost figure down to £1.66 million.   This included the omission of the kitchen and utility fittings, significant savings in the mechanical and electrical services and other important reductions in both the exterior and interior elements of the proposed building which are directly relevant to some of the most important allegations in the Scott Schedule.</p>

First, the Defendants say that the mere fact that they were instructed to, and did, make significant reductions to the scope of the work in order to get Waltham’s figure down to the budget figure of £1.5 million was entirely inconsistent with Mr McGlinn’s case now that he had insisted from the outset on the highest possible specification and standards of finish.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, some of the reductions are directly relevant to the specific allegations now made by Mr McGlinn because, within the Scott Schedule, there are a number of items where the suggestion is that the Defendants were negligent and/or in breach of contract in allowing particular reductions to be made from the original scope of work.    Although it is unnecessary, at this stage, to consider the specific allegations concerning the reductions that were made, it is instructive to focus on two which loomed large during the trial.    Those are the changes from granite facings to Haddonstone facings, and, internally, the change from oak to idigbo.  </p>

Following the receipt of the tenders, one of the proposed reductions was the replacement of that granite with reconstituted stone, which was, therefore, a move back to the original concept.   It was referred to in the minutes of the meeting on 19 November as the removal of “all areas of natural stone and replace with stucco and recon stone”.   In the report of 21 November 1998, faxed by Mr Richards to Mr McGlinn, this proposed reduction read as follows: </p>

On balance, I think it more likely than not that Mr McGlinn did see the Haddonstone catalogue which provided more details about their reconstituted stone product.   Further, given that it was Mr Thornton’s recollection that there was a meeting later in December attended by Mr McGlinn, Mr Thomas, Mr Thornton and Mr Disdale, at which the Haddonstone was generally approved, that seems the most likely occasion on which Mr McGlinn looked at the catalogue.    It was suggested to Mr Thornton in cross-examination by Mr Reese QC that, by reference to other documents, this meeting was likely to have been on 14 December.   Although there were no notes or minutes of this meeting, it seems to me that, again on the balance of probabilities, there was a further meeting on this date attended by Mr McGlinn at which, amongst other things, the Haddonstone that had been proposed and agreed by the professional team was accepted by Mr McGlinn.</p>

That is how it was subsequently constructed.    In cross-examination, Mr McGlinn thought it possible that, once the Haddonstone had been erected, his only comment was that it looked too neat and new.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Unfortunately, in December 1998, there was a major disagreement between Mr Thomas and Mr McGlinn concerning fees of about £8,000 claimed by Mr Thomas in respect of design work on the Sandbanks property.  Mr McGlinn and Mr Thomas had an argument about these outstanding fees in a pub in St Aubin.   This dispute had very serious consequences because Mr McGlinn decided that, not only would he not pay HTA’s fees, but he would also not pay any of the consultants’ outstanding fees in respect of both the Sandbanks property and Maison d’Or.  He also expressed the intention to sack HTA from both projects. Eventually, however, he was persuaded out of this extreme stance by Mr Richards at WL and Mr Hardcastle at Centurion.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a result of Mr Richards’ intervention, and a meeting that he had with Mr McGlinn in January 1999 at St Katherine’s Dock, it seems that Mr McGlinn decided not to sack HTA after all.  He subsequently made payment of the outstanding fees to all the consultants on both projects.   However, he did not modify his hostile views of HTA.   From this point on, he did not communicate with Mr Thomas at all for almost two years:  as he put it, “I could not speak to the architect”.  When trying to understand how and why this project went so wrong, it is perhaps unnecessary to look further for at least one explanation of the subsequent events than the fact that the client and his architect did not speak for almost the entire period that the house was being detailed and constructed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The disagreement over fees between Mr Thomas and Mr McGlinn had another important consequence.   Mr McGlinn was anxious to find somebody else who would effectively act as a go-between in the relationship between the client and the architect, and to deal with all the financial arrangements in respect of both projects.   He asked Mr Richards to take on that role.   According to Mr Hardcastle of Centurion, Mr McGlinn told him that Mr Richards would become the Project Manager, although Mr McGlinn denies saying that.   Accordingly, on 29 January 1999, Centurion wrote to HTA, DJH and others, to say: </p>

However, Mr Hardcastle did not write to WL in those same terms and, like so much else in this case, WL dispute that they were appointed to act as Project Manager, at least in the usual sense of that expression.    That is a dispute I deal with at <span style="font-weight:bold">Section I</span> below.   But, whatever the precise terms of WL’s engagement as Project Manager, the fact remains that WL were solely responsible for administering all of the many financial arrangements arising out of the design and construction of Maison d’Or, including the identification of the amount to be paid to Waltham on an interim basis.</p>

Mr McGlinn said that he was happy with the reduction of £548,000 (from the tender sum of £2.2 million odd) and was uninterested in how this had been achieved.   On 24 November, Mr Richards wrote to DJH saying, amongst other things: “Ian McGlinn has given the go-ahead”.  Mr McGlinn accepted in cross-examination that, although he could not recall the conversation, he must have given this instruction to Mr Richards.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, as at the end of November 1998, there was no agreement between Mr McGlinn and Waltham (the two parties to any proposed building contract) in respect of the scope of the works (because of the proposed changes/reductions in workscope); the price of the work (because the letter says that the contract sum is to be negotiated); and the period which the contract works would take (because the letter says that a detailed programme had to be agreed).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite the terms of the letter, no formal building contract was ever entered into by Mr McGlinn and Waltham, and, even more surprisingly, the letter was never updated.   In August of 1999, after Waltham had been working on the site for many months, WL sent them a set of contract documentation which, in the round, duplicated in their entirety the documents sent out with the original tender enquiry.   However, this contract was never signed by Waltham and sent back.   Whether this was simply due to inadvertence is unlikely; there is a clear suggestion in the papers that Waltham deliberately decided that they could not sign up to this contract because they were unable to agree to a completion date for the works due to the number of variations.    It is likely that this was a classic case where a contractor was allowed to start work before a contract was or could be agreed, and by the time the parties might have been in a position to formalise a binding contract, it had been overtaken by events.   Mr Thornton said that it was his understanding that “the contract was not signed because it was in flux”.    However, notwithstanding the absence of a contract, Waltham often wrote to HTA making claims pursuant to specific clauses of the JCT standard form, and purporting to rely on specific provisions that they considered helpful.</p>

In addition, it seems to me that there was an agreement between Mr McGlinn and Waltham that the preliminaries and general conditions set out in Bill 1 of the Bills of Approximate Quantities would also be incorporated into their contract.   That was certainly the important assumption on which WL operated.   However, the fact that these JCT conditions look to have been broadly agreed as between Mr McGlinn and Waltham should not be taken to mean that the obligations of any of the professionals on this project must have been those which are envisaged to exist by the JCT Standard Form.</p>

It seems to me that it was quite wrong for HTA – and this must, in reality, mean Mr Thomas - to seek or accept a loan from the contractors whose work they would be inspecting on behalf of Mr McGlinn.   It was a grave lapse of professional judgment, leaving HTA vulnerable to an obvious and justified attack on their lack of integrity and independence.   This lack of judgment was compounded by their failure to inform WL or Mr McGlinn;   even if Mr Richards realised from Waltham’s letter of 7 April 1999 that this loan had been made (and I make no findings either way), that cannot excuse HTA, because there was nothing to show that they knew that the letter had even been sent.   The letter did not, could not, excuse Mr Thomas from telling WL and Mr McGlinn about the loan, and he failed to do so.</p>

I find that Mr Thornton made his inspections and dealt with Waltham without any regard to, or even subconsciously influenced by, the existence of the loan.    I accept his evidence that, in carrying out his inspections, Mr Thornton “had little regard to the firm’s position in relation to any money they owed anybody”.    Whether he made those inspections properly is, of course, another issue altogether.</p>

However, save where there are particular Items in the Scott Schedule on which Mr Thomas purported to give evidence as to periodic inspections, I do not consider that the failure to call Mr Thomas should affect my perception of Mr Thornton’s performance as the inspecting architect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept Mr Williamson QC’s submission, made on behalf of Mr McGlinn, that the events between February 1999 (when the work started) and December 2001 (when Waltham stopped work) are of some significance to the specific allegations of default in this case.   It is also important to set out, by way of background, the general features of the progress of the work over this period.   There were three primary sources for that information:  the contemporaneous documents in the sixteen G bundles, which were referred to only sparingly in the cross-examination;   particular parts of the oral evidence of Mr McGlinn and Mr Thornton of HTA; and the lengthy paragraph 4 of the statement of Mr Thornton, which was not the subject of substantial challenge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The work started in February 1999.  Between February and October 1999, there were site meetings, on average, every fortnight, which were minuted by Waltham, not HTA.  They were generally attended by Mr Thomas and Mr Thornton of HTA, as well as Mr Richards of WL, and representatives of DJH and Waltham.  From November 1999, the frequency of the site meetings dropped to once a month.  With one or two exceptions, HTA’s sole representative at these monthly meetings was Mr Thornton.  The minutes of these meetings demonstrate that, by January 2000, the ground floor slab had been cast and the blockwork walls were progressing.  By October the same year, the main structure of Maison D’Or had been completed, namely the walls, windows, roof and so forth.   Thereafter, as Mr Thornton accepted, the main focus of the monthly site meetings was in respect of the internal works, principally the mechanical and electrical works.   Mr Thornton also said that his periodic inspections were carried out on the same day as the monthly meetings, usually in the company of Mr Richards of WL.</p>

Mr Disdale confirmed that Mr McGlinn often changed his mind “when he saw things constructed”.  Therefore, even though Waltham might have built the particular feature entirely in accordance with the drawings with which they had been provided, Mr McGlinn would consider the feature in question and then decide that he wanted something different.  Mr McGlinn said that, since he was prepared to pay for the change, this was an attitude that he was entitled to adopt:  “I was prepared to pay for it and they had time”.    This approach was consistent with his statement, early on in his cross-examination, that his wealth allowed him to indulge his likes and dislikes.  </p>

The posts which carried the roof of the turret then had to be turned into window mullions and extensive further work was required.   Mr McGlinn did not accept the suggestion that Mr Thornton had told him that adapting the existing timbers and windows would not be as good as having the whole thing purpose-made in the joinery shop.   In Bedroom 1, Mr McGlinn instructed the raising of the floor in the study and the lowering of the window sill in the study and bedroom, to improve his view, as well as the extension of the balcony to Bedroom 1 to make it larger.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Three points emerge from Mr Thornton’s lengthy description of the changes to the works (and their effect) during the three year period in which Maison d’Or was constructed.   The first, which was echoed by others, was the delay on the part of TDD in producing internal design features, a failing which Mr Disdale candidly accepted during his cross-examination.   It may be that, at the outset, the relationship between Mr McGlinn and TDD was entirely informal, and that, therefore, the production of information for Mr McGlinn was not one of TDD’s  highest priorities, but by 2000, and the construction of the house itself, that could no longer be an excuse for the late delivery of promised information.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there is the likelihood that, because Mr McGlinn issued peremptory instructions on his irregular visits to the site which resulted in the destruction of work which the professionals and Waltham regarded as perfectly satisfactory, this would have had an effect on the morale and, up to a point, on the performance of the contractors and consultants working on Maison d’Or.  However, I reiterate that, in general terms, I do not consider that, without more, these instructions and events could be used to excuse specific errors of design or workmanship. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, although the scope and scale of the changes made by Mr McGlinn demonstrated that, if he did not like something about Maison d’Or as it was being built, he pointed it out and had it changed, he never complained about the Haddonstone (Item 1.2.1 of the Scott Schedule), the idigbo (Item 2.2.3), or the masonry paint on the render (Item 1.1.2).  In respect of the Haddonstone, he accepted that it was possible that the only comment that he made was that the stone looked too neat and he again requested that yogurt be painted on it to promote the growth of algae and mould (paragraph 62 above). As to the idigbo, he made no comment at all.  And as to the render and paint, although he said that he knew that the walls had been painted and he had made no criticism of that, he sought to excuse that omission by arguing that “at that time it was too far gone”.  It therefore follows that, although Mr McGlinn was not shy about making radical changes to the completed works, he did not seek to make changes in respect of these three aesthetic elements of Maison d’Or which feature prominently in the Scott Schedule and which, on the face of it, were apparent to him from 2000 onwards.  That is a point to which I return below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the summer of 2001, it was plain that the Maison d’Or project was in a certain amount of difficulty.   The exterior of the house was largely complete and, whilst the interior was certainly moving towards practical completion, it was some way from achieving that status.   Mr McGlinn had understood originally that the contract price was going to be £1.66 million but, by this stage, he had paid Waltham approaching £4 million for the work. Everything had taken considerably longer than the year which Waltham had originally estimated.   Mr McGlinn was, not unreasonably, dissatisfied with this position.   However, in the absence of a clear building contract, and in the absence of a clear line of responsibility amongst the professionals, Mr McGlinn’s room for manoeuvre was somewhat limited.   He decided, not for the last time, that the right thing to do was to appoint a new adviser.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, in June/July 2001, Mr McGlinn appointed Mr Tanner to act as his representative.   Mr Tanner had been the captain of one of Mr McGlinn’s boats and had known him, and worked for him, for a long time.   It was clear that Mr McGlinn trusted him to look after his interests.  Mr Tanner then became involved in endeavouring to ensure that Maison d’Or was completed to Mr McGlinn’s satisfaction.   He agreed that he became Mr McGlinn’s “eyes and ears and mouthpiece”.   He said that one of his main functions was to provide “the instructions, decisions and answers” on site which, according to him, both WL and Waltham were asking for.  He accepted in cross-examination that one of his functions was to give instructions on Mr McGlinn’s behalf.  Mr McGlinn, too, agreed that Mr Tanner was there “to instruct them of my needs”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the cross-examination of Mr McGlinn, it was suggested to him that Mr Tanner’s appointment coincided with a significant change of mind on his part as to what he wanted Maison d’Or to look like.  It was suggested that, by 2001 at the latest, Mr McGlinn wanted Maison d’Or to look more like the Sandbanks house and that changes were then made to try and achieve this.  To the extent that that suggestion is pursued by HTA, I reject it.  It does not seem to me that the instructions being given by Mr McGlinn, through Mr Tanner, amounted to a major change of design concept on the part of Mr McGlinn.  I do not believe that there was any intention to change the architectural idiom at Maison d’Or.</p>

Mr Tanner made notes of the matters which needed attention, trying to hurry things along towards completion.  Thereafter he made various inspections of the property.   Indeed, in November alone, Mr Tanner carried out at least two extensive inspections of Maison d’Or in the company of Mr McGlinn.   Mr McGlinn made clear to Mr Tanner those items with which he was dissatisfied on a room-by-room basis.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the complaints which surfaced at this stage, really for the first time, was the point that the interior and finishes were not to the boat standard.   Mr Tanner produced notes of those items with which Mr McGlinn was unhappy and passed them onto Waltham; by this time, one of Mr McGlinn’s concerns was that, in his view, Maison d’Or “was not the same quality as a luxury yacht”.   At this late stage in the progress of the original works, Waltham had not offered up any part of the building for handover, and neither HTA nor DJH had produced any snagging or defects lists at all.    In his cross-examination, Mr Tanner accepted that, as a result of his role at that stage, he was having direct dealings with – and issuing instructions to – Waltham, without reference to either WL or HTA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, it appears from the documents that not even the presence of Mr Tanner could resolve all the longstanding problems on site.   For example, in their letters of 16 October 2001, 7 November 2001 and 9 November 2001, Waltham complained that Mr McGlinn regularly failed to attend meetings (despite his promises to do so) which meant that decisions on particular outstanding matters could not be taken and had to be deferred.    It is clear that frustrations were building on all sides.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At this time, as Mr Thornton put it, “the contractor was still working towards passing it [the building] over to us for snagging”.    However, as he confirmed, at no time before Waltham left site in January 2002 did they “actually offer the building up for snagging”.    Furthermore, at the same time, WL were apparently making relatively modest deductions from sums otherwise due to Waltham on account of defects in the work which had been pointed out and discussed by Mr Thornton and Mr Richards.</p>

The first responded to Mr Tanner’s lengthy list of items that needed to be dealt with following his visit on 23 November.   Waltham claimed that 33 of these items required an instruction from HTA to proceed; that they were, effectively, variations.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In their second letter, Waltham complained to HTA that practical completion had not been certified.   It appears that Waltham accepted that not all of the works that they had been asked to do were practically complete, but they argued that all of the original work scope was complete and that any outstanding matters related only to the extensive variations which they had been instructed to carry out.    They seemed to envisage some sort of qualified Practical Completion Certificate which is not provided for in the JCT form and is, on analysis, a contradiction in terms.   Moreover, Waltham’s stance was not an easy one, even by reference to the original work scope, given that they had at no stage offered up any part of the building to HTA for handover and snagging.   In addition, in the absence of a signed contract, it might have been difficult to differentiate between original work scope and variations in any event.</p>

Mr Tanner wrote to HTA on 7 December to reiterate Mr McGlinn’s “strong concern that, in his opinion, this stage [Practical Completion] has not yet been reached.”   It therefore appears from the evidence that, at this point, neither Mr Thornton, nor Mr McGlinn, nor Mr Tanner, considered that the building was practically complete.</p>

According to the contract, the certified sum of £68,350 became due no later than 27 December 2001.   The sum was not paid and, on 27 December 2001, Waltham served a default notice pursuant to Clause 28.2.1 of the contract and seeking payment in 14 days.  On 4 January 2002, Waltham suspended work and on 11 January they purported to terminate their employment under the contract.   The outstanding sums were then paid by Mr McGlinn following the issue of a statutory demand. It now seems clear that Waltham’s notices of 4 and 11 January were issued prematurely. </p>

Waltham’s express offer to continue with the works was rejected completely, and they left site the next day, making a video of the conditions as they then existed.   Waltham never returned after 24 January, and to all intents and purposes, no further work was carried out at Maison d’Or.    The house stood empty, unheated, unventilated and rather neglected, for the next three years.   It is HTA’s case that this exacerbated, and even caused, some of the defects about which complaint is now made.</p>

In the context of this dispute, that is not an unimportant matter; it has been said, with some force, that much of this case results from the simple fact that the building was never actually finished.  The risks inherent in refusing to allow a building contractor to complete his work are well known to those who are involved in construction disputes; there is no evidence as to the extent (if at all) to which Mr McGlinn was advised of those risks by Eversheds when he decided not to allow Waltham to finish the works at Maison d’Or, and to accept their repudiation instead.</p>

Mr Wheeler did not give evidence.   He produced an Initial Site Report dated 25 March 2002 which was rather like a snagging list.   Mr Tanner added his own comments:   he accepted in cross-examination that he made no criticism in these comments about the idigbo, the reconstituted stone, or the painted render, all of which are now allegations made by Mr McGlinn in the Scott Schedule.  On 17 May 2002, there was a meeting at which Mr McGlinn was present, together with Mr Tanner, and three representatives of Charter.   At that meeting, the question of the boat standard finish was raised by Mr McGlinn.   It was Charter’s stated position that “to get this standard you need to employ a specialist”.    In the typed minutes of this meeting, the point was expanded, with Charter making it clear that when, in respect of the Sandbanks property, Mr McGlinn referred to the need for a boat finish for all the works, they immediately realised that this was a standard of finish that was not normally obtainable on standard construction in the UK and that boat-building specialists would have to be employed to carry out much of the work (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following this meeting, in July 2002, Mr Wheeler produced a much more extensive defects schedule, which was the origin of the Scott Schedule used at the trial.    The vast majority of the defects were identified as matters of bad workmanship on the part of Waltham.   Further, almost all of the items were internal.    There were just four pages of external items.   Mr Dobbs said that the investigation which gave rise to this schedule was intended to be as exhaustive as possible.   Therefore, it is important to note that, as the cross-examination of Mr Dobbs made plain, a number of critical allegations in the subsequent Scott Schedule were not mentioned at all in Mr Wheeler’s July schedule.  They included Items 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.5, 1.3.3, 2.1.4, 4.1.1, 10.1.1, 10.2, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, 10.3.4 and 10.4.    I accept Mr Bartlett QC’s submission on behalf of HTA that these Items include some of the most important which HTA now face, and would <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> have required any opening-up in order to be discovered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of particular significance was the omission of Item 4.1.1 of the Scott Schedule which is concerned with the alleged inadequate quality of the slates.  The allegation against HTA turns on whether or not, during Mr Thornton’s periodic inspections, they should have noticed the pyrites stains on some of the slates.  HTA’s defence was that there was no sign of pyrites prior to January 2002.  In such circumstances, the content of Mr Wheeler’s July 2002 Schedule was important, because it was the best evidence of what could be seen at Maison d’Or by an architect, inspecting for defects, some 6 months after the work had come to an end.  Mr Dobbs accepted that Mr Wheeler had looked at the slates (because he noticed and recorded that several slates were broken and needed replacing) but either he did not notice the pyrites or did not consider that it was a matter worth commenting upon.  Mr Dobbs suggested that an even more thorough investigation might have been needed in order to appreciate that there was an issue of pyrites.  </p>

A further report was then provided.   This led to a revision of the defects schedule of July, which now identified photographs of some of the typical defects.  This did include a first reference to the pyrites.  At least some of the items in the revised schedule could fairly be classified as snagging items;   there was a major dispute (as demonstrated in the evidence of Mr Dobbs of Charter) as to how widespread such items were, and whether in truth, many of the items were more significant than mere snagging.    It was accepted by Mr Sey that these opening up works exacerbated water ingress into the property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 9 September 2002 there was a further meeting between those advising Mr McGlinn.    One of the points noted at that meeting was the “deterioration due to building standing empty”.   Mr Dobbs said that the concern was that Maison d’Or had been sealed up, and really needed to be properly ventilated whilst the building dried out, a point echoed by Mr Sey of Charter during his cross-examination.  Mr Holt agreed that the closing up of the property when it was drying out was a serious mistake.   In addition, it does not seem that any attempt was made to stop water ingress in the few places where it was occurring.  There was also further discussion about the boat standard and what Mr McGlinn thought that he was getting originally.   Following that discussion, Charter were not asked to do any further investigations until well into the following year.   Thus, between September 2002 and July 2003, very little happened at the site.</p>

At this meeting, it is clear that Mr Tanner was passing on specific instructions from Mr McGlinn.  These included potentially significant changes to the design of the existing property, such as a requirement for slimmer window timbers and larger areas of glass.  As a result of this meeting Charter prepared a ‘Schedule of Client’s Requirements’ which talked, for instance, about the possible redesign of the windows and reducing the timber section sizes.</p>

It seemed to me that that was the only fair reading of the minute, a point with which Mr Dobbs agreed.   Mr Sey also agreed that he could see “why it would be read like that”.  On the basis of that evidence, and given the redaction of much of the preceding minute, I find that the only fair inference to draw is that, even at this stage, demolition and rebuilding was already the preferred choice of Mr McGlinn, and that the information-gathering and report-writing exercises were to be carried out with this end in view.   That would be consistent with his wish to have significant elements of the house, like the windows, completely redesigned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Between 2003 and 2004, a full-scale opening up operation took place at Maison d’Or, including the complete stripping of the roof, and the construction of a lay-by at the side of the property to facilitate the works.   These were known collectively as “the enabling works”, although Mr Holt agreed that only the lay-by could truly be called enabling work;  the rest of the work was concerned with the investigation and recording of what was found at the building.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Four points arise from this extensive programme of works.   The first concerns its scale.   Mr Jowett said frankly that he considered that more opening –up work was done than he considered necessary.   I respectfully agree with that view.   At least some of the opening up work seems to me to have been unjustified on any view of the evidence of defects or damage as it then existed.   Mr Sey of Charter said that he had never before taken a house apart in this manner.    Mr Sugg of E. C. Harris confessed that “I have never known a contract like it”, and he was the project manager.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point concerns the purpose of the enabling works themselves.  It is usual, in cases where an employer is concerned about defects in a new or refurbished building, to open up in those areas that have given rise to the original concerns.  For example, if there are leaks below a proprietary roofing system, parts of that system will be opened up to demonstrate whether the roof joints have been properly made, and so on.   But here, considerable opening up works were authorised in areas where there was no, or very little, reason for Mr McGlinn’s team to have even a reasonable suspicion about the work that had been performed.   One example that I take is the roof.   It appears that between 2003 and 2004 the entirety of the roof covering was stripped off, which involved about 10,000 slates on 19 different roof slopes.   And yet, as Mr Sey and Mr Holt of Charter both accepted, there was no evidence that there was one single leak through the slates.    Such extensive opening up work was therefore, on the face of it, both exceptional (which everyone agreed) and, depending on what was found, potentially unjustified.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Sey originally said that one of the principal purposes of the enabling works was to help Mr McGlinn to decide whether Maison d’Or should be repaired or demolished.  Clearly, some of the enabling works, like the construction of the lay-by, did not fall into this category in any event.   And, more widely, it is difficult not to conclude that the focus of Mr McGlinn’s team – and Charter in particular - was on finding defects, even in areas where there had been no problems and no signs of damage.  Thus, by 2004, as these extensive works continued, I consider it unlikely that Mr McGlinn’s team thought that repair of a building that they were pulling apart so thoroughly was a likely option.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The sheer scale of the so-called enabling works can also be measured in monetary terms.   The enabling words, including the £171,543.70 paid to Charter, cost a total of £687,320.36.  That is to be compared with the (largely agreed) maximum base cost of the repair works for all the alleged defects (excluding on-costs and fees) of just £870,066.   It is very difficult to justify spending £687,000 in order to decide whether or not to spend £870,000 on remedial work.   Mr Sey agreed that it seemed “an enormous amount of money to spend”, and that, if the purpose of the enabling works was to decide whether to repair or rebuild, the figure was “unreasonably large”.   Perhaps as a result of this answer, Mr Sey then went on to accept that the main purpose of the enabling works was to obtain and preserve evidence to be used in court proceedings against the Defendants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third issue arising out of the extensive enabling works concerns how they were performed.   I am in no doubt that those works were done carelessly, with no real regard for the materials being removed, and no real thought given to whether or not the elements concerned could be re-used.    In a lengthy passage of cross-examination, Mr Bartlett QC put to Mr Jowett a number of the stills from the videos which demonstrated the careless way in which the extensive opening up work had been done.    Mr Jowett quite properly agreed with the generality of the points that were put to him.    He agreed that the opening up caused “a considerable amount of damage”.   It is impossible to reconcile the destructive way in which this work was carried out with a real desire on the part of Mr McGlinn and his team to repair, rather than demolish, the property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The final point arising from the opening up confirms the previous three.  It arises from the minutes of the meeting held on 2 October 2003, which was immediately before the opening up commenced.  Charter had prepared a document called ‘Scope of Works Overview’ which said that, in respect of each defect, where the remedial option was unclear “the more onerous remedial option has been selected”.  Mr Sey of Charter was asked about this in cross-examination:</p>

In relation to the individual Items in the existing Schedule, it purports to draw a distinction between remedial works on the one hand, and enhancement works on the other.  I note that, at that stage, the proposed change to self-coloured render (Item 1.1.2) and the proposed change from stone to granite (Item 1.2.1) were both considered as an “enhancement”.  Other alleged defects in the present Scott Schedule are also identified in this document as enhancement rather than remedial works.  </p>

During the opening up works, there were meetings at which the condition of the building was considered in some detail.  These meetings were sometimes minuted, and again the minutes confirm that the emphasis was rather more on the demolition and rebuilding option than repair.  Thus, for example, the minutes of the meeting on 4 November 2003 at Camerons’ offices referred to the under floor heating and the tests that had been carried out on it.  The minutes noted that the feedback from those tests was that “the under floor heating cannot sustain an argument for taking all of the heating out”.  Mr Sey accepted that, again, he could understand why that minute would appear to show that Charter and the rest of the team were trying to find reasons for wholesale replacement rather than repair.</p>

He agreed that the reason for the works, and the monitoring system, was ‘to create and preserve evidence for the legal proceedings’.   Many of the sheets themselves were prepared by Mr Holt of Charter, whose only previous experience of working on a luxury house was at Sandbanks, and who had never before assessed a building for a defects claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 5 July 2004, Charter produced a report which identified the defects and the different remedial options.   It appears that the report was based, at least in part, upon other material for which privilege has been claimed. The report was expressly designed to demonstrate that, in respect of particular elements of the construction, the cumulative effect of the matters complained of was such that a point was reached whereby the right remedial scheme was, in fact, to demolish and rebuild the element in question.   As Mr Dobbs put it, “we look at the cumulative effect of one defect on to the next in terms of what [remedial works] might be appropriate”.   As an example, section 1.1 of the report dealt with the external walls.   The numbering is again similar to the Scott Schedule used in the litigation.  Item 1.1.1 dealt with the coping detail;   Item 1.1.2 was the paint finish; Item 1.1.3 was the paint application; and Item 1.1.4 was the render.  Those are all Items alleged against HTA.    The report does not recommend that, in respect of those four particular defects, the walls would have to be taken down and rebuilt.    Instead, piecemeal repairs were suggested.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next Item in the report was Item 1.1.5.   That was concerned with allegedly inadequate wall ties.   It is not an Item alleged against HTA, either then or now.   Having dealt with that Item, the report then stated that partial/piecemeal removal of the external leaf in order to install further wall ties was not an appropriate course and that therefore, in all the circumstances, the walls had to be demolished and rebuilt.  The same approach was recommended in respect of all the subsequent Items in Section 1.1 (Items 1.1.6-1.1.8), which are again not alleged against HTA.   Thus, on the face of the report, it was only those Items which are <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> alleged against HTA that tipped the scales to justify demolition and rebuilding.</p>

The report made it clear that “the process does not make any judgments concerning the financial viability of the remedial works.  The solutions offered are purely driven by the process of arriving at a practical and pragmatic solution to the defect”.  Mr Sey of Charter accepted in cross-examination that Charter did not weigh up the relative advantages of one solution as against the other, and made no recommendation as to what Mr McGlinn’s decision should be when the cost information was taken into account.  Accordingly, the relevant material has to be read as part of a two-stage process:  the Charter report dealing with the defects and the remedial options, and the EC Harris report comparing the costings.  </p>

Whilst it seems to me that this was a risk, I am not persuaded that, in these particular circumstances, it was of great significance, particularly as Mr Sey accepted that, in view of the extensive and intrusive investigations that had already been carried out, the chance of a serious but as yet undiscovered defect emerging during the repair works was relatively small.</p>

In essence, that was a reference to the separate E.C. Harris report on the figures.   That report advised Mr McGlinn that, although the demolition/rebuild option was more expensive than the repair option, there was not very much in it.   Of course, that was the advice then; now, as perhaps might have been anticipated, the rebuild option is valued at £1 million plus <span style="text-decoration:underline">more</span> than the agreed costs of repair.</p>

The precise circumstances in which that decision was taken are shrouded in mystery, which is most unfortunate given the importance of the decision itself in this litigation, and the admission by Mr Sugg, of E. C. Harris, that a decision to demolish a new house would require ‘strong and exceptional circumstances’ to justify it.   Mr McGlinn confirmed that there was no meeting and no minuted discussions relevant to the making of the decision; he agreed that there was no letter, and certainly no reasoned analysis, setting out what factors he had taken into account in deciding to demolish.  The decision itself was apparently communicated orally to Mr Raper, Mr McGlinn’s solicitor, who passed it on to Mr Sugg, the Project Manager in respect of the enabling works at Maison d’Or.   He then told the rest of the team by way of an email dated 18 August 2004.</p>

However in his cross-examination, Mr McGlinn appeared to accept that the only document to which he paid any serious attention was the Charter report of 5 July 2004 (paragraphs 132-135 above) and the costing information produced by E. C. Harris (identified at paragraph 136 above).   Mr McGlinn made clear in his cross-examination that he was not a great reader of reports and that he expected to have the relevant points explained to him orally.   He did not read any of the reports by himself.  Accordingly, it seems to me most unlikely that Mr McGlinn had regard to the full lever arch file worth of material in bundle G15, and much more likely that he simply scanned, or had explained to him, the contents of the Charter report of 5 July and the E.C. Harris costings based on that report.    I therefore find that that was the principal material on which Mr McGlinn relied when he decided to demolish the building.</p>

For reasons which again are not entirely clear, no detailed drawings have been prepared for a new building;  no planning permission has been obtained for a new building;  and no tenders for a new building have yet been sought.  There was even an argument about what the new building will look like, because, although E. C. Harris’ Project Execution Plan of June 2006 emphasised the importance of “contemporary finishes … stainless steel and glass”, Mr McGlinn said in evidence, in an echo of his principal complaint against HTA, that he did not think that this is what he had asked for.  Sadly, therefore, ten years after Mr McGlinn bought the site, Maison d’Or is a foundation slab waiting for something (it is not clear what) to be built on top of it.</p>

These documents are often prepared by the architect; they are effectively a written record of precisely what the employer wants the finished building to achieve.   Even in a contract where there is no contractor’s design, and therefore no need for a contract document formally entitled ‘Employer’s Requirements’, it is usually the case that the employer (or the architect on his behalf) will prepare a written record of what the employer wants.

As construction projects have become more complicated, it has become even more important to ensure that there is one lead consultant who is responsible for the satisfactory implementation of the employer’s requirements.    The lead consultant may, but will not necessarily, be the architect;   the discipline from which the lead consultant is drawn will depend on the type of project and the particular wishes of the employer.  But, whichever professional is appointed to this role, he will usually be engaged by the employer pursuant to a written contract, the terms of which will require him to perform a wide range of duties.   He must generally act as the employer’s agent and do all that he reasonably can to implement the entirety of the employer’s requirements.

Most of the standard forms of contract identify a wide range of tasks which the contract administrator must perform.   It is therefore critical for the lead consultant to ensure that the contract as between the employer and himself incorporates all the obligations which, in its terms, the standard form of building contract assumes have been imposed upon the lead consultant as contract administrator.</p>

So, for example, there is no written or signed-off record of what Mr McGlinn wanted at the outset of the project:  no employer’s requirements, no design brief, no specification.   This has meant that, for example, both prior to the trial and at the trial itself, there was a large amount of debate over the boat standard, whether it formed part of Mr McGlinn’s original requirements and, if it did, what it meant and how it could be implemented.</p>

It is quite extraordinary that a project of this kind was progressed for 3 years, at a cost to Mr McGlinn of £4 million odd, with no concluded building contract in place and uncertainty as to whose job it was to administer that contract on his behalf.</p>

He is recorded as saying that “client dialogue is <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">critical</span> as this appears to be a major failure of the first contract … all design sign-offs and contracts (contractor, consultants etc) need to be in place as this was a principal failing of the ‘first’ contract works”.   Mr McGlinn agreed with that view in cross-examination.  In my judgment, Mr Tanner and Mr McGlinn were quite right:  the absence of any clarity concerning the inter-relationships between the various parties and what they were trying to achieve lies at the heart of this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that the complete absence of any sort of clarity in relation to the appointment of a lead consultant is also significant.   HTA say that they were not the lead consultant for a host of reasons, including a contention that Mr McGlinn forbade them from issuing any binding instructions on his behalf, a point I address in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E3.6</span> below.  They also say that their design responsibility was limited to the shell of the building and did not include the interior, which was solely a matter for TDD.   And from a commonsense perspective, it is rather difficult to imagine how HTA could have been Mr McGlinn’s lead consultant, when he simply did not speak to Mr Thomas for the vast bulk of the time that Waltham was on site.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Clearly, the announcement of the engagement of WL as Project Managers was another factor which emphasises the implausibility of any suggestion that HTA acted as a traditional lead consultant.    How could they be, when they were not the Project Managers?   On the other hand, it was plainly impossible for WL to fulfil any such role themselves, since they had no design function whatsoever and, as I explain in more detail in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section I</span> below, they did not purport to deal with anything other than matters of valuation and payment, and a certain amount of liaison and contractor-chasing.  However, it seems from the agreed bundle that WL did deal with the contract documents:  they prepared and sent the documents to Waltham at the tender stage, wrote the letter of intent in November 1998, and sent the final version of the proposed contract documents to Waltham in 1999.  Responsibility for contractual matters is very often part of the role of the contract administrator/lead consultant.   </p>

To echo a sentiment in Mr Thornton’s witness statement, “there was no overall co-ordination of the contract”.   The absence of the ordinary contract documentation, or any clear chain of command (on or off-site) meant that it was more likely than not that major problems might arise on the Maison d’Or project.    It was simply unclear who would be responsible for what element of the project.  On a related topic, I also find that there was no lead consultant in the conventional sense; all of the professionals were engaged to perform particular tasks, and, in the later sections of this Judgment, I go on to consider in detail the allegations that they failed to perform those tasks with proper skill and care.   But I am in no doubt that, in the round, this cannot be considered a conventional case, and it would be quite unjust to assume that the consultants in this case were responsible for particular functions simply because the obligation in question was one which professionals of their respective disciplines might usually take on.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The relevant events in respect of HTA’s engagement are few in number.   A detailed analysis of them is made more difficult by Mr McGlinn’s poor memory, and the absence of any evidence at all from Mr Thomas himself.    For these reasons, I can make no findings on what might have been said at the meeting between the two men on 8 August 1997, or subsequently.   The following paragraphs are therefore based almost exclusively on the documents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 12 August 1997 Mr Thomas, on behalf of HTA, wrote to Mr McGlinn.  This was at a time when, according to the letter, Mr McGlinn was considering asking HTA to be the architects for what became the Maison d’Or project.   The relevant part of the letter reads as follows:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“As to fees, I have already given you the RIBA Guidance for Clients on Fees booklet, but as you are in France I have also included in this fax some extracts for your ease.”</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">The rest of the letter was principally concerned with the level of fees that HTA might charge as a percentage of the total cost, and the relevant hourly charges for the partner, associate and the like.   There were, however, a number of references in the letter to “RIBA Stages A and B” and “design stages C and D”.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These references were explained by the extracts from the RIBA documentation which Mr Thomas sent with the fax.   It is agreed that these extracts came from the Architect’s Appointment documentation, first produced by the RIBA in 1982 and subsequently updated, most recently in 1990.   Although, by the time the fax was sent, the Architect’s Appointment document had been superseded by SFA/92, it was extracts from the older document which Mr Thomas sent to Mr McGlinn that summer.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should also note that the fax was wrong to suggest that these extracts came from the RIBA Guidance for Clients on Fees booklet, which was an entirely separate document, and which had apparently already been given to Mr McGlinn by Mr Thomas.  As I have already noted, Mr McGlinn could not remember that incident, and the booklet is irrelevant to the issue of HTA’s obligations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The extracts that were sent with the fax are therefore very important.  They comprised Part 1 of the Architect’s Appointment, and Part 4.   Part 4 was solely concerned with the calculation of fees.  Part 1 described the Preliminary and Basic Services which an architect would normally provide.  Thus, Work Stage A is inception and Work Stage B is feasibility:  those are the two preliminary services.   The basic services cover Work Stage C (outline proposals), Work Stage D (scheme design), Work Stage E (detailed design), Work Stages F and G (production information and bills of quantities), Work Stage H (tender action), Work Stage J (project planning), Work Stage K (operations on site) and Work Stage L (completion).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was apparently no further discussion or exchange of letters between anybody at HTA and Mr McGlinn (or anybody on his behalf) as to the precise services which HTA would provide.   It appears that HTA’s fees were calculated in accordance with the Architect’s Appointment:  their invoices (which were the subject of a helpful schedule prepared during the trial by Mr Selby) make a number of references to Work Stages A-G inclusive (ie, from inception down to the production of a detailed design).   It also appears that, once it became apparent that HTA would have to co-ordinate the designs of, for instance, TDD, an additional fee was sought from Mr McGlinn, and paid by him, for that service.</p>

Indeed, it appears that, by 2000, TDD were responsible for all matters concerning the finish and fit-out of the property.   There are numerous examples of TDD giving instructions direct to Waltham without HTA’s knowledge and/or without HTA’s involvement.    Indeed, it appears that, by early 2001, TDD were more concerned that HTA might issue instructions without their approval rather than the other way round:   see paragraph 206 below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is submitted on behalf of Mr McGlinn that the services which HTA were to provide were those that were set out in Part 1 of the Architect’s Appointment document attached to the fax of 12 August 1997.  HTA, on the other hand, say that this fax was simply an indication of the services that an architect might normally provide and that, by sending him this extract, HTA were advising Mr McGlinn that it was in his interests that the appointment should define and record precisely the architectural services to be provided.   They say that, in fact, no contract for these services was ever agreed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that HTA’s pleaded case on this point, supported as it is by no oral evidence whatsoever, is unsustainable.    I find that the sending of the document on 12 August 1997 was a clear indication by Mr Thomas that HTA were proposing to carry out the Work Stages identified in the Architect’s Appointment.   The letter is otherwise meaningless.   The references in the letter to the percentage fees are expressly made by reference to the Work Stages in the Architect’s Appointment, which seems to me to be a clear indication that these would – at least in general terms - be the services that HTA would provide.   If Mr Thomas had wanted to say that the letter should be given a different meaning, he could have given evidence to that effect.  The obvious inference to be drawn from his failure to do so is that such an argument was rightly recognised by HTA as hopeless.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should record that, as a result of his poor memory and his lack of interest in the detail, Mr McGlinn accepted that he was quite unable to say exactly what agreement he had with HTA.   That is one of the reasons why the documents referred to above are so important.    In addition, there are other relevant documents, in the form of HTA’s regular fee notes, which confirm that, generally, HTA were purporting to perform the Work Stages identified in the Architect’s Appointment.   Throughout their involvement on this project, HTA submitted fee notes which made express reference to those Work Stages.  They also wrote letters to other parties, including Centurion, which made express reference to the RIBA fee scales and Work Stages.   In those circumstances, it seems to me that these fee notes and other letters could only have confirmed to Mr McGlinn that HTA were carrying out the services set out in the original document sent on 12 August 1997.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, it is clear that there were certain elements of the Work Stages which HTA were not required to, and did not, perform.    For example, the matters listed at paragraphs 14.1 – 14.4 of HTA’s re-amended defence (paragraph 168 above) were matters which were all dealt with by WL, not HTA.    Accordingly, my general conclusion is that HTA were obliged to carry out the services set out in the Architect’s Appointment, save where it is clear from the evidence that those services were either not required at all or were required to be performed (or were performed) by some other professional or specialist contractor.    Thus, it is appropriate to go on to consider in detail particular aspects of the case against HTA, each of which can be traced back to the uncertainty surrounding their appointment and the services which they were to provide.

Mr Thornton made plain that he always endeavoured to ensure that any completed project on which he worked was to a very high standard, although he said that, in this respect, he did not differentiate between Maison d’Or and any other property on which he might be working.   However, I find that it was clear to HTA from the outset that this was a luxury house, being designed and built for a multi-millionaire, and nobody, certainly not anyone at HTA, can have been under any illusions that the completed work was to be of a very high standard.</p>

That is a difficult question for HTA to answer satisfactorily, given their failure to provide a specification, in which such a standard could have been clearly set out.   The evidence from both Mr Jowett and Mr Salisbury was that, if a very high standard was required, it needed to be spelt out in the specification. Although the Bills contained some provisions relevant to the standard of workmanship (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Section C4</span> above) I consider that these clauses were couched in general terms and did not always clearly set out the very high standards that were required.   Therefore, so it seems to me, the success (or failure) which HTA had in conveying to Waltham the very high standard required has to be judged principally against the finished product; in other words, the lack of a written specification can only emphasise the importance of HTA’s periodic inspections.</p>

Their obligation did not extend to ensuring the completion of a building that was, in every possible way, perfect.    A telling passage of evidence on this topic took place on Day 7, when Mr Thornton was being asked about alleged defects in the joinery in the master bedroom.    He complained at one point that what he was being shown was one saw cut, on one louvre, to one cupboard door in the dressing room.   He said:</p>

First, it was apparent from the evidence of the meeting on 17 May 2002, and a number of the witnesses (including Mr Dobbs of Charter) that a perfect standard of interior fitting and finish could only be provided by boat-fitting specialists, not construction contractors:   see <span style="font-weight:bold">Section C5</span> above.   Neither HTA, nor any of the other consultants, ever made any such arrangements, which indicates that they did not understand that a perfect standard was required.   Secondly, if such a standard had been required by Mr McGlinn, it would have been recorded, because it was so unusual.   It was not.  Thirdly, it would mean that HTA, DJH and WL each fundamentally misunderstood their instructions from the start, and I am not prepared to make such a finding on the evidence.</p>

As he himself agreed in cross-examination, he fully understood the correlation between quality and cost.   The reductions were not inconsistent with the provision of a completed house of a very high standard.   They were, however, inconsistent with the boat standard.</p>

Secondly, as a logical consequence of this, when the complaints were being formulated against HTA, one of the principal criticisms made by Mr Dobbs of Charter, and others, was that “the consultants didn’t pass on the requirements of a ‘boat standard’ finish to the contactor”:   see Charter’s notes of the meeting on 17 May 2002.  This statement incorrectly assumed that Mr McGlinn had asked for the boat standard in the first place.    Accordingly, I consider that, to this extent at least, the benchmark to which Charter and others were working when investigating the building was not entirely correct.  </p>

However, it is equally clear that, following the engagement of DJH (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Section G</span> below) HTA could no longer be regarded as responsible for the structural engineering design and the mechanical and electrical design.  Those were aspects of the design of Maison d’Or for which DJH would be responsible.   HTA retained a responsibility to co-ordinate the DJH structural design, and the DJH M&amp;E design, so as to ensure that it did not clash with their own design work.    But, beyond that straightforward co-ordination obligation, HTA no longer had any primary responsibility for either the structural engineering or the mechanical and electrical aspects of the design process.   </p>

Some of these contained very precise measurements, down to the nearest millimetre.  Although Mr Berryman said that he thought that these drawings would be worked up into other drawings, perhaps by the architect, he agreed that, where the TDD drawings gave measurements in millimetres, those drawings were intended to be followed precisely.  On a number of occasions he said that the TDD drawings were showing the aesthetic detail, rather than construction information, but he agreed that what the architect or builder did with the drawings would be a matter for them.  Mr Berryman also confirmed, by reference to a number of contemporary documents, that TDD issued instructions to HTA which HTA were expected to follow.  He said that all matters of “aesthetics, finishes and layout” came from TDD.  Such instructions were not limited to HTA and Waltham; other documents demonstrated that, for example, Mr Berryman gave direct instructions, on behalf of Mr McGlinn, to the electrical sub-contractors, on an occasion when neither HTA nor WL were present.  Mr Berryman accepted that, on this example, TDD had the authority to give instructions direct to the contractor and would leave it to the contractor to tell the architect what was going on.</p>

This was demonstrated by a fax dated 26 January 2001 from TDD to WL.  In this fax TDD expressed their concern that HTA “do not need our approval for any work carried out on site”.  Mr Berryman confirmed in his evidence that, on anything aesthetic, HTA required TDD’s approval and that included small details like the positions of light switches, or indeed anything else which impinged on any aesthetic considerations.  It seems to me that this is the clearest possible evidence that, in relation to the interiors and finishes of Maison d’Or, it was not HTA who were controlling TDD, but the other way round.</p>

For example, they suggested the replacement of stone in the floor of the garage with durable cobblestone because that would be better able to stand up to leaking petrol.  Mr Berryman accepted that, on that point, therefore, TDD had applied their mind to the technical suitability of the materials, rather than just a matter of aesthetics.

First, it is clear to me that HTA had a similar co-ordination role to that which they performed in respect of the DJH structural and M&amp;E design.    Indeed, from the fee notes submitted by HTA, such as the note dated 1 May 1999, it can be seen that, although Mr McGlinn could not remember it, HTA charged an additional fee for co-ordinating TDD’s interior design with their own design work.  They therefore had an obligation to carry out the co-ordination of TDD’s design with their own with reasonable skill and care.</p>

There was inevitably a blurred line of demarcation between some features of the general design (which were HTA’s responsibility) and aspects of the interiors/finishes (which were TDD’s responsibility).  As the architects, it was HTA’s job to take reasonable steps to check with Waltham that they had all the information they reasonably required relating to any aspect of the interiors/finishes. </p>

First, I do not consider that the omission of the kitchen and fittings meant that the property would simply have been a shell.  Secondly, I note that when that point was put to Mr McGlinn he (not unreasonably) responded that “that was not my intention”.   He wanted a house to live in; that must have included a kitchen.  Thirdly, I find that if HTA had seriously thought that, as a result of the reductions, Maison d’Or was simply going to be a shell, they should have pointed that out expressly to Mr McGlinn at the time.  They did not do so.  </p>

They were, however, responsible for the co-ordination of those three aspects of the design with their own work.   If there was a clash between any of those three aspects of the design, and HTA’s own design work, then HTA had both to point out the clash and, perhaps in conjunction with the other professional involved, they had to endeavour to find a way to resolve it.  This task was particularly important in relation to the interiors/finishes, for the reasons noted above.  They were obliged to carry out their own design work, and their co-ordination role, exercising reasonable skill and care.</p>

Although this case went to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords on a different point, Judge Stabb’s analysis of an architect’s site–based duties is the appropriate starting-point for any consideration of what supervision and inspection might actually involve.    The relevant passages of his judgment are, I think, these:   </p>

In particular the building owner is entitled to expect his architect so to administer the contract and supervise the work, as to ensure, as far as is reasonably possible, that the quality of work matches up to the standard contemplated.    </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">(b)<marker name="tab"/><span style="font-style:italic">Supervision</span>:   The RIBA conditions of engagement state that the architect shall give such periodical supervision and inspection as may be necessary to ensure that the works are being executed in general accordance with the contract, and that constant supervision does not form part of the duties which he undertakes.    It has often recently been said that as the architect now frequently has the power by means of final certificate of freeing the contractor from liability for defects, he, the architect, is required to accept a greater responsibility in his supervisory capacity in the detection of defective work during the progress of the contract.   Mr Simpson agreed that one reason for supervision was to ensure that the defective work was spotted at an early stage, and indeed noted and subsequently reflected in an interim certificate if not previously remedied.    I think that the degree of supervision required of an architect must be governed to some extent by his confidence in the contractor.   If and when something occurs which should indicate to him a lack of competence in the contractor, then, in the interests of his employer, the standard of his supervision should be higher.    No one suggests that the architect is required to tell a contractor how his work is to be done, nor is the architect responsible for the manner in which the contractor does the work.   What his supervisory duty does require of him is to follow the progress of the work and to take steps to see that those works comply with the general requirements of the contract in specification and quality.    If he should fail to exercise his professional care and skill in this respect, he would be liable to his employer for any damage attributable to that failure.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A number of points need to be made about these passages.  First, they are concerned with an architect’s obligation to ‘supervise and inspect’ which is what the old RIBA terms required.    The obligation to supervise has now gone; there is now only an obligation to make periodic inspections.    That is a potentially important reduction in the scope of an architect’s services.    Secondly, Judge Stabb’s comments assumed, quite reasonably, that the architect would be closely involved in the valuation process.    In many modern construction contracts, that is not the case and there can be a blurring of responsibility for interim valuations/certificates as between the architect and the quantity surveyor.    That is a dispute in the present case to which I return below.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In more recent times, the role of the architect in inspecting the work has been the subject of surprisingly few cases.    <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Corfield v Grant</span> [1992] 29 Con LR 58 was a case concerned with supervision, not inspection.    In <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Consarc Design Ltd v Hutch Investments Ltd</span> [2002] 83 Con LR 36, His Honour Judge Bowsher QC, indicated that the obligation to inspect was somewhat vague and it was difficult to know in real terms what was required, although, as he put it, “what is absolutely clear is that the architect does not guarantee that his inspection will reveal or prevent all defective work”.    I respectfully agree with that statement.  I also respectfully agree with Judge Bowsher’s adoption and approval of the relevant passages concerned with inspection in (what is now) the Fifth Edition of <span style="font-weight:bold">Jackson &amp; Powell On Professional Negligence</span> at paragraphs 8-236 to 8-249.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, perhaps the most helpful recent guidance in respect of the duty to inspect can be found in the judgment of His Honour Judge Hicks QC in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">George Fischer Holdings Ltd v Multi Design Consultants Ltd</span> [1998] 61 Con LR 85.    In that case, the consultant with the inspection obligation had defended himself on the basis that, on the balance of probabilities, he would not have seen the defective joints on the roof being formed and, if he had been there, the workmen would have taken particular care to get those particular joints right.    Judge Hicks said:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“That defence fails at every level.    As to missing the relevant phase of the operation, first, it is clear on the evidence that on visits of the frequency and length which Mr Gardner says he carried out elsewhere on site, and even without any special attention to this point, the likelihood is that he would on many occasions have had the opportunity of seeing lap joints formed and sealed.   Secondly, the formation of the joints was so obviously crucial that even if the overall frequency of visits was not increased special attention should have been paid to ensuring that they fully covered this aspect.   But thirdly, since this whole discussion predicates the acceptance by DLE of the very risky and inadvisable inclusion of lap joints in such shallow slopes, it was incumbent upon them to exercise the closest and most rigorous inspection and supervision of the process.  The last point also disposes of the suggestion that workmen will ‘put on a show’ – either they cannot do that all the time, or if they do, that achieves the object anyway.    Moreover it is in any event part of the necessary skill of a competent inspecting officer to detect and make allowances for such behaviour.”</p>

Thus it seems to me that it is not enough for the inspecting professional religiously to carry out an inspection of the work either before or after the fortnightly or monthly site meetings, and not otherwise.    The dates of such site meetings may well have been arranged some time in advance, without any reference to the particular elements of work being progressed on site at the time.    Moreover, if inspections are confined to the fortnightly or monthly site meetings, the contractor will know that, at all other times, his work will effectively remain safe from inspection.</p>

However, it seems to me that such a situation would be unlikely to arise in most cases because, if the inspecting officer is carrying out inspections which are tailored to the nature of the works proceeding on site at any particular time, he will have timed his inspections in such a manner as to avoid affecting the progress of those works.    </p>

That seems to me to be a misconceived approach.  The architect does not guarantee that his inspection will reveal or prevent all defective work:  see <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Corfield v Grant</span>.  It is not appropriate to judge an architect’s performance by the result achieved:  see paragraph 8-238 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Jackson &amp; Powell.</span>    To that extent, therefore, I agree with the points made in paragraphs 49 and 50 of the written opening prepared by Mr Bartlett QC and Mr Hamilton on behalf of HTA.</p>

HTA were obliged to inspect the works being constructed to their design in accordance with these principles.  In respect of the structural works, and the M&amp;E works, HTA’s obligation to inspect was more limited.  It extended to ensuring that any co-ordination issues had been properly dealt with by Waltham, and it might possibly extend to any very obvious errors in the construction of these elements, but it would not be appropriate to impose upon HTA the same inspection obligation in respect of a detailed element of the work designed by, say, the engineer, as for an element of the work which they themselves designed.  It is clear that in the former case, their inspection obligation must have been much less onerous.   In addition, as set out in paragraph 210 above, HTA were obliged to carry out periodic inspections in respect of the interior/finishes, notwithstanding TDD’s primary design obligations.</p>

Mr Thornton said that, in late 2001, the joinery in Bedroom 4 was used as a benchmark for the standard to be achieved, a point that Mr McGlinn confirmed.    Unsurprisingly, therefore, the Scott Schedule contains no express allegations in respect of the joinery in Bedroom 4 and it was not the subject of any oral evidence at all.   However, this argument cannot be taken too far.   I agree with Mr Williamson QC that the decision to use Bedroom 4 in this way arose out of Mr Tanner’s inspection and snagging lists of November 2001, and that, to be effective, this quality benchmark – if that is what it was - should have been established some time earlier.</p>

That includes an analysis of their limited role in respect of the interim valuation/certification process.  As to the overlap between HTA’s periodic inspections and WL’s role, it seems to me that HTA were obliged to point out to WL, the quantity surveyors, particular elements of defective work, depending of course on their significance or importance.  It would always be a question of degree; joinery in one room that exhibited 100 various defects should be pointed out, whilst one saw cut on one louvre on one door would not be.   If the defects were pointed out, it would then be for WL to take appropriate account of them when producing the interim valuations.  Mr Thornton’s evidence was that, when he walked round the site after the site meeting, he was accompanied by Mr Richards and a representative of Waltham, and that, during this walk about, he pointed out areas of defective work which he required the contractor to put right.  He left it to Mr Richards of WL to value, if that was appropriate, those defective works for the purposes of the interim valuations.  It seems to me that, in the circumstances of this case, that was a generally sufficient approach, although I regret the complete absence of any record of these conversations, and I accept that whether or not it was enough in any particular instance might depend on the facts.  It is also a matter of fact as to whether, in any given instance, Mr Thornton actually gave the necessary advice to Mr Richards.</p>

This was a critical period for inspections.  During that period, the inspections by Mr Thornton were monthly and there was no evidence to suggest that they were arranged at a time that was suitable for the particular progress of the works on site.  On the contrary, it appears from his evidence that, in general terms, Mr Thornton routinely made his periodic inspections on the same day as the monthly meeting, and not otherwise.

Accordingly I find that the only relevant periodic inspections were those carried out by Mr Thornton once a month, on the day of the site meeting which had been arranged some time before.

An inspection can only be effective if the inspector clearly identifies what defects he has seen and what he wants done about them.   If there is no record of the matters noted and the directions given, it will almost inevitably create conflict months later, over precisely what was said and when.   The absence of any inspection notes is only one of numerous omissions in the documents kept by HTA: I would certainly have expected to see such records on a project of this sort.</p>

There were a number of important elements of this construction which I find Waltham got wrong, or where they failed to display a proper standard of workmanship and finish.  I have already said that it was a mistake that Mr Thornton, who was neither a partner in, nor associate of HTA, was left to oversee this project almost on his own, and that monthly visits, telegraphed in advance, were an inadequate performance of the inspection function.  It appears from the range of building defects at Maison d’Or that Waltham did not always give this project the care and attention that it deserved and, whilst the standard of much of their work was high, there were important elements of the project where it fell significantly short of what might have been expected.  It was for Mr Thornton to identify those areas and to ensure that they were corrected by Waltham.  In the absence of any written inspection notes or instructions to that effect, it is difficult to say that he fulfilled this general obligation.</p>

But, beyond that, I have concluded that, on the evidence, Mr McGlinn did not impose a blanket ban on HTA issuing any instructions at all to Waltham.  There are three reasons for that.  First, I consider that, if he had issued such a blanket ban, Mr McGlinn would have remembered it and, much more importantly, HTA would have been bound to have recorded it in writing.  They did not do so.  Secondly, if that had been Mr Thomas’ evidence, he could have said so; his failure to give evidence leads me to draw the inference that he could not support such a case.</p>

For the present analysis, I identify four different categories of instruction which were debated in the evidence:  instructions to carry out additional work, as opposed to work that formed part of the contract workscope; instructions that were in writing, as opposed to oral; instructions in respect of the interiors and finishes of the property, as opposed to, for example, the structure or the exterior detailing; and instructions to rectify defective work.  I deal with each of these categories below in a way which I hope explains HTA’s role in relation to the issuing of instructions and the practical limitations that existed upon it.</p>

Whilst it appears that many (but not all) of these instructions were answers to queries and confirmation as to detail, and thus did not involve variations or changes to the design, that was not exclusively so.   Where instructions did involve variations or changes to the design, HTA were obliged to obtain the permission of Mr McGlinn or his representatives before issuing those instructions, although I accept that Mr McGlinn’s physical remoteness from the project, and his refusal to speak directly with Mr Thomas from January 1999 onwards, meant that a certain amount of leeway/discretion was plainly available to HTA in resolving such matters.  They did not have to seek his approval for minor or insignificant variations.  </p>

He said he distinguished between “issuing instructions” on the one hand and “instructing the contractor” on the other hand.  He considered that issuing instructions meant issuing written instructions in the standard RIBA form, which he did not do, whilst instructing the contractor merely involved what he described as “a verbal thing or something that would be brought up in the minutes”.   The suggestion, I think, was that HTA were entitled to give oral instructions to the contractor but, in some way, they could not issue written or formal instructions.  </p>

Either HTA had the authority to issue instructions, or they did not:  the form in which those instructions were issued must be wholly irrelevant.  Indeed, in the present case, the form was clearly immaterial because, although Mr Thornton stuck to HTA’s curious policy of always instructing the contractor verbally, and never issuing formal AI’s, Waltham merely wrote back, confirming in writing his previous verbal instruction.  All of the JCT Standard Forms of Contract make plain that a written confirmation by the contractor of a verbal instruction (if it is not disputed) must be given the same force and effect as if the instruction had been issued by the architect in writing in the first place.  That is, in my judgment, pure common sense.  </p>

Their absence certainly does not demonstrate HTA’s case, such as it is, that they were not empowered to issue such instructions:  for all the reasons that I have set out above, they clearly did have that power and it was a power that they exercised.  Moreover it would be wrong in principle to find that, because there were no formal or written AI’s, HTA must have been prevented from issuing them; taken to its logical conclusion, that would allow any party who had failed to perform a contractual obligation to rely on that failure as irrefutable proof that there was no obligation to undertake the task in the first place.</p>

He was not employed by HTA when the original contractual arrangements were discussed with Mr McGlinn and the meeting in December was really his first involvement on the project.  If he was confused as to the scope of HTA’s role, it was for Mr Thomas, who had been involved in the project since its inception, to deal with any queries.  The view which I have formed from the evidence is that Mr Thornton was left to run this project on behalf of HTA without any proper guidance from Mr Thomas, and I am supported in that view by the inferences that I have drawn from Mr Thomas’ failure to give evidence.</p>

Based on the evidence from Mr McGlinn and Mr Thornton, I have found that the discussion did not result in some sort of blanket ban imposed by Mr McGlinn on HTA issuing instructions to Waltham.    However, as noted in paragraph 203 above, I consider that Mr McGlinn did issue a partial ban, effectively preventing HTA from issuing instructions to the contractor in respect of the interiors/finishes of Maison d’Or.    It seems to me that, even by this stage, Mr McGlinn was unsure about Huw Thomas in particular and HTA in general.    He was, however, sure that Terence Disdale of TDD, who had designed the interior of the Tigre d’Or, was capable of producing interiors which were to his taste.   Therefore, I find that, at that meeting, Mr McGlinn made it clear that HTA were not to issue instructions to the contractors, Waltham, in respect of the interiors/finishes of Maison d’Or.  If Mr Thomas thought that the ban on instructions went wider than that, he was wrong.</p>

As we have seen, all matters relating to the design and finish of the interior of the house were put to TDD for their approval.   In addition, TDD then issued numerous instructions to Waltham as to the design of the interiors/finishes of the house.   No significant instructions in respect of the interiors/finishes were issued by HTA.   Furthermore, when, on occasion, it appeared to TDD that HTA were issuing minor instructions to the contractor in respect of the interiors of the property, they complained and made it quite clear that it was they, not HTA, who had to have the final approval.  They had regular meetings with Waltham at which HTA were not present.  For the reasons that I have already explained, all of this confirms my view that, in respect of the interiors/finishes of the property, it was TDD, not HTA, who were in control of the design of Maison d’Or.</p>

It also means that now, six years later, there is no record of whether Mr Thornton actually did point out some of the matters which constitute the Items in the Scott Schedule.</p>

HTA were empowered to, and did, issue instructions to Waltham, the contractors.   To the extent that HTA pursued a policy of giving those instructions verbally, as opposed to in writing, I find that this was entirely HTA’s choice.   It was not a policy which had, or could have, any legal significance.    I also find that, in general terms, to the extent that variations or changes were being introduced by HTA, they needed the consent, either expressly or impliedly, of Mr McGlinn or his representatives but that, in the particular circumstances of this case, they were entitled to exercise a certain amount of discretion so as not to bother Mr McGlinn or his representatives in respect of minor matters.    </p>

It is quite clear to me that Mr McGlinn wanted this work to be the responsibility of TDD, because he trusted them as a result of their previous involvement on his projects.    Thus, at the meeting on 14 December 1998, it was in respect of the interiors/finishes that he made plain that all instructions were to come from TDD, not HTA.   That, however, was the only ban which Mr McGlinn imposed.</p>

They were not, therefore, themselves required to exercise any independent valuation function.   Furthermore, I should say that it seems to me clear on the evidence that the actual issuing of the interim certificate was irrelevant to Waltham’s cash-flow.    Waltham were not paid on the basis of either the issue or the content of the certificate.   When, in 2000, there was a delay on the part of HTA in issuing interim certificates, Waltham wrote to complain, but only as a matter of good order, and not because it meant that they had not been paid.

It was Mr Thornton’s evidence that, following the site meetings, he walked the site with Mr Richards and did just that.

It was not clear to me to which issue this line of questioning actually went.     However, on the evidence that I heard, it seems to me that Waltham were making their claim for an extension of time to HTA because, in the draft form of contract which they had been sent by WL, HTA were referred to as the architect.     For their part, HTA were not surprised to receive such a request but they appeared to do very little about it.    Mr Thornton said that, when he wrote his response to Waltham (his letter at G5/1575) it was based upon information given to him by WL.    He said he wrote the letter because he was asked to, and he refuted the suggestion that either Waltham or WL thought HTA were dealing with contractual matters.</p>

All of the evidence that I heard suggested that it was for HTA, in the present case, to conclude when Practical Completion had been reached and, when it had been reached, to certify accordingly.    Mr Thornton never at any stage demurred from that proposition.    It seems to me to be the only logical conclusion from the evidence.    Of course, in the present case there was never any Certificate of Practical Completion.    That in turn gives rise to a debate as to the absence of snagging lists issued by HTA to Waltham, a point addressed in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E3.8</span> below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, on this point, I should note that Mr Thornton agreed, when answering questions put to him by Mr Reese QC that, as far as Waltham was concerned, HTA acted as contract administrators.  For the reasons previously noted, this was perhaps unsurprising, given the reference to HTA as architects in the unsigned building contract, and the fact that, as the correspondence demonstrates, there were times during the construction of Maison d’Or when HTA carried out tasks which could fairly be labelled as ‘contract administration’.  But that only takes us so far, because, on other occasions, there were times when WL were also undertaking tasks which could be similarly labelled.   This is all part of the fundamental uncertainly over the contractual arrangements here, a point I have addressed at <span style="font-weight:bold">Section D</span> above, but which is almost completely irrelevant to the pleaded allegations in this trial. However, for the avoidance of doubt, I should make clear that, particularly given the absence of evidence from Mr Thomas, I reject the suggestion that, in some way, HTA’s perception of WL’s role had any relevance to HTA’s performance of their contractual obligations, or any relevance to the allegations with which I have to deal (see also paragraph 764 below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is the usual practice in the UK construction industry, when a building is nearing completion, for the contractor to go through the building carefully and do the best he can to ensure that it complies in all respects with the contract.    He then hands the building over to the architect for snagging purposes.    The architect then undertakes his own careful inspection of the building and records, in a detailed snagging list, all those items which he considers to be patently incomplete or defective.    The contractor is then required to correct all the items on the snagging list.    Once the architect is satisfied that all the items on the snagging list have been corrected, then, unless some other event has intervened, the architect will normally issue a certificate of Practical Completion.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An issue which arose repeatedly throughout the evidence in this case was the extent, if at all, to which an architect was entitled to wait until the contractor’s handover of the building before undertaking a careful inspection and producing a detailed snagging list of the incomplete/defective work.    It seems to me that the answer to this question comes in two parts.   First, there can be no doubt that, if, during an inspection prior to handover/snagging, the architect identifies defective work, then he should point it out to the contractor and require it to be remedied.   The reason for this is succinctly summarised by Judge Stabb in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Sutcliffe</span>.   As he pointed out, if circumstances unexpectedly bring the contract to a premature end before such defects had been remedied, and assuming such defects had not been accounted for in the interim certificates, it would be difficult to see how the architect could avoid responsibility, if any consequential over-payment proves to be irrecoverable from the contractor.   This, of course, links the inspection regime directly to the interim certificate process.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, it seems to me that there would be certain matters which, if they had been or should have been noted by HTA during their periodic inspections, HTA were obliged to point out as the works progressed.  Although in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Sutcliffe</span>, Judge Stabb put this obligation by reference to the interim certificate process, it seems to me that, even without the existence of that process or an architect’s role in it, plain common sense dictates that that is what the inspecting officer should do.   That is what Mr Thornton generally accepted should have been (and was) done in this case.    On the other hand, there are other aspects of this case where I accept Mr Thornton’s evidence that it would have been counter-productive for the inspecting officer repeatedly to point out purported defects in work that was still in the process of being carried out.    Such an approach to temporary disconformities would simply have led the contractor to conclude that the inspecting officer was unreasonable, and would have disrupted the proper progress of the works.    Thus, one of the issues for me, in respect of the Items in the Scott Schedule where a case is advanced against HTA by reference to their failure to inspect properly, is to decide into which of these two categories the particular Item falls. </p>

If, however, such a case had been right, and the property really was “a million miles” from Practical Completion, then the ‘temporary disconformity’ point would inevitably have loomed larger – and been of more assistance to HTA - in any consideration of the Items in the Scott Schedule.</p>

That involvement has almost always arisen when a problem has manifested itself in the building in question, and Mr Jowett and/or his practice have been asked to investigate the defects and suggest remedial solutions.    Accordingly, although he has a wealth of experience in dealing with potentially defective buildings, Mr Jowett has rather less experience of practical day-to-day architecture.    He has not, for instance, ever been the designer or the inspecting officer on a project of this sort.  That factor is reflected in certain of my findings in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section F2</span> below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A related point concerns the architectural standards which Mr Jowett has sought to impose, retrospectively, on HTA and their performance.    Although much of his approach is soundly based on British Standards and other technical documents, there are some passages in his report which demonstrate what I consider to be a slightly unrealistic approach to ordinary architectural standards.    I consider that some of the criticisms that he has made of HTA spring from his unfairly onerous view of the standard to be expected of an ordinarily competent architect. </p>

As noted above, the defects and the basic criticisms were identified by Charter during the extensive opening up exercise, and given a Scott Schedule number.    It was then apparently Mr Jowett’s job to consider and, where possible, support those criticisms in his report.   I have the impression that this chronology explains the inclusion within the Scott Schedule, and subsequently Mr Jowett’s report, of criticisms of HTA which were, on any fair view, unjustified.   </p>

Whilst of course I accept that, in a case of this sort, it is quite impossible for an expert in Mr Salisbury’s position to see and take on board the contents of every document, there were in the present case a number of important documents generated before and after the building contract, many of which were expressly referred to in the Scott Schedule, which Mr Salisbury really had to see and digest in order to form a view as to the allegations against HTA.    His failure to consider such documents, and his dogged reliance instead on what he repeatedly referred to as “my instructions” meant that there were times when Mr Salisbury was dealing with a completely different case to that which had been pleaded and advanced by the Claimant in the Scott Schedule.    </p>

Although these answers were contradicted by Mr Salisbury’s earlier evidence, and in certain instances, by his answers in re-examination, I have to consider very carefully the unqualified admissions made by HTA’s own expert.    </p>

These Items arise in this way.    Within the groupings of Items within the Scott Schedule, there are particular Items which are said to have required extensive remedial work. They are the so-called Lead Items.   If remedial work had been carried out to rectify a particular Lead Item, such work would inevitably also have made good a series of other defects in the building, which are pleaded by way of other Items, sometimes in other parts of the Schedule.   In some instances, only the Lead Items have been costed.   Other (non-Lead) Items were not separately costed in the Scott Schedule, because they were said to be included within the Lead Item, although some extrapolated costings were provided as part of the Claimant’s closing submissions.   </p>

If I concluded that that Item was the responsibility of HTA, and that HTA are liable either for the rebuild or repair cost of that Item, then, on the Claimant’s case, my findings on Items 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 become irrelevant, because all those Items would have been made good by the repair/rebuild work said to be necessary under Item 1.2.3.    However, if I rejected Item 1.2.3 (either as to liability or causation or on the basis that the remedial scheme proposed is unreasonable or unjustified), but found for Mr McGlinn on other Category 1.1 or 1.2 Items, there was a potential difficulty in arriving at an appropriate figure for damages, because none had been separately pleaded.

On the one hand, I have been critical of certain aspects of the inspection regime adopted by Mr Thornton of HTA:  see <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E3.5</span> above.  But I am also conscious that some of the allegations of defective inspection set out in the Scott Schedule arise out of Items where Mr McGlinn plainly had a very strong case against Waltham for bad workmanship, but where, with the best will in the world, it is much more difficult to say that an ordinarily competent architect should have picked up on the defect in question during his periodic inspections.  In other words, I have endeavoured not to lose touch with reality; the mere fact that the contractor would have been found liable for an item of defective workmanship does not automatically mean that there is a sustainable case against the architect for failing properly to inspect.</p>

I consider that this agreement must have made plain to HTA that there was a case for them to answer on the point, but it was not addressed in Mr Thornton’s second statement, prepared just a few days before the start of the trial, nor was it satisfactorily dealt with by Mr Salisbury.   HTA are therefore liable for this defect too.</p>

There was no specific evidence as to whether or not it was possible to reposition the copings but it seemed to me to be doubtful.   I also note that, in connection with this specific item, Mr Salisbury accepted that, on a new building of this kind, this type of defective work should be remedied so as to achieve a proper standard, regardless of whether there is actual damage.   Whilst I consider that such a proposition is a matter of fact and degree, and must always depend on the defect in question, I conclude that it is applicable to copings protecting the top of the external walls of the house itself: there was at least a risk of water penetration in the future, and that clearly justified remedial work.</p>

However, for completeness, I should say that, in my judgment, there was little evidence that the defects in the design and construction of the copings had caused any damage prior to demolition.  If water had been getting in at the coping level, the render immediately below the coping would demonstrate signs of water penetration.    No such water penetration is apparent from the photographs and there are no protimeter or other readings which would demonstrate that water had been getting in at that location.   </p>

It is his case that he wanted self-coloured render, so that the fact that HTA specified paint on a sand/cement render – and that is what was constructed - constituted a breach of contract on their part.    Although the pleaded allegation was confined to the simple point that HTA had made an unauthorised change to the agreed workscope, there was throughout the trial a suggestion that the paint that was specified was somehow itself deficient.    I am not persuaded that this allegation has been properly pleaded by the Claimant in the Scott Schedule.    However, in view of the evidence that I heard and the firm views I have reached on the point, I deal with that additional allegation below.    </p>

That explains why the absence of self-coloured render was not raised as a complaint by Mr Tanner in the second half of 2001, or in his comments upon the Charter Schedule the following spring (paragraph 110 above) and, even more tellingly, why the first suggestion for self-coloured render was properly described by Charter as an ‘enhancement’ (see paragraph 128 above).</p>

The weight of all the rest of the evidence is contrary to such an assertion, and the inference that I am asked to draw arising from the failure to call Mr Thomas cannot alter my conclusion.   I therefore reject the allegation that HTA made an unauthorised change to the workscope instructed by Mr McGlinn.</p>

If there is no technical or aesthetic difference between self-coloured render and painted render (and no-one suggested that there was), then I would not have concluded that Mr McGlinn was entitled to the cost of re-rendering all the walls.   That would have been out of all proportion to the breach;   in accordance with the principle in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ruxley Electronics v Forsyth</span> [1996] A.C.344<marker name="tab"/>discussed at paragraphs 789 and 791 below, I would have found that only nominal damages were recoverable as a result of any breach.</p>

Indeed, there was really no evidence to suggest that the paint was not suitable.     Mr Jowett’s complaint was not about the type of paint, but the way in which it had been applied.   He said “whichever paint it was, it was put on too thin”.   That is a separate issue, dealt with under Item 1.1.3 below.  Accordingly, I conclude on the evidence that the paint identified by HTA for use at Maison d’Or was suitable and appropriate.    I therefore reject Item 1.1.2 against HTA.</p>

Accordingly, the question for the Court under Item 1.1.3 was whether or not Waltham’s failure to apply the paint properly was something which HTA should have seen on their periodic inspections.    Thus, this is the first of the allegations in the Scott Schedule where the contractor (thief) was obviously liable but where, for economic reasons, Mr McGlinn needs to get home against the architect (policeman) instead.</p>

The criticism of HTA is that a three coat render should have been specified.   The dispute was therefore whether two or three coats of render should have been specified by HTA; that issue in turn centred on whether or not this was a severely exposed site, either in accordance with the British Standards, or at all.    Mr Jowett, on behalf of the Claimant said that it was;    Mr Salisbury, on behalf of HTA, said that it was not.    It is accepted that, if the site was not severely exposed, three coats of render would have been unnecessary, and would not have constituted a breach of contract on the part of HTA.</p>

It is clear from the documents produced by Charter between 2002 and 2004 (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Section C14</span> above) that Charter advised that specific criticisms could be made of the design/specification of Maison d’Or because, in their view, the site was severely exposed and insufficient allowance had been made for that fact.   It appears from the evidence that this element of Charter’s investigations amounted to no more than an assertion by them that the site was exposed;   the Charter witnesses agreed with Mr Bartlett QC in cross-examination that they had undertaken no calculations themselves in accordance with the British Standards in order to determine the exposure rating.</p>

As I have previously noted, that view accorded with the views of Mr Salisbury.    In assessing whether or not that was a proper view, I am hampered by the fact that I have not been to the site and never saw the house when it was built.  However, on the evidence, I could understand why an architect, using his experience and professional judgment, might conclude that the site was not severely exposed, because of the surrounding slope, the trees and mature shrubs, and the other buildings in the vicinity.    On the other hand, I could also see that an architect might be concerned by the fact that the site was close to the sea, on a hill above a harbour. </p>

Those would then be circumstances in which the architect might positively conclude that he needed to do a more detailed assessment in accordance with the British Standards.   Whilst it appears from the evidence that this was not something that an architect would always do (indeed, it would be quite rare) it seems to me that the competing factors in relation to this site were such that an architect, acting reasonably, might well have undertaken such an assessment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider that this is a fair reading of BS 5262.  Importantly, paragraph 19 stipulates that three coats of render are necessary only where the wall in question is “dependent upon the rendering for protection”.     That makes sense, because it is a BS concerned with rendering.   But the walls of Maison d’Or were <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> dependent on render to keep out the rain.   Mr Jowett expressly accepted that an unpainted, unrendered cavity wall was considered in Jersey to be suitable to keep out the rain from the building; as Mr Salisbury put it, the walls of Maison d’Or would have performed quite satisfactorily without any render at all. The cavity construction of the walls formed the essential element of protection; to that extent, the render was simply a bonus.</p>

However, an equivalent answer can be found by reference to the other relevant British Standard, namely BS 8104.  That identifies a methodology in which exposure can be calculated.    Mr Jowett followed that methodology to arrive at the conclusion that just one wall, the south wall of Maison d’Or, fell within the definition of severely exposed.    He achieved that by incorporating into his calculation the most extreme ‘terrain roughness’ rating and the most extreme ‘obstruction’ rating.</p>

It is quite plain from the accompanying photographs in BS 8104 that this is a category applicable to flat, wind-swept coastal locations with no surrounding buildings, trees or slopes.    It is simply impossible to say that the location of Maison d’Or fits within that description, given the contours of the ground around it, and the sheltering buildings and trees on either side and behind it.    </p>

He said that he did not think it appropriate to rely on the trees around the property because they might be removed at any time.    Again, I am bound to reject such a contention.    Indeed, paragraph 5.2.7 of the BS expressly provides that trees should be taken into account in calculating the obstruction factor.    It is therefore contrary to BS 8104 to ignore the presence of trees in the calculation of the exposure rating of the site.    </p>

It seems to me that an initial assessment of this site might have led a reasonably competent architect to conclude that the site might be severely exposed, or that it might not be:   that assessment would be a matter of professional judgment, and not (except in extreme circumstances) the proper subject matter of an allegation of professional negligence.  The reasonably competent architect may then have concluded that he should refer to the two appropriate British Standards; reference to either, for the reasons set out above, would have demonstrated that the Maison d’Or site was not severely exposed, and that therefore there was no requirement under the British Standards for there to be three coats of render. Thus, HTA’s specification of two coats was not a breach of contract; indeed, it was, in my view, the right technical solution. In those circumstances, of course, it matters not that HTA did not do a detailed assessment of the exposure rating.  </p>

Further confirmation of that, were it needed, can be found in the complete failure on the part of Mr McGlinn (or his representatives) to complain about the use of Haddonstone.   Instead, Mr Disdale approved the colour of the reconstituted stone on Mr McGlinn’s behalf, and Mr Tanner never gave the matter any thought at all. Much later, when it was the subject of the Charter investigations, the proposed change back to granite was properly described as an ‘enhancement’ (paragraph 128 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jowett accepted that reconstituted stone was widely used for the kind of decorative features for which it was utilised at Maison d’Or.   He also accepted that Haddonstone was a well-known manufacturer of reconstituted stone products, and that Haddonstone was used on Grade I and National Trust properties.   Accordingly,   Mr Jowett’s criticism was limited to the narrow point that the architect should have specified that the Haddonstone had to comply with the ISAT surface absorption test.   I consider that this was an example of an Item where Mr Jowett’s criticism was unrealistic, particularly as he himself had never before even specified the use of Haddonstone.  There was nothing to suggest that the ISAT test was known to architects of ordinary competence and experience.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event Mr Jowett was cross-examined about the STATS report that was concerned with certain samples of Haddonstone which they had tested, and to which he had referred at paragraph 6.1.27 of his report.  The report stated that the porosity of the Haddonstone product was presumably intentional, in order to simulate the surface texture of Portland stone.     It also stated that this variability in surface absorption almost certainly explained the patchy appearance that had been reported in the stone in wet weather and thereafter during the drying period.    The text of BS 1217 was then put to Mr Jowett because that made plain that capillary absorption testing was suitable for cast stone products intended to exhibit weathered surfaces within the same time scale as many natural stones, whereas the ISAT test was more suitable for products with a denser surface, intended to maintain its initial appearance over many years.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In other words, it was put to Mr Jowett that the Haddonstone used on Maison d’Or satisfied the relevant test, which was the capillary absorption test, because what mattered was Mr McGlinn’s requirement for a weathered and aged look.   The ISAT test was therefore irrelevant, because it was designed to test for something that Mr McGlinn had said he did not want, namely an appearance that did not age. Mr Jowett accepted that if Mr McGlinn wanted the aged appearance, that proposition was correct.    However he maintained his view that the reconstituted stone had a very poor appearance.</p>

It is just that everybody is not a fussy architect like me …  I am not sure that any architect could be reasonably expected to know it has a patchy appearance.   I have looked at the Haddonstone information and it does not say on its face ‘watch out, this material has a patchy appearance’.    It says nothing of that kind whatsoever.    Nevertheless, Haddonstone is a very widely specified building product that finds acceptance with contractors, builders, clients, up and down the country.  So it is difficult to agree with Mr Jowett.   I suspect that Mr Jowett does not like Haddonstone;   neither do I much, frankly, but that is not quite the point.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, Mr Jowett’s criticisms of HTA in respect of Item 1.2.2 were unrealistic and unfair, for the following reasons.    First, I consider that, if an architect is specifying a reputable product such as Haddonstone, the identification of the required product is sufficient for specification purposes.    It is unnecessary for an architect to specify the product of a reputable well-known manufacturer, and then go on to stipulate that the materials supplied then had to comply with various British Standards or other tests.     Although there was no specification as such, for which HTA can be rightly criticised, any specification on this point would simply have referred to the requirement to use the Haddonstone product, which is what Waltham did.   So, in respect of this Item at least, nothing turns on the lack of a written specification.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, if I am wrong about that, and HTA should have sat down with the British Standards and worked out what tests they wanted the Haddonstone to comply with, they would have concluded that, because of Mr McGlinn’s desire for an aged appearance, it was the capillary absorption test that mattered, not the ISAT testing.  They would therefore have acted quite reasonably in not specifying compliance with the ISAT test in any event.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further and in any event, I consider that, from the photographs and other evidence, the patchy appearance that can be seen in the Haddonstone as it dries out is very similar to the look of ordinary stone in such conditions.   Natural materials like stone tend to have a patchy appearance when they dry out; thus, to that extent, the Haddonstone was simply reflecting the natural elements, like stone, which Mr McGlinn had emphasised to HTA.   That is a yet further reason why I do not consider that this Item is a justifiable criticism of HTA.    </p>

However, this conclusion does not make any difference to the result because, in my judgment, it was in any event unreasonable to contend that the small repairs that existed on the stone columns should lead to the complete replacement of those columns.    Whilst, as I have already said, the existence of a defect in a house of this kind (no matter how small) will often entitle the employer to complete replacement of the item in question, whether or not there is damage, this will always be a matter of fact and degree.

Alternatively, they should have produced a specification which required compliance with the relevant part of BS 5390.    They did neither. </p>

It was said that they failed to comply with BS 5628 and BS 5390 in consequence.  The principal defence mounted by HTA in relation to this item was that, because the rectangular projection was so small (10 mm or so) the weathering would have made no difference: such a detail was said to be impractical for these stones.    </p>

However, the fact remains that Haddonstone products are marketed on the basis that they have an upper sloping edge which could serve a weathering purpose in accordance with the BS, and yet the stone specified by HTA here had no such weathering.</p>

Dealing first with the lintels, there is no evidence that the absence of a drip in the lintels caused any damage at all, let alone water ingress into the building.   Furthermore, there was some evidence that a groove could have been cut in the lintels to form the missing drip, although it was agreed that this would not be at all straightforward.    Looking at the lintel point in isolation, it is plainly fanciful to suggest that the entirety of the external walls in the building had to be torn down and rebuilt, simply so that lintels with the necessary drip or groove could be installed above the windows.  On the other hand, lintels with drips were required, whether they were new lintels or modified existing lintels. </p>

Again there were no protimeter readings or any other analysis which demonstrated that water had got in behind the stone.   Indeed, in my judgment, it was at this point that the small size of the projection became relevant, because Mr Salisbury demonstrated effectively that, on a projecting ledge 10 mm wide, the rainfall would not be retained on such a surface, and would not therefore penetrate behind the stone (see in particular his sketch at D2/5940). At most, there was a slight risk of increased water penetration as a result of the absence of the weathering.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was some evidence of paint peeling by 2002 (see paragraphs 321-322 above).    The experts were agreed that the paint was peeling chiefly in areas about 1 metre below the horizontal copings and about 1 metre away from the vertical stone string courses down the edge of the wall.   In other words, the peeling was not immediately below the copings or immediately next to the string courses and quoins, but was instead some way from both, although still recognisably towards the corners.    Mr Salisbury explained that this was because, when working with render, the labourer has to be very careful when approaching the corners and that, very often, he reworks the render too much in those areas, with the result that the paint does not properly adhere to the reworked or over-worked render.    It seems to me that that explanation fits precisely with the areas of peeling paint work that can be seen in the photographs and videos at Maison d’Or.   The locations of the peeling paint are not consistent with any significant water penetration in the areas of the horizontal ledges.</p>

Superficially, the patchy appearance could be overcome by painting, but this would change the appearance from stone to paint and an essential feature of the intended design would be lost.   Furthermore, the absence of weathering details in the reconstituted stone elements would be likely to seriously impair the durability of such paintwork.   Similarly, a clear waterproof coating could be applied to the reconstituted stone which initially might give it a more consistent appearance, but any moisture retained in the stonework or gaining entry through the interfaces between units or between units and the rendered areas would then tend to cause a “bloom” to appear on the surface as salts in the construction drawn to the stone surface beneath the applied coating.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These paragraphs raise a variety of questions.   It was unclear what precisely Mr Jowett meant by “the deficiencies identified”.   When asked about that in cross-examination, he appeared to say that, at the very least, he included both Items 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, and that this was his conclusion as a result of the cumulative effect of these two Items.   Of course, as noted above, I have rejected the allegation against HTA at Item 1.2.2.  That was obviously an important element of the advice in Mr Jowett’s report at paragraphs 6.1.37 and 6.1.38 (hence his repeated references to the appearance of the stone).  Moreover, it is clear from paragraph 6.0.2.2 of his report (paragraph 276 above) that the taking down of the external walls was only justified, on his analysis, because the wall defects had to be taken together with the various allegations concerning the windows (Category 2 in the Scott Schedule). However, for the reasons set out in detail below, I have rejected each of the major window Items against HTA. There is therefore no evidence at all from Mr Jowett, or indeed from anybody else, that Item 1.2.3 <span style="text-decoration:underline">on its own</span>, justified the demolition of all the external walls: indeed, it is clear that, taken in isolation, even on Mr Jowett’s case, it could not do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">More importantly still, because I have rejected the suggestion that this Item gave rise to any actual damage, or anything other than a slightly increased risk of water penetration, the basic assumptions behind these paragraphs of Mr Jowett’s report must fall away. Indeed, it is clear from the evidence, both in relation to the external walls generally, and Item 1.2.3 in particular, that it would be absurd to suggest that, because of the absence of weathering on a 10 mm decorative projection, which caused and would have caused no significant damage, the entirety of the external walls must be demolished and rebuilt.   Such a suggestion offends against common sense.   A reasonable and prudent house owner, when given the facts about the protruding edge, would clearly want to do what he could to protect himself from possible future problems, even if he had been told that the risk of such problems was small.   But no house owner would agree to the complete demolition of the external walls of his house, with all the attendant mayhem that that would involve, simply because the decorative stone banding had not been weathered and the lintels did not have drips.</p>

I consider that that is a fair reading of that part of Mr Jowett’s evidence.   For the reasons that I have explained, I consider that Mr Jowett was right to believe that such a remedy might be out of all proportion to the problem; in my judgment, it plainly was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have already noted, Item 1.2.3 is a Lead Item.    There was no evidence from either Mr Jowett, or Mr Fitch, the quantum expert, that either of them had advised or suggested that Item 1.2.3 should be presented as such.  For the reasons which I have explored above, I consider that it should not have been a Lead Item, because it was principally concerned with a relatively minor defect in a decorative element of the external walls and the lintels above the windows.    For the reasons which I have given, I reject the suggestion that such a defect justifies the complete demolition and rebuilding of the external walls.    It patently does not.  Further confirmation of that, were it required, can be seen in Mr Fitch’s build-up sheet for this Item (D5/1228) which, even on the Claimant’s case, includes numerous elements of work which are plainly unconnected to the remedial work required for this Item. This finding, therefore, gives rise to a particularly difficult question as to the assessment of loss.   I come back to that in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section L2.2</span> below.</p>

First, that, on the southern and north eastern gables, abutting the turret roofs, galvanised straps were specified and the fixings should instead have been stainless steel.   There were just three such straps in total.  The second complaint is that, on some of the sloping gables, where the slope was long and the horizontal run short, there was no mechanical restraint.</p>

Mr Salisbury demonstrated, by reference to the mass of the horizontal coping in his sketch at D2/581, that there would be no lateral movement in these locations.

Unfortunately, this was not pleaded in the Scott Schedule, and was therefore not a matter which was the subject of the expert’s agreement.  However, on proper analysis, it seems to me that it could not possibly be said that this one-off error was something which HTA should have spotted on their periodic inspections.    This was one small area of a large site where the insulation board would have either been put in (or omitted) quickly, and the relevant area then covered up.    I reject the suggestion that this defect can therefore be the liability of HTA.  </p>

The Jersey Byelaws stipulated that the railings had to be at least 1,100 mm in height.    If the top of the railings on balcony 2 was measured from the paving level of the balcony, it was in excess of 1,100 mm; as a result, the experts have agreed that “the balustrade height … was adequate in relation to the paving level of the balcony surface.”    However, because the railings were set into a plinth, the Claimant’s argument is that the plinth should be ignored for measurement purposes.   It was agreed that the balustrade height was “inadequate if the plinth was taken to be the finished floor level.”    </p>

It seems to me clear that anybody standing on the paving level of the balcony would not be in danger of falling over the top of the railings, because the height of the top of the railings from the floor level of the balcony was well in excess of the stipulated 1,100 mm.   For a person to be in any danger when standing on that balcony, they would actually have to step up onto the plinth in which the railings are set.    I consider that this would be the equivalent of someone starting to climb up decorative wrought-iron railings. It would take the situation outside that contemplated by the Bye-Laws.</p>

First, it is not entirely clear how widespread this alleged defect was.    Mr Salisbury only inspected the one window section in the possession of Bickerdike Allen, where a hard setting glazing compound had been used.   Perhaps more importantly, there was no evidence of any significant leakage through or around the glazing compound that was used; at the most, one window in one photograph may have leaked through the compound.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first allegation against HTA is in respect of their design.    It is said that the HTA drawings provided considerable detail in relation to the windows and French doors, but they gave no details as to the precise method of glazing, and thus there was no specification of a suitable sealant in accordance with BS 8000:   Part 7.    I consider that these criticisms are unfair.    Mr Jowett accepted that, by reference to the British Standards, the choice of window sealant is regarded as a workmanship issue, rather than a matter of design.    Therefore, it seems to me that it was a matter for Waltham or, more importantly, their joinery sub-contractor, to ensure that the windows were properly made using an appropriate sealant.    A reasonably competent architect would not specify the precise make or type of sealant to be used; that would be a matter for the specialist joinery sub-contractor.  Indeed, I formed the impression that this allegation had only been made against HTA because of the unusual amount of detail that had been otherwise included in their window drawings, the suggestion being that, because HTA had gone further than an architect might normally go in providing window details, they should also have specified the precise sealant to be used, however unusual that might be. I do not consider that this was a fair or reasonable basis on which to found an allegation of professional negligence.</p>

But, because I accept the proposition that the choice of the appropriate sealant was a matter for Waltham, I do not, in this instance, regard the absence of a specification of a particular sealant as a breach of contract on the part of HTA.   However, even assuming that I am wrong about that, and the mere absence of a written specification was a breach of contract by HTA, I am in no doubt that it was not causative of any loss, because, regardless of HTA’s omission, an appropriate specification was provided to Waltham in any event. </p>

That is because there was no proper evidence of any actual or imminent water ingress through the French doors or windows, much less any evidence of ingress because a hard setting compound, rather than a moisture vapour permeable sealant, had been used.     With the exception of one stained window sill, the cause of which was entirely unclear, there were no photographs of leaks in and around the windows.     In addition, I find that there was nothing to suggest that there was any real risk of leakage in the future as a result of the choice of the hard setting compound by Waltham’s joinery sub-contractor.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jowett’s evidence on this topic was revealing.   Having admitted that ‘any water ingress owing to the contractor’s use of the wrong sealant [was] very minor,’ he endeavoured to emphasise the risk of possible leakage in the future.   However, when he was cross-examined on the point, he reverted to his fundamental argument that, because this was a high quality house, anything that might be regarded as defective has to be replaced or done again.    He said “even a small amount of leakage would be regarded as completely unacceptable …” I reject that argument on the facts of this Item for the reasons set out above; there was no evidence of any leakage, actual or prospective. Furthermore, in contrast to some of the earlier Items, I conclude on all the evidence that there was nothing to suggest even a slightly increased risk of water penetration around the windows as a result of the choice of a hard setting compound.</p>

This was important evidence, because TDD’s principal business concerned the fitting-out of luxury yachts; therefore, it might be thought that Mr Berryman’s knowledge and experience of appropriate ironmongery for ocean-going vessels was of some considerable relevance to the allegation that lacquered brass was unsuitable for a marine location.</p>

Neither is there any British Standard or other published recommendation with which it is said the lacquered brass at Maison d’Or failed to comply.    Given the evidence of Mr Thornton and Mr Berryman, it is difficult to see how this alleged breach of contract can be made out against HTA.   The Claimant’s closing submissions say that the ironmongery was “obviously unsuitable” but in truth the only evidence relied on is that of Mr Jowett, who had much less experience of the use of lacquered brass in a marine environment than Mr Berryman.   In my judgment, HTA acted reasonably. They specified internal ironmongery of a type used by a specialist interior designer of luxury boats.    They sought and obtained the approval of that ironmongery by that interior designer.    In those circumstances, I do not consider that there is any basis for suggesting HTA were in breach of contract.    </p>

Again, Mr Jowett accepted that there was no British Standard that stated that the straps had to be stainless steel rather than galvanised; on the contrary, he accepted that galvanised steel straps were commonly used to fix windows.   Again, therefore, I do not consider that HTA were in breach of contract because they approved Waltham’s use of galvanised straps.    </p>

Mr Jowett said that some straps that he had seen were marked with superficial rust.    Mr Salisbury said that, in one of the videos, you could see some of the windows piled up where the straps were “bright”, and therefore uncorroded.    I must say that, in my view, the few photographs of corrosion scattered throughout the bundles were unimpressive.    Thus, taking that evidence together, I find that the straps were not significantly corroded and many (perhaps most) were not corroded at all.    I therefore find that the performance and reliability of the windows would not have been affected by the fact that the straps were galvanised rather than stainless steel.    </p>

Mr Jowett defended the pleaded case that the windows had to be taken out, but he made clear that that was only if it could be shown that it was likely that the windows were rendered unreliable by the galvanised steel straps.    If they were not unreliable, therefore, it was unreasonable – even on Mr Jowett’s view - for the windows to be taken out.  </p>

This is an important conclusion, not only in relation to this Item, but because success on this point was a necessary ingredient of Mr Jowett’s view as to the need to demolish the external walls (see paragraph 6.0.2.2 of his report).    </p>

I take that to mean that HTA should have done something positive well before the end of 2001 to get those windows replaced.   In my judgment, that is what should have happened.   It is clear that the two windows in question were unacceptable and would always have had to be replaced.   There was simply no point in waiting until the handover/snagging process before HTA condemned these windows:   for the reasons set out at length in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E3.8</span> above, when faced with work that was plainly defective but purportedly finished, as these windows were, HTA should have condemned them well before the end of 2001.</p>

Mr Jowett properly said, at paragraph 6.2.35 of his report, that, apart from the two instances of shakes, “the remaining deficiencies were generally of a type which might be called snagging defects, in that they would probably have been capable of in situ remedy and making good”.   This seems to me to be a clear statement that the other deficiencies in the timber were matters which could properly – indeed should properly – have been left by HTA to the snagging/handover process.    In those circumstances, it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to criticise HTA as a result of the existence of those items.</p>

They say that this view has to be read in the context of Mr Jowett’s evidence as a whole, and his emphasis on the need for proper snagging lists and the like.   However, in my judgment, this argument ignores the fundamental point that these were matters which, in accordance with the principles outlined in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E3.8</span> above, HTA were entitled to leave to Waltham until the snagging/handover process, because they had not yet been completed.   Since the snagging/handover process had not even started, HTA cannot be criticised for the absence of proper snagging lists.  Thus the argument at paragraph 328 does not bite.</p>

I address below, under Item 2.2.3, the use of idigbo where, amongst other things, I conclude that idigbo was a high quality material that was suitable for use at Maison d’Or.  Thus the failure on the part of HTA (if that is what it was), to produce a written specification for a high quality timber for use at the house, was rendered irrelevant by their approval of idigbo.  For all these reasons, therefore, I consider that the allegation in relation to the words “wrot oak” in the Bills ultimately went nowhere.</p>

The Scott Schedule operates on the assumption that it would have been rectified automatically if Item 2.1.1 (the glazing compound allegation) had been made out against HTA and had justified the complete replacement of the windows and French doors.   Since, for the reasons set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight:bold">F2.15</span> above, the Claimant’s case on Item 2.1.1 has failed, it is irrelevant for the purposes of quantification.    Thus the Claimant now has a difficulty because, even if, contrary to my findings, I had concluded that HTA were in breach of contract in respect of all the elements of Item 2.2.1, there is no identifiable remedial work to which a damages figure could attach.    The same problem applies specifically to the replacement of the two windows with shakes, which I have found to be the limit of HTA’s liability. I return to that point in paragraph 857 below.</p>

But the idigbo looked the same as oak and, as the experts have agreed, was technically suitable.

The Claimant relied principally upon three photographs taken in the summer of 2002 which allegedly showed some pyrites staining on some slates on two of the 19 roof slopes.    Mr Salisbury, rather surprisingly, then identified some more photographs which he said were relevant.   But there is no clear record of the extent of the pyrites staining at the time the roof was removed, either in respect of the whole roof, or its individual slopes.  The best, I think, that can be said is that there was some staining on most slopes by 2004.</p>

During his cross-examination, the Claimant’s pleaded case as to the failure to provide an adequate specification was put to Mr Jowett, in the light of his view that the specification of the slates in March 2000, in the terms of the Waltham letter, was satisfactory (paragraph 478 above).

I think it is fanciful to suggest that HTA should have required the slates to be the subject of water absorption or bending strength tests.    These were slates which were, on the face of it, appropriate, being supplied by reputable suppliers and with the benefit of a proper guarantee.    I think it is artificial to conclude that HTA should have done more in relation to the specification of these slates.   The problem concerned the quality of the particular batches of slates that were supplied.   As against HTA, that can only be an issue of inspection.</p>

It appeared to be part of the Claimant’s case during the cross-examination of Mr Salisbury that, during this period, HTA should have carried out further periodic inspections of the completed roof.    I reject that contention.   I agree with Mr Salisbury that, once Mr Thornton had inspected and approved the completion of the roof, he had no need to look again at the roof on his next visit.   I accept Mr Salisbury’s evidence in cross-examination that “to look for deterioration in a building during the construction period is really not something that one does on regular inspections.” In my view, it would be artificial, and unduly onerous, to impose upon an architect making periodic inspections the duty to re-inspect areas of work which have been completed and approved at an earlier stage of construction.   </p>

Of course, that phase was never reached in the present case.    Thus, it seems to me that, apart from the inspections at the time that the roof was first laid and then completed, and the final inspection for snagging/handover purposes prior to Practical Completion, an ordinarily competent architect carrying out a periodic inspection function would have had no obligation to inspect the roof in the intervening weeks or months, unless there was something about the roof which triggered a concern, and which therefore justified a further inspection.    I note that this approach was broadly agreed by Mr Jowett in his cross-examination:   </p>

There was simply nothing to indicate that, in the summer/autumn of 2000, there was any sign of defects of the slates.   Mr Williamson QC complains that, in his statement, Mr Thomas indicated that this was a topic on which he was going to give evidence, and so he submits that I should draw the inference from the failure to call Mr Thomas that there was such evidence in the summer/autumn of 2000.   I am unable to draw that inference in the light of the clear evidence to the contrary of Mr Jowett, the Claimant’s own expert.   </p>

The crucial question then becomes whether, as Mr Jowett put it, “towards the end of the job” there was sufficient sign/warning of pyrites to lead HTA on a chain of enquiry which would have led to the condemnation of the slates.    I have considered the evidence on this point very carefully and I have concluded that, whilst there may have been the odd pyrites stain that might have been visible to HTA (had they been looking for it) before Waltham left site, there was nothing which would have led them to decide to re-inspect the roof more closely, and nothing which would have triggered the necessary chain of enquiry to lead to the condemnation of the slates.

The starting point is the Waltham video made on 24 January 2002.   There is nothing in that video which indicates pyrites staining, even though Mr Prinn of Waltham appears to have looked at the roof quite carefully on that occasion, because he points out missing slates.    </p>

As noted in paragraphs 109-115 above, Mr Wheeler’s detailed schedule made no mention of pyrites staining.    Mr Bartlett QC and Mr Hamilton therefore take the not unreasonable point that, if such staining was not apparent to Mr Wheeler doing a thorough inspection some months after the project came to an end, it cannot possibly be argued that HTA should somehow have seen (and acted upon) such staining months before.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant’s attempted answer to that is to say that the Wheeler inspection was largely internal and that the external inspection was short.    I do not accept that.   The evidence that I have summarised at paragraphs 112-113 above was clear:   Mr Wheeler was requested to do a thorough investigation of the property, with no qualifications.   The fact that there were many more alleged defects inside than out merely reflected the fact that, at least at that time, the problems were largely felt to relate to the finishes and internal works.    After all, in the spring/early summer of 2002, the external works looked largely as they had looked for the preceding 18 months, and it might be thought that, if there were aspects of the external works which Mr McGlinn did not like or considered to be defective, they would have been pointed out well before then.    It is therefore unsurprising that the list of external items in Mr Wheeler’s schedule is much shorter than the list of internal items.   In any event, within that list of external items, there was a reference to slipped slates.   Mr Wheeler therefore inspected the roof; equally plainly, he did not identify the pyrites staining.    I am not prepared to find that HTA should have noted the pyrites staining in late 2001 when Mr Wheeler failed to do so in the spring/early summer of 2002.    </p>

The photographs were taken in the summer of 2002. It was Mr Jowett’s evidence that, by reference to these photographs, on one slope 40 out of 420 slates were affected by pyrites, and on another, 40 out of 320 slates were similarly affected. He said that these were the slopes with the most pyrites staining.    He also said that there was a total of about 8,000-10,000 slates on the 19 different roof slopes. </p>

Even if, which I do not accept, HTA should have spotted a problem in, say, June/July of 2001, it would not have been a straightforward (or quick) matter to investigate the state of the tiles, condemn the roof and get it re-laid.   Such a drastic result could only have been achieved by first obtaining a detailed report on the roof slates.   The report on the slates that was obtained in this case took three months from commissioning to production.   On that basis, if such a report had been commissioned in June/July 2001, it would not have been available until September/October 2001. The report would then have had to have been considered by all parties, including the supplier, before a way forward could be discussed and (hopefully) agreed, and it was not inconceivable that further samples would have needed to be taken, particularly if there was any suggestion of relaying the whole roof.   Even then, it is not clear when any replacement slates might have been delivered.</p>

An alternative case, that HTA should have advised WL to withhold money in respect of the roof during the latter part of 2001, is not pleaded and would in any event be fraught with difficulty.   When should the deductions have been made?   How much should have been deducted?   How was that to be calculated, and how did it relate to the actual number of slates with pyrites staining? What was the effect of the guarantee on the appropriateness of any such deduction?</p>

Some of the slates were from a bad batch or batches:   whether they justified the complete replacement of all the slates on the roof is a difficult question on the evidence, but the defects were such that they plainly justified the replacement of some of the slates on some of the slopes.    This would have been Waltham’s responsibility under the terms of the building contract because the slates were not fit for their purpose.  Waltham in turn would have been able to pursue the suppliers of the slates who had, after all, guaranteed those slates in the first place.   There would thus have been a clear and simple claim passed down the appropriate contractual chain.    </p>

Thus the Claimant has been forced to look elsewhere for his remedies.   The obvious place for a Claimant in the position of Mr McGlinn to look is the architect, given his obligation to carry out periodic inspections.    However, there will always be complaints about defective materials, underpinning even potentially large claims like this Item, where it is just not appropriate to try and render the architect liable for something which, on any fair view, was simply not his fault.    As noted in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section E3.5</span> above, an architect’s periodic inspections are not intended to (and do not) ensure that the materials supplied by reputable suppliers, and installed by the building contractors, are free from all defects.   For all these different reasons, I reject this Item against HTA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">According to Mr Thornton, the original design stipulated that the sarking membrane was to go above the counter batten.    He said that, at some point before the roof was laid, Waltham proposed putting it beneath the counter batten.   He said that HTA agreed to this proposal because it was acceptable to the manufacturer, although there was nothing to indicate that the manufacturer had even been asked about it.    It also appears that Mr Thornton considered the possibility that a water trap would thereby be created in this location.    As a result, he stipulated that a solid piece of plywood should be used in the installation to ensure that there was no such trap.    Mr Jowett agreed that the plywood was a good design solution, but said that the difficulty was that the plywood was simply not installed by Waltham.  He also said that this omission would have been “obvious” to HTA.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that the allegations at Item 4.1.3 in the Scott Schedule exhibit a number of failings on the part of HTA.    First, I consider that Mr Thornton did not fully think through the significance of the plywood piece to prevent the water trap.  If he had done so, he would have provided a better and clearer drawing of the plywood than the one provided to Waltham and included in the trial bundles.    It was, with respect to Mr Thornton, extremely difficult for Waltham to see where that piece of plywood was supposed to go and what its purpose really was.   However, given that this was not an Item where the allegation was of defective design, I make no specific finding in this regard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the uncertainty as to what was required by way of a design solution emphasised only too plainly Mr Thornton’s failure to check carefully on site to make sure that the plywood was installed in accordance with the HTA drawing.  After all, this was a change to the original design.    It was therefore something to which Mr Thornton should have paid special attention when he was making his periodic inspections, particularly given the significance that the plywood piece would have in order to prevent the water from being trapped.    He failed to spot it even though, as Mr Jowett put it, its omission was “obvious”.    Mr Salisbury did not address this point in his report and I did not discern any real challenge to it during his cross-examination.   I therefore find that HTA were in breach of contract because they failed to note that the key ingredient of their design solution had been omitted by Waltham.    </p>

Mr Jowett’s point was that, because of the inherent trap, the defect could only be corrected by opening up and redetailing the base of the roof and that, given that the roof slating was fixed from the bottom to the top, all the roof slating had to be removed in order to correct the detail. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept HTA’s case that there was no evidence of water becoming trapped on or in the membrane in large quantities and thus no evidence of water dripping from this source into the building.   However, this does not mean that the importance of this Item can be downplayed, as HTA seek to do.  It was extremely important that the roof of Maison d’Or was properly designed and constructed;    it always is on any house, let alone this high quality private residence on Jersey.    This was an error that could have had potentially important consequences.    The water trap meant that there was a clear risk of water ingress through the roof and into the house. In my judgment, in respect of such a vital element of the construction as the roof, there should have been no risk at all.    This was an Item which, had they spotted the omission of the plywood, HTA would have been bound to instruct Waltham to rectify the deficiency, no matter what stage the works had reached. In that regard, it can be contrasted with, say, Item 2.2.1, where it was by no means clear that such an instruction would have been given in respect of the particular compound used in the window construction.</p>

Mr Salisbury’s evidence on the same point in his report was limited to the suggestion that, at the turrets the facia board could be lowered, although, as we have seen, HTA expanded this argument in cross-examination.   The difficulty with this proposition was that there was no detailed alternative scheme put forward in Mr Salisbury’s report, and no alternative costings provided by Mr Linnett, HTA’s quantum expert.   It was always open to HTA’s experts to set out a detailed case to the effect that, even if HTA were liable for this Item, the remedial works should have been carried out to a different (lesser) specification which would have been valued at a lower cost than the one for which the Claimant claimed.   In my judgment, HTA have not pleaded or put forward such a coherent alternative case.   Moreover, where they have referred to possible alternatives (the lowering of the facia boards, for example) the architectural experts have agreed that this would be very difficult and would involve much more work than might initially be thought.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no Specification in respect of the quality of joinery.   Mr Jowett made plain that, in his view, it was for the architect to identify clearly in the written specification precisely what standard was required.   Mr Salisbury did not disagree with that, saying “in the usual course of things, I would look for a far more precise specification than I have read in connection with this job, yes …”   Accordingly, it seems to me that, in line with my reasoning set out above, HTA were in breach of contract in failing to provide this specification. They knew that a high standard of joinery was required;   they knew or should have known that, as architects, they had to specify that high standard;   and they failed to do so.   Of course, whether that breach was causative of loss depends on what the overall quality standards of the joinery actually were on site.  That in turn brings in the second allegation against HTA, namely their failure to carry out proper periodic inspections in relation to the quality of the joinery.</p>

The first is that, although the quality was reasonably high, there were numerous examples of defective work and poor finish.    Secondly, I conclude that, whilst the neglect of the building after January 2002 may have served to exacerbate some of the deficiencies in the joinery, it was plainly not the real cause of the problem.   WW Pro and Charter were finding major deficiencies right at the outset of the period of neglect, in January 2002.</p>

However the real issue in respect of the joinery was the alleged failure on the part of HTA to carry out proper periodic inspections, with the result that there were numerous specific defects which should have been, but were not, rectified by Waltham long before they left site.    It is to that issue that I now turn.   </p>

For the avoidance of doubt, I have reached this conclusion by reference to the very high (but not perfect) standard which Mr Thornton was obliged to apply, and which he said that he intended to apply. I have not applied the boat standard. Furthermore, I accept Mr Williamson QC’s submission that the joinery which is criticised and which can be seen in the photographs failed to meet even an ordinary standard of workmanship. Examples of the joinery which I consider to be of a wholly unacceptable standard, and which have led to these conclusions, are as follows:</p>

I reject that submission for two reasons.   First, it seems to me that, because HTA are liable for the failure to specify the appropriate quality of joinery in the first place, the foreseeable consequence of that default was the carrying out of inadequate work which, when it came to be replaced, could not be completed by the original contractor free of charge. That is, of course, exactly what happened.   Secondly, since I have found that HTA should have alerted Waltham to the errors in their joinery work long before Waltham left site, their failure to ensure that these matters were put right meant that they were liable for the costs of remedial work if, as turned out to be the case, Waltham were no longer in a position to carry out the works or pay financial compensation.    It seems to me that that finding is entirely in accordance with <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Sutcliffe</span>, and I do not consider that the absence of an allegation in relation to the interim valuations makes any difference to my conclusion.</p>

They should have provided a specification of the kitchen by the time that the works went out to tender in October 1998, and could be said to be in default because they did not do so.    However, it is unclear whether this default led anywhere, given that Waltham’s tender figure for the kitchen was £50,000, which is £10,000 <span style="text-decoration:underline">more</span> than the claimed cost of a new kitchen now.    In other words, Waltham seemed to appreciate what was required, notwithstanding the lack of a written specification. </p>

Thus, at the end of 1998, it may have been unclear whether HTA had any ongoing liability for the kitchen, because it had ostensibly been omitted.  However, this seems to have had no effect on the work that was subsequently carried out:   it does not appear that anybody thought for a moment that this house was being designed and constructed without a kitchen.   So the omission by WL of the kitchen in late 1998 appears to have made no difference, because Mr McGlinn obviously wanted a kitchen in the property and ended up paying about £30,000 odd for the kitchen that was supplied and installed by Waltham.    </p>

That was expressly confirmed by Mr Berryman of TDD. Thus, the use of MDF fitments, which might seem a slightly surprising choice for the house of a multi millionaire, and was the subject of much criticism, was the choice of TDD.    Indeed, on the evidence before me, it appears that all the aspects of the kitchen design, about which complaint has since been made, can be traced back to TDD’s design/requirements.    </p>

HTA’s obligation to co-ordinate in relation to the design of the kitchen was to ensure that, for example, the location of water pipes and the like married up with TDD’s design of the kitchen itself.    It was no part of HTA’s co-ordination obligation to check whether TDD were right and Mr McGlinn really did want painted MDF in his kitchen.   Accordingly, I reject the allegation that the defaults in the design of the kitchen were in any way the responsibility of HTA.</p>

The reason is this.    On the evidence of Mr Thornton, by the summer of 2001, Mr McGlinn and/or Mr Tanner had made plain their (entirely reasonable) dissatisfaction with the kitchen.    For the reasons which I have previously given, that dissatisfaction was essentially rooted in the design/specification decisions taken by TDD.   It appears clear from the documents that Mr McGlinn was seriously considering at that stage stripping out the existing kitchen and replacing it, lock stock and barrel.  According to Mr Thornton, having contemplated that possibility, Mr McGlinn then made it plain that, instead, he wanted Waltham to complete the kitchen, when he would then make a decision, based on its completed condition, as to whether he retained it or not.    That was something that was discussed at the meeting on 19 July 2001.    In the subsequent letter from WL to HTA of 23 July 2001, Mr Richards wrote:</p>

Accordingly, at the time that Waltham left site, Mr McGlinn had expressly chosen to proceed with the existing kitchen.   In those circumstances, it seems to me that, even if HTA had been liable for the inspection allegations, Mr McGlinn could not have claimed against them for the cost of a new kitchen, in circumstances where it was he who decided to proceed with the original kitchen in any event.</p>

HTA’s default (in failing to produce a specification originally) was not causative of loss.   The real problem with the kitchen was its defective design/specification, which I find was entirely the responsibility of TDD.  These problems were compounded by Waltham’s poor workmanship. However, HTA were not in breach of their inspection obligation in this regard:  everyone knew of the deficiencies in the kitchen, and Mr McGlinn took an informed decision to continue with the kitchen to completion.   For all these reasons, the claims against HTA under this Item must fail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The allegation against HTA is based on a failure to make adequate inspections.    However Mr Jowett agreed – as he was bound to do - that HTA should not have required the timber to be rejected simply because it had wormholes:    the whole point of the timber was that it was old and weathered, and therefore the existence of wormholes did not mean that the timber was in any way defective.   Accordingly the issue was whether the timber was in fact the subject of active infestation in 2000 or in 2001 and, if so, whether this should have been spotted and sorted out by HTA.   But as I have said, there was no unequivocal evidence that there was any active infestation during the contract period, or indeed subsequently.  Thus, there was nothing to say that HTA should have done anything differently, or that there was anything further that they should have checked.    Accordingly, I reject this item against HTA.    It seems to me that, on the evidence available, the fact of actual infestation on which it is based cannot be made out.</p>

Secondly, it is said that the opened joints should have been seen and dealt with during HTA’s periodic inspections.</p>

HTA’s closing submissions made the point (at paragraph 442) that any badly made mitre joints were “few and far between”.    That appears to be linked to the submission at paragraph 437 that Mr Salisbury was only aware of two examples of open mitre joints in the flooring.   I have explained above that Mr Salisbury’s visits to the site were considerably less numerous and less extensive than those undertaken by Charter and Mr Jowett.    This Item is, perhaps, a good example of the difficulties thereby created.    At Appendix QA10 of Mr Jowett’s answers to questions of September 2006, 15 different mitre joint/junctions are identified as being defective.    They are cross referenced to videos or photographs taken by Charter and Bickerdike Alan &amp; Partners.   </p>

I accept the proposition that the problems may have been exacerbated by the period of neglect after January 2002 although, since there was no provision to allow for any moisture movement, it might be said that HTA were responsible for that in any event.   More fundamentally still, there was clear evidence that there were problems with the mitre jointing before Waltham left site.   Indeed many of the Charter photographs, taken only a few months after Waltham left site, make clear that the gaps visible in those photographs have been in existence for some time. </p>

They could and should have specified a means whereby there was sufficient allowance for moisture movement at the joint, and they should have raised the open joints expressly with Waltham on their periodic inspections.    It may well have been that, had they done so, they would then have realised that expansion of boarding laid in a panel, surrounded by a mitre jointed strip, would tend to open up the mitre joints, unless there was proper provision to accommodate any moisture expansion. A solution could then have been found. Thus, if Mr Thornton had dealt with this Item properly during his inspections, the cause of the problem could have been identified and dealt with.</p>

But the main problem that existed here was not with the heating itself; it was the absence of a proper gap between the under floor heating and the timber floor, which floor was being designed by HTA.  The related problem was that the flooring, specified by HTA, could not accommodate the maximum temperature of the heating system.  As the designers of the floor, and as the architects, it was therefore HTA’s obligation to ensure that these two elements of the overall design fitted together.   </p>

HTA were the only professional being paid to co-ordinate the designs of others.   It was therefore for them to co-ordinate the designs to produce a proper gap, and they failed to do so.    They are therefore liable for this Item.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These defects meant that the floor would have been damaged by the heating system, and therefore extensive remedial work was required.  I note that Mr Jowett agreed that the defects in the performance of the under floor heating itself, which are Items 26.5-26.23 in the Scott Schedule (and not alleged against HTA) meant that the floor would have had to have come up in any event.    That, however, does not seem to me to make any difference to the liability of HTA for this Item.    HTA were in breach of contract and their breach of contract meant that the hardwood floor would have had to have been replaced, and other work done to the location of the pipes, even if the system worked perfectly.    If DJH were liable for the failures in the performance of the under floor heating, then it may mean that DJH would be liable for some of the same items of cost to Mr McGlinn.    But, always provided that Mr McGlinn does not obtain double recovery as between the two Defendants, both Defendants are liable (for different reasons) for the cost of the same (or some of the same) elements of remedial work.    </p>

Although he said he had given instructions to Waltham to deal with the problem by sanding, there was no other evidence of this, and certainly no written notification.  Cupping is also expressly referred to in the WW Pro Report of January 2002, which talks of “boards curling up under the skirting board” and “movement due to excess moisture”.     Furthermore, Mr Salisbury, having considered all the photographs, offered the view, without even being asked, that the cupping was “quite clearly visible in the video that Mr Prinn made on 24 January 2002 …cupping was present”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me, therefore, that there is overwhelming evidence that the cupping was present prior to Waltham’s departure from site.    There was nothing in writing to indicate that Mr Thornton drew this defect to the attention of Waltham.    It seems to me that he should have done;   there was certainly no reason to wait for the snagging/handover process before this item was dealt with.    In addition, it is clear from Mr Salisbury’s evidence that sanding (which Mr Thornton said was the work he asked Waltham to do) was not the best solution;   Mr Salisbury said “the better option is to deal with the cause of the cupping, if that is a problem, first, and that would probably mean taking up the floor boards, in which case you might as well replace them.”  </p>

I made the point during the trial that, although the Claimant’s Scott Schedule had a column entitled ‘Defect and Location’ it was rare that any actual location was identified in the Schedule.    In respect of this Item, the column appeared to identify the cupping as having occurred in the Dining Room only.    That is now a point taken by HTA, despite the existence of the Defects Location Schedule, produced by the Claimant late in the trial, which suggested that the cupping also existed in the Living Room and the Billiard Room.    No cross-references to other evidence to support this suggestion were identified in the Defects Location Schedule.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded that there was no pleading and no evidence concerning cupping in any locations other than the Dining Room floor.   I therefore consider that the references in the Defects Location Schedule to the Living Room and the Billiard Room were not in accordance with the Claimant’s pleaded case and unsupported by evidence.  That may well explain why there are no cross-references in the Defects Location Schedule to any photographs or other material relating to these other locations.    I therefore find that HTA are liable only for the cupping in the Dining Room floor.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The problem in the en-suite was a clash between the panel and the door architrave.   Mr Thornton’s evidence made clear that the panel was designed by TDD.    However, the TDD drawing that showed this design could not be described as detailed.   Although I accept Mr Thornton’s evidence that, in each instance, he formed a judgment as to whether he would redraw the TDD information, or just pass it on to Waltham as it was and deal with any subsequent queries they may have, it seems to me that, on each occasion when he adopted the latter course, Mr Thornton had to be particularly careful to ensure that the undimensioned TDD drawings did not clash with other aspects of the design. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was always for HTA to ensure that the TDD design was co-ordinated with the overall design, so that these clashes did not arise.  Mr Salisbury said that “the width of the architrave had been overlooked”.    In my judgment, that was a fault on the part of HTA, and a predictable result of passing on undimensioned drawings to Waltham without properly considering the consequences.   For the avoidance of doubt, I reject the suggestion that this was a small error that did not indicate negligence; it was, in my view, an error which arose from a failure to have in place a proper co-ordination system in respect of the use of TDD’s undimensioned drawings.   Accordingly the “conflict”, as Mr Salisbury described it, was the responsibility of HTA.    </p>

There was no duty on HTA to warn of errors in TDD’s design.   In any event, the Claimant did not demonstrate that the MDF had been incorrectly specified; whilst Mr Jowett was generally against the use of MDF in a wet environment, the evidence was that some types of MDF were suitable, and it was not known what type was used here.</p>

The furthest Mr Salisbury would go was to say that it was “debatable” whether there was a fault.   Moreover, he said that he swung on the doors “like a monkey” without producing any drop in the doors, and explained his reasons for concluding that the doors were strong in the vertical plane.

As a result HTA prepared a new design for a set of steel stairs.   The difficulty with this modified design was that it meant moving the hydraulic pipe to the lift and Waltham were unwilling to move the pipe because of the risk that it would jeopardise the guarantee from Otis Lifts.  Accordingly, Mr Thornton said that Mr McGlinn agreed that the cat ladder would remain as it was, and that he would carry out further work in this area after Waltham had left site.    </p>

Accordingly I consider that they are liable for Item 8.2.  Again, the fact that there was or might have been a change to HTA’s original design is irrelevant to their liability for this Item.</p>

Item 9.2 is concerned with the defective construction of the baths, which are said to have been fixed too low in relation to the stone panel surround, leaving a large gap.   It is also said there are inadequate timber supports to the baths.   Item 9.3 is concerned with the shower tray in the master bedroom en-suite and the allegation that there is no tanking provision beneath the shower tray.

In all those circumstances, I find that HTA should not have accepted this obviously inadequate remedial solution and should have required Waltham to re-do this element of the work.

Mr McGlinn originally wanted a retractable pool cover.   The slot by the side of the pool was designed and built to house that standard cover.    Subsequently, Mr McGlinn changed his mind and, possibly mindful of the fact that the swimming pool took up the bulk of the garden area which the house overlooked, he decided that he wanted a cover which could be walked upon.   HTA did their best to meet this changed requirement and went to pool cover specialists, Dripool.    Dripool came up with the design of the panels with the astro turf finish.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McGlinn was asked in detail about the relevant sequence of events.   He said he believed that, by the time he first broached the idea of having a cover that could be walked on, the pool had already been built with a ledge for the retractable cover and the slot for the cover to retract into.   He accepted that, thereafter, ‘a bespoke design was carried out for a walk-on cover that would fit on the pool and go into the slot’.    He said that Mr Thornton made him aware of the Dripool fax referred to above and that, on the basis of the information in the fax, he approved going ahead with the cover.   He agreed that he told Mr Thornton that his staff could deal with removing the cover in the spring and putting it back in the autumn.   He also accepted that, much later, prompted by his daughter’s desire to have parties on the pool cover, he looked into the possibility of having the cover strengthened even further.  However by November 2001, it appeared clear that he had decided not to pursue that point any further.  All of these admissions by Mr McGlinn were reflected in the evidence of Mr Thornton.</p>

It made perfect sense, once Mr McGlinn had changed his mind as to the sort of pool cover that he required, to use the existing slot for the storage of the panels.   Indeed, Mr McGlinn made clear that that was precisely what he expected HTA to do.   I consider it misconceived for Mr McGlinn now to criticise HTA because they utilised the slot (which had been designed for a different sort of cover) to house the larger panels stipulated by Dripool.   </p>

Inevitably, to achieve this, the panels were gong to be heavy.  HTA simply followed Dripool’s recommendation.    That was a reasonable thing for HTA to do and they cannot be criticised for doing it.   Furthermore, I am not at all persuaded that Dripool’s recommendation was wrong. </p>

It is simply not open to Mr McGlinn now to criticise the arrangements which he himself formulated and agreed in conjunction with Mr Thornton.  Again the absence of some better or more obvious solution propounded by Mr Jowett (see paragraph 628 above) was very striking.</p>

I consider that that is much too restricted a view of the Bye-Laws.  The terrace was effectively a very large balcony, looking out over a lower area.  Since it would plainly have been dangerous if there had been no balustrade at all I consider that the Bye-Laws applied.   Even if the Bye-Laws did not strictly apply, it seems to me that some form of balustrade was plainly necessary and, unless there was a good reason to depart from the 1100 mm figure in the Bye-Laws, the balustrade should have been at least that high.</p>

Mr McGlinn accepted that those were his instructions.    However, there are two difficulties with this aspect of HTA’s defence.    First, there is nothing to suggest that HTA made plain to Mr McGlinn that the balustrade at just 770 mm high was unsafe/dangerous.   Secondly, I accept Mr Jowett’s evidence that there were ways in which the view could have been maintained as well as a safe height for the balustrading.</p>

First, for the reasons which I have given under Item 1.3.3 above, I consider that the plinth on which the railings were mounted should be taken into account in considering the height of the barrier overall.   If the plinth was to be taken into account, the railing height was in excess of that stipulated by the Bye-Laws.    Furthermore, even if the plinth should be disregarded, the railing height without the plinth was only just below that stipulated by the Bye-Laws.  The evidence was that it was only about 18 mm too short.   In those circumstances, I do not accept that this element of the design comprised a breach of contract on the part of HTA in any event.</p>

However, it seems clear beyond doubt that the defective construction was apparent, or should have been apparent, to Mr Thornton on his periodic inspections.

It is not right to say, as the Claimant’s closing submissions do, that this was “too little, too late”.   The whole point of an architect’s duty to review his design and make periodic inspections is to ensure that any earlier slips are corrected.    This was a slip which was being corrected, and would have been but for Mr McGlinn’s decision not to allow Waltham back on site.  I therefore reject this Item against HTA. </p>

However, it is nonsense to suggest that, without more, HTA had to require DJH to produce a report in respect of the drainage. Why should they have done so? What triggered such a requirement?   There is no evidence that there was anything that should have alerted HTA to a problem with the drainage system or would have indicated to them that a report was required.    Indeed, it might be thought that, since DJH were responsible for the design of the drainage, it would be for them to point out any problem or potential problem to HTA, not the other way round.    In any event, as Mr Thornton explained, drainage would be tested shortly before practical completion, as part of the commissioning process.  That stage, of course, was never reached.</p>

For the same reasons set out above, I consider that that allegation must fail.   This was a matter for DJH to sort out in their direct dealings with Waltham at the appropriate time;   it was not a co-ordination matter for HTA. </p>

There was nothing to suggest that HTA saw, or should have seen, this patch repair work during their periodic inspections, or were informed about it by others.   Mr Thornton said he was quite unaware of it.    If, as I find, HTA had no reasonable way of knowing about the patch repairs, they could not have ordered a report into how or why the repairs had come about.    </p>

Mr Ellerington accepted that, in doing this, DJH would have to take a view as to what was complete and what was incomplete, and what element of their works was satisfactory and what elements were unsatisfactory.   There were, however, no notes from DJH recording the results of this process.</p>

That plainly cannot have been the case, given the incomplete work and the need for commissioning of the M &amp; E services.  In that respect, Mr Ellerington confirmed that DJH had carried out preliminary inspections (although no notes of such inspections existed) but they had not yet got to the stage where they could issue to the sub-contractors a list of defective work. Mr Ellerington confirmed that there was no final snagging “because a lot of the finishing items were incomplete”.  He said that there were no defects lists or lists of items of incomplete work.  </p>

There was a greater difficulty with the mechanical sub-contractor, PHS, who, according to Mr Ellerington, failed to produce any proper manuals, just “a collection of manufacturers’ details and publications.   It was not specific to the job”.  These difficulties with PHS led to a suggestion that DJH take over their commissioning obligations, a suggestion that DJH declined.</p>

The mechanical and electrical works therefore remained incomplete and un-snagged, having not been commissioned, and without any completed operating and maintenance manuals.  DJH eventually determined their engagement in November of the same year on the basis of the non-payment of their fees although, as noted above, they had not actually carried out any work at the site for many months.</p>

The tank failed in situ and cracked open.    The issue is whether or not that failure, which was plainly a matter for which Waltham could be roundly criticised, was also the responsibility of DJH.

These explained how the tank should be installed.    DJH passed on those detailed instructions and, in addition, provided to Waltham their own specification (dated 12 August), stipulating, amongst other things, the depth of the concrete base, the use of reinforcement and the need for a polythene sheet.    Unfortunately, as Mr Ross-Gower accepted in cross-examination, Waltham failed to install the rainwater tank or lay the foundations in accordance with the specifications and instructions with which they had been provided.   Indeed Mr Ross-Gower accepted that they had failed to comply with “almost every single aspect” of those instructions and specification.   </p>

That admission rather indicated that there had been a lack of care in the preparation of the allegations against DJH, and that was perhaps borne out by the suggestion, which Mr Ross-Gower endeavoured to pursue for the first time in his oral evidence, to the effect that DJH’s foundation design was defective because it failed to take into account the fact that the ground at one end of the foundation slab was going to be backfill, rather than made ground.    This assertion, which was nowhere set out in Mr Ross-Gower’s report, was firmly rejected by Mr Dibb-Fuller who pointed out that the area where the foundation slab went into the fill material was: </p>

It appears that the investigations/tests that were carried out in respect of this Item were only performed on 13 October 2006.    Therefore, I am not confident that this allegation was properly made against DJH in the first place.   </p>

It appears that the experts agreed that the erosion of the galvanised steel would occur at between 2 and 5 microns per year.    The galvanising that was measured on site demonstrated an average thickness of 2,000 microns.    Thus, as a matter of simple mathematics, there was a design life for this steel work between 40 years and 100 years.    As Mr Ross-Gower accepted, taking the arithmetical average of those two possibilities, it meant that this steel work would last for 70 years, a figure therefore in excess of the required design life.    </p>

First, it was pointed out that DJH only specified a coating of only 85 microns, but it seemed to me that that was irrelevant given the actual findings on site and because, as Mr Dibb-Fuller explained, that was a minimum specification which would have been comfortably exceeded (as it was) when the galvanising was applied.    Secondly, although there was a good deal of cross-examination about average thickness of galvanising and erosion rates, I do not consider that I was greatly assisted by such enquiries.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position is that the actual galvanised steel beneath this patio had a design life of somewhere between 40 and 100 years.    In the round, it is therefore impossible to say that DJH’s design and specification was provided in breach of contract because it failed to allow for a design life of 60 years.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is one final point on this Item.    If I am wrong, and DJH were in breach of contract in respect of the actual amount of galvanising applied, I reject absolutely the notion that that would entitle Mr McGlinn to replace the entirety of the steel beams under the patio.    Again it is back to the question of fact and degree that I referred to above.     In my judgment, no reasonable homeowner, when told that the steel beams below his patio might (as a worst-case scenario) only last 40 years, rather than 60, would tear up the patio and replace the beams.    Accordingly, even if I had found (which I have not) that DJH were in breach of contract in respect of this Item, I consider it to be an Item where the principle in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ruxley</span> would have then been relevant (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Section K1.1</span> below).</p>

Although Mr Dibb-Fuller was cross-examined by reference to a meeting minute which demonstrated that Mr Malcolm Hartigan of DJH was to inspect the roof trusses to confirm that they were structurally sound, it seemed to me that this was actually a point against the Claimant, because the evidence demonstrated that the inspection was carried out and the correct diagnosis made (i.e. that the trusses were structurally sound).

Indeed, Mr Ross-Gower accepted in evidence that “until recently I have held the view that DJH would probably not have had reason to inspect the roof specifically when that element was under construction”.    No explanation was provided as to why this Item, which had been roundly rejected by the Claimant’s own engineering expert, was nonetheless pleaded and pursued by the Claimant.</p>

Mr Ross-Gower accepted that the original work was relatively simple and that an engineer would be entitled to trust the contractor to put it in properly.    However he said that, because the straps had to be refitted (following some unrelated pipe-fitting work), in some way the re-doing of that simple work was something which the engineer should have inspected.   I am bound to confess that the tortuous logic of this rather escaped me.    In any event, I prefer the evidence of Mr Dibb-Fuller who said: </p>

It is DJH’s case that these Items comprise incomplete work which would have been carried out but for the departure from site of Waltham and the specialist sub-contractors in January 2002, and it was therefore unclear to DJH why the Claimant maintained that they were liable for any damages in respect of these Items.

The problem for him is that, on the evidence, there has been nothing to indicate which Items were paid for in full or, where the Items have not been paid for in full, what, if anything, is said to comprise the additional cost of completing them.    In short, the Claimant has offered no evidence in support of his secondary case.    </p>

Therefore, by reference to the point of principle made in paragraphs 256-263 above, I conclude that these were temporary disconformities, not breaches of contract by Waltham, and no criticism can be made of DJH in consequence.    In all those circumstances, it seems to me that it is impossible, even if I found that these items constituted a breach of contract on the part of DJH, to find that any damages could be recoverable.    </p>

These are all Items which are admitted to be defects in Waltham’s work, but where it is said that, on the evidence, there was no breach of contract/negligence on the part of DJH.    The principal points appear to be:  first, that the Items were drawn to Waltham’s attention, and that it is not DJH’s fault if Waltham did not then go on to carry out the works;  or secondly, that the Item should “ideally” have been seen on inspection.   </p>

Accordingly, I deal briefly below with each of the contentious Items.   However, by way of introduction, I should say that, in my judgment, if a professional man identifies an element of defective work and draws it promptly to the attention of the contractor, he is obliged to monitor the progress of that item and, effectively, chase the contractor until the necessary remedial work is done.   The alternative, once he has identified the defect to the contractor, would be to make a deduction from the contractor’s valuations.    In my judgment, if the professional has identified the defect in question and reasonably appreciates that the Item has not been rectified, then the onus would again be on him to demonstrate that he had made the necessary deduction from the interim payments.    </p>

On 23 April, Mr Richards of WL wrote to Mr Thomas attaching his fee proposal for quantity surveying and cost management.  The letter enclosed documentation in respect of the level of proposed fees and also offered, if the fees were acceptable, to draft a QS agreement for Mr McGlinn to sign.  No such agreement was ever drawn up.  It appears that WL carried out their role as Quantity Surveyors without there having been any sort of discussion as to what services they would provide, let alone a written agreement setting out such services.</p>

Mr Hardcastle, who wrote the letter, confirmed that those were his express instructions from Mr McGlinn.  Mr McGlinn denied that he had used those words to describe Mr Richards’ new role.  It seems clear to me from his other evidence that Mr Hardcastle was a careful man who would not have made a mistake of this sort.   I find, therefore, that those were precisely the words used by Mr McGlinn to describe Mr Richards’ new function.

Furthermore, he wanted to ensure that all the bills that he paid had been properly vetted.   He was not going to undertake that task.   Mr Hardcastle was not qualified to do it.   Mr Richards, on the other hand, was qualified and was already the QS on the project.  Mr McGlinn plainly trusted Mr Richards to perform this additional function.  Accordingly, after his row with Mr Thomas over the unpaid fees on the Sandbanks property, and Mr Richards’ successful attempts to persuade Mr McGlinn to continue to use HTA on both Sandbanks and Maison d’Or, Mr McGlinn clearly decided that he never wanted to be in that position again.  Thus, he gave Mr Richards full authority to deal with all invoices rendered by consultants and contractors on either project.  I find that this is what Mr McGlinn meant by ‘Project Manager’.  </p>

Thus, for instance, they were involved in a consideration of Waltham’s claim for an extension of time.   They were also involved in passing on instructions to Waltham, and chasing up missing or incomplete information.  However, I reject any suggestion that, as a result of their appointment as project managers, a whole raft of obligations that were otherwise the responsibility of HTA (or others) were somehow transferred to WL.  To make any such finding, I would have had to have heard from Mr Thomas to that effect, and I did not.  WL’s additional obligations were in any event limited and ad hoc, and grew out of their effective proximity to Mr McGlinn.</p>

They included Mr Disdale, who said that Mr Richards was “our prime point of contact for a period and it would be him that was asking us questions or chasing us for information”.    In consequence of this, Mr Disdale agreed that it was Mr Richards’ role to pass on what was required to the other consultants.   He concluded by describing Mr Richards as “quite a liaison point for me.   He was the guy who chased us more than anyone else, so I imagine he had the reins …”   Mr Tanner described Mr Richards as “the man who was closely involved in the project with Ian McGlinn”.</p>

However, whether it caused specific difficulties for HTA, or limited their actions in some way, I cannot say and do not find;   there was no evidence to that effect from Mr Thornton, and Mr Thomas gave no evidence at all. For the avoidance of doubt, therefore, I reject on the facts HTA’s point, made at paragraph 113 of their closing submissions, that “what does matter is what HTA perceived WL’s role to be”. In truth, there was no evidence that HTA’s perception of WL’s role, whatever it might have been, made any difference at all to the outcome of these allegations, whether against HTA or WL.</p>

This takes effect in two different ways.  First, it is said that the claims against WL are only pursued at all if, in respect of the Item in question, the Claimant has not been successful against HTA.   In truth, this point has become academic since, in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section F2</span> above, I have not found HTA to be liable for any of the Items alleged against WL.    Accordingly, on the face of the pleadings, these claims are still open to the Claimant against WL.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the claims against WL are pursued by the Claimant on the basis of what they say are HTA’s allegations against WL in their responses to the Scott Schedule.   Examples of this can be seen in relation to Items 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, where HTA alleged that WL produced the Bills (which is not in fact disputed) and Item S1.1, where HTA alleged that “HTA’s role of co-ordinating other consultants was superseded by the appointment of WL as project managers”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It should also be noted that the criticism about the Haddonstone product itself, namely Item 1.2.2, is not pleaded against WL.    Thus, the only claim that they have to meet is the fact that the change itself constituted a breach of contract.    For the reasons which I have previously set out, I dismiss any such suggestion.   I expressly agree with paragraph 22 of the closing submissions of Mr Reese QC and Mr Warnock that “this was a rational costs saving suggestion properly made to a client who, after receiving tenders, asked his professional team to find possible savings”.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in this context, I should deal with WL’s letter of 20 November 1998.   The Claimant’s case was that this letter wrongly suggested that the change from granite to Haddonstone did not ‘alter the design’ of the house and reliance was placed on the incorrect nature of that statement.    In my judgment, this criticism is palpably unfair.    First, the letter makes clear that the reductions will result in “design changes”, so no fair reading of the letter could have left the reader with the impression that there were to be no design changes at all.   If Mr McGlinn had been confused by the letter, which would have been a much fairer submission, he could have asked Mr Richards precisely what he meant.    There is no evidence that he did so;   indeed, the evidence was that Mr McGlinn did not really read documents at all.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there was a good deal of esoteric debate as to what was meant by “design” in that context.   If “design” meant shape or space, then this change did not alter the shape or space of the building;   if “design” meant the look of the building then, to an extent, the change to Haddonstone altered (albeit in a minor way) the appearance of the house.   However, I regarded this debate as ultimately irrelevant.    Mr McGlinn knew what the granite would look like and, because he saw the Haddonstone brochure, he knew what the Haddonstone would look like in its stead.   In those circumstances, he knew what the change involved.   I therefore reject the criticism of WL based on the letter of 20 November 1998.</p>

I have analysed and rejected the claim that this change constituted a breach of contract on the part of HTA in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section F2.23</span> above.   I have concluded that the change was approved by Mr McGlinn;   that all relevant information was available to Mr McGlinn when he approved the change;   and that, in view of the experts’ agreement that, technically, idigbo was not inferior to oak, there was no detriment to Mr McGlinn as a result of this change in any event.    It seems to me, therefore, that the same reasoning must lead to the rejection of the allegation at Item 2.2.3 against WL, namely that they (wrongly and without instruction) approved the change from oak to idigbo.  Further, if Mr McGlinn was right and Mr Richards told him that “idigbo was as good as oak” then, on the evidence before me, that was a correct technical statement.    </p>

I have already said (paragraph 772 above) that, in my judgment, it is not a fair reading of this letter to conclude that WL were saying that there were no design changes as a result of the reductions.   But in any event it seems to me that, in relation to the change from oak to idigbo, this was not strictly a design change at all.    That was simply the replacement of one material with another, both materials being technically as capable as the other and both materials looking very similar.    Accordingly, even on the Claimant’s reading of the letter of 20 November 1998, I reject the criticism of WL in respect of the change from oak to idigbo.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, this allegation is only sustainable if it could be demonstrated that the timber supplied and installed by Waltham was inadequate.    This is a separate point to the quality of the finish to the joinery, which is Item 5.1.1 and not alleged against WL.    For the reasons set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section F2.21</span> above, I have concluded that the quality of the idigbo was high.     The only problems with the timber were a list of minor matters which Mr Jowett accepted were snagging, and the two windows that had to be replaced because of shakes.    HTA are liable for those two windows because I have found that they should have pointed out the problem long before Waltham left site.   However, WL are not liable for those two windows because they had no aesthetic inspection function.   Beyond that, there was no inherent problem with the quality of the timber so, whatever the Bills of Quantities had said, there was no breach and no loss for which WL can now be liable.    </p>

The House of Lords held that it was unreasonable to award damages based on the cost of reinstatement of the pool, because that would be out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained.  Since there was no diminution in value, no damages were recovered beyond an award of £2,500 for loss of amenity.   An important element of the finding in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ruxley</span> that the cost of reinstatement was out of all proportion was the judge’s rejection of the claimant’s evidence that he intended to rebuild the pool.  The House of Lords made it clear that, while such matters were not normally of relevance to the court, they might be important on the issue of reasonableness.

If he is incurring loss because he cannot use his property, his duty to mitigate may require him to repair it as quickly as possible, even if earlier repairs would cost more than later repairs would.    The duty to mitigate may require the plaintiff to have regard to advice from third parties, or even from the defendant, or from the defendant’s advisers.”</p>

Neither had been designed in full detail, so acceptance of either is to some extent dependent, first, on a judgment as to the ability of a designer, with the assistance of the specialist knowledge of the relevant manufacturer and a contractor experienced in using the system, to devise suitable detailed treatment of all the potential trouble-spots and, second, on an assessment of the guarantees and bonds offered by the manufacturer and contractor.  Since Soladex would be so much the cheaper and cannot be said to be the more detrimental to the appearance of the buildings – I should have thought, if anything, the reverse – it must clearly be preferred unless the criticisms of its expected effectiveness are, taking the above considerations into account, made good on the balance of probabilities.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Slightly different considerations may apply if a claimant has taken professional advice and carried out a remedial scheme on the basis of that advice.    As Judge Newey pointed out in the passage of his judgment in the <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> case, set out at paragraph 790 above, in certain cases it would be foreseeable that a claimant would decide which repair scheme to put in hand with the assistance of expert advice, and that it would be foreseeable that the claimant would take such advice and be influenced by it.    In such circumstances, it has been said that, prima facie, the claimant is entitled to the cost of the work carried out pursuant to that expert advice, even if, with hindsight, criticism could be made of the scheme that was put in hand.  In such a case, in order for a defendant to open up the damages claim based on work actually carried out, the defendant must ordinarily demonstrate that the advice upon which the claimant relied was negligent.    Such negligent advice would form an independent cause of damage which breaks the chain of causation.

The event may take the form of negligent advice upon which the plaintiff has acted.    Another way of expressing the matter might be that the defendant could not reasonably have foreseen that the plaintiff would act on negligent advice.   Advice which is not negligent will not by itself break the chain.”</p>

In <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Skandia Property UK Ltd v Thames Water Utilities Ltd</span> [1999] BLR 338 the claimant was advised by experts that a tanking system, called a “Sika” system, was the only practical way to protect a building that had been damaged by a flood caused by the defendant.    However, at the time that such advice was given and acted upon, the experts had been unaware of pressure grouting treatment which had been performed some time prior to the flood, and which meant that the flood had not in fact damaged the integrity of the building.  The Sika system that was put in as part of the remedial scheme was therefore shown to be unnecessary. In assessing the damages due from the defendant, the judge refused the claim for the cost of the Sika system, despite the absence of any suggestion of negligence on the part of the experts.   The Court of Appeal upheld his view.    Waller LJ said:</p>

If a plaintiff is to recover damages for something beyond the cost of reinstatement of physical damage then he must on any view show that it was reasonable to incur expenditure beyond that quantifiable figure … What should be emphasised is that it must be rare if ever that a plaintiff will be able to establish the reasonableness of any assumption of damage to something which is accessible and inspectable.   Certainly, simple reliance by a plaintiff on an expert cannot be the test as to whether a plaintiff has acted reasonably in making an assumption, albeit, provided the plaintiff has provided the expert with all material facts and the expert has made all reasonable investigations, the advice will be a highly significant factor.”</p>

It seems to me that it is not:  the cost of repair represents a valid way of arriving at an assessment of the Claimant’s loss if, for whatever reason, I conclude that the primary case fails and the costs of demolition and rebuilding are not recoverable.   For the same reason, I reject the submission by HTA that, in the absence of any evidence as to diminution in value, no damages should be awarded at all.  No party proffered any evidence as to diminution in value, and it was not even suggested as a possibility at the CMCs or the PTR. This is unquestionably a case in which the correct measure of loss is reinstatement:  the critical issue is whether those reinstatement costs should be calculated by reference to the costs of demolition or rebuilding (Mr McGlinn’s case) or the costs of repair (the Defendants’ case).   It is to that issue that I now turn.  </p>

That was a case where the engineer’s modifications to the piling design of the new wing of the hospital were negligent and resulted in the construction of inadequate foundations.  Both sides agreed that remedial work was necessary as a result of that default; the real issue was whether the Defendant could criticise the particular remedial scheme that had been carried out on expert advice.  In that sense, at least, it was a relatively straight-forward case. Here, there were a number of significant factors lying behind the decision to demolish which were not directly connected to the breaches of contract on the part of the Defendants (whether as alleged by the Claimant or as found by the court in the preceding Sections of this Judgment).</p>

These included his desire for all the windows to be redesigned and replaced (paragraph 118 above); the changes proposed on his behalf by Mr Sey as soon as the decision to demolish was announced (paragraph 144 above); and the changes which E. C. Harris believed him to have stipulated, for the new house to have “contemporary finishes … stainless steel and glass” (paragraph 145 above).

But many, indeed most, of these criticisms could fairly be described as aesthetic;  unlike <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span>, most were unconnected with the structural soundness of the building itself.  Indeed, that is another curious feature of this case.  There is no part of Maison d’Or itself which, even on the Claimant’s case, could have been described as structurally unsound, or dangerous, with the possible exception of the wall tie allegation of Item 1.1.5, which does not affect any of these three Defendants.  Indeed, it is unclear whether any part of the house would have failed the test of fitness for human habitation promulgated by <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">The Defective Premises Act</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> 1972.</span>  Further, even those criticisms which are more than aesthetic, such as the case that the roof tiles were inadequate, are not clearly linked to any damage; as I have previously pointed out, there were no discernable leaks through the roof slates at all.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, this is a very important feature of this case.  It is, on any view an extreme course:  to knock down a newly completed building because it is said to be defective, particularly where the majority of the defects can fairly be described as aesthetic matters only.  Even Mr Sugg said in evidence:  “I was shocked at the decision”.  If such a course of action is to be justified at all, it will ordinarily be because the building is dangerous or structurally unsound.   That was simply not the case here.  Thus, I consider that Maison d’Or was demolished because of what might be described as ordinary building defects, many of which are entirely explicable on the simple basis that, as Mr Salisbury put it, “the building was not finished”.  It is therefore difficult not to share Mr Salisbury’s view (if not his rather colourful language) that, from a commonsense perspective, the demolition should not have happened.  The absence of real structural concerns about the property makes it a very different sort of case to <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span>, which was concerned with structural defects in the foundations of a hospital wing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly on this point, I should say that the absence of any compelling case for demolition was reflected in both the uncertainties surrounding the decision to demolish itself (paragraphs 138-143 above), and Mr McGlinn’s own evidence.   At one point, in a rather dismissive passage of his cross-examination, he poured scorn on Maison d’Or, referred to its unsatisfactory condition, and described it as “unsafe”.   At another point, he said that “the place was falling down”.   In truth, both of these statements grossly exaggerated the problems at the property, and were not reflected in his own experts’ reports.  I regarded these answers as indicative of Mr McGlinn’s awareness that he had, for the most part, required the demolition of the building because of an accumulation of aesthetic complaints, rather than anything more significant, and he perhaps  felt the need to exaggerate those complaints – at least in his own mind - in order to justify that decision.  </p>

First, there is the fact that the overall advice as to demolition was plainly dependent on the comparative costs:  see paragraphs 134-136 above. This dependency could fairly be read as qualifying the advice to demolish, making the advice as to the defects and the appropriate remedial scheme entirely subject to questions of cost, which was a wholly separate matter.  Again, no such qualification arose in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, I am troubled about this cost advice in any event.   There can be no doubt that, within the costs advice with which Mr McGlinn was provided, there was a relatively modest differential between the costs of demolition and rebuilding on the one hand, and the cost of repair on the other.  That was a relevant matter in any consideration of which remedial scheme to adopt.     But it seems to me that commonsense dictates that demolition and rebuilding will always be an option which should only be considered as a last resort. That is because, when an owner demolishes and rebuilds, he is inevitably doing away with a large amount of perfectly satisfactory work.  I have already made the point that the building was structurally sound.  Therefore, even if the quantum of the figures was reasonably comparable, there was a clear risk that, by demolishing something that was sound and starting again, the rebuild option might well turn out to be more expensive (as well as being more destructive) than had originally been envisaged.   Demolition and rebuilding the house involved so much more physical work than the repair option that it inevitably carried with it a greater risk that the costs might increase.  Despite that, Mr McGlinn made clear in his cross-examination that he was not told of this financial risk; he said that he was told that “the risk side was the repair”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It should also be noted that the (largely agreed) figures for the repair cost are now far less than was recorded in the advice provided to Mr McGlinn at the time that the decision was taken.  Then, the advice was the demolition/rebuilding costs were only slightly more than the repair cost; now that most of the figures for the repair of the individual items have been agreed, the differential is in excess of £1 million.   Thus, in support of his case as to demolition/rebuild, the Claimant is obliged to rely on cost advice which has not only been demonstrated to be quite wrong, but might be said to have been based on a risk assumption that was, to put it neutrally, open to considerable debate.</p>

Mr Jowett was Mr McGlinn’s architectural expert and was involved at the time of the decision to demolish.  However Mr Jowett made it plain to me that he was not asked about and did not advise Mr McGlinn to demolish Maison d’Or.

Thus, the advice that Mr McGlinn allegedly acted upon came, apparently, from the Charter witnesses, who were not called as experts to give evidence as to their opinion, but simply as to matters of fact; and Mr Sugg of E C Harris, who was in a similar position.  Therefore, rather unusually, the two principal elements of the advice (defects and quantum) that were said to have underpinned the recommendation to demolish were not the subject of evidence from the Claimant’s experts. </p>

I deal in greater detail in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section K4 </span>below with some of the points that arise from it but, for present purposes, it is sufficient simply to note that, whilst in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> the damages argument could be confined to the appropriate remedial work to rectify one defect, in the present case the advice to demolish and rebuild was based on the cumulative effect of a whole series of unconnected Items.  Some of those Items I have found were not defects at all; others were not claimed against these three Defendants, so have not featured in the trial; and many others I have rejected as being the liability of these Defendants in any event.  In the absence of advice that item x, item y, or even items x, y and z were, on their own, sufficient to justify demolition and rebuilding, the Claimant’s case on this aspect of the claim had all the usual problems inherent in a cumulative exercise that essentially relied upon/assumed complete success on a large number of contentious items.  Remove one significant item from the equation (because, say, it was not a defect at all) and where did that leave the advice to demolish and rebuild?  Failure on one or more significant Item in the Scott Schedule would not, of itself, make the advice to demolish/rebuild negligent, but it would fundamentally weaken its causative effect and evidential value.   As I have said, that was not a problem in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> but it is a very real difficulty here.  </p>

The fact that the building was demolished and thereafter nothing further was done does not, in my judgment, put Mr McGlinn in precisely the same position as the hospital in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold">    </span>He might (indeed, on the evidence, he is likely to) build a rather different house in place of Maison d’Or.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Now let us assume that I am wrong to distinguish <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> on the facts, and/or that I am bound by whatever principle it is said that Judge Newey QC articulated in his judgment in that case.   It might well be said that his decision is authority for the relatively narrow proposition that, if two remedial schemes are proposed to rectify a defect which is the result of a defendant’s default, and one scheme is put in hand on expert advice, the defendant is liable for the costs of that built scheme, unless it could be said that the expert advice was negligent.  For what it is worth, I consider that, subject to one potentially vital qualification, set out below, this narrow proposition is generally in accordance with other authority and correct in law.   On that basis, therefore, I reject the submission made by HTA that the judgment in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> was wrong and should not be followed. The important qualification that needs to be made is that outlined by Waller LJ in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Skandia</span> to this effect: although reliance on an expert will always be a highly significant factor in any assessment of loss and damage, it will not <span style="text-decoration:underline">on its own </span>be enough, in every case, to prove that the claimant has acted reasonably. Moreover, in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Skandia,</span> Waller LJ made clear that to put in issue the reasonableness of a decision based on expert advice “does not require proof of conduct amounting to professional negligence or something of that sort.” That seems to me, with respect, to be entirely right and, for a variety of reasons, directly apposite in the present case (see, for example, the point about the cumulative nature of the Claimant’s position, towards the end of paragraph 822 above).</p>

Instead, Mr Williamson QC and Mr Selby are obliged to advance a much wider proposition on his behalf, to the effect that, on the basis of <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span>, Mr McGlinn’s reliance upon the advice from Charter in July 2004 was, on its own, enough to mean that the court must take the demolition and rebuilding costs as the measure of his loss in the present case, regardless of whether the Items in the Scott Schedule are proved to be defects or not, and regardless of each Defendant’s actual liability for the individual Items alleged against them in that Schedule.   In his oral closing, Mr Williamson QC properly accepted that this wide proposition was nowhere expressly articulated by Judge Newey, but he submitted that it followed logically from the judgment in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span>.   Mr Bartlett QC and Mr Hamilton disagreed completely and, as previously noted, were joined in that submission by the other two Defendants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The decision in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> was based upon notions of foreseeability and causation.   But in the present case, the Claimant’s claim based on the cost of demolition and rebuilding takes no account of the Defendants’ (different) liabilities for the Items which are said to justify such a drastic decision, whether as alleged by Mr McGlinn in the Scott Schedule or – perhaps more importantly - as found by the court in the earlier parts of this Judgment.  Thus, on the Claimant’s case, DJH, as the engineers, are liable for the costs (or an allocation of them) of demolition and rebuilding, even though the evidence made clear that the reasons for demolition and rebuilding were nothing to do with any defects in either the M&amp;E services, or the structural aspects of the building.   That is not – it cannot be – a reasonably foreseeable consequence of DJH’s original breach.   This, so it seems to me, is an overarching reason why the demolition/rebuild option is an inappropriate measure of loss in this case:  it is simply unforeseeable.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, the particular position of DJH makes this point starkly.  The experts have agreed that the liability of DJH for the basic costs of repair can be measured in the maximum sum (assuming full liability for everything, which is not the case) of £190,296.  That figure is calculated by reference to the individual Items within the Scott Schedule alleged against DJH, and the cost of repairing each of them.  To that base cost must be added an amount for preliminaries, fees and so on, which, on the Claimant’s case, might as much as double the final figure to, say, £380,000.  However, that is to be compared with the primary pleaded claim against DJH, which is in the sum of over £1 million (see A2/484), and which is said to be 25% of the total cost of demolition and rebuilding.  The 25% appears to be an arbitrary apportionment percentage advanced by the Claimant in its pleading, although it was not identified in the evidence, and did not feature in the Claimant’s closing submissions.  The vast difference between these two figures is an eloquent demonstration of how and why the Claimant’s development of the <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Great Ormond Street</span> principle is inappropriate in the present case:  it leads to an unforeseeable and unreasonable result.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even in respect of HTA, who are liable for more Items in the Scott Schedule, the same reasoning applies.   Assume, in the Claimant’s favour, that the eight defects in Category 1.1 of the Scott Schedule justified the demolition of the external walls.  Four of those defects (Items 1.1.5 – 1.1.8), including important allegations concerning wall ties and the like, were never made against HTA.  Already, therefore, it would be difficult to justify demolition (even of the external walls alone) as against HTA in circumstances where it was never part of Mr McGlinn’s case that HTA were liable for some of the significant defects in those walls that resulted in the advice to demolish.  Furthermore, even in respect of the four Category 1.1 Items which are alleged against HTA, I have found that HTA are not liable for three out of four of them.   On that basis it is impossible to say that HTA should reasonably have foreseen that their liability for one relatively minor Item in Category 1.1 (Item 1.1.1, which was concerned solely with copings) would render them liable for the cost of the complete demolition and rebuilding of those walls.  </p>

Again, such a situation would simply not be foreseeable.  The defendant’s one default has not caused the demolition and rebuilding, so that cannot be the appropriate measure of loss.</p>

Instead, the Claimant has taken the total figure for demolition and repair and, in his pleadings, then allocated this on a 75%/25% split as between HTA and DJH.

If I may say so, that was an unscientific approach to the assessment of damages after a 23 day trial.  The contrast with the detailed and agreed figures for the cost of repair of each Item in the Schedule could not be more marked.  It is for that reason that I consider, in this case, that the wide proposition relied on by the Claimant ignores the practicalities of assessing damages in a case of this sort, and is contrary to common sense.</p>

In such circumstances, no judge or arbitrator would use the global claim to allocate (imperfectly) sums to any of the delay events, when there was already in existence an agreed figure for the cost consequences of that specific event.

It is certainly right that would be one of the consequences of my decision not to base the assessment of loss on the costs of demolition and repair.  But I am not persuaded that this gives rise to an unjust or unreasonable result.  I have very much in mind the fact that the vast majority of the Items in the Scott Schedule were alleged against Waltham, and many were apparently admitted.

Therefore, it may be said with some justice that Mr McGlinn’s inability to recover that £250,000 odd is largely the consequence of Waltham’s financial demise, and subsequent absence from the trial as an active Defendant. That, of course, cannot be the responsibility of the other Defendants.  Furthermore, I note that, since practical completion was never certified, Mr McGlinn retained the sum of £127,267 as against Waltham (see the figures set out in Interim Certificate 30, dated 27.12.01).  In the round, it might be said that that sum (which would otherwise have been payable to Waltham on completion of the works) amounted to their contribution to the costs of demolition.  </p>

Thankfully, these disputes are not significant.    At paragraph 591 of HTA’s closing submissions, Mr Bartlett QC and Mr Hamilton confine themselves to the contention that, where there is a difference, Mr Linnett’s figures are more likely to be reliable “for obvious reasons”.   The Claimant’s closing submissions, at paragraphs 752-755, provide a little more detail as to why it is said on behalf of Mr McGlinn that Mr Fitch’s approach on rates was the right one.   I have concluded that, on this point, the Claimant’s submissions are to be preferred.   </p>

Secondly, as to the appropriate labour rate (which formed the bulk of the cross-examination), I accept Mr Fitch’s explanation of the reasonableness of the labour rate that he used.   I note that that rate was broadly accepted by Mr Pontin and Mr Pope, the quantum experts acting for DJH and WL.   Moreover, I agree that much of the cross-examination of Mr Fitch in relation to rates was, in truth, a challenge to the appropriate workscope in respect of a particular item. That, of course, was not a matter for Mr Fitch at all.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no pleaded figure in relation to this individual Item.   As a result of my repeated requests for such information, as part of their closing submissions, Mr Williamson QC and Mr Selby produced Appendix 2, which purported to provide a figure for each Item in the Scott Schedule.   In some respects this exercise might be regarded as unfair, since it contained specific figures which had not been separately identified before.   However, in relation to a number of the Items for which I have found HTA liable, it was clear to me that Appendix 2 was expressly based upon the existing break-downs provided by Mr Fitch as part of his expert’s report, with suitable deductions to reflect elements of work that were not relevant to the particular Scott Schedule Item in question. In other words, the material in Appendix 2 was already in the evidence; it was just being used in a new way. Item 1.1.1 was a good example of this. I am satisfied that the figure in Appendix 2 of £8,872 for Item 1.1.1 was a proper extrapolation of the relevant figures, which can all be found in Mr Fitch’s build-up under Item 1.2.3.  From this falls to be deducted the agreed sum of £5,145.46, in order to avoid double recovery under Item 4.1.3, for which I have also found HTA liable. Accordingly, I find the (now agreed) sum of <span style="font-weight:bold">£3,726.44</span> is due in respect of Item 1.1.1.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In many ways the damages due in consequence of Item 1.2.3 (which for this purpose also includes Item 1.2.5) have been the most problematic to quantify, for the reasons explained in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section F2.8</span> above.   I refer in particular to paragraphs 378-382 above, which explain how and why I have found that this defect, although a breach of contract on the part of HTA, did not and could not warrant the complete demolition and rebuilding of the external walls.   How then are the damages for this Item to be assessed?   In my judgment, I have to arrive at a fair figure on the basis of the evidence, bearing in mind Lord Mustill’s comment in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ruxley</span> that “judges are well accustomed to putting figures to intangibles, and I see no reason why the imprecision of the exercise should be a barrier, if that is what fairness demands.” On the basis of Mr Fitch’s break-down sheet at D5/1228, I have concluded that the right course for me to take is to allow just those items which are concerned with the provision of new lintels, cills, quoins and other stone banding, namely J/11, J/12, J/13, J/14, J/15 and AG/7, making a total of £44,556. To that I add an allowance for demolition/removal of the existing lintels and banding, in the sum of £5,000, making a total of £49,556. To that I add the agreed Jersey uplift of £8,465.64, and deduct the agreed differential between the cost of granite and reconstituted stone of £29,010.82. This produces a (now agreed) sum for this Item of <span style="font-weight:bold">£29,010.82</span>. I regard that as the appropriate damages figure for Item 1.2.3 (including Item 1.2.5) and the fact that it works out at about 25% of the total figure originally claimed for this Item only serves to confirm my view that, in the round, it is a fair and reasonable assessment of the appropriate damages due.</p>

However, Mr Fitch’s break-down sheets indicate a unit cost of £650 for a new window (see, for example, D5/1233). Thus I assess this Item in the sum of £1,300.

For the reasons set out above, I prefer Mr Fitch’s approach to the figures.    Accordingly, the right starting point for the quantification of this Item is £65,764. From that falls to be deducted a figure of £2,911 to reflect the fact that some of the tiles could have been re-used. This deduction was calculated in a separate document provided by the Claimant following the hearing on 8 February 2007, which calculation I accept. HTA sought to argue for a larger reduction to reflect the likely re-use of the slates, but I have concluded that only the bulk tiles could have been reused, not the specially cut tiles used at hips, ridges and valleys. In addition, I have concluded that only about 25% of the tiles would have been capable of re-use following the stripping of the roof, and that there would have been an additional labour cost, calculated by Mr Fitch at £10.75 per square metre, associated with the sorting through of the slates to work out which could be re-used. That rate is in line with other rates calculated by Mr Fitch, which I have accepted. The final figure for this Item was therefore <span style="font-weight:bold">£62,853</span>.</p>

I have already explained that I prefer Mr Fitch’s approach.    However, a deduction from Mr Fitch’s figure is necessary to reflect the point in paragraph 539 above, that there were no defects in the joinery in the wine cellars.   That specific part of the claim was valued in the sum of £12,000. Accordingly, the starting point for the assessment of this Item is £142,792 less £12,000, a total of £130,792. From this sum falls to be deducted the agreed figure of £2,280 to allow for the Jersey uplift on the wine cellar element; £853.53, being the agreed deduction for dado and skirting; and £3,750 and £1,547 which are deductions referable to various elements of joinery in Bedroom 4, where I have concluded that there were no defects and therefore no recoverable damages.

I have already made the point (see paragraph 115 above) that next to nothing appeared to happen between the summer of 2002 and the middle of 2003.    Secondly, as noted in paragraph 125 above, I consider that the enabling works were on too grand a scale (and therefore took too long) if their principal purpose was simply to decide whether to repair or rebuild.    It seems to me that the necessary investigative works should have been completed by late 2002/early 2003, which was, after all, one year after Waltham left site. The repair work would then have been completed by early 2004 at the latest, making the March 2005 assessment date generous to the Claimant.   </p>

The repair works would plainly have taken many months to complete.    But, given that the original contract work scope (before the changes and variations) was estimated to take one year, I do not consider that a period of eight months for the necessary repair work to an existing property is unreasonable.   Thus, again, it seems to me that the works should have been finished by 31 March 2005.   </p>

In the five years since Waltham left site, all that has happened is an excessive opening-up scheme, and the demolition of the house.   This has a direct bearing on the proper date for the assessment of the repair costs.    Perhaps because Maison d’Or is not Mr McGlinn’s principal property, there have been extensive delays on his part in deciding what steps to take in relation to the property and when to spend the money on necessary works.    I do not consider that there can be any basis for requiring HTA (or DJH) to pay for those delays.   They were wholly unforeseeable.    </p>

The Claimant’s claim is based on Mr Fitch’s careful ascertainment of a wide variety of on-costs which he considers would be incurred by reference to a full remedial scheme based upon all the Items in the Scott Schedule.    That assessment produces a figure for preliminaries in the sum of £475,517.    Mr Linnett, on behalf of HTA, contends that the right approach is to allow a 13% uplift on the repair costs which have been allowed, to reflect preliminaries, including supervision.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have come to the conclusion that Mr Fitch’s calculation of the preliminaries relating to the repair work is inappropriate and unworkable for a number of reasons.   Those are set out below.    I have also come to the view that applying a percentage uplift is the most appropriate, and certainly the fairest, means by which I can assess the appropriate amount for preliminaries.    My reasons are again set out below.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point is that, as Mr Fitch made plain, his assessment of the necessary preliminaries was based upon the full scope of the remedial scheme proposed on behalf of Mr McGlinn.   In other words, his calculation of preliminaries assumed that HTA would be liable for each and every Item in the Scott Schedule which was alleged against them.    For the reasons set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section F2</span> above, HTA do not have anything like that liability.    Because Mr Fitch repeated on a number of occasions that his calculation of preliminaries depended entirely upon the basic work scope, he accepted that if the remedial scheme (to which the preliminaries would be an on-cost) was lesser in extent than the full scheme, he had done no calculation of the preliminaries appropriate to that lesser scheme.   That is, of course, not a criticism of Mr Fitch, because I accept that he could not possibly do a calculation to meet every eventuality.    But it does mean that there is no assessment of what items of on-cost would be appropriate to the remedial scheme necessary to rectify only those Items in the Scott Schedule for which I have found HTA liable.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Therefore, it follows from this that, despite Mr Fitch’s painstaking work, there is no evidence before me of what the appropriate preliminary items and on-costs would be by reference to the remedial works for which I have found HTA liable.    It is simply not appropriate for the court to do its own assessment of what preliminaries might be required and what might not: as Mr Fitch made clear, there is no evidence on which such an assessment could properly be based.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, I have no doubt that Mr Fitch’s calculation of preliminaries was over-stated.    I can identify that in two separate ways.    First, I note that his figure of £475,517 was more than half the cost of his own basic figure for the repair costs themselves, namely £870,066.    I do not accept that any contractor pricing for work adds a 50+% uplift for preliminaries: if he did, he would quickly be out of business.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also right to say that some of the individual items in Mr Fitch’s calculation are also over-stated.    For example, the evidence demonstrated that, for the enabling works, a hoist was bought in the sum of £12,000.    Yet Mr Fitch’s preliminaries included the cost of hiring a hoist for 52 weeks, in the total sum of £36,000.    It was plainly unreasonable to claim against HTA the equivalent of the net cost of three new hoists.    In addition, the repair works were identified as lasting 52 weeks, but there was no independent evidence that it would have taken this long, and for the reasons that I have given above at paragraph 878, I do not consider that the remedial works would have taken more than about 8 months.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, I have concluded that Mr Fitch’s calculation of preliminaries was excessive and was, in any event, calculated by reference to a remedial scheme for which HTA have not been found liable.

Mr Fitch did not suggest a higher percentage.   Although he criticised the use of SPONS for a job of this kind, I am not persuaded that that was a fair criticism.     Both experts agreed that the SPONS’ rates applied to a wide range of jobs and there was no evidence that it would not apply to a project such as Maison d’Or.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common in the estimating and tendering process for contractors to identify a contingency sum, to reflect possible unknown elements of the work scope.    It is more unusual to see a contingency claim maintained in a trial of this sort, because the aim of the assessment of damages is to arrive at a precise calculation of the compensation properly payable to Mr McGlinn.   No authority was brought to my attention in which an award of a contingency sum on repair costs has been made.    However, as a matter of principle, I can see that there may be cases in which it is appropriate, and I have concluded that this is one such case.   My reasons are set out below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I am not attracted to HTA’s argument that, because the repair works are notional, no contingency fee is due at all.    Although the repair works are now not going to be carried out, at least in this form, they still represent the correct measure of damage, for the reasons set out above.    Accordingly, if it would have been reasonable and appropriate for a contractor bidding for this repair work contract to allow for an additional sum, to reflect the fact that it was more likely than not that, when the building was opened up, the eventual work scope would increase rather than decrease, then I consider that the assessment of damages can properly include for such a contingency sum.    However, it seems to me that the court has to be very careful to ensure that the amount of any contingency sum properly reflects the pricing risk.   Thus, if there is doubt about it, either no contingency sum should be allowed at all, or any sum that is allowed should be measured in modest terms. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I have concluded that, on the facts of this case, it is appropriate to add a modest sum as a contingency allowance.    My principal reason for that conclusion is my appreciation of the fact that, here, certain defects were only discovered after a good deal of investigation.    It must therefore be likely that some further defects, albeit relatively modest in nature, would have been discovered during the carrying out of repair works.  In addition, I consider that, if the repair works had gone out to tender, the tenderers would inevitably have sought a contingency allowance.  Accordingly, I consider that a modest contingency sum is allowable by way of damages in this case.    </p>

I consider that the contingency uplift should not be more than 5%.   That is therefore the amount that I award.    5% on the sum of £330,551.81 (being the total of £292,523.73 and £38,028.08) is <span style="font-weight:bold">£16,527.59</span>.</p>

I have already made the point that this was an absurdly large sum to have spent on investigation and opening up, particularly when the basic remedial scheme, for all Items, was costed by the Claimant’s team in the sum of just £870,066.   A number of major disputes arise in relation to this claim.   They include the claim for the costs of the lay-by built to provide additional parking/storage space;   the extent to which the claims for other physical works are more properly described as claims for costs, not damages; and the claim for professional fees already incurred, which totals £302,425.76, and is thus the largest single element of this head of loss.    In relation to this latter item, one of the principal arguments that arises is again whether or not these fees are recoverable as damages, or whether, if recoverable at all, they are recoverable as costs.

Indeed, it appears from the documents that part of the original HTA/DJH scheme involved the construction of three parking bays on the site.   However, as DJH’s minutes of the meeting of 19 November 1998 make plain, this element of the proposed scheme was abandoned as part of the cost-saving exercise.    Therefore, it might fairly be said that Mr McGlinn’s claim against HTA now is an attempt to make them pay for work which he declined to finance originally for cost/budget reasons.    That plainly cannot be right as a matter of principle.   </p>

The evidence was that, if the temporary permission could be made permanent, then that would constitute a significant benefit to Mr McGlinn and to the property.   From the evidence, I cannot conclude that planning permission will not be made permanent:    on the evidence, it already seems to have acquired some permanence, and I find that, on the balance of probabilities, it will become permanent.   Again, therefore, on that basis, it would be wrong in principle to make HTA pay for the construction of something which was of positive benefit to Mr McGlinn.    </p>

It has not been explained why the lay-by was necessary for the demolition and rebuilding, when it was not necessary for the more significant works first time round.   Moreover, given that HTA are liable only for the repair elements of the work, and not the demolition and rebuilding, there is even less to link HTA’s default with the construction of the lay-by.    There was no evidence that the entire repair scheme (let alone the repair work for those Items for which HTA are liable) necessitated this lay-by.</p>

In those circumstances, I reject the attempt to get HTA to pay for this enhancement.   In any event, I do not consider that this was a recoverable or foreseeable head of loss.

In addition, because of the various criticisms that I make about the enabling works in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section C14</span> above, and the point made above as to the problems in principle with recovering these sums as damages (as opposed to costs), it seems to me that it would be wrong to allow anything like the full recovery of these sums as damages in any event.

In my judgment, taking into account all the evidence that I heard, these fees are unreasonably high. In addition, there is considerable force in HTA’s other complaint about the fees, namely that these fees were incurred in what they call the “hunt for defects and the recording of evidence for forensic purposes”, so that, to the extent that they are recoverable at all, they would be recoverable as legal costs, not damages (see paragraph 910 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the evidence, there can be no doubt at all that the majority of the professional fees were incurred in identifying and recording in minute detail the defects that existed at Maison d’Or.  Much of the fees went on the complex system of record sheets and cross references.   The Charter witnesses agreed that their principal role was indeed to identify such matters for the purposes of the imminent litigation.    Accordingly, I am in no doubt that the majority of the professional fees are not recoverable as damages. If they are recoverable at all, they are recoverable as part of the costs of the litigation: see <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Bolton v Mahadeva </span>[1972] 1 W.L.R. 1009 at 1014, CA. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulties with this as a claim for damages were significantly compounded by the fact that there was nothing to indicate precisely what Charter, or the other professionals, were doing during their time on site.  Their records demonstrate what hours they spent at Maison d’Or, but do not indicate precisely what they were doing during those periods.    It is doubtless for this reason that Mr Fitch could not support the appropriateness or reasonableness of those fees:   it remains a mystery precisely what Charter, and others, were doing at any given time to justify these considerable fees.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All of that said, I recognise that, just as there was some modest element of the physical enabling works for which HTA were properly liable, there must be an element of the fees payable to Charter, and the other professionals, in relation to those works, which would also be recoverable against HTA by way of damages.    Mr Bartlett QC and Mr Hamilton submit that it is impossible for the court to identify what the recoverable element of the fees might be, so that nothing at all should be awarded.    That, of course, is an unattractive option for the court to take, and not in accordance with Lord Mustill’s comment in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ruxley</span> (see paragraph 854 above).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that I do have a rough and ready way of calculating those professional fees, incurred in respect of the enabling works, which could be said to be recoverable against HTA as damages, because they related to the actual physical works being carried out in respect of Items for which I have found HTA liable, as opposed to the exercise of evidence-gathering for the litigation.   It will be recalled that the experts have agreed that a reasonable total professional percentage on the prospective repair works is 9.55%.   There is no reason in principle why that would not be an appropriate percentage by which to calculate that proportion of the professional fees recoverable as damages against HTA in connection with the enabling works which have been carried out. If I apply 9.55% to the amount of the enabling works for which HTA are liable, namely £53,514.62, I arrive at a figure of <span style="font-weight:bold">£5,110.65</span>.   That seems to me to be a reasonable assessment of the professional fees payable by HTA by way of damages on that element of the enabling works for which they are liable.   I make it clear that any other sums would have to be sought by way of costs, rather than damages, and it is very unclear the extent to which such sums could be recovered in any event. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a large claim for storage costs in the sum of £69,948.26.    The Claimant’s claim is that soft furnishings and furniture, including chairs and sofas, and a billiard table, have been stored since late 2001 in two different locations off-site.   The assumption behind the claim appears to be that at no stage was Maison d’Or in a condition to allow those furnishings and furniture to be taken to Jersey and installed.    </p>

Clearly, for the reasons set out above, a certain amount of remedial work was required to Maison d’Or.  But there is nothing to suggest that, in early 2002, the furnishings and the furniture could not have been delivered and installed at Maison d’Or.  Neither is there any evidence that, on the basis of the limited repair works for which HTA are liable, any furniture or furnishings would have had to have been stored off-site while they were carried out.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, there is an inherent confusion about the entire basis of this claim, apparent in the Claimant’s own pleading.    This claim was added by amendment in September 2006 and was said to be based on the position “following the demolition of the premises”.   The demolition, of course, happened only in 2005, whilst the bulk of the claim for storage actually pre-dates the demolition. The suggestion in the pleaded claim is that this head of loss is dependant on the success of the demolition case: since that case has failed, it would follow that this claim must fail with it.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> I conclude that there were no breaches of contract on the part of HTA which justified the non-delivery of the stored items to the Maison d’Or.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should also add that there were a number of other unsatisfactory elements of the Claimant’s pleaded claim in respect of storage charges, which also lead me to reject it.    It appears that Mr McGlinn did not actually pay any storage charges to start with because, other than the billiard table, the soft furnishings were stored by Disdale.    Although there was a suggestion that TDD later endeavoured to recover these costs from Mr McGlinn, there is no evidence that they were actually paid.   In addition, if the pleaded claim were right, the storage charges were becoming greater than the value of the furnishings and furniture being stored.  That would suggest a failure to mitigate.</p>

The difference concerns the amount of wall tiling that would also have needed to be replaced as a result of this Item.   The Claimant contends that all of the wall tiles would need to be replaced in order to facilitate the under floor heating work, whereas DJH maintain that only the first two courses of wall tiles had to be replaced.

Indeed, the same reasoning applies even more forcefully to the position of DJH, given that, as the evidence demonstrated, it was almost impossible to identify with any precision what sort of preliminaries might be required in relation to the limited repair work for which they are liable.   Accordingly, I have no doubt that the 13% preliminaries uplift provides the best way of arriving at a fair assessment of the on-costs for which DJH are liable.    The sums recoverable for repair costs against DJH are £14,909, £6,773, and £81,667.75, making a total of <span style="font-weight:bold">£103,349.75</span>. The 13% uplift for preliminaries would therefore be <span style="font-weight:bold">£13,435.47</span>.</p>

I have explained why a project manager is not an appropriate additional cost.   The total percentage for professional fees is 9.95%.    That percentage should be applied to DJH’s liability for the repair costs, including the preliminaries and the contingency, a total figure of £122,624.48.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Much of the reasoning set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section L7</span> above in relation to this head of claim applies, with even more force, to the sister claim against DJH.    Thus, for those reasons, DJH have no liability in respect of the costs of the lay-by.    Moreover, unlike HTA, it is difficult to see that any significant physical works were carried out in connection with the structural and/or M&amp;E defects for which I have now found DJH liable. For DJH, there were no equivalent elements of the enabling works, such as the work to the roof, for which I have found HTA liable, and which has triggered, for them, a limited liability to pay damages by reference to the costs of those works. In addition, I am confident that the work carried out by the professionals to identify the defects and to sort out the case against DJH related directly to the anticipated litigation, and was therefore recoverable (if at all) as costs, not damages.   Thus, I find that, to the extent that any element of the enabling works or professional fees was referable to DJH, it was properly classifiable as costs, not damages: it was costs incurred in respect of the conduct of the anticipated proceedings, not to help the Claimant deal with DJH’s breaches of contract.    I therefore decline to allow any amount by way of damages against DJH in respect of either the enabling works themselves, or the professional fees incurred in respect of such works.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject that analysis.    It seems to me that the compromise agreement of 1 October 2002 compromised HTA’s fee claim for the payment of the sum of £54,594.    Any attempt to alter that amount must involve the setting aside of the compromise agreement and its effective replacement with an amended agreement.     It is pure sophistry to argue that an attempt of this sort to change the amount payable under an agreement is not an attempt to set aside the agreement itself.    It may be that this argument stemmed from the undoubted difficulties in which the Claimant otherwise found himself, in the light of the very limited circumstances in which the courts have condoned the setting aside of compromise agreements.</p>

That identified the sum to be paid by Mr McGlinn to HTA and the mechanics of payment.    It is clear and unambiguous.    Accordingly, as a matter of construction of the agreement, I find that there could have been no mistake as to the effect of the agreement.   Mr McGlinn was paying £54,594 in full and final settlement of HTA’s outstanding fees.   It really was as simple as that.  </p>

I refer to the passages from <span style="font-weight:bold">Foskett</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Goff &amp; Jones</span> set out above.  They both emphasise that, to obtain the necessary relief, the Claimant needs to demonstrate a proper case of mistake:   what the mistake was, how it came about, and whether it was the responsibility of the payee.    In the present case, there was no evidence of mistake.    Mr McGlinn gave no evidence about the agreement at all, let alone any mistake that he might have made, whilst Mr Ward of Eversheds, the person who drafted the agreement for Mr McGlinn, was not called to give any evidence.    In the absence of any evidence of mistake, I do not consider that the Claimant is entitled to seek an order from the court allowing him to alter the agreement that he entered into.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is suggested that I can infer the mistake from the documents.  I do not accept that.    On Mr McGlinn’s case the operative mistake was the reference to the £200,406 “already paid”.    It is said that this was obviously wrong and, once that figure was replaced with the correct figure, the sum payable to HTA was automatically reduced to the £13,000 odd. But whilst the gross payment figure was wrong, so too was the total stated for the gross fees claimed which, although identified in the letter at £286,000, was actually higher than that. As noted above, HTA’s total fee entitlement was as much as £345,133.38.    Accordingly, both of the two figures quoted in paragraph 1 of the letter were wrong:   the total claims made and the total sums paid were both under-estimated.   Neither of those errors necessarily meant that there was a mistake as to the amount payable to settle the claim in 2002, much less a mistake that was referable to or caused by HTA.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In many ways, I consider that paragraph 1 of the agreement contained a series of preambles.     Some of those preambles contained errors.    In my judgment, those errors did not affect the unambiguous agreement by the parties as to the payment of the £54,594.    Moreover, in one sense, those two errors cancel each other out so that, whilst the sum already paid by Mr McGlinn was actually higher than recorded in paragraph 1, so too were the total claims for fees that had been made by HTA.    Thus, any error in the one figure is broadly balanced out by the error in the other.  </p>

There was no pleaded misrepresentation, duress, undue influence or lack of good faith.   There was no evidence of a mistake of fact.    Even if, contrary to my view, I could infer a mistake of fact, there was no express or implied term of the compromise agreement that, in the event of the parties being mistaken as to the sums previously paid by Mr McGlinn, the money should be repaid.   There was nothing to suggest that the agreement was entered into on the basis of a mistake shared by both parties as to some fact of fundamental importance;   indeed, I do not believe that there was any mistake properly so called on the part of either of these parties.    They were aware that HTA had claims for fees that were well in excess of what had previously been paid and they knew (and agreed) what Mr McGlinn was prepared to pay in 2002 to compromise those claims.    They compromised the claims on the basis that the sum of £54,594 would be paid by Mr McGlinn, and it was so paid.    There is no basis in law, and no evidential support, for undoing or re-writing any part of that agreement. </p>

He has not demonstrated an entitlement to restitution.    That claim fails.   It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider HTA’s alternative arguments based upon any opening up of the agreement of 1 October 2002.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">DJH’s pleaded counterclaim in respect of outstanding fees is in the sum of £161,476.   Broadly speaking, there are three issues which arise on this counterclaim for fees.   They are: the correct sum to which the percentage fee should be applied (<span style="font-weight:bold">Section P2</span> below); the appropriate percentages to be applied to that sum (<span style="font-weight:bold">Section P3</span> below); and whether or not DJH are entitled to a claim for “additional duties/transition” (<span style="font-weight:bold">Section P4</span> below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pursuant to their contract, DJH were entitled to a percentage of “the project cost”.     The issue that then arises is this:   how should “the project cost” be calculated?   DJH maintain that the project cost should be that ascertained by WL in their calculation of Waltham’s Final Account.    That final account figure is in the sum of £4,372,841.    The Claimant, on the other hand, contends that “the project cost” must mean the proper value of Waltham’s work, and since he contends that Waltham have been significantly overpaid for the work that they have done, he claims that DJH’s entitlement to a percentage fee must be calculated by reference to the final account figure produced at the end of the valuation trial, currently due later in the year.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a matter of common sense, I would be reluctant to conclude that the project cost should automatically equate to the sum paid by Mr McGlinn to Waltham.    It might do;   it may be that, on an analysis of those sums paid, I conclude that that was a reasonable valuation of the work carried out by Waltham.   But as things presently stand, there must be a real risk that that will not be the case.   Mr McGlinn seeks to challenge the reasonableness of the sums valued by WL and paid to Waltham and part of that challenge is based on criticisms of DJH’s valuations of the mechanical and electrical work.    In those circumstances, it would be wrong as a matter of principle to conclude that, although the valuation of Waltham’s work remains a live issue, DJH’s entitlement to fees should be calculated by reference to the original (disputed) valuation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Take a simple example.    Assume that Waltham sought the sum of £10,000 in respect of an element of the mechanical and electrical work and that, through a slip in their valuation processes, or even just because of a typographical error, DJH valued the item at £100,000.   As part of the valuation dispute that will form the second trial in this case, those facts, without more, would lead me to conclude that that element of work had been overvalued, and Waltham had been overpaid, in the amount of £90,000.     In such circumstances, it would be a nonsense for me to have already concluded that DJH’s percentage fees should be calculated on a figure which included that £90,000.    There would, I think, be no rational basis for such a decision.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At paragraph 89 of his closing submissions, Mr Whitting makes the fair point that this conclusion would mean that there would never be certainty in the award of scale fees, because it would always be open to employers to criticise, or to seek to vary, the figure in the Final Account.    Up to a point, this is true, although I think that it is an inevitable consequence of an open-ended percentage arrangement such as the present one.    Moreover, it is not a problem that arises very frequently because, more often than not, an employer comes to an agreement with his professional advisers (of the sort reached between Mr McGlinn and HTA and discussed in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section O</span> above), so that the final, adjusted out-turn cost is often not relevant to the calculation of the fees.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, in my judgment, the reference in the DJH contract letters to “the project cost” must be taken to mean the final ascertained project cost.  At present, of course, this is an unknown figure and it is therefore not possible finally to determine at this stage the final amount of DJH’s fee entitlement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are of course two elements to the DJH work.    In relation to the mechanical and electrical work, the agreed percentage was 1.88%.   However, in their closing submissions, DJH accepted that the percentage should be abated, and the parties have agreed a reduced percentage figure of 1.84%.   This abatement reflects the fact that, as discussed in <span style="font-weight:bold">Section G4</span> above, the mechanical and electrical works were not completed by the time DJH’s contract with Mr McGlinn came to an end.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The more difficult dispute concerns the structural engineering percentage.    The contract letter (paragraph 682 above) identified a percentage of 4.5%.    This percentage was not dissented from and formed the basis of DJH’s invoices and Mr McGlinn’s payments.    However, Mr McGlinn now says that this significantly over-stated the proper scale fee and the relevant percentage should only have been 2.6%.    It is therefore said on his behalf that the fees should be recalculated using the 2.6%.    Essentially, therefore, Mr McGlinn seeks to substitute the agreed percentage with a reasonable or appropriate percentage.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant’s case faces a significant difficulty as a matter of principle.    It has long been established that, where an express agreement for the payment of a particular sum has been reached, that express agreement cannot be modified or changed for the payment of a “reasonable sum”.     A specific agreement will always override an implied entitlement/liability in respect of a reasonable sum:   see, for example, <span style="font-weight:bold">Keating on Construction Contracts</span>, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition, paragraph 13-067 and the case referred to in the text there, <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Gilbert &amp; Partners v Knight</span> [1968] 2 All ER 248.   Accordingly, there can be no basis in principle which would permit Mr McGlinn retrospectively and unilaterally to vary the clear term of the contract which he had accepted as long ago as 1998.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In their closing submissions, Mr Williamson QC and Mr Selby say that the 4.5% should be varied because it was based on a misrepresentation.   They point to the words in the letter which make plain that “the scale fee for normal duties, in accordance with the above document equates to 5% of the project cost …”    They contend that this was a misrepresentation which would allow Mr McGlinn to make a claim for damages for the difference between the sum paid and the sum which ought to have been paid but for the misrepresentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with this submission is that, as Mr Whitting bitterly complains, it is simply not pleaded.   Mr Whitting says that this is a new argument which has never been particularised.    Is it said that the representation is negligent or fraudulent?    Is it a misrepresentation of fact or a misrepresentation of opinion?    He submits that this is not a matter which should be open to the Claimant in the absence of a proper pleading.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded that Mr Whitting is right in these submissions.    There is no proper pleading of a case for misrepresentation in the letter of 27 May 1998.    This is not simply a technical point, because I also think that Mr Whitting is right to say that the precise nature of the misrepresentation would have needed to be spelt out; the relief available, if any, would depend on the precise nature of the pleaded claim for misrepresentation.    Moreover, any application to amend at the start of, or during, the trial might have been extremely difficult, given that a stand-alone claim for misrepresentation might now be statute-barred.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For all these reasons, I consider that the parties agreed that DJH would be paid 4.5% of the project cost in respect of their structural engineering work.  This was a clear term of the contract and was not qualified by, or dependent upon, the way in which that percentage had been purportedly calculated.    I am not prepared to allow Mr McGlinn to re-open the terms of the original contract, just as I would not be prepared to allow DJH to do the same if the percentage quoted had, on analysis, proved to be low as against the usual fee scale.   Accordingly, I find that Mr McGlinn is liable to DJH in respect of 4.5% of the project cost, following the ascertainment of that project cost at the second trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">DJH’s claim for outstanding fees is based on their invoice of 19 April 2002.   That included a gross claim of £30,365 under the heading “time charges for transition”.     It appeared that, at the time that the claim was made, this was a claim for fees in respect of the reductions in the design in late 1998.    Mr Ellerington’s evidence, which is dealt with in greater detail below, suggested that this claim incorporated other matters.    Notwithstanding that, I have concluded, for the reasons set out below, that this element of DJH’s fee claim should be disallowed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To the extent that this is a claim for the fees incurred in respect of the reduction to the work scope, I do not consider that this is payable under the terms of DJH’s contract.    They are entitled to a percentage on the project cost; they are not entitled to additional fees based on work done in respect of the reduction of the proposed project work scope.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If I was wrong about that, I would in any event conclude that DJH had effectively waived any entitlement to make this claim.    The documents demonstrated that DJH first intimated such a claim at the meeting on 19 November 1998 and a formal claim was made on 21 December that year.    WL then asked DJH to re-issue the relevant invoice based on a project value of £1.5 million (the reduced amount) rather than £2.2 million.    DJH did just that, issuing a revised invoice in a lower figure.     Later, in July 2001, when there was again a suggestion that a claim for a higher fee would be made, WL proposed, and DJH accepted, that the claim should be based on the lower project figure.    Accordingly, not only was the claim of April 2002 the first time that such a claim had been made but I consider that, in the round, DJH’s acceptance, on two separate occasions, of WL’s request that the fees be calculated on the basis of the lower figure amounted to a waiver of any entitlement to a claim in respect of the work scope as originally proposed.    </p>

DJH were always in a certain amount of difficulty in proving this element of the claim.   During the trial, I allowed in a second statement from Mr Ellerington which addressed the fee claim, even though that statement was dated 25 October 2006.     However, I ruled out a third statement from Mr Ellerington, which dealt expressly with this part of the claim, on the grounds that it was only provided hours before Mr Ellerington was due to be cross-examined.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These late statements all stemmed from the fact that the time sheets that were available to Mr Ellerington, when he came to reconstruct this claim some years later, were not clearly linked to any redesign work at all.    This problem was compounded by the fact that the time sheets that had been made available were summary time sheets only, and it was impossible to work out, from a sight of the summary sheet, precisely what had been done and why.   This point was emphatically demonstrated in Mr Ellerington’s cross-examination:   </p>

That was why the third statement from Mr Ellerington – which I refused to admit because it was so late - was so important.    Moreover, I do not accept Mr Whitting’s submission that this is a pleading point, and that to decide this element of the claim against DJH would be to ignore the merits.    On the contrary, I regard it as a question of proving on the balance of probabilities an entitlement to a sum over and above the percentage fee.   For all the reasons which I have indicated, I conclude that no such entitlement has been made out.</p>
