	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The basic problem that gives rise to this litigation can be stated simply and shortly.  The Defendant Secretary of State was conducting three franchise procurement competitions during a period when there was considerable uncertainty about the scope of potential pension liabilities because of intervention by the Pensions Regulator (“TPR”).  The three competitions were for the South Eastern, East Midlands and West Coast Partnership franchises, commonly referred to as the SE, EM and WCP franchises.  It was anticipated that the SE franchise would commence on 1 April 2019 and run for 8 years, that the EM franchise would commence on 18 August 2019 and would run for 8 years, and that the WCP franchise would commence on 15 September 2019 and run for 7 or 12 years.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The WCP franchise differed from the others because it was structured to accommodate the development of the High Speed railway link between London and the North (“HS2”) when that came on stream.  The WCP franchise arrangements provided that when that happened (which was envisaged in the procurement documents as being on 1 April 2026, with provision for it to happen later) the franchisee would run it and the franchise would switch from what was known as the ICWC (InterCity West Coast) period to what was known as the IOC (Integrated Operator Contract) period.  When that switch happened, the financial arrangements would change from being those of a normal franchise to an arrangement under which the Government would bear all costs and revenue risk, with the franchisee being remunerated on a cost reimbursement model to ensure flexible delivery of the integrated West Coast and HS2 services.   </p>

The first is that the Regulation’s “primary objective is not to regulate the procurement of rail passenger services by the Member States but rather to define the extent to which the Member States can grant suppliers of such services compensation out of public funds.”  Second, the Defendant submits that, in order to avoid transgressing EU prohibitions on State aid, it is necessary for public service contracts and general rules to comply with the requirements of the Railway Regulation. Specifically, Article 6 requires that “all compensation connected with a general rule or a public service contract shall comply with Article 4, irrespective of how the contract was awarded”.  Article 4(1) (cited above) requires Public Service contracts and rules to define the services to be provided and the parameters for compensation, as well as determining the arrangements for the allocation of costs, including staff costs, in a way that prevents overcompensation: see Article 4(1)(b). </p>

Nor was the wider scheme of support, which was promoted by the Department but rejected by the Treasury, rejected on grounds that it would or might amount to unlawful State aid.  Second, the scheme of support that the Claimants proposed in their bids was not rejected on the basis that it would or might constitute unlawful State aid.  Third, the existence and terms of the Railway Regulation are an acknowledgement that State aid may be lawful in the context of rail passenger services, provided that “overcompensation” is avoided: see, for example, Recitals 5 and 27.  Fourth, as the Defendant recognises, protection against overcompensation is achieved by a competitive procurement process in which the level of compensation will reflect the level and allocation of risk established by the contract. Recital 33 to the Regulation recognises that compensation does not constitute unlawful State aid provided the <span style="font-style:italic">Altmark</span> conditions are satisfied. The Defendant has not demonstrated that further or different levels of support could not have been adopted without constituting unlawful State aid, provided the last two <span style="font-style:italic">Altmark</span> conditions were satisfied as they would be in any reasonably foreseeable circumstances.  However, the Defendant submits that it is for the Claimants to prove that any increased protection would not have amounted to unlawful State aid.  If there had been any suggestion in the contemporaneous materials before the Court that increased protection had even been questioned on the basis that, although offered in the context of a competitive procurement, it was or might contravene the rules on unlawful State aid, this submission would have substance.  However, so far as I am aware, no such suggestion was ever made, which is not surprising given the context of a competitive procurement exercise.  In other words, unlawful State aid was simply not an issue.  Therefore, and subject to one qualification, although the Defendant in its submissions routinely characterises any level of support (including the PRSM) as State subsidy or indemnity or aid, I do not find this characterisation helpful in trying to decide the </p>

The first is that the Secretary of State’s allocation is a discretionary decision of a kind which the courts have traditionally been particularly reluctant to disturb. There is no “right” answer prescribed by the EU Treaty or the 2013 Regulation to the question how EU Structural Funds should be distributed within a Member State. There is not even any clear principle on which this should be done. Instead, the Secretary of State was required to make a complex evaluation of a wide range of overlapping criteria, all of which involved difficult and sometimes technical judgments about matters of social and economic policy. </p>

The allocation of public expenditure - whether we should spend more or less on defence, health, education, police and so forth, whether at a national or local level - is very much a matter for democratic decision. Furthermore, a court deciding a case which will affect one form of public expenditure - for example, impose a burden of expenditure upon education authorities - has no way of being able to decide whether such expenditure should or should not have a prior claim over other forms of expenditure. It may consider that, viewed in isolation, it is fair and reasonable that children in schools should receive certain benefits or financial compensation for not having received other benefits. But because it can only view the matter in isolation, it has no way of knowing whether this means that other people dependent upon social security, police protection and so on will have to make sacrifices because there is less money for them. The only people who can make such decisions are the democratically elected bodies who are in charge of the budget as a whole. This means that even when a case appears to involve no more than the construction of a statute or interpretation of a common law rule, the courts are very circumspect about giving an answer which would materially affect the distribution of public expenditure.” </p>

The manner in which English law ensures that contractual effect is given to the Article 8 objectives is by treating BT’s discretion under Clause 12 as limited. As a general rule, the scope of a contractual discretion will depend on the nature of the discretion and the construction of the language conferring it. But it is well established that in the absence of very clear language to the contrary, a contractual discretion must be exercised in good faith and not arbitrarily or capriciously: … . This will normally mean that it must be exercised consistently with its contractual purpose: … .  Interconnection agreements are made in a regulated environment. The regulatory scheme may change, quite possibly after interconnection terms have been agreed (as it did in this case). But the intention of the parties must be to comply with the scheme as it stands from time to time so far as the contract permits. That intention necessarily informs the scope and operation of any contractual discretions. In my opinion, it is entirely clear that the discretion conferred by clause 12 of the Standard Interconnect Agreement is limited by reference to the purposes set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive. It follows that contractually BT was entitled to set its own charges, but only within limits which are fixed by those objectives.” </p>

Proportionality as a ground of review of national measures … has been applied most frequently to measures interfering with the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the EU Treaties. Although private interests may be engaged, the court is there concerned first and foremost with the question whether a member state can justify an interference with a freedom guaranteed in the interests of promoting the integration of the internal market, and the related social values, which lie at the heart of the EU project. In circumstances of that kind, the principle of proportionality generally functions as a means of preventing disguised discrimination and unnecessary barriers to market integration. In that context, the court, seeing itself as the guardian of the Treaties and of the uniform application of EU law, generally applies the principle more strictly. Where, however, a national measure does not threaten the integration of the internal market, … a less strict approach is generally adopted. … </p>

This is not the same as a requirement that he must know everything that is relevant. Here, for example, much that was highly relevant was appropriately sifted by the Commission in formulating its advice and then distilled within the department in order to make a submission to the minister which would tell him what it was relevant (not simply expedient or politic) for him to know.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It will therefore always be appropriate and necessary to look to the briefing that has been submitted to the Minister.  Borrowing from principles developed in the context of planning law, documents such as Ministerial Submissions should be subjected to close scrutiny to discover their true meaning.  They should not be read with undue rigour or as if they were a statute but with reasonable benevolence, bearing in mind that they are written for Ministers who may have prior knowledge, general or particular.  “Reasonable benevolence”, to my mind, merely implies a disposition to find coherence if it is there to be found.  In my judgment, the Court should always bear in mind the sifting that will have taken place in the preparation of such documents, and should not be astute to pick up on any and every imperfection that can be identified under the forensic microscope of contested litigation.  The better approach is to look for the coherence in the document and to be concerned only by errors that would or might materially mislead the recipient.  The object is to see whether the Minister had sufficient information to enable her or him to make an informed judgment and whether the reasoning and reasons for the Minister’s decision can be inferred from a combination of the briefing and the decision itself.  But, in my judgment, it would not be justified to elevate this sensible and necessary step into a presumption (let alone a legal presumption) that a Minister will have adopted all of the reasons in a report, even where the Minister has made a decision which is in accordance with the recommendations in the briefing.  The question is one of inference and proof.  In some cases, particularly those that are complex and multifactorial, it may be difficult to infer with any confidence that the Minister accepted all arguments and reasons set out in the briefing.  It may also be undesirable from the decision-maker’s point of view if the briefing contains anything that the Court later holds should not have been relied on.  Those difficulties will be increased if it is apparent that the Minister has accepted some recommendations but rejected others.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Particular problems may also arise where, as in the present case, the materials are incomplete.  For example, the CCS in the present case is heavily redacted for privilege.  It is of course a decision-maker’s right not to waive legal professional privilege; but if it is not waived, it may leave gaps in the relevant information and logic which limit a court’s ability to draw inferences about the decision-maker’s reasons and reasoning with confidence.  In contested litigation, it will always be for the parties to decide what evidence is required in order to substantiate their case.  While I do not suggest that it is or need be the norm for the actual decision-maker to attend court to give evidence about their reasons and reasoning, I do not accept that the combination of a briefing plus a decision will always be sufficient evidence to substantiate what were the reasons in a particular case.  Nor do I accept that the briefing and decision are the only sources of evidence that may be available and admissible.  The questions of inference and proof are to be resolved on the basis of all relevant and admissible evidence. </p>

It is not something I would have chosen to do; it is a matter of regret, but we have done what we are told that clearly we legally have to do. It is also worth saying that it is a matter of public record that across the franchise bids there were six different owning groups that put in bids. Only two of those owning groups were excluded on grounds that they had made non-compliant bids on pensions, so it is not something where the Department is somehow out there.

There is no reason why the Courts should not receive evidence of the proceedings of Parliament when they are simply relevant historical facts or events: no questioning arises in such a case: see 35 above. Similarly, it is of the essence of the judicial function that the courts should determine issues of law arising from legislation and delegated legislation. Thus, there can be no suggestion of a breach of Parliamentary privilege if the Courts decide that legislation is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights: by enacting the Human Rights Act 1998, Parliament has expressly authorised the Court to determine questions of compatibility, even though a Minister may have made a declaration under s 19 of his view that the measure in question is compatible.

If a party to proceedings before a court (or the Information tribunal) seeks to rely on an opinion expressed by a Select Committee, the other party, if it wishes to contend for a different result, must either contend that the opinion of the Committee was wrong (and give reasons why), thereby at the very least risking a breach of Parliamentary privilege, if not committing an actual breach, or, because of the risk of that breach, accept that opinion notwithstanding that it would not otherwise wish to do so. This would be unfair to that party. <span style="font-style:italic">It indicates that a party to litigation should not seek to rely on the opinion of a Parliamentary Committee, since it puts the other party at an unfair disadvantage and, if the other party does dispute the correctness of the opinion of the Committee, would put the tribunal in the position of committing a breach of Parliamentary privilege if it were to accept that the Parliamentary Committee's opinion was wrong.</span>  As Lord Woolf MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Hamilton v Al Fayed</span> at [1999] 1 WLR 1586G, the courts cannot and must not pass judgment on any Parliamentary proceedings.  </p>

Furthermore, if the tribunal either rejects or approves the opinion of the Select Committee it thereby passes judgment on it. To put the same point differently, in raising the possibility of its reliance on the opinion of the Select Committee, the tribunal potentially made it the subject of submission as to its correctness and of inference, which would be a breach of Parliamentary privilege. This is, in my judgment, the kind of submission or inference, to use the words of 16(3) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which is prohibited.” (Emphasis in [58] added) </p>

If the evidence given to a Committee is uncontentious, ie, the parties to the appeal before the tribunal agree that it is true and accurate, I see no objection to its being taken into account. What the tribunal must not do is refer to evidence given to a Parliamentary Committee that is contentious (and it must be treated as such if the parties have not had an opportunity to address it) or to the opinion or finding of the Committee on an issue that the tribunal has to determine.

The issue of parliamentary privilege arose in the context of Ground II, which was that, even if the Minister had the power to make the decision he did, the manner in which the decision was taken was so opaque and confused that it violated the principles of transparency and good administration.  The gist of the argument was that over a period of months, starting with a Ministerial Statement on 6 July 2016, the Secretary of State in public conveyed the message that the action he was taking amounted to a binding decision to impose a contract on doctors and that he had power to make such a decision.

He concluded at [148] that the principle of transparency applied but held that there had been no breach of the principle because, although the Ministerial Statement led to a degree of misapprehension (by which the Judge meant misunderstanding on the part of the doctors) “the Minister has speedily removed that ambiguity or confusion and made his position clear.” </p>

At [156] he identified that the difficulty in that case was that “in a relatively brief statement of reasons an issue of significance to one category of relevant addressee was not spelled out (viz., the scope for negotiations with employers) and did thereby lead to misapprehension.”  In other words, the Ministerial Statement was itself the substance and target of the challenge alleging lack of transparency.

The fact that his answer was obviously not intended to be a complete answer to the question he was not asked is also demonstrated by the complete absence of any detail about what reasons he took into account (either for or against disqualification) that were not legal advice.

This discrepancy is noted by the Claimants in their closing submissions where they point out that the reason given to the TSC is different from those stated in the notification letters on 9 April 2019 and corresponds with only part of the reasoning in the CCS.  So, although the fact that legal advice was given and received is beyond any doubt (as is conclusively shown by the extent of redactions to the CCS), the Secretary of State’s reply to the TSC cries out for questioning and inference about what that advice might have been, as submitted by the Speaker’s Counsel: see [79] above.  The result is that, since the Defendant now runs a more complicated case, it runs the immediate risk of having to challenge the Secretary of State’s answer, however hard it has tried to avoid doing so in its letter of 6 February 2020.

Pursuant to the terms of the Railways Act 1993 passenger rail services are provided by TOCs that have entered into franchise agreements with the Secretary of State after a competitive procurement process conducted under the Railway Regulation.  Those franchise agreements define the services to be provided by the franchise holder and the terms on which they are to be provided.  Franchise agreements have been in relatively standard form for some time so far as is material to this litigation.  Each franchise agreement will cover the provision of passenger rail services for a defined geographical area.  Any franchise is a major commercial undertaking involving the investment of large sums with associated risks and potential rewards. </p>

The ITT will be issued to potential tenderers who have pre-qualified and are known as passport holders.  The desired end result of the procurement process is the decision of the Secretary of State to enter into a franchise agreement with the preferred bidder, which in turn leads to the execution of the franchise agreement itself.  The terms of the ITT and the franchise agreement are set by the Secretary of State.  The draft franchise agreement is annexed to the ITT so that bidders may see the terms on which they will be required to contract, though there is the possibility of communication and clarification during the process, including the ability for bidders to raise requests for clarification by questions (known as clarification questions or CQs). </p>

Where a franchise comes to its end and no new franchise has been agreed, the existing franchisee (or another TOC) may be appointed to continue (whether on existing terms or new, directly negotiated, ones); and where a franchise is terminated part-way through, it may be necessary for the Secretary of State to appoint another operator to provide the services after a direct negotiation and award or to take over the franchise as the Operator of Last Resort.  I accept the evidence of Mr Smith, the Defendant’s Director for Policy, Operations and Change within the Rail Passenger Services Directorate, that direct awards are not the Secretary of State’s preferred option because they involve negotiating with a single operator who is by definition in a strong bargaining position and whose profit margin tends to end up higher than after a competitive process; and because it is difficult to build in proposals for improvements to the provided service or investment for the longer term e.g. by the provision of new rolling stock.  </p>

Historically, it has been a feature of franchise agreements that the Defendant has required the TOC to become a Designated Employer for the relevant section of the RPS for the duration of the franchise contract and has made the TOC responsible for paying the employer’s share of pension contributions during that period.  If the TOC’s payments are up to date at the end of the franchise period, the TOC has no liability to make further payments thereafter: the burden of funding any deficit that might be identified later falls on the TOC’s successors when and after the deficit is identified.  Similarly, the TOC is not entitled to benefit if it is determined that its contributions have generated a surplus at the end of its franchise; </p>

The scheme’s “Technical Provisions” (or liabilities) are to be calculated as the present value of the future expected benefit payments from the scheme, calculated by reference to members’ service to the date of the valuation.  Assumptions adopted in valuing the Technical Provisions are required to be “prudent”.  The assumptions to be made include assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate to be applied when assessing the present value of expected future benefit payments: the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value placed on the liabilities.  Other assumptions are the subject of the expert actuarial evidence but do not need to be mentioned here.  Once calculated on given assumptions, the Technical Provisions are compared with the scheme’s current assets at the valuation date to identify whether or not the scheme meets its statutory funding objective of having sufficient assets to cover its Technical Provisions.

Rather, the choice of assumptions affects the pace at which anticipated liabilities are funded.  This in turn may bring another factor into play, namely industrial relations: any increase in employee’s contributions is likely to be sensitive and there will be limits beyond which it is simply not feasible to call upon employees to contribute more.  At that point it may become practically impossible to maintain the 60:40 split in funding contributions from the employer and employees respectively.  The potential implications for an employer engaged in a heavily unionised industry with a defined benefit shared-cost scheme that must be funded both as to FSCs and as to DRCs do not need to be spelt out in detail here. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is immediately apparent that both of these passages refer expressly to exogenous <span style="font-style:italic">revenue</span> risks.  The Government’s Response to the Brown Review accepted his recommendation that “franchisees should be responsible for the risks they can manage and should not be expected to take exogenous revenue risk.” Its reaction was to analyse the implications of implementing a revenue risk sharing mechanism and, in due course, steps were taken to implement such a mechanism.  Its formal acceptance and response can therefore be seen to be in relation to revenue risks.   Elsewhere, the Brown Review makes clear that it takes a different attitude to <span style="font-style:italic">costs </span>risks.  Brown did not expressly consider pension costs.  This is probably, at least in part, because at that time pension costs were regarded as being assessed on a settled basis and therefore as being reasonably predictable.  However, Brown’s overall attitude to costs risks was that franchisees should be exposed to a greater proportion of cost risk, and that “a particular weakness of franchising to date has been that franchisees have not been exposed to the large majority of infrastructure cost risk, despite infrastructure accounting for broadly half the industry’s cost base”.  It was his view that “franchisees need to have greater risk exposure to the true variable costs of the railway if serious inroads in efficiency are to be made”: see paragraphs 4.30-4.33.  There was no equivalent acceptance in the Government’s Response to the Brown Review of a need to protect franchisees from exogenous costs risks.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept that the Brown Review itself supports the view that all exogenous risks should be borne by the Defendant rather than by Franchisees.  Nor does it provide any express support for the view that the risk of pension costs should be allocated to the Defendant rather than to franchisees.  On the evidence that I have seen that view did not emerge until the current pensions problem emerged some years later, since when it has been pressed into service.  In my judgment, the most that can be said of Brown on this topic is that he recognised there to be a danger that, if unmanageable risks were allocated to franchisees, bidders would add margins into their pricing for those risks, thereby adding cost and reducing value for the Government and passengers.  This consideration was recognised by the Defendant, but it did not at any stage become entrenched or formalised as policy, not least because there was a simultaneous desire to incentivise pension reform, which was thought more likely to be effective if pension costs were allocated to the TOCs (which were directly involved with the RPS) rather than to the Government (which was not).  That said, it was by the middle of 2018 openly acknowledged in a Ministerial Submission addressing the pensions problem that “in principle, our policy is to ensure that TOCs only take on the risks they can bear and to incentivise pension reform.” </p>

The two main departmental bodies with which this judgment is concerned were the SRO’s Investment Appraisal Panel (“SIAP”) and the Board Investment Commercial Committee (“BICC”).  SIAP was a panel which Mr Wilkinson chaired.  SIAP played an advisory role to the SRO, its purposes including that its deliberations would enable the SRO to put proposals for major franchising decisions, including proposed award decisions, to the Directors General of the Department who would then decide whether to sponsor or recommend those proposals to BICC.  BICC was a sub-committee of the Departmental Board and was the Department’s highest investment board.  It was chaired by the Permanent Secretary with membership that included the Directors General, Legal Director, heads of professional functions including the commercial function and two non-executive directors.  BICC’s role was to consider and test proposals and the process to be followed at appropriate stages of the franchising competitions and to approve the submission of final recommendations to Ministers in relation to any major Departmental commercial matter.  Mr Wilkinson was not a member of BICC but would attend when asked to help present or explain proposals. BICC had final authority to decide what to recommend to ministers and the basis for such recommendations.  BICC would often meet more than once to consider a particular issue.

The effect of this stability, at least since about 2007, has been that it has also been comparatively straightforward for TOCs to project pension costs and to price them in when bidding for franchises. </p>

On 10 November 2016 it wrote to the RDG stating that it had been engaging with the Trustee and the Department for a number of years but that its concerns had not been addressed to its satisfaction.  It suggested that there was scope for the parties to amend their approach to funding the TOC Sections in a manner which would negate the need for TPR to take enforcement action.  It identified its concerns as being (a) on covenant, that employer covenant strength was currently being rated higher than it should be for all TOC Sections; (b) on investment, that the risk being taken for all TOC Sections was not fully supportable by the employer covenant and that it was not necessarily appropriate to assume (as was currently the case) that a notional portfolio of 100% return-seeking assets would continue in perpetuity; and (c) on funding, that, in light of (a) and (b) above, Technical Provisions were not being set sufficiently prudently and hence funding deficits were being materially understated; and that in some cases unnecessarily and inappropriately long recovery periods were being set.  The letter stated TPR’s view that “the Technical Provisions should be set at least 25% higher” and pointed to the fact that the Scheme’s funding continued to be based upon an approach assuming implied Government support, which would continue indefinitely.

Having summarised its powers TPR indicated its willingness to work collaboratively to find a TOC-wide solution and then set out its concerns about covenant strength, investment approach and funding.  It gave TPR’s view that the TOC section covenant ratings were no higher than “CG2 (Tending to Strong)”, that the current strategy of investing up to 100% of the TOC sections’ assets in return-seeking assets was not supportable, and that the current Technical Provisions did not incorporate a sufficient level of prudence.  Once again it gave its view (which it said was supported by expert actuarial evidence) that Technical Provisions were “at least 25% understated” and that some recovery plans were unnecessarily and inappropriately long.  TPR repeated its expectation that every TOC section should be taking a more prudent approach to funding, that Technical Provisions should be “at least 25% higher” for all sections and that the resulting deficits should then be cleared over an appropriate period – “the stronger the covenant, the shorter the recovery period should be”.  Once again it stated its expectation that the TOCs should work together through the RDG alongside the Trustee and the Trade Unions to put in place an action plan and timetable for a TOC-wide solution in short order. </p>

These included that, contrary to its normal practice and only in the interests of reaching a TOC-wide solution, TPR was willing “to be pragmatic and agree to the use of uniform TOC-wide covenant grades and Technical Provision … increases.”  TPR made clear that, if it was obliged to resume regulatory action (because of a failure to find a TOC-wide solution) it reserved its position “in respect of individual sections’ assessments of covenant, Recovery Plan … length and [Technical Provisions].”  Its stated parameters, in the interests of agreeing a TOC-wide solution, were that it would be prepared to assume for all TOC sections that the covenant rating was CG2 or “Tending to Strong” and that the increase in Technical Provisions was 25% from the (draft) 2016 valuation results.  It proposed that, if a valuation showed a deficit then a recovery plan needed to be put in place that would end “no later than either … the end date of the next franchise agreement(s) subject to a maximum of 15 years; or, if sooner, the date that the TOC no longer employs protected persons.”  The presentation also made clear that these parameters were not once-and-for-all: in particular, investment strategy should be reviewed at each valuation period and covenant strength would need to be reviewed at each valuation.  The big stick was present: TPR reserved the right to take regulatory action if the TOC-wide solution was abandoned or not implemented within a reasonable time period and that “to be clear, TPR will use its s.231 powers on each TOC section if required to enforce the change needed.” </p>

First, application of TPR’s parameters could have the effect of transforming what had previously been thought to be stable sections operating with a sufficiency of assets into sections that would be in deficit and would require significant additional funding of both FSCs and DRCs, quite apart from requiring a fundamental review of investment strategy and restricting recovery periods.  Second, TPR’s parameters were expressed to be <span style="font-style:italic">minimum</span> requirements that were (a) contingent upon the implementation of a TOC-wide solution that was acceptable to TPR and (b) liable to become more onerous on future valuations.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">These reasons included that TPR’s stated parameters applied only to the 2016 Valuation and were contingent upon a TOC-wide solution being reached, which (as events have shown) is not guaranteed either within a particular time-frame or at all.  Second, the discount rate assumption used for the TOC sections is significantly out of line with those used for other UK DB schemes and this would be the case even after adjusting the draft 2016 valuation Technical Provisions to increase liabilities by 25%.  This fact alone suggests that TPR will press for further increases in funding with time.  Third, this suggestion is fortified by the facts that, even with a 25% increase, the ratio between (a) the Section 179 valuation (which is known to be of particular interest to TPR because of the statutory objective that it should protect the PPF), and (b) the RPS’s Technical Provisions would be significantly worse than 95% of other DB schemes in the market, which indicates a level of risk to the PPF that the Regulator is statutorily obliged to try to manage.  Fourth, TPR had stated that any Recovery Plan for the Scheme should end at the earliest of 15 years or the end of the next franchise period and any deficit that emerges during that period will have to be managed during a progressively diminishing window.  Viewed overall, it is Mr Salter’s opinion that the RPS is a significant outlier in terms of the calculation and funding of liabilities, that it will remain so even after a 25% increase in the liabilities shown in the draft 2016 valuation, and that it is clear that TPR has the RPS firmly in its sights.  I accept Mr Salter’s overall evidence and opinion as just summarised in the last sentence.   </p>

He draws attention to the fact that the Trustee has resisted suggestions that the approach to funding the RPS is in need of an overhaul.  He points to the highly prescriptive approach adopted by TPR in specifying the parameters that it considers should be adopted, which Mr Punter considers makes it less likely that TPR would seek further changes at subsequent valuations if a 25% increase in Technical Provisions were to be incorporated in the 2016 valuation.  He also takes issue with Mr Salter’s aggregation of risks and with his linking of falls in the discount rate with falls in bond yields, because the RPS Trustee does not set its discount yields by direct linkage to bond yields.  These are points of substance which form part of the grist for the mill of differing opinions between reputable experts.  They do not establish that one or other opinion is “right” or “wrong” when dealing with potential risk, particularly from a bidder’s perspective. </p>

Consistently with these omissions, his report contained no consideration of whether or when a TOC-wide solution would be achieved.  Equally, his report did not refer to TPR’s expressed concern to reduce the funding deficit of the RPS on the PPF measure.  His suggestion that TPR might countenance longer recovery periods than 15 years appears unduly optimistic even taking into account the statutory objective of affordability.  He did not acknowledge that, even with the current parameters introduced, the approach to the setting of discount rates for the RPS is an outlier that looks unsustainable, particularly if the TOCs’ covenant strength is down-graded.  His report did not attempt to model the effect of any combinations of potential risks, though he accepted that to do so would be “a legitimate enquiry”; nor did it take account of “tail risk” which could be a legitimate concern for commercial enterprises.  To my mind, these criticisms of Mr Punter are of a rather different order to the criticisms that the Defendant makes of Mr </p>

The Defendant submitted that there was no real risk of the current franchises being adversely affected by reference to the 2022 and subsequent valuations because of their timing within the currency of the franchises and the 15-month period for settling valuations.  In my judgment that is too simple an approach.  The fact of delay and the risk of a failure to achieve a TOC-wide solution in respect of the 2016 valuation (with the consequential continuation of contributions being made on the basis of the 2013 valuation) has the effect that the pensions problem is being pushed back so that (in TPR’s view) there will have been a more prolonged period of inadequate funding to be remedied in a diminishing remaining period for these franchises.  While it would have been reasonable for bidders to assume that the existing delays should mean that further intervention in relation to the 2019 valuation had become unlikely, it does not follow that franchisees would be immune to further intervention or that the 25% uplift first proposed by TPR in late 2016 would be the limit of TPR’s requirements during the period of the franchises.  In particular, the power of TPR under s.231(2)(c) of the Act to impose a schedule of contributions could not be discounted or ignored.  This is not to lose sight of the fact that, as Mr Salter agreed, TPR (a) does not want to use its s. 231 powers, and (b) if it did, would be likely to select one TOC section and one that was near to the start of its franchise period.  However, these mitigating features, together with the freedom from further liability that a TOC would have after its franchise had come to an end, would not and did not eliminate the risk of further intervention.   </p>

Viewed overall, I consider that Mr Punter’s evidence did not fully reflect the level of risk of further intervention though his opinion was not outside the range of opinions that might have been expressed by an expert actuary at the time of bidding.  I accept the evidence of Mr Salter and Mr Humphrey about the impossibility of ascribing probabilities to the risk of future intervention, though Mr Salter’s evidence viewed overall could be said to maximise perception of the risk.  More importantly, I accept the evidence of Mr Paterson (Stagecoach’s Finance Director who, with their CEO Mr Martin Griffiths, was responsible for the Stagecoach bids) that, from a bidder’s perspective, the probability of a (further) regulatory decision was inherently uncertain.   </p>

This raised eyebrows on the Defendant’s side but reflected the fact that, on the evidence in this trial, Stagecoach was the dominant partner in deciding how to approach the WCP procurement. </p>

In relation to both uncertainty and size of financial consequences the court was assisted by direct lay evidence and expert opinion evidence of high quality.  It is not necessary to provide an assessment of the quality of the witnesses individually.  Each attempted to assist the Court and gave evidence which they now believed to be sound.  To a greater or lesser extent the Defendant’s witnesses tended to be slightly (and understandably) protective of the steps and decisions that had been taken and, on occasions, attempted to provide justifications or explanations that were the product of diligent reconstruction rather than unvarnished recollection.  Only once did I have the sensation that true meaning was being concealed by the art of civil-service-speak; and that was not critical or, ultimately, indecipherable.  On the Claimants’ side, I was generally impressed by the level of frankness of the witnesses at all levels, particularly in their oral evidence.  My major reservation, which I shall detail later, concerned the evidence about their contemporaneous perception of the level of the risk of disqualification for non-compliance as expressed in their witness statements.   </p>

As Mr Punter rightly accepted, there was a very broad spectrum of risk in this case that a reasonable actuary could properly model.  Implicit in that acceptance is the corollary that a reasonable actuary advising potential bidders could properly have modelled a broad spectrum of possible financial outcomes, as did Mr Salter and Mr Punter.  Mr Punter did not suggest that Mr Salter’s assumptions could not be adopted by a reasonable actuary modelling the risks that confronted bidders; and the Defendants have (rightly) not suggested that Mr Salter’s modelling falls outside the range of what a reasonable actuary could have done.  Mr Salter confirmed that he could, subject to one qualification, have provided essentially the same report and advice had he been consulted by an actual or potential bidder in the course of the franchise competitions; and Mr Humphrey confirmed that an actuary acting for either the Government or a bidder at the time of the bids could have predicted the size of the scheme deficit in five years’ time, taking into account the likely movement in assets and the likely movement in liabilities over that period.  I accept that evidence.  It follows that, although it would not be possible to predict the size of any future deficits with any degree of certainty, a reasonable actuary advising a client in the position of the bidders could have undertaken modelling that generated very large potential deficits in the relevant TOC sections by the time of the 2022 valuation, as Mr Salter has done for this litigation.        </p>

In my judgment, the expert actuarial evidence from Mr Salter and Mr Punter demonstrated two things beyond argument: first, that the level of uncertainty of outcome was something upon which experts could reasonably disagree and in relation to which, even with the benefit of some hindsight, there is as yet no “right” answer; and, second, that the figures that expert actuaries would produce, either at the time of bidding or now in the context of litigation, would be entirely dependent upon the assumptions they either were asked or chose to make.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">My conclusion is that detailed findings that seek to calibrate the degree of uncertainty or to identify precisely the potential financial consequences would be spurious for two main reasons.  The first is the nature of the uncertainty about possible future developments and, specifically, the risk of further regulatory intervention, which defies quantification.  The second is that what mattered both for the Department and the bidding TOCs was their perception of risk and its allocation rather than trying to predict the outcome with certainty.  This distinction is important and must be borne in mind at all times.  Uncertainty of outcome is the essence of risk.  The fact that the outcome of the pensions problem was uncertain meant that bidders were dealing with commercial risk.  It is inherent in any substantial procurement that there will be areas of uncertain outcome that generate commercial risk for bidders; and that each bidder is likely to approach that risk differently for any number of commercial reasons including past experience, current financial strength, specific policy and general appetite for risk in the given circumstances.  For this reason it is, in my judgment, wrong simply to equate “uncertainty” of outcome with “uncertainty” of commercial risk, though the two are closely related and were often used indiscriminately by witnesses.  Although I accept that the outcome of the pensions problem was uncertain and that the possible outcomes covered a wide range, I reject the submission that it was not possible to reach a commercial estimate of that risk.  Different bidders’ assessment of the risk would differ for any and all of the commercial reasons to which I have just referred; but that is not the point.  It is for that reason that Mr Paterson was right to accept that Stagecoach could have found a number that, if priced in, would make them comfortable taking the risk: see [258] below.  In other words, I accept Mr Punter’s evidence that “it was possible for bidders to assess and evaluate the level of pensions-associated risks, taking account of the PRSM, so as to reach an informed </p>

First’s approach to those risks differed in many respects from the approach taken by Stagecoach.  The Claimants submit that First assumed a considerable amount of downside risk and that its acceptance of that risk in its bid illustrates the uncertainty faced by bidders.  I would state the point rather differently: the nature of the pensions risk meant that there was no single approach for bidders that was “right” to the exclusion of all others; but differing approaches to uncertain risks are, in the experience of this court, commonplace in large-scale procurements and are certainly not unique to this case.  Mr Clancy was crossexamined rigorously and at length about First’s approach.  The cross-examination came nowhere near showing that First’s approach could be characterised now as unreasonable.  It merely showed that different (major) commercial entities may have a different appetite for risk and different approaches to catering for such risks in a complex bid. </p>

There was suddenly a great deal of uncertainty as to what impact this involvement would have over the life of [the three franchises] given the possibility of significant change taking effect during the course of the franchise term.  What the change would look like was (and remains) unknown; the risk being that the cost of funding benefits (including the quantum of any deficit) would increase substantially, and effectively overnight in response to TPR’s ongoing investigation.”  There was nervousness because there was (from the bidder’s perspective) little or nothing the franchisee would be able to do to defray or mitigate those increased costs.  The steps that might immediately recommend themselves, such as reducing benefits, closing the section of the scheme to new members or closing the scheme to future accrual, would require agreement between the Trustee, the franchisee and the Department and would have obvious implications for industrial relations, as would trying to effect savings elsewhere by reducing staff numbers.  I accept the general thrust of this evidence though it tends to maximise the difficulties facing franchisees.     </p>

For the EM competition Stagecoach estimated that additional pensions costs could be in excess of £600 million (on the basis of assumptions set in order to approximate the outer limit of the liability).  Assuming that TPR sought to reduce the discount rate by a further 1% in the 2019 or 2022 valuation generated an estimated additional £105 million in pensions costs.  For the WCP competition Stagecoach estimated an outer limit of liability of approximately £1 billion.  Different assumptions generated a figure of £189 million.  For the SE competition, assuming a further reduction in the discount rate in the 2019 or a later valuation generated an estimated additional costs of £167 million which would increase to £216 million if there was a 10% fall in the RPS’s asset values, with the outer limit of potential liability being several times higher. </p>

That figure derived from a presentation to the West Coast Partnership Bid Steering Committee on 16 November 2018 which assessed the worst case potential risk as being over £1 billion and proposed as a possible solution including £189 million of additional costs in the bid to cover a reasonably likely level of downside costs.  A Stagecoach summary of the Pensions Position originally prepared in November 2018 and updated in April 2019 referred to a possible shortfall for the SE Section of over £1.1 billion on a solvency basis and gave a total reasonably likely risk of £156 million NPV.  Although Mr Paterson accepted in evidence that the solvency basis figure was “a kind of marker” rather than a realistic risk, it was evidently regarded as material to be presented to Stagecoach’s decision-makers and carried some influence in the formulation of Stagecoach’s position. </p>

It represents a commercial judgment which Stagecoach was entitled to reach based upon its assessment of its own position, experience and interests.  Its relevant experience included, as Mr Paterson accepted in evidence, Stagecoach’s sobering experience (shared with Virgin) of losing a lot of money on the failed East Coast Franchise, which contributed to making Stagecoach “risk aware”.  It may also explain why Stagecoach, despite Mr Hamilton’s promptings, did not pay closer attention to the likelihood (or unlikelihood) that the large numbers that had been generated in the course of its deliberations would eventuate if it became franchisee. </p>

The Secretary of State stated that Stagecoach should work out “what the franchise is worth” and bid on that basis, but that they should not “strike out parts of the Franchise Agreement”.  Stagecoach’s account of the meeting recorded that the Secretary of State’s key messages included reiterating that they should work out what they thought the franchise was worth and Stagecoach being clear that they could not bid on a compliant basis.  I accept the evidence of Mr Wilkinson that “the Secretary of State could not have been clearer that bidders were not entitled to pick and choose” and that marking up the bid non-compliantly risked disqualification. </p>

In support of that statement he points to his being told that the Department was still trying to find a solution on pensions and that the expectation was that discussions on the pensions issue would continue after the bids were submitted; and that not all non-compliant bids lead to disqualification; and that Stagecoach’s initial bids for the SE franchise had not (yet) been disqualified.  Mr Kavanagh described the decision to disqualify their bid on the WCP competition as “entirely unexpected” in the light of the terms of the ITT that permitted a variety of alternatives to disqualification.  His witness statement said that “our expectation was that our suggested risk-sharing mechanism would lead to a discussion with the Department in connection with pensions risk-sharing, and an agreement on this would be reached.”  It said that their expectation that there would be further engagement on pensions “was informed by the fact that discussions between the Department, the RDG, the Trustee and TPR regarding a potential industry-wide solution were still ongoing throughout the bidding process.”  In oral evidence he was more restrained, saying that there was a general view within Stagecoach that they “hadn’t reached the end of the line on pensions” while accepting that they were faced with increasingly firm language from the Department; and he regarded it as “not impossible” that the Treasury might change its position.  Even this evidence was inconsistent with Mr Kavanagh’s assessment on 15 November 2018 in the updating memorandum on the WCP pensions rebid that amending the PRSM in their bid “would carry a high risk of disqualification”; and he accepted that there was very little hard evidence at that time to suggest that the pensions position was still moving. </p>

There are suggestions in the evidence that tend to support this submission, but it is not necessary to make any findings on it as it cannot affect the lawfulness of the Defendant’s conduct in disqualifying the Claimants the following April.  What does appear, however, is that Stagecoach had information by 3 December 2018 that it was the only non-compliant bidder in the SE competition and that it had therefore “clearly lost”.  Yet, when it was given a chance to withdraw its non-compliances by AQ219 on 7 December 2018, it did not take the chance and maintained its non-compliance.  To my mind this tends to support my conclusion that the main driver for Stagecoach’s decision to bid noncompliantly was its unwillingness to take the commercial risks to which the pension problem gave rise. </p>

The first was the </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">level of risk that their Board was prepared to approve.  On the SE bid, there is evidence that the Stagecoach Group Board had identified a figure that it would accept as its residual risk attributable to the pensions problem and that, on the numbers being presented, if they were to rely only on the PRSM they would be accepting double that risk: see [247], [248] and [250] below.  The same position held when it came to submitting the EM and WCP bids, with Mr Paterson pointing out that they did not have Board Approval to take the residual risk on WCP that was indicated by the figures with which they were working: see [259] below.  The second strand was Stagecoach’s unwillingness to take on risks of that nature.  This was part of its wider policy position that it should not accept risks that it felt the private sector could not realistically manage.  This point was made by Mr Paterson in his 11 October 2018 discussion document and reiterated immediately before submission of the EM and WCP bids: see [239] and [262]-[263] below.  The third strand was that, although a number could have been found that would make them comfortable to take the residual risk, they feared it would have made their bid uncompetitive: see [258] below.  This last strand was allied to Mr Griffiths’ commercial policy decision that he was not interested in “gaming” the process: see [261] below.  I accept that Stagecoach had in mind the possibility that other bidders might all bid non-compliantly, though it realised that it would only take one to break ranks and bid compliantly in order to scupper its bids.  Subject to that, which was speculation with no solid foundation, if anyone really believed that the outcome would or might realistically be further discussions and a further change to the risk allocation required of bidders, they had no good reason for that belief.  Stagecoach’s strategy was certainly not driven by any such a belief.  Despite Stagecoach’s commercial muscle as a significant player in the railways business, to have founded a strategy on the hope or expectation that the Defendant, when confronted by their non-compliant bids, would re-allocate the pensions risk to the Government’s disadvantage would have been no more than hubris.  While some may have entertained the hope, it was not a foundation for Stagecoach’s strategy.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The combined effect of these strands was that by the time for submitting final bids, and although they could have priced the risk at a level that they would have found comfortable, Stagecoach (and, in particular, Mr Griffiths and Mr Paterson) were opposed to taking the residual risk with only the PRSM as protection, a position that was reflected in different ways in the different bids.  With this reasoning, the precise extent of the residual risk was not determinative though the decision-makers were influenced by the scale of the numbers with which they were being presented as possible downside risks, whether or not they clearly understood the likelihood or otherwise of those risks eventuating.  If it were necessary to my decision (which I think it is not) I would hold that Stagecoach’s decision-makers concentrated on the size of the numbers that were presented to them without giving close attention to the likelihood or unlikelihood of those risks eventuating.  </p>

For that reason, for example, though significant time was spent at trial attacking a figure of £589 million that appeared in documents created in 2019, and although the end result of those attacks is that I am not convinced that the adoption of that figure was sound, it does not matter when trying to understand what the Claimants were trying to do in the run up to lodging their bids save, tangentially, as a further illustration of the way in which the uncertainty surrounding pension risks could generate widely divergent figures. </p>

The following day there was a feedback meeting, which repeated the reasons for disqualification that had been given but did not elaborate on them: the slides for the meeting stated that their purpose was to give SEMTL feedback on the quality of its Delivery Plan submissions and was not to discuss the decision that had been made.  The day after that, SEMTL wrote to the Department raising further questions and asking for further disclosure.  In the course of that letter SEMTL described the issue in relation to the pension requirements as “a very significant one with industry-wide consequences” and complained of lack of engagement either before or after the submission of final bids.  Further correspondence followed including a letter from Mr Wilkinson on behalf of the Department on 15 April 2019.  On 2 May 2019 the Department provided a further note explaining the process that had been followed in assessing SEMTL’s non-compliance and disqualification.  On 9 May 2019 the Secretary of State entered into the EM Franchise Agreement with Abellio.  The franchise commenced on 18 August 2019.  </p>

Such meetings continued after issue of the ITTs and provision was made for bidders to raise questions and for the Department to provide information through its AWARD system. The formal SE ITT and draft Franchise Agreement contained standard form instructions and terms on pensions; it did not refer to or reflect the fact of TPR’s investigation.

He urged the DfT to review the risk transfer associated with the SE franchise competition and to consider delaying the deadline for the submission of bids “until a clear specification for each scheme and risk share arrangements is defined.”  He wrote that “without a rethink by the Department, any bid we might submit would be noncompliant with your bidding instructions” in relation to pensions and another topic.  In their reply on 6 March 2018, Ms Hannant and Ms Payne, the Directors General for the Rail Group, referred to the possibility of collective negotiations by the RDG and TOCs with TPR.  Consistently with the Department’s approach of treating the RPS as a private pension scheme, they suggested that TPR’s parameters “provide a helpful steer to enable the development of options to inform a satisfactory solution to TPR’s concerns.”  The letter, while cordial, provided no comfort for the concerns that Stagecoach had raised about potential non-compliance, though it encouraged Stagecoach to continue to liaise with the SE Project Team. </p>

The tensions are reflected in a pensions paper coauthored by Mr Baghurst on 27 February 2018 and submitted to the Rail Investment Board the same day, which referred to the uncertainties created by TPR’s intervention and the fact that bidders had expressed strong concerns about the scale of the uncertainty about the potential RPS deficit and about maintaining a level playing field for the competitions.  As against those concerns, the paper recorded the policy team’s concerns, backed by the Treasury, that the RPS is not subject to a Crown Guarantee and their wish “to avoid any suggestion that the Department … is giving an indemnity which relates to pensions.”  It is these conflicting concerns which dominated discussions within Government (and, in particular, between the Department and the Treasury) over the coming months.  The paper asked for agreement to the Department engaging with the Treasury about the extent of any protection the Department could provide to bidders. </p>

GAD provided initial results on 23 March 2018, with subsequent iterations before what were treated as final results on 18 May 2018 – that being the version that was used in developing the final formulation of the PRSM.  The GAD analysis did not purport to be a full-scale actuarial analysis of the Department’s potential exposure.  In particular, as Mr Humphrey accepted in evidence, their analysis considered investment risk (at a high level that was very sensitive to assumed investment return) but not risks relating to the RPS’s liabilities; and it assumed that TPR’s intervention would be limited to the 2016 valuation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 17 April 2018 Ms Stayte, the Head of Rail Workforce Strategy, Rail Strategy Projects, provided a Ministerial Submission which noted the concern amongst SE competition bidders about how to approach the deficit identified by TPR and how to deal with the uncertainty of future valuations.  The submission expressed the view that, unless a way was found to manage the issue, it would not be possible to complete the other current franchise competitions or that they would provide poor value for money.  The submission proposed the offer of “a short-term risk sharing mechanism for uncertain and significant pension costs that may arise during the franchise term and are outside the control of the TOC employers” on the basis that any offer would be linked to appropriate and timely action by the TOCs to reform pensions in order to maintain long-term affordability.  The recommendation was that the Department should rapidly develop a short-term risk protection mechanism with a view to obtaining Treasury agreement once it was developed.  The submission expressed the view that bidders’ concerns about current and future valuation risks would, if priced into the bids, not reflect value for money; and it drew the analogy with revenue risks in proposing some protection.  The advantages of offering some protection were stated to be that bidders would be able to quantify and therefore price risk into their bids effectively, which would enable the SE competition to proceed.  It noted the need to get Treasury agreement and, since it raised the prospect of contingent liabilities for the Department, said that Treasury Ministers were expected by their officials to be “sceptical of any protection which reduces the incentives for the TOC and Trade Unions to reform the current scheme” and that officials judged that Treasury Ministers “would instinctively prefer an approach which would allow bidders to price in the pension risks.”     </p>

One reason for this was the Department’s perception that bidders were more worried about DRCs than FSCs.  A PwC discussion draft dated 9 May 2018 listed the Department’s objectives under three headings: first, that “requirements of bidders should be fair i.e. where they are on risk for costs, bidders should have sufficient information to make a proper estimate of future costs with a high likelihood that these estimates will be the same/similar in order to avoid pensions costs have [sic] a significant impact on the evaluation of bids”; second that “material uncertainty being transferred to bidders should be avoided – it will not represent value for money for bidders to have to build in contingencies which may subsequently prove to be unnecessary, resulting in windfall gains for the winning bidder.  Equally, DfT does not want a failure to forecast future costs accurately to undermine the financial robustness of a TOC”; and third, that “Bidders/TOCs should be incentivised to share additional costs with the employees rather than simply bearing the whole of the costs themselves.  However, it is recognised that there is a limit to the amount of the cost burden, … which can be transferred to employees without triggering industrial relations issues.”  Though only a draft, this provides a useful snapshot of strands of the Department’s thinking, though not necessarily in order of importance.    </p>

During the same period, DfT officials met Treasury officials to explain the principles of what they were proposing to do; and PwC progressively developed their advice in the light of feedback and instructions from the Department.

It reported that the Department had developed a short-term risk sharing mechanism to cater for the pensions problem by sharing the risk and rewards of changes in the funding position of the RPS which might arise in future valuations, from 2019 onwards.  The three main features of the mechanism were that it “enables bidders (i) to price the pension risks in the usual way on the current 2016 Trustees’ valuation uplifted by [TPR’s] recent guidance on parameters, and (ii) leaves the future service risk with the bidders, but (iii) proposes a risk share on future valuations of the deficit during the franchise term above a certain threshold – this protects TOCs from potential exogenous risks outside their control (e.g. stock market crash) whilst incentivising them to consider long-term pension reforms … .”  The submission stated that “in principle, our policy is to ensure that TOCs only take on the risks they can bear and to incentivise pension reform.  This is consistent with the Brown review of only allocating risks to TOCs that they can manage efficiently. … Without a protection, we run the risk of competitions failing and also resulting in dis-incentivising pension reform with costs ultimately being borne by Government.”  Among the prospective benefits that were put forward in support of the proposal was that its inclusion was likely to result in better value for money than doing nothing because, in the absence of a support mechanism, bidders </p>

The proposal was for protection against DRCs from the 2019/2022 valuations onwards.  The initial reactions from the Stagecoach representatives were that it seemed a reasonable but pragmatic proposition.  After the meeting Mr Winnie wrote to Ms Letten expressing support for a risk-sharing mechanism but asking that it should be extended to cover all employer contributions i.e. FSCs as well as DRCs.  The transcript of the bilateral meeting and Mr Winnie’s email shows the wide-ranging nature of the discussions that were available to bidders during what was inevitably an uncertain period (both for them and for the Department) while the Department determined what could and should be done. Ms Letten took the view (almost certainly correctly) that the Treasury would never wear extending a mechanism to cover future FSCs as well as DRCs; so that suggestion was and remained dead in the water.  A similar bilateral meeting took place in relation to the WCP competition on 24 May 2018, at which the currently proposed PRSM was explained to representatives of WCTP.

All bidders complied with these instructions when submitting their bids on 13 July 2018. </p>

The submission noted that the “best estimate” modelling of the 2019 valuation point suggested that the mechanism would result in no additional cost to Government and that the worst-case scenario suggested a cost to Government of around £50 million per year.  The submission canvassed the wide-ranging policy considerations in play, including raising the TOCs’ expectation of further protection in future, the need for an exit strategy and the need for any protection to be accompanied by meaningful reform of the TOC RPS chapters.  It also provided a succinct summary of the Treasury’s view of the pensions problem as it was affecting current competitions:  </p>

Specifically, it is concerned that the next RPS valuation point, 2019, will show a larger deficit requiring even higher contributions. Given other financial pressures facing TOCs at the moment, resulting from lower than forecast passenger growth, TOCs say they are unable to price or bear the risk of additional costs. </p>

The letter expressed the Department’s concern that “as currently framed the requirement to limit the protection to the 2019 valuation only will so reduce its value that either bidders will walk away, or price pensions risks into their bid to such an extent that value for money is seriously undermined.”  They pointed out that the SE competition was now pressing, so that the Department hoped to be able to obtain the Treasury’s agreement to the protection the Department had designed (i.e. covering all valuations from 2019 onwards) and bidders had time to take it into account for their rebids at the end of August.  They argued that the post-2019 valuations were further into the future and posed higher uncertainty because of that fact; and that their proposed protection struck the optimum balance for achieving value for money and incentivising participation in a permanent solution.  They expressed the view that, without the protection, one or more bidders may withdraw, with the ultimate risk that the competition could fail.  The concerns raised in the letter represented the real concerns of Mr Smith, one of the co-signatories, and of the Department generally.  It was his view at the time that limiting the PRSM to the 2019 valuation point substantially though not entirely undermined the purpose of the mechanism.  As will be seen, his fears (and the fears of those who shared them) that bidders would walk away did not materialise and bids that were compliant on pensions were received in all three competitions.   </p>

He pressed for a mechanism that was not time-limited to a specific valuation on the basis that time-limiting “would so reduce its value that we risk bidders pricing pensions risks into their bid and seriously reducing the value for money … or in a worst case walking away from the competition.”  However, in about mid-September the Secretary of State changed his mind and accepted the Treasury’s condition that the PRSM should apply to the 2019 valuation only.  The evidence does not disclose and I make no finding about why he changed his mind.  The change caused dismay among officials because of their belief that a more extended mechanism was necessary and because they identified unintended consequences of limiting it to one valuation which would be adverse to the franchisee and which, at its highest, Mr Baghurst described as “irrational”.

Mr Smith said in evidence that he regarded this as leaving the Treasury’s door ajar rather than open and that he would “interpret this as not completely excluding the possibility, but I don’t think the door was very open.”  At the time he treated it as an effective fait accompli so far as the current competitions were concerned, writing in an email on 8 October 2018: “This is frustrating, given all the efforts we have put in”, to which Mr Bailey, the Department’s Director of Rail Strategy, Reform and Analysis, replied “Agreed.  Infuriating.  But at least we have clarity.”  Mr Wilkinson regarded the language, coming as it did from a very senior politician, as unequivocal.  When Mr Baghurst saw the Chief Secretary to the Treasury’s letter on 8 October 2018 he reported to his colleagues that it would take time for the actuaries to work through all of the issues associated with excluding post-2019 accruals and that they would then need to go back to the Treasury.

In evidence he repeated the point that, in the absence of certainty in the workings of the actuaries and given the time constraints on the competitions, the mechanism was now limited to the 2019 valuation point only.  They therefore proceeded with a mechanism which had not originally met their objectives as far as they wanted it to, but which did provide some protection to bidders and which bidders seemed to have valued in the conversations the Department had had with them earlier in the year.  I accept this evidence of Mr Smith, Mr Wilkinson and Mr Baghurst as a reasonable reflection of their views at the time and that their views of the prospect of further movement from the Treasury were reasonably held.   </p>

Mr Baghurst accepted that time was one factor, combined with the complexity and cost of what was being proposed and the lack of any clarity about how the mechanism would work or certainty of outcome.  The Claimants submit that only 2-4 week’s actuarial work was required at that point.

The terms of the ITTs, draft franchise agreements and rebid instructions were also clear on pensions and understood by all tenderers.  What was uncertain was how the pensions problem would play out in practice: whether the inherently uncertain risk of increased future pension liabilities in the changed landscape after TPR’s intervention would eventuate and, if so, what numbers might attach.  In an earlier section of the judgment I have addressed that inherent uncertainty.  As with any risk affecting commercial enterprises, the question for the tenderers was how to cater for the uncertainties inherent in that risk.  The commercial choice facing the Claimants and all other bidders on each competition was clear-cut, though making the choice was not necessarily straightforward: it was whether to bid compliantly, or non-compliantly, or not at all.  This section of the judgment concentrates in greater detail than before on how the Claimants addressed that question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 11 October 2018 Mr Paterson produced a discussion document in which he set out the options and decisions facing Stagecoach on the SE competition.  The bidding options were (1) bidding on the basis of the current level of pensions contributions, (2) bidding in accordance with the RDG proposal that was then current, (3) including an increased level of contributions based on the latest rebid guidance (i.e. bidding compliantly), and (4) bidding at a point between the RDG proposal and the rebid guidance.  Mr Paterson listed pros and cons for each option.  The cons for options 1, 2, and 4 included “could be cause for DfT to disqualify bid (but likely to bid noncompliantly in some respects on pensions anyway)”.  The sole con for option 3 was “could make our bid (premia) appear more expensive than others.”  Separately, he considered the options facing Stagecoach under the heading “Should we demand any protection versus base case over and above what DfT has offered?”  The points in favour of demanding additional protection were “reduces in-franchise exposure on pensions to an acceptable level” and “consistent with wider Stagecoach policy position on not accepting risks that private sector cannot realistically manage”.  The cons were “Potentially non-compliant bid on pensions” and “could be disqualified before opportunity to re-negotiate pensions as a preferred bidder”.  The points in favour of living with the protection offered by the DfT were “could be compliant bid on pensions” and “opportunity to re-negotiate at preferred bidder stage and improves chances of getting to that stage”.  The cons included “cost and effort to get to preferred bidder stage when it still might be impossible to negotiate adequate protection”, “could be seen as willingness to sign franchise without protection” and “could undermine Stagecoach policy position (and comments to Williams Review) on not accepting risks that private sector cannot realistically manage”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, and in the light of the internal Stagecoach discussions and debates that I summarise elsewhere, this document provides a revealing and accurate snapshot of Stagecoach’s thinking as it approached the rebids.  Certain strands stand out, namely (1) an appreciation of the risk of disqualification if it bid non-compliantly, (2) the hope that it might achieve preferred-bidder status and then use the leverage that might give it to negotiate for more protection, (3) a balancing of the risk that disqualification for bidding non-compliantly would prevent it achieving preferred bidder status against the risk that bidding compliantly, while maximising its chances of achieving preferred bidder status, would leave it exposed if it failed to achieve extra protection and would cut across Stagecoach policy.  The reference to the possibility that bidding compliantly would be seen as willingness to sign the franchise agreement without protection indicates that Mr Paterson had in contemplation bidding compliantly but not signing the franchise agreement if they were unable to obtain additional protection at that stage.  Mr Kavanagh confirmed that, saying in evidence that Stagecoach intended to renegotiate if it were the preferred bidder. Mr Paterson said, and I accept, that he “was aware there was a school of thought that said we could bid compliantly as an attempt to remain in the competition, but with some opportunity to renegotiate later, and I reflected that here.  Personally, it wasn’t an approach I favoured … .”  On any view, it would have been a dramatic step to take, for legal, commercial and reputational reasons. </p>

Mr Kavanagh said in evidence that, while they recognised that AQs 218 and 219 were an attempt to get Stagecoach to change its position, and that the risk of disqualification was clearly there, they regarded it as “not impossible” that the Treasury would move again.  He reasoned that the DfT had previously shared Stagecoach’s view of some of the risks that it did not want bidders to take, and that there was therefore “a reasonable prospect, perhaps not a high prospect” that something different to disqualification would result.  In the light of the AQs, which stated expressly that the Department did not anticipate amending the PRSM, and for reasons given elsewhere in this judgment, I cannot accept that this view, if it was held at the time, was realistic.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">More reliable evidence is provided by four contemporaneous documents.  On 26 October 2018, Mr Winnie sent to Messrs Griffiths, Paterson, Kavanagh, Hamilton and others a paper that provided an overview of Stagecoach’s response.  He traced the approach to the original bid and first rebid by reference to the stated figure that the Stagecoach board would accept as a residual pensions risk.  Turning to the second rebid he recorded that, following work by Hymans, if Stagecoach were to rely only upon the PRSM, it would be accepting a residual risk that was approximately “double the risk that the Board was prepared to accept in the First Rebid and falling outside the boundaries of our subsequent internal discussions.”  It therefore proposed in the second rebid that the PRSM should also apply for the 2022 valuation.  The possibility of achieving preferred bidder status but then refusing to sign remained if they were unable to achieve what they regarded as a suitable protection mechanism and no suitable industry-wide mechanism was yet in place was still in contemplation: “we ultimately do not have to sign the Franchise Agreement consistent with the Board position with our First Rebid.”  The paper also raised the possibility that other bidders would be as prudent as Stagecoach and could therefore be expected to also be noncompliant on pensions.  I accept his evidence that this was not a statement of the strategy that had driven Stagecoach’s approach, though Stagecoach were always conscious of the possibility that the Department might have to rethink its strategy if it received no compliant bids at all.  Stagecoach was also conscious of the risks that existed if it was non-compliant and other bidders were compliant, as is shown by an exchange of emails between Mr Winnie and Mr Shoveller, Stagecoach’s Managing Director of their UK Rail Division at the time, on 13 June 2018. </p>

He summarised that the Department were seeking confirmation that Stagecoach would retract their non-compliances and make no further amendments, and he listed three options.  The first, doing nothing, would be compliant with Board Approval but involved “likely disqualification from the competition as we will be non-compliant with the [Franchise Agreement]”.  The second, falling into line on all three questions, would be compliant with the Franchise Agreement and would mean that Stagecoach remained in the competition; but it would add substantial additional risk over and above that approved by the Board and would not be compliant with Board Approval.  The third, agreeing to the first two requests but not the third and pricing the additional risk, would be compliant with the Franchise Agreement and Board Approval and would mean they remained in the competition; but they would be in a less competitive position.  The basis of this summary, therefore, is that the residual risk that the Board had approved was incompatible with the greater level of risk that would be accepted by a successful compliant bid. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This evidence supports a finding that Stagecoach’s non-compliance in the second SE rebid was the result of a decision by the Stagecoach Board about the level of residual risk that they were prepared to accept and an assessment based on internal and external advice that reliance on the PRSM alone would expose them to approximately twice that level of risk.  This commercial assessment of risk led to the submission of a bid with additional (non-compliant) protection mechanisms that were designed to reduce the residual risk to acceptable levels.  The alternative, which Mr Paterson did not favour, was thought to be to add “a huge increase in pension costs” to guard against the residual risk.  The nature of Stagecoach’s assessment (as set out by Mr Hamilton and Mr Winnie) demonstrates that although the risks were uncertain and (to a large extent) unmanageable by franchisees, they were not unquantifiable for the purposes of making commercial decisions about whether and how to bid.  This feeds into my overall findings about the nature and reasons for Stagecoach’s non-compliant bids: see [183] above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendant criticises the methodology and calculations of risk adopted in the paper and slides and at least some of the criticisms appear valid.  However, what mattered at the time and what matters for present purposes is what Stagecoach/WCTP thought and how it influenced their approach to the bids.  In that context the exercise undertaken by Stagecoach at this stage of the bidding process illustrates the wide range of outcomes that could be reached by substantial commercial concerns possessed of high levels of internal competence and with the benefit of external expert advice.  It also shows that, although the outcome of the pensions problem (and therefore the eventuating of the risk to which it gave rise) was uncertain, it was possible to estimate the risk for the purposes of taking commercial decisions on whether and how to participate further in the bidding process.  Mr Paterson was right when he accepted that they could have found a number that was big enough to price in and that they would then have been comfortable taking the risk.  They were concerned about putting a large number in, for reasons that he explained, but “[he] wasn’t necessarily of the view that it was impossible to price the risk.”  </p>

It was decided that there should be a further call the following Monday, 19 November 2018, by which time more information about the likelihood of an outcome worse than their current reasonable estimate was required.  It was after the meeting of 16 November that the SNCF representative reported on the “unpleasant” discussion that had occurred: see [173(vii)] above. </p>

He adopted an approach that was similar to his presentation to the WCP Bid Steering Committee.  The figures were different, but the recommendations remained essentially the same as for WCP.  He stated in his recommendation that “we believe the risk of disqualification is very high with option 1” (i.e. requesting additional protection) “and would recommend option 2 is adopted.” Option 2 was “do not request additional protection but price in for <span style="font-style:italic">some </span>of the additional pension risk … .”  In evidence Mr Kavanagh was unable to identify where some of his important figures came from, a feature which characterised the evidence of other Stagecoach witnesses.  However, once again, what matters is not whether the figures were right or wrong but that they informed Stagecoach’s thinking when making its commercial decision whether and if so how to bid.  Of most relevance for that purpose was a figure of £0.6 billion which represented an estimate of “the only minimal risk approach”, which would be achieved by funding both past and future accruals on a risk-free basis (i.e. gilt funded).     </p>

In it he argued that there may be a financial opportunity provided by pricing in additional sums to cover the residual risks if bidding compliantly.  His argument was partly strategic, that the Department must eventually look for a lower cost option (which would require it to give added protection), and partly principled, questioning the likelihood of the downside risks eventuating and warning against talking up “scary numbers”.  Mr Griffiths’ reaction was to call for a discussion as soon as possible, and that “for me this is simply about protecting the downside.  I have no interest at all in gaming the system or making money out of/or second guessing future pension provision.”  </p>

On 19 November 2018 Mr Hamilton told Mr Kavanagh that he had been talking to Mr Griffiths and Mr Paterson over the weekend and that they had reached the position that they would not take the pensions risks and would set out what they referred to as the principled position about the allocation of risk from the Department to the TOCs.   </p>

Conversely, it is reasonable to conclude that everyone is aware that a compliant bid, however that is judged, is likely to win.”  There was therefore a clear awareness on the part of the Claimants that one compliant bid could scupper Stagecoach’s position, as Mr Micklethwaite accepted in evidence. </p>

I accept Mr Micklethwaite’s evidence that Mr Wilkinson was unhappy about the situation and that he said that the Treasury had put the Department in an “appalling” position.  It is, however, far from clear that Stagecoach would have bid compliantly if required to bid against the PRSM as originally proposed by the Department.  While that would have reduced Stagecoach’s residual risk, it would not have done away with Stagecoach’s policy/principled objections to taking a pensions risk at all that it regarded as unmanageable by the TOCs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the first stage of risk adjustment, all bids were risk adjusted until what is known as the first consolidation.  During the first stage, the evaluators considered exogenous risks such as GDP, employment rates and changes in interest rates.  The result of this first stage was to derive and establish the P (price) score.  That was combined with the quality and deliverability (“Q&amp;D”) scores to identify the preferred bidder or bidders who would then be taken forward to the next stage of evaluation.  The Q&amp;D evaluators could also propose additional areas for risk adjustment.  The second stage of risk adjustment involved evaluation by reference to endogenous risks, such as marketing and staffing costs, though exogenous risks could still be brought into account if new information emerged.  The second level risk adjustment would take about 8-12 weeks and is resource heavy.  For reasons of time and resource, it was only applied to the preferred bidder or bidders.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It should be noted that the ITT-based risk adjustments, as just described, looked to identify the most credible financial outcome of the bid in question and did not attempt to analyse the likelihood that the outcome would be worse or to what extent it could be worse.  In that respect they were not a risk assessment as normally so called and they differed fundamentally from the risk assessment exercise that bidders might reasonably undertake in preparing their bids.  Once the PAPRA analysis is complete and the risk adjustment team has determined what risk adjustments should be made to the bid, a Proposed Risk Adjustment report (“PRA”) is prepared which summarises the adjustments to be made as a consequence of the PAPRA process. At that point, the risk adjustment process is taken to have identified the most credible financial outcome.  Once the PRA report has been approved, the Financial Robustness Test (“FRT”) is run by the financial advisor, based on the central risk adjusted scenario.  In other words, the FRT is run on the most credible financial outcome of bids as identified by the risk adjustment process.    </p>

It is intended to enable the Defendant to assess the financial risk in the bids and to provide confidence in the robustness of the bids and to reflect that in the assessment of MEAT.  There are two elements of the test.  The first is a pass/fail element.  In simplest terms, the bidder’s risk adjusted bid is run through a model which checks whether the bidder will fail the required financial covenants during the franchise’s core term, even after taking into account available PCS and allowing for a threshold. If it does, the test is failed and automatic elimination follows. This test is based upon the Department’s assessment of the most credible financial outcome and does not involve assessing downside risks that would result in a worse outcome than the most credible financial outcome.  Its stated purpose is “the assessment of whether the level of financial risk is acceptable”: paragraph 7.7.1.1 of the WCP ITT and equivalent paragraphs of the other ITTs.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second element of the FRT involves establishing a Central Risk Adjusted Scenario (“CRAS”) and a Downside Risk Adjusted Scenario (“DRAS”) in order to give further insight into the level of financial risk in the bid.  The CRAS broadly equates to the most credible financial outcome in the light of the risk adjustments.  The DRAS is achieved by a further (downward) adjustment of the bidder’s passenger revenue projections.  It is then used to adjust the bidder’s P score.  It was an innovation for the three competitions that are in issue in these proceedings.  I accept Mr Baghurst’s evidence that it was introduced because of concerns about bids that were over-ambitious in their passenger revenue projections and on the basis of external advice that operating costs and other revenues were subject to less risk than passenger revenue and the belief that a significant proportion of operating costs were either fixed or fully protected.  For that reason, no further adjustment was made in the FRT either for non-passenger revenue or for operating costs.  Specifically, for that reason, there was no further downside risk analysis on pensions included in the FRT.  The ITT made the position clear, stating that “no adjustment will be made to the forecasts in the Central Risk Adjusted Financial Model of non-passenger revenue, or operating or capital costs” at paragraph 7.7.3.1 of the WCP ITT and equivalent paragraphs of the other ITTs. </p>

Mr Wilkinson rejected the suggestion that it was an instruction to engage with the Treasury on the scope of the protection for the current competitions, though he accepted that “it was an instruction to go back to Treasury and discuss the risks and issues pertinent to the pension risk-sharing mechanism”.  Mr Smith’s evidence was that BICC was here acting in an advisory capacity and giving advice (rather than instructions) on what they would expect to see later.

There is reference to pensions giving rise to an immediate franchising issue and that “HMT are proposing to make this a franchising issue and focus on what we offer TOCs at the start of new franchise terms.  We will need to confirm the details …. – but it sounds like HMT are prepared to share risk on employer deficit recovery contributions only for the duration of new franchise terms.”  Although there is a heading for “Live competitions” there is nothing there noted to suggest a discussion about extending the PRSM protection in the live competitions; and Mr Smith was cross-examined on the basis that the Department had not asked for an extension of the protection in the live competitions, with which he agreed.  The note records that Mr Duffy would write to the Department “to outline HMT views and a proposal on pensions risk sharing for future franchises”.  There is no similar note relating to the live competitions; but when Mr Smith received Ms Kneen’s email he responded by saying that they needed to consider if they would want to go back to bidders to ask them to reprice on a revised basis.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A separate paper presented to BICC recommended cancellation of the SE competition.  As presented to the court, the paper is subject to extensive redactions for legal privilege.  However, although the prospect of eliminating a bidder (SSETL) for pensions non-compliance is mentioned (with cross-reference to the non-compliance paper), the substantial reasons for recommending cancellation that appear in the open sections of the document are a major and irreconcilable disagreement in the assessment of the two pensions-compliant bids on non-pensions issues between the Department’s technical and operational advisers, Steer and Network Rail. BICC members agreed to the recommendations in the paper.  SSETL’s non-compliance on pensions is given as one of two reasons why its bid had not been considered further, the other being that “significant affordability issues with this bid meant it was unlikely to win the competition.”  The paper highlighted that a decision to proceed with the competition meant that “the Department” would have to make a decision whether or not any of the bidders should be eliminated based on the identified noncompliances.  Conducting a further rebid was said to be “unattractive” for a number of reasons including that it may open the Department to accusations of bias or trying to help one bidder to avoid the decision to eliminate.  Other considerations included the fact that the current franchise was due to expire on 23 June 2019 with an agreement having been reached for a short Direct Award being possible before the next franchise operator took over.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is convenient to draw some of the strands of the engagement between the Department and the Treasury together at this point.  There is no doubt that initially the Department were looking for a protection mechanism that covered both the 2019 valuation and subsequent valuations.  This was not acceptable to the Treasury despite extensive engagement during which the Department’s officials tried their best to persuade their counterparts in the Treasury of the benefits of more extensive protection.  The Treasury had a significant policy block because, as a matter of policy, it did not wish to become embroiled with what it saw as a private pension scheme and because it took the view that intervention would reduce any prospect of long-term reform.  In those circumstances, the PRSM was as good as the Department could get.  Although the Chief Secretary to the Treasury’s letter of 4 October 2018 left open the theoretical prospect of further adjustments to the PRSM, that was reasonably considered to be not feasible.  Specifically, I consider that Mr Smith’s belief that the chance of the Treasury agreeing to change the approach on the live competitions was “vanishingly small” was a reasonable view for the Department’s officials to take and was generally reflective of the views that were reasonably held by the Department’s officials as summarised at [227], [281], [288] and [298] above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I find that the position that was established by BICC was more subtle and gave the Directors General and their officials flexibility about how to engage with the Treasury.  At its highest it was, as Mr Wilkinson accepted “an instruction” (I would add, in the very broadest sense of the word) “to go back to Treasury and discuss the risks and issues pertinent to the pension risk-sharing mechanism”, which was done.  That said, while it is accepted that the Treasury were not asked to change the risk allocation for the current competitions during the meeting on 16 January 2019, the tenor and content of the correspondence between Ms Kohler and Ms Kneen after the meeting and the terms of the jointly-agreed letter that Mr Duffy sent to the Directors General provides support for the view that further movement by the Treasury in relation to the current competitions would have been very unlikely indeed, even if they had been asked.  By this stage there were two main reasons for this unlikelihood.  First was the Treasury’s general reluctance, born of its overarching policy outlook.  Second was that, by now, the bids (including pensions-compliant bids) were in for three competitions that were under varying degrees of time pressure and all participants were aware of the risks of changing competition criteria in the circumstances then prevailing: see [288] above.  In these circumstances, the suggestion that the Department could or should have persuaded the Treasury to change the risk-allocation basis for the current competitions seems to me to lack practical realism.  Like it or not, the current competitions were stuck with the PRSM.  Whether that was a lawful outcome and basis on which to proceed, I leave to later. </p>

When in early February 2019 Mr Hayes was mooting the idea that there should be work done to give assurance that pensions would not bankrupt the winning bidders, he drew a distinction between such an exercise and the ITT process of evaluation, suggesting that “we include any such analysis in the FBC<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

They identified downside risks that franchisees would face in respect of their obligations to the RPS, which included (a) factors reducing the (anticipated) funding level of the scheme; (b) an increase in the level of prudence used in the scheme assumptions, which could be driven by a reduction in strength of the scheme covenant or a change in approach by the Trustee or TPR; and (c) factors causing an increase in the annual payments required to meet any deficit, such as a requirement to fund deficits over a shorter period than current expectations.  They had previously, by an email to Mr Baghurst on 22 February 2019, said that they would “struggle to express a view on pensions risks per se.  This is due to the inherent uncertainty in pensions – for example, the Pensions Regulator could require something different at future valuations, which we haven’t taken into account.”  The PwC Analysis, when it came, was consistent with these cautionary words.     </p>

The real issue, therefore, is whether the use that the Department made of PwC’s work vitiated all or part of its procurement process, which I consider later: see [568] ff below.  </p>

This is because any downside risks that do materialise could be absorbed by not paying dividends as planned and by drawing down on parent company support (PCS). These risks have had to be considered in isolation at this stage because the result of the FRT is not known on any competition, but the most credible financial outcome in terms of pensions will be included a part of the final FRT testing - this will consider the validity of the bid assumptions in combination with other risks. <span style="font-style:italic">It is critical that no evaluation or award decision is made or influenced by the downside analysis conducted by the Government Actuary's Department or PwC as the ITT does not allow for this, and to do so would introduce very significant procurement challenge risk.</span>” (Emphasis added)   </p>

At the end of the meeting BICC concluded to maintain its recommendation to the Secretary of State that the SE competition should be cancelled and that the EM and WCP competitions should continue.  There is no reference to the PwC Analysis in this section of the minutes.  On non-compliances there was reference to legal advice, all of which has been redacted.  It is clear from the context that one of the aspects of the legal advice related to the proposed amendments to the franchise agreements in each competition.  The minutes record that the consideration paper provided strong reasoning for the elimination of WCTP and that a decision should be taken in short time, within the wider context of decisions to be taken on franchise competitions (which I take to be a reference to decisions on whether or not to continue the current competitions, though this inference is not critical).  BICC concluded that further work was necessary, including that “clear and consolidated legal advice should be shared with ministers, recognising the risks and exposure to challenge of any disqualification”; but, at the conclusion of the item, endorsed the recommendation to disqualify WCTP from the competition. </p>

Further, we consider there to be a medium-high risk that such a challenge would succeed bearing in mind that: (a) most bidders have bid compliantly based on the current risk allocation; and (b) PWC's analysis suggests that those bidders were not behaving unreasonably in so doing. The concern is that an inference would be drawn that the Department had acted in a discriminatory manner against those bidders who have bid compliantly. If such a claim were to succeed the claimant would be very likely to recover not only its wasted bid costs but also its lost profit, a claim which in the case of current leading bidders could be very substantial indeed given the strong arguments they could make that they would otherwise have been awarded the contract.” </p>

In May 2018, you wrote to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury seeking agreement for the inclusion of a risk sharing mechanism which applied to changes to deficit recovery contributions resulting from the 2019 actuarial valuation and each subsequent actuarial valuation during the relevant franchise term. In order to incentivise TOCs to take a long-term view on pension provision, TOCs were to remain on full risk for changes to future service contributions. After a lengthy delay, and extensive engagement at senior official level, the Chancellor eventually agreed to the use of a mechanism, but stated that it must be limited to the 2019 valuation point only.  </p>

Those considerations included questions that are not obviously within the court’s competence to assess such as, for example, the interplay between the three franchises and the forthcoming spending review that was due to take place during the 2019/2020 financial year. It was implicit in this section that (a) the Secretary of State would have to make a decision on exclusion for pensions non-compliance in the SE competition even if he cancelled it, and (b) the Secretary of State would have to make a decision on exclusion for pensions non-compliance in all three competitions, come what may.  It is a matter of forensic interest that most of the section on the available options from paragraph 50 onwards was barely referred to during the trial, the focus of attention being on the earlier passages and Annex A to the virtual exclusion of all else.  The section and reasoning on options was, however, an integral part of the submissions provided to Ministers. </p>

It appears from a sequence of emails that Mr Smith prepared for the meeting by obtaining a copy of the PwC Analysis and information about the basis of the bidders’ non-compliances on pensions across the three franchises.  A latedisclosed note made by Ms Greig, the Secretary of State’s private secretary, evidences that Stagecoach’s non-compliance on pensions was discussed, that there was a “basket of issues” on the SE competition, and that if there was an award on the EM competition, Stagecoach would know at that point that they would be disqualified from all competitions, a point made separately in the EM Franchise submission to the minister.  Her note, taken in conjunction with another (late-disclosed) note from a Mr Edwards, suggests that the Secretary of State was told that Stagecoach were trying to transfer all risk to the Government which would leave them with no incentive to pursue reform of the RPS and, more generally, that the Secretary of State was expressing significant concerns about the ability to get the SE competition “over the line”.  There is what appears to be a reference to the PwC Analysis and to “extreme scenarios” being tested.

But he said that, although the second point did not feature in the CCS, the reasons were already in existence before the SIAP meeting and before the decision was taken to disqualify on 1 April 2019 and that SIAP merely confirmed them. His evidence on this point was confirmed by Mr MacDonald who said that the Department were very uncertain about how to unwind and price a risk so as to create equality between the bids or assess how the bids would have looked if they had been bid on the same basis.  Their evidence is also supported by the terms of an email from Grant Thornton on 12 February 2019.  I accept their evidence that the Department had been conscious of the difficulty or impossibility of equalising bids where some had accepted the pensions risk and others had not. That evidence referred to internal departmental thinking.  It does not of itself demonstrate or evidence that the Secretary of State had the point in mind when deciding to disqualify the Claimants.  Mr MacDonald, who signed the disqualification letters, said (and I accept) that he took advice to consider what should be written in the letters, and confirmed that the letters were drafted by the legal team.  There is no evidence that the letters were referred to Ministers before being sent.  They were sent on 9 April 2019, in the materially identical terms set out at [188] above.   </p>

That said, it is convenient at this point to review and make main findings about what reasons for the disqualifications are shown by the evidence.  In doing so, I bear in mind that the relevant decision-maker is the Secretary of State himself and that he made his decisions after receipt of the briefing documents that I have described at some length: see [332] ff above.  He had also received the Ministerial Submission before the meeting on 19 February 2019, which attached the paper that had been submitted to BICC on 18 February 2019: see [299] and [305]  above.  In my judgment, the other primary sources of evidence to be examined are the letter that the Secretary of State sent to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on making his decision: see [351] above; the emails from the Secretary of State’s private secretary recording the decisions: see [346]-[349] above; and the disqualification letters themselves: see [187]-[190] above.

Its seriousness was also reflected in the continuing discussions during 2018, in the course of which representations were made to the Department, the Department gave bidders sight of an “hypothetical” PRSM that was stated to be subject to Treasury approval, and then the Department formulated the Government’s final position (including the PRSM and PRP) by the terms of the Rebid instructions that were reinforced by re-iterated warnings about the need for compliance.  Intense lobbying, right up to the Secretary of State himself, had consistently been met with the response that bidders could not cherry pick and were to price the franchise compliantly.  Leaving all these considerations temporarily on one side, the allocation of risk is, self-evidently, a central feature of any major procurement; and attempts to re-allocate risk back to Government in the knowledge (confirmed in answer to AQ218) that it was and would be treated as non-compliance were attempts knowingly taken to adjust basic terms of the contract proposed by the Government.  Every time the Claimants at trial emphasised the magnitude of the risk to which they say they were being subjected by the Defendant’s proposed terms, they illuminated the selfevident seriousness of their re-allocating non-compliance. </p>

Little can be gleaned from the Submission, the annexed BICC paper on cancellation or the scant information about the meeting itself save that the Secretary of State’s focus seems to have been on the operational difficulties affecting the two SE competition bids that were pensions compliant.

That said, paragraph 37 is clear and correct in saying that disqualification decisions had to be taken on a competition-bycompetition basis but that there would be no objective justification for taking a differential approach on the issue across the three franchises.

A conclusion that it was too risky would inevitably mean cancellation of the competitions.  But the CCS is astute at paragraph 41 to distinguish between evaluation of bids and the decision to continue with or cancel the competitions and warns that the PwC Analysis is separate to the bid evaluation process, the warning being repeated in stronger terms at paragraphs 16 and 17 of Annex A.  This distinction between the bid evaluation and carrying out additional stress testing using the PwC work is also present in the EM Franchise paper.  Paragraph 44 then addresses the alternatives of cancellation or calling for a rebid on the basis of different risk allocation, and concludes that either course would carry a high risk of being challenged and a significant risk that such challenges would be successful.  This is an obvious recognition of and reference to the public law principles and procurement risks arising from them that are the subject of this action.  Those principles and procurement risks are revisited at paragraphs 2326 of Annex A.  Paragraph 25 evidently refers to the question of varying the risk sharing approach that was currently in place: no other deductions can be made.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On these materials I find that the Secretary of State disqualified the Claimants (and Arriva) in each case because their non-compliances on pensions were considered as being sufficiently serious to merit disqualification from the competitions due to the level of risk on pensions which those bidders sought to transfer back to the Department.  That was, in my judgment based on the immediately relevant materials assessed in the context of all of the evidence about the importance of the pensions issue for all parties, the reason for the disqualification.  As the disqualification letters correctly stated, it represented inconsistency with the Department’s policy in respect of the allocation of risk on the issue as reflected in the specification.  The reasoning supporting the Defendant’s reason included that the Claimants’ bids proposed actual or de facto amendments to the signature documents which would alter the balance of risk in their favour and were therefore considered to be significantly non-compliant; and that there was no objective justification for taking a differential approach on the pensions non-compliance issue across the three franchises.  The decision was taken in the knowledge and taking into account that for the Defendant to make further changes to the risk allocation approach that it had put in place would carry a high risk of being challenged by disappointed market participants with an unacceptable risk that such a challenge might succeed because the inference would be drawn that the Secretary of State as decision-maker and the Department had acted in a discriminatory manner (in other words, in breach of its public law duties raised in this action).  It would have been “exceptionally difficult” (which in context meant practically impossible) to get Treasury agreement to a change in the Department’s policy on risk allocation in the three competitions; and any mechanism that the Treasury would be prepared to permit would be unlikely to result in non-compliant bids becoming compliant or offer better value for money to the Department. Combining these supporting strands of reasoning, and particularly in the light of its public law duties, the Department and Defendant concluded that he could not properly have come to any decision other than to reject the bids for non-compliance. <br/></p>

The Claimants submit that the court should limit itself to interpreting the terms of the ITT as and when originally issued.  The Defendant submits that the appropriate time is the time that bids were submitted because that is when the bidders committed themselves to engagement with the current terms of the procurement.  The Defendant is right on this point because, on the particular facts of this case, the Claimants’ challenge is to the process of the rebids and their evaluation.  On the rebid, bidders did not bid solely against the terms of the ITT – they bid also on the terms of the rebid instructions (the lawfulness of which is no longer subject to separate challenge): see [230]-[234] above.  By that time, the context in which the ITT and bidding instructions fell to be interpreted by RWIND tenderers had also developed to some extent.  However, to avoid unnecessary disputation later, I will decide this issue (a) by reference to the time of the issuing of the original ITT and (b) by reference to the time of the rebids.  </p>

Specifically, under the terms of the original ITT, paragraph 4.1.2 was clear, precise and unequivocal in stating that a contractual amendment which sought to transfer risk from the franchisee to the Secretary of State would mean that the bid was deemed non-compliant.  There is, in my judgment, no reasonable basis for an argument that the provision breaches the obligation of transparency or fairness.  It could only be interpreted in one way by any RWIND tenderer and was not unfair either as between tenderers or as between tenderers and the Defendant.  Terms about and in support of a contractual allocation of risk are subject to a wide margin of appreciation because (a) they reflect the terms on which the contracting authority is prepared to contract as part of an overall package of rights, risks and obligations, and (b) the terms about allocation of risk in the ITT are the contractual manifestation of policy decisions about the allocation of public resources.  It is not reasonably arguable that a term such as paragraph 4.1.2 which is present to support and emphasise the ITT’s provisions about allocation of resources is outside the scope of proper contract terms as between the Department and bidders or that it is in any sense lacking in transparency or fairness. </p>

Once that is done, there is no lack of clarity or precision, and the term is unequivocal.  Nor is the discretion “unlimited” as the Claimants suggest.  It is limited by the requirement that the discretion be exercised on a principled basis.  It is therefore to be exercised rationally and in accordance with the policy upon which it is based; and it may not be exercised on an unlimited, arbitrary or capricious basis.  These principles are sufficiently well known and definite to render the discretion transparent.  The RWIND tenderer would know that it was protected by the need for any exercise of the discretion to be exercised on a principled and proportionate basis and to be challengeable if it was not. </p>

Where no discretion could be exercised, because a particular noncompliance would lead to automatic disqualification, the principle of transparency required that to be stated – and it was.

Viewed in isolation, the terms of the ITT drew specific attention to the prohibition on attempting to reallocate risk from the franchisee to the Secretary of State, which would (even without this indication) reasonably be regarded as touching directly on the basic terms of the contract.  However, the terms of the ITT should not be viewed in isolation but in context; and by the time the first ITT (for the SE competition) was issued in November 2017, the pensions problem was well known to the passenger rail industry, including any RWIND tenderer: see [125] ff above.  There could be no doubt for any interested party that the pensions problem was serious and that the provisions of the ITT dealing with the allocation of risk were terms of high importance, reasonably justifying description as “basic terms”. </p>

But this fact is uninformative and, if anything, tends to support the validity of an approach which does not seek to micromanage the discretion but relies upon it being exercised in accordance with established principle.  What is more informative is not the frequency or infrequency of disqualifications but whether the working out of a principled approach can be seen to have led to capricious or arbitrary results.  That is not the evidence here.  The evidence is that a party has been disqualified for non-compliance only once in recent times, that being Stagecoach’s disqualification from the SW competition because they proposed significant amendments to the Franchise Agreement.  Nor is there evidence of similar situations being treated differently in the exercise of the discretion provided by the ITT: although other bidders submitted bids that were non-compliant in other respects they were assessed separately and (correctly) were not treated as if they were the same as or similar to non-compliance on pensions.  </p>

I reject (a) as a matter and finding of fact: see [173] to [181] above.  As to (b), the submission is literally correct, because the outcome of any exercise of discretion is unknown until the discretion is exercised; but that does not assist the Claimants, even if they are to be taken as the personification of a RWIND tenderer.  In my judgment, any RWIND tenderer should and would have realised that material non-compliance on pensions gave rise to a serious risk of principled disqualification.  That risk was not reduced by the fact that no TOC-wide solution had yet been found.  The period for contractual discussion, including bilateral meetings up to and including meetings with the Secretary of State himself, came to an end when tenderers were invited to tender their final rebids against the terms then on offer.  There was no indication and no reason to believe that those terms were anything other than final or that they invited counterproposals on the allocation of risk.  </p>

Any RWIND tenderer in these competitions would have been aware, at least in general terms, of the protracted process by which the Department had arrived at the position of offering the PRSM; and any RWIND tenderer who had been contemplating bidding non-compliantly would (or at least should) have raised that possibility, as Stagecoach did, with the Department in bilateral meetings or written clarificatory questions.  Had they done so, the RWIND tenderer would have received the same unequivocal message that the Department required compliance with the Franchise Signature Documents in the specific context of the pensions rebid.  All that had happened since the original issuing of the ITTs had served to re-emphasise the “big ticket” nature of the issue or, in other colloquial terms, that this was a “monster problem” (for the Department and bidders alike).  Accordingly, if assessed at the time of the rebids in the broader context then prevailing (including but not limited to the rebid instructions and associated information provided by the Department) the terms of the ITT were transparent and fair. </p>

In one sense it is correct, because imposition of the contractual obligations was a consequence of the Defendant’s decisions on allocation of risks and resources and would not have happened otherwise.  But this is not of any material assistance in deciding whether the imposition of the risks on the franchisees was lawful. In another, more general, sense the submission is wrong.  A pension scheme for employees is a “natural” incident of running any business; and it has been an established feature of employment on the railways in the United Kingdom since before privatisation.  What is more, the RPS is a <span style="font-style:italic">private </span>pension scheme for the benefit of railway employees, including those who are the TOC’s employees during the franchise, and the franchisee is the Designated Employer for its duration.

Franchisees would prefer not to be subject to potential liabilities, for obvious commercial reasons.  The Government has policy reasons associated with incentivising reform and avoiding the disbursement of public funds on a private pension scheme.  Leaving aside the question of uncertainty of outturn, neither side’s wishes or reasons triggered any known principle of EU or UK law that required the Defendant to accept that risk rather than imposing it on the franchisee, as had always been the case.  Subject to the questions raised in Issue 4, there is no principle of EU or UK law that limits the size of a risk that may be allocated to one contracting party or another in a public procurement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor can I accept that uncertainty of outcome engaged the principle of transparency so as to render the imposition of the risk upon the franchisees unlawful.  First, as I have said earlier in this judgment, uncertainty of outcome is the essence of risk; and bidders have to deal with commercial risk in any substantial procurement.  Their ultimate protection is always to decline to bid, as it was in this case.  There is no principle of EU or UK law that a procurement must be so structured that every potential bidder can or will bid or even that a particular subset of potential bidders can or will bid: see <span style="font-style:italic">Concordia Bus Finland Oy Ba </span>[2002] ECR I-07213 at [85].  If all were to decline to bid, that would be an intensely unsatisfactory outcome, but it would not mean or even suggest that the terms being offered were unlawful, either for reasons of transparency or otherwise.  Second, this was a risk that could be estimated and priced as any other, as Mr Paterson rightly acknowledged.  It is to be expected and normal that different bidders would reach different estimates of any risk and the fact that scarily large worst-case numbers could be generated does not affect the question of principle.  This is as true for thinly capitalised special purpose vehicles with limited exposure of capital in the form of bonds and PCS as it would have been for bidders with greater financial substance and greater sums at risk. Third, if the complaint is that the Defendant failed to provide an estimate of the outturn costs, the bidders were in as good a position as the Defendant to estimate the risks, being </p>

Fourth, the margin of appreciation that is open to a contracting authority in relation to the allocation of public resources, including the level of state support or protection that it will make available to a prospective bidder, is wide.  Fifth, the Defendant would not be in a better position than the franchisee to manage the risks as and when they arose and, in some respects (e.g. in the face of prospective industrial action) would be in a worse position because of its lack of direct involvement.  Sixth, the adequacy or otherwise of the FRT as a means of identifying whether a bidder would be able to bear the risk does not affect the transparency or fairness of the allocation of pension risks to the franchisees.  They could assess for themselves whether the risk was bearable.  If its FRT was inadequate the Defendant lacked a degree of assurance about the future financial stability of the franchise.  That might be regrettable; but it does not render the contract unlawful.  </p>

This is because of the underlying point that it is for a contracting authority to determine the nature and extent of the contracts into which it wishes to enter.  There is no self-contained principle of EU or UK public law that prohibits the allocation of large risks (whether certain or not) to bidding parties.  The ultimate protection for bidders is that they are not obliged to bid and, if they do, need only bid if they conclude that the balance of risks and rewards that goes to make up their bid is commercially acceptable to them. Obviously, to some extent, every burden that is allocated to a bidder will make the package less attractive and may affect the willingness of prospective bidders to bid at all or, if they are prepared to do so, the price at which they will bid.  Thus a package such as set out in these ITTs and draft Franchise Signature Agreements may not have been the optimum solution for achieving value for money and may not have appealed to all prospective franchisees; but those considerations do not demonstrate or even suggest that the packages fell outside the wide margin of appreciation allowed to a contracting authority to stipulate how it proposes to allocate public resources.   Similarly, the Department’s fears that some bidders would find the risk unacceptable and walk away might be real and might, in the event, have been realised; but that does not of itself demonstrate that such an allocation was unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Claimants rely upon their characterisation of the pensions risk as exogenous.  The classic example of an exogenous risk is a market crash over which a contracting party will have no control at all.  The pensions risk is not of the same order.  The RPS is a private pension scheme directly affecting and funded by the TOCs as Designated Employers and the members.  This direct interest is also reflected in the composition of the Trustee Board.  As was made clear in the early stages of TPR’s intervention, the UK Government has no responsibility for funding or managing sections: see [127] above.  By contrast the franchisees have a closer relationship with the Trustee than does the Department, though under the provisions of Schedule 16 the Defendant’s permission is required before certain steps can be taken; and they are in a better position than the Department to promote and negotiate reform or change with their employees and the trade unions, both as Designated Employer and through the medium of the RDG.  It is in their interests to do so, not least because they will be most immediately and directly affected in the event of industrial unrest amongst their employees.  So although the franchisees have no control over TPR, it is incorrect to suggest that they have no control or influence over the pensions problem and the liabilities which it may generate.  These features all go to support the Treasury’s established wish to keep its distance from what it regards (correctly) as a private pension scheme.  More importantly, there is no principle of EU or UK law that requires that such a risk must be allocated by contract to Government rather than to other contracting parties.  Nor, as I have said, was there any formalised policy (in the wake of the Brown Review or otherwise) which required such risks to be allocated to Government such that failure to do so would render the allocation unlawful.  More generally, there is no principle of EU or UK public law that prohibits the allocation of exogenous risks (properly so called) to bidders rather than to Government. </p>

Third, there is recognition that franchisees were not able to change their obligations under existing franchises.  Fourth, there is the recognition that TOCs were free not to enter into future franchises, which would apply whatever their reasons for eventually not wishing to take on the pension risk or if there was some other reason altogether.  Fifth, taken in context, the cited passage does not evidence any effective or substantial deterrent effect, referring only to “serious concern”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Viewed more widely, there is no evidence that the allocation of the pensions risk to franchisees acted as an effective deterrent so as to breach the freedoms guaranteed by Articles 49 and 56.  There was substantial transnational engagement in each competition.  This engagement included bids involving Trenitalia, RENFE, SNCF, Deutsche Bahn (of which Arriva was a subsidiary), Nederlandse Spoorwegen (of which Abellio was a subsidiary) and Keolis (as a joint venturer in Govia) having involvement over the three competitions.  Of these, SNCF formed part of WCTP and, as appears from the evidence of the meeting on 16 November 2018, were effectively led into the decision to bid as WCTP did by Stagecoach and (perhaps to a lesser extent) Virgin.  Arriva’s reasons for not bidding compliantly are not the subject of evidence because of the settlement of their actions immediately before trial.  That leaves Stagecoach, whose reasons for bidding non-compliantly on pensions have been examined in detail in this judgment.  They are complex and are based on a commercial choice not to price in the risks.  As outlined elsewhere, Stagecoach’s decision-makers were influenced by extreme estimates of worst-case projections, the likelihood of which was vanishingly small, though I am not in a position to find that their influence was determinative (rather than merely contributory).  Viewed overall, however, the evidence supports the finding that Stagecoach could have bid compliantly at a level that would have given them protection with which they were comfortable.  That they chose not to bid accordingly does not lend support to a submission that the enormity of the potential outturn of the pensions risk acted as a deterrent that breached the freedoms guaranteed by Articles 49 and 56; still less does it demonstrate breach.  Stagecoach were not prevented from participating in the procurements: they simply chose not to participate compliantly.  I therefore reject the submission that there was any breach of those freedoms.  And, for the avoidance of doubt, I would reject a submission that the procurement process would have breached those freedoms even if the PRSM had been omitted.  The procurements were and would have been transparent and fair in being clearly stated, affecting all bidders equally, and being capable of being met by compliant bids that priced in the risks to which bidders were exposed. </p>

The test would therefore be whether the allocation of the pension risk to the franchisees, given the wide margin of appreciation that would apply, was proved to be “manifest error”.  The Claimants do not advance a case on this basis, their case being that the allocation of risk with the PRSM failed to achieve the policy objective of protecting the bidders from risks that were disproportionate and uncertain and that they could not control.  That case rests on the submission that the Department could </p>

For all its limitations, the PRSM was a benefit for bidders.  The Claimants’ submission that “the onus is … on the Defendant to show that it was proportionate to impose these pension risks subject only to the more limited PRSM which it eventually offered” is therefore wrong and rejected.  Adopting the less strict approach to proportionality that is appropriate to the decision to allocate the pension risks to the franchisees, it cannot be said that there has been manifest error or that the Defendant acted outside the wide margin of appreciation that was available to it.  The countervailing policy considerations that were in play included, on the one hand, the DfT’s wish to improve value for money and, on the other, the Treasury’s policy position on private pension schemes: see [147] and [200] above.  This is an area where the court should be very slow to intervene.  In my judgment it would be an unwarranted judicial intervention to second guess the proper outcome of these policy tensions.  And, for the avoidance of doubt, I am not satisfied that, had the DfT gone back to the Treasury in October 2018, the outcome either would, should or even might have been any different for the current competitions.   </p>

First, as an Interested Party, acknowledges their agreement.  However, the court is requested to determine Issue 5.2 on an assumed basis, indicated by the introductory words “Insofar as there was any breach… .”  There is a degree of circularity in this division of issues, because it is conceivable that the scope of any duty may be affected by whether or not earlier provision of information about potential delays to HS2 would have affected bidders’ attitudes to the Defendant’s proposals on the PRSM.  In order to give sense and substance to the Issue, it must be deemed to cover the Defendant’s proposals for both the PRSM and the PRP.  For these reasons I agree that, in the absence of Issue 5.1, Issue 5.2 must be limited to the factual question whether the more timely provision of information about potential delays to HS2 would have affected bidders’ attitudes to the Defendant’s proposals on the PRSM and the PRP.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hayes explained that, upon a switch to IOC terms, the Government would bear all costs and revenue risk, with the franchisee being remunerated on a cost reimbursement model to ensure flexible delivery of the Integrated Services.  After some debate it was concluded that, if and while there was a Reset Period, protection should be offered against DRC liabilities.  As explained by Mr Hayes and Mr Baghurst, the Department’s concern was that, because bidders could not include specific financial proposals in their bid for the period from April 2026, if they were left exposed to DRC liabilities during a Reset Period, they might build a contingency into their bid for the pre-April 2026 period, resulting in a reduction in premium payments for a contingency that might not arise.  The proposal and the drafting were run past the Treasury to ensure cross-governmental agreement. </p>

If the level of those payments had increased (beyond, in the case of post 1 April 2026 changes, a small nil band i.e. the Threshold Amount), the franchisee’s premium payment to the Government would reduce and there was therefore no need for the Franchisee to include a contingency for that risk which might never arise (but would, if a contingency was included, lead to reduced premium payments and therefore worse value for money for the Government and the taxpayer).

Neither they nor any other bidder raised a CQ about current prospects for timely delivery of HS2 in 2026, which they could have done had it been of any materiality to their thinking or the formulation of their bids.  Stagecoach’s financial modelling included the assumption that there would be delay for the whole 5 year period; but there is no other evidence that Stagecoach gave any consideration to the consequences of a delay to HS2 and whether it would be detrimental to their interests, even though (a) the prospect was plainly stated by the terms of the ITT and Franchise Agreement and (b) the Defendant had given no representation in the context of the procurement or otherwise that HS2 would in fact come on stream in time.

He understood the mechanisms and their limitations; he also understood the concept of re-baselining and consequential premium reductions; and he assumed (as was reasonable even if others would not necessarily share his view) that if a question arose about an underlying contingency not being satisfied, the Department would, as with other similar clauses, enter into dialogue and would not wish to operate the mechanism in such a way as to put the franchise in financial difficulty.     </p>

Apart from Mr Clancy, whose assessment was that both the PRSM and the PRP provided valuable protection such that First resolved that it could and should bid, there was on 3 December 2018 a series of email exchanges when Mr Griffiths was attending a dinner with representatives of other bidders.  It became apparent that others did not share Stagecoach’s views, with Go Ahead and Abellio saying that they thought the protection provided by the PRSM was better than what they currently had and better than the solution then being promoted by the RDG.  In an email on 4 December 2018 to most of the relevant operating groups, including Mr Griffiths for Stagecoach, Mr Long of MTR said “We would like it to be made clear somewhere in [a proposed letter that was under discussion] that we support the current franchise bids being evaluated on the basis and methodology and assumptions that have been provided by DFT to bidders for each competition.”  The fact that the majority of bidders bid compliantly on pensions itself evidences that they were comfortable to bid compliantly against the overall package, including the protection provided by the PRSM. </p>

Furthermore, to the extent that there was any cross-examination of Mr Hayes, it proceeded on the false basis of an assumption that the ICWC phase would be pre-HS2 and then the IOC phase would be once HS2 began.  This was incorrect because, as Mr Hayes explained, the division was between pre-April 2026, which would be on ICWC terms typical of other franchises, and then from April 2026 when the Department had a choice about whether to move to IOC terms or not: although the Department needed to switch to IOC terms in order to operate HS2, it was not required that HS2 should be in operation in order for IOC to come into place.  It was therefore not inevitable that the Department would trigger a Reset Period if HS2 was in delay: it might for reasons prevailing at the time (of which Mr Hayes gave a credible example in cross-examination) decide to switch to IOC terms in any event.  Accordingly, delay to HS2 may not lead to a Reset Period or to the risk of any further exposure to pensions liabilities. </p>

They submit that the non-compliance log included an undisclosed scale of 1-5 for rating the “seriousness” of non-compliances on which scale non-compliances involving a transfer of risk to the Secretary of State would be given a high mark.  It is also submitted that this amounted to an undisclosed policy or criterion which contradicted the terms of the ITT because Section 3.5 and paragraph 7.2.1.5 of the ITT provided for non-compliant bids to be accepted and compared with compliant bids. </p>

I accept the evidence of Ms Palmer that each project was given the same template and could customise it as they wished by adjusting its application to the specific features and circumstances of the particular competition on which they were working.  The template provided for potential non-compliances to be rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being low and 5 being high.  The template allocated descriptions to each number on the scale, ranging from “ignore” for 1 up to “consider elimination” for 5.  It was open to people taking part in the processing of bids to substitute their own labels for each number and some did so.  For example, Eversheds Sutherland relabelled 1 or 2 as “Minor – a technical non-compliance…” and progressed up to 5 which was relabelled as “Serious – an amendment to the terms of a Franchise Signature Document which alters the risk allocation as between DfT and Franchisee or a disregard by the bidder of the procedural requirements of the ITT …”.  The Eversheds Sutherland template separately recorded “Available Decisions”, which were not correlated to the 1-5 scale and ranged from “Ignore” through “Dialogue with bidders” and “Adjust ITT e.g. if DfT wishes to accept non-compliance and apply to all bidders” to “Eliminate”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The use to which the 1-5 scale was put does not appear on the face of the documents.  However, I accept the evidence of Ms Palmer, Mr Hayes, Mr Brandenburger and Mr MacDonald that it was treated solely as an administrative tool, the purpose of which was to assist in prioritising which identified potential non-compliances should be worked on first either because of their complexity or their potential seriousness.  I refer to “potential” non-compliances because I accept the evidence of Mr Hayes that entering something on the log did not mean that it would ultimately be treated as a non-compliance.  I accept and find that, at a later stage in the process, the evaluation of the potential non-compliances was carried out by a different team that was kept separate from the team that did the administrative prioritisation using the 1-5 scale.  The scale was not itself a part of that later evaluation of non-compliances.  In Mr MacDonald’s words, the scale was used “as a means only to identify whether the noncompliances were significant for the purpose of allocating administrative resource and did not form any part of the evaluation process itself.”  In short, though the phrase is ugly, I accept Ms Palmer’s evidence that the scale was conceived and applied as “an internal administrative prioritisation tool” and not as part of the substantive evaluation process.  It was not itself part of the methodology by which the Defendant decided how to respond to non-compliances.  Decisions on how to respond came later and were not influenced or determined by the scale.  The scale did not amount to an evaluation criterion or sub-criterion (however described) used by the Defendant (or any members of the teams for whom it was responsible) in deciding whether to disqualify the Claimants or in making other material decisions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On these findings of fact, the existence and use of the non-compliance log scale neither was nor evidences the existence of an undisclosed policy as alleged by the Claimants.  Nor was its existence or use inconsistent with what bidders were told in the ITT.  The provisions of the ITT left the principled exercise of the discretion about how to react to non-compliances with the decision-maker, as explained elsewhere in this judgment; and neither that discretion nor its exercise was affected by the existence or use of the non-compliance log scale.  Thus, whatever number had been allocated in the non-compliance log, it remained for the decision-maker to decide how serious a given non-compliance was and how it should be treated.  Even a noncompliance involving allocation of risk to the Secretary of State could be trivial by, for example, an adjustment and identifiable transfer of a few hundred pounds.  No one suggests that the Claimants’ non-compliances were of such triviality; but if they had been, the existence of the principled discretion would protect the Claimants, whatever rating was ascribed in the non-compliance log – just as with the adoption of wrong font size.  The allocation of a number in the non-compliance log was separate from and irrelevant to the exercises of discretion that led to the disqualification of the Claimants in these cases. The use of the non-compliance log scale thus falls within the ambit of the leeway that was available to the Defendant in carrying out its evaluation: see [37] above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is common ground that proportionality must be considered in context.  Unsurprisingly, the Defendant’s approach to relevant context barely overlaps with that of the Claimants.  Put shortly, the Defendant relies upon the contextual evidence that shows the Claimants’ non-compliance to have been deliberate and sustained and in the full knowledge of the high risk that disqualification would follow.  I have made my findings on this evidence: see [172]-[173] above for a relatively brief summary.  In addition, the earlier iterations of the PRSM and the Department’s views on the meaning and applicability of the Brown Review fade from direct relevance once the Department set out its actual and current policy on risk allocation by the terms of the ITT, the re-bid Instructions and the draft Franchise Signature Agreements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The starting point is the terms of the Defendant’s discretion.  It arose from the provisions of the ITT and was to be exercised in a principled manner as outlined at [44]-[56] above. It fell to be exercised having regard to the interests and legal entitlements not only of the Claimants and the Defendant but of the other bidders, particularly those who had bid compliantly.  Because, as I have held, the terms of the ITT and re-bid Instructions allocating the pensions risks were not inherently unlawful, it cannot be suggested that the Claimants had any public or private law right to have their proposed terms as to risk allocation imposed on compliant bidders, whether by way of a rebid or, more drastically still, by cancellation with or without a follow up competition.  The principles of equal treatment and transparency upon which the Claimants rely in support of their interests applied equally to protect the interests of compliant bidders, the difference being that they had complied with the requirements of the ITT and had a legitimate public law interest in the treatment of their compliant bids satisfying the principles of equal treatment and transparency that I have outlined at [26]-[36] above.  In such circumstances, the Defendant’s discretion <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to disqualify was circumscribed by the principles of transparency and equality of treatment.  An obligation to treat other bidders fairly and equally did not remove the Defendant’s undoubted discretion – but it provided reasons why the discretion should be exercised in a particular way.  </p>

The exercise of the Defendant’s discretion concerning the Claimants’ noncompliances accordingly fell within the scope of EU law; and it did so without imposing restrictions on an established right conferred by the EU Treaties.  That being so the court would only intervene with his exercise of the discretion on proportionality grounds on proof that the exercise was “manifestly inappropriate”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning first to the option of repricing the Claimants’ bids as provided for by the ITT, there is a pervasive ambiguity and lack of clarity in the Claimants’ case that seems to me to be fundamental to this option and, more generally, to this issue.  The Claimants have not made clear whether it is their case that, after a repricing exercise (however conducted), the Defendant should have contracted with the Claimants (a) on terms that incorporated their proposed allocation of risk or (b) on the Defendant’s terms as set out in the ITT and rebids.  This problem is not merely hypothetical because the Claimants had confirmed repeatedly (including by their original bids, face-to-face with the Secretary of State and by their responses to AQ218) that they were not prepared to contract on the Defendant’s terms; and there was and is no obligation upon the Defendant to contract on Stagecoach’s.  Taking for the moment the prospect of the Defendant contracting with the Claimants on Stagecoach’s favoured terms, what would have been required was a repricing of the compliant bids in an attempt to bring them into line with the Claimants’ approach. Taking the alternative prospect of contracting with the Claimants on ITT terms (and ignoring for the moment the fact that the Claimants would not do so), that would require repricing the Claimants’ bids in an attempt to bring them into line with the compliant bids.  Assuming either of these routes to have been possible for the Defendant, it would appear to have been the clearest possible breach of the principle of equal treatment to have done so without reverting to the compliant bidders.  The risk of a challenge would have been not merely high but virtually certain; and the outcome would have been very likely to be adverse to the Defendant.  So, in practical terms, a repricing could not have led to the Defendant contracting with the Claimants either on the terms set out in the ITT or on the terms proposed by the Claimants.  This ambiguity, which was identified during the trial, has not been addressed, still less clarified, by the Claimants.    </p>

The potential for such claims existed whether the Defendant re-priced and adjusted the terms of the Claimants’ bids to make those terms compliant (i.e. the course which the Claimants had resolutely refused to take) or performed some other exercise which retained the Claimants’ chosen terms as the basis for contracting.   </p>

It is no answer to say that the Defendant assessed the most credible outcome of incorporating Stagecoach’s extension of the PRSM to cover all future valuations as having no net effect for the Defendant.

The Stagecoach bid, their price didn’t take account of that risk that would have potentially caused the Department to incur costs, and so the two prices were not comparable.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">In deciding whether to conduct a repricing exercise, the Defendant would have been bound to take into account that adding in the extended pensions risk would inevitably reflect somewhere in the contract price.  As Mr Macdonald explained in evidence, there could be diverse perceptions of the pensions risk that would have been factored in to the compliant bids; and there could be no confidence that the Defendant could make an adjustment to the Claimants’ bids (or the compliant bids) that accurately represented the Claimants’ evaluation of the risk or that of their competitors.  In other words, irrespective of what would be the outcome of following the procedure laid down by paragraphs 3.5.4 or 7.2.1.5 of the ITT, had the Defendant chosen to use them, it was not possible to quantify the financial impact of the pensions noncompliance on price with any reliability, as had been pointed out by Grant Thornton in their email on 12 February 2019.  Nor would it have been possible to predict how a compliant bidder’s bid would have changed if they had known that the Claimants’ allocation of risk would be acceptable and accepted.  I therefore accept the accuracy of First’s submission that quantifying the financial impact on the Defendant does not address the discrete issue of the impact on the other bidders of accepting the non-compliance and does not address the requirements of equal treatment.  These considerations would feed directly into a compliant bidder’s challenge based on breaches of the principles of equal treatment and transparency: as it was not possible to compare compliant and non-compliant bids on a genuine like-for-like basis, any attempt to do so would involve treating the bidders unequally. </p>

That discretion would have to be exercised on the same principled basis as applied to the Defendant’s discretion to disqualify.  Calling upon the Claimants alone to submit a compliant rebid would have been an idle exercise given the Claimants’ confirmation that they had no intention of complying on pensions and because it would have run into precisely the same issues of equal treatment and transparency as would have applied to a re-pricing exercise.

But it is not obvious why the Claimants’ unwillingness to bid compliantly should, of itself, have been used as a reason for cancellation.  I have recognised that Stagecoach may have had in mind that, if all bids were non-compliant, the Defendant might have to think again: see [182] above.

However, on the basis of the wide-ranging arguments during this trial, my view is that, if the Defendant had chosen any other route than disqualification, the risk of a successful challenge by compliant bidders would have been extremely high and not a risk that the Defendant could sensibly contemplate unless absolutely compelled to do so, which he was not.

Their meaning was clear: the objections to other courses of action led inexorably to the conclusion that disqualification was the proper exercise of the Defendant’s discretion. </p>

It is described in detail elsewhere in this judgment.  In my judgment the Defendant is justified in describing the breach as “not … a minor or incidental non-compliance but a directly confrontational refusal to accept the allocation that was clearly and specifically” (and, as I have found, lawfully) “set out in the Pensions Rebid Instructions.”  And it was a breach deliberately committed in full knowledge of its seriousness and the very high risk of disqualification. </p>

For the reasons given there, I do not accept the submission.  The submission that the Secretary of State decided to disqualify the Claimants because of legal advice that he was required to do so is based by the Claimants primarily upon what the Secretary of State said to the Transport Select Committee, which I have excluded for the reasons given at [77] to [101] above, though they also rely upon paragraph 44 of the CCS.  For the reasons explained when deciding Issue 6.3, I would accept that, as a matter of fact, the legal risks attendant upon changing the basis of risk allocation were high and unacceptable; and that they formed part of the Secretary of State’s reasoning, as I have found.  Since the Claimants had rejected the possibility of contracting on the terms of the ITT, the effect of the legal risks attendant upon changing the basis of risk allocation can reasonably be described as “compelling” in favour of disqualification. </p>

Financial adjustment or a rebid could be available in other circumstances which did not go to the fundamental or basic terms of the procurement; but in this case the Secretary of State was constrained by the position of the compliant bidders and the duties of transparency and equal treatment as already explained.  Nor is it any answer to submit that the compliant bidders were on an equal footing in enjoying no right that the Defendant would respond in any particular way to a noncompliance and no right that the Defendant would take the competition to a conclusion based on the existing rules and requirements of the procurement.  As a general proposition that is correct, but it does not assist in determining whether the Defendant’s exercise of his discretion in deciding to disqualify these Claimants for serious non-compliance on basic terms was lawful.  On the facts of these cases, the Secretary of State was entitled to keep the competitions running and to exercise his discretion in favour of disqualification.  It does not take the argument further to submit that the Secretary of State <span style="font-style:italic">could </span>have taken the view that the evaluation mechanism contained in the ITT was not capable of assessing robustness of bids to withstand downside risks.  The Defendant was not obliged to include any test of robustness and was not obliged to change tack after receipt of compliant bids simply because the FRT that he had put in place did not give total assurance of financial robustness.    </p>

This case is not based on breach of a Brown-based policy; nor could it be as there was never a formalised policy in relation to costs risks and therefore no basis for asserting that the Department was bound to follow one.  As the narrative sections of this judgment show, the policy-based approach to the pensions risk that was finally adopted came after cross-governmental debate that led to the inclusion of the PRSM.  There was no wider policy about allocation of risk that is of any relevance to the determination of this litigation.  To the extent that the submission is based upon “the Brown principle”, it is therefore misconceived.  What the rest of this judgment demonstrates and concludes is that the Claimants’ non-compliant inconsistency with the Defendant’s policy on pension risk allocation was serious and deliberate, which supported the exercise of the discretion in favour of disqualification.   </p>

That said, I would accept that this may well have been a strand of the Secretary of State’s reasoning when considering his public law duties, though proof that it was is lacking.

The proposed distinction is that (a) in the <span style="font-style:italic">Denmark </span>case the stated principle was that “the requirement of equal treatment would not be satisfied if tenderers were allowed to depart from the basic terms of the tender conditions by means of reservations, except where those terms expressly allow them to do so”, whereas (b) in the present case the ITT permitted the Defendant to proceed with non-compliant bids without disqualification and so did not rule out “reservations”.  In my judgment this is a false distinction.  The terms of the ITT about price and allocation of risk were “basic terms” and the Claimants were not permitted to depart from them.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Denmark </span>principle therefore applies.  The fact that the Defendant is given a discretion which is in terms that covers all non-compliances from the most trivial to the most serious does not amount to permission to depart from the ITT’s basic terms.  Conversely, the existence of the <span style="font-style:italic">Denmark </span>principle does not mean that the discretions under the ITT cease to exist though it may lead to the conclusion that the discretion should be exercised in a particular way, depending on the nature of the non-compliance. </p>

The assertion is not supported by the evidence.  The direct evidence comes from Mr Clancy of First, who explained First’s approach to and consideration of the possible eventuation of the pensions risks and how they priced those risks into their bid.  I have held that the challenges to his evidence came nowhere near showing that First’s approach was unreasonable.  There is no evidence to substantiate a finding that other bidders ignored pension risks either.  The evidence is to the contrary and is that, with the benefit of the PRSM, bidders were prepared to contract on the basis of the Defendant’s terms as to allocation of the pension risks, not on the basis that those risks were ignored.  Although Stagecoach took the commercial decision that it would not bid compliantly it was the view of Mr Hamilton and Mr Paterson that it could have done so: see [258] and [261] above.  The fact that it did not pursue a compliant course does not even suggest that those who did bid compliantly ignored the pensions risk.  </p>

In the light of those findings, and the fact that the Claimants’ non-compliances went beyond anything that the Treasury had contemplated even for future franchises, and the delays that would be inherent in going back to the Treasury and the public law risks arising from the fact that the Department had compliant bidders in place, it cannot reasonably be argued that the Department was obliged to go back to the Treasury on what would have been a fool’s errand.   </p>

I have taken all these matters into account in reaching my findings about what were the Defendant’s reasons and reasoning for his decision to disqualify the Claimants: see [305] ff above.  There was no recommendation to disqualify SSETL because the recommendation was to cancel the competition, in which case no question of disqualification would arise: see [334] above.  However, once the Secretary of State decided that, for the time being at least, the competition would continue, the logic for disqualifying SSETL was precisely the same as it was for the non-compliant bidders in the other competitions.  As the CCS correctly said, there was no objective justification for taking a differential approach across the three franchises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I have found that it is clear beyond argument, as it has been clear to all since 9 April 2019, that the Claimants were disqualified because their bids were non-compliant in rejecting the allocation of the risk of pensions in the tender documents and proposing contractual amendments which sought to transfer the pensions risk from the franchisee to the Secretary of State.  If it were necessary to do so, I would hold that it would have been sufficient for the disqualification letters to have said that and no more: in context that was all the Claimants needed to know to make them aware of the reasons for their disqualification and to enable them to defend their rights.  However, in fact the letters went further and, as has been amply demonstrated by the course of this litigation, has enabled the Claimants to defend their rights fully and with the maximum application of forensic rigour.   </p>

One illustrative example is the notice from Mr Griffiths to Stagecoach staff on 10 April 2019: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As noted at [119] above, the Government’s response to the Brown Review was to implement a revenue risk sharing mechanism; but it did not formulate or implement a cost sharing mechanism until the PRSM in 2018.  Also, in 2017 the Government introduced the DRAS element of the ITT’s methodology, which involved adjusting bidders’ revenue projections as part of the FRT because of concerns about overambitious revenue projections in bids: see [279] above.  The Claimants are therefore correct to say that these three competitions did not include financial robustness testing by reference to costs risks in general or pensions risks in particular.  The fact that GAD’s input took account of a 25% increase in technical provisions does not alter the basic premise on which the Claimants’ case is based, which is that the Defendant should have tested all realistically possible pensions downside outcomes as an obligatory component of robustness testing under the ITT. </p>

The Claimants allege that this amounted to taking a manifestly erroneous approach to the assessment of bids’ financial robustness and breached the Defendant’s duty of fairness because of the Defendant’s inability to assess reliably and distinguish between the robustness of different bids.  </p>

What is required by Article 5(3) is that the competitive tendering procedure should be open, fair, transparent and nondiscriminatory.  It points to the provisions and purposes of the review and adjustment process, which I have set out at [274] above; and it emphasises the wide discretion that these provisions give it when determining whether and to what extent it will take into account and adjust for particular downside risks.  It would not be expected that the contracting authority would address downside risks in the same way as or from the perspective of the bidder and it submits that adjustments based upon the WTW Figures and the GAD analysis were reasonable for its assessment of the most credible financial outcome.  It rejects the proposition that it should have reviewed all risks and the full extent of downside risks to which a bidder could be exposed in life.  What it did was to carry out its assessment taking into account the WTW Figures (which built in the 25% uplift in Technical Provisions) and the GAD analysis (which took into account downside risks for investment returns and movements in asset valuations, the 25% uplift in Technical Provisions, and varying percentiles over a wide range), which it submits was reasonable.  While it is true that the implementation of the FRT did not include additional downside for the possibility of future regulatory intervention, that was a permissible and reasonable view, even if it was not one with which Mr Salter or Stagecoach agreed.  On this basis, it submits that the process of risk adjustment as set out in the ITT, including the FRT, was reasonable, fair and transparent, having been set out precisely in the ITT and as presaged by Appendix 3 in general and paragraph A3.3.2 in particular. </p>

The procurement in <span style="font-style:italic">Henry </span>was for a framework contract and was conducted under the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 which, by Regulation 30(1)(a), required the contract to be awarded on the basis of the offer which was the most economically advantageous from the point of view of the contracting authority.  The contracting authority’s methodology required tenderers to submit direct fee percentages, sub-contract fee percentages and indicative fee percentages for design services: see [6(vii)].  No other information directly relating to price was taken into account.  The Plaintiffs demonstrated that this was not a reliable indicator of economic outturn unless the fees were assumed to be based on constant prices across all tenders, which was not the case.  On this basis, the court held that the Contracting Authority’s methodology was incapable of identifying the most economically advantageous tender without the provision of further information, which was lacking: see [27].  The court concluded that the “decision to rely upon the percentage fees and bands was based upon an incorrect factual assumption sufficient to amount to a manifest error, namely, that costs would always be the same in the construction industry … .” </p>

The outcome was based on a fundamental misconception in the construction of the ITT such that it could not satisfy its intended purpose.  That is not the case here.  The discretion given by Appendix 3 of the present ITTs was different and did not require a comprehensive analysis of or adjustment for downside pensions risks.  The FRT that was put in place was limited; but it was known to be limited and its limits were transparently set out in the ITT.  There is in my judgment no scope for an argument that seeks to impose a legal obligation to carry out a more comprehensive risk assessment or adjustment given the lack of any general obligation to carry out FRTs and the fact that the FRT that was put in place was in accordance with the discretion and limits laid down by the ITT.   </p>

It is not a necessary part of any FRT that it should be capable of eliminating all risk or adjusting for every eventuality and the contracting authority has a wide margin of appreciation in deciding what level of assurance it wishes to have.  None of the preceding history upon which the Claimants rely imposed a public law obligation upon the Defendant to implement robustness testing that analysed the potential downside to bidders of the pensions risk as protected by the PRSM or that required any particular level of assurance to be achieved.  In setting the terms of the ITT the Defendant was entitled to determine the extent of any robustness testing it wished to put in place.  Nothing in the terms of the ITT itself imposed an obligation upon the Defendant to institute an FRT that would give total assurance of robustness or that would incorporate downside risks going beyond what the Defendant assessed to be the most credible financial outcome.  The Claimants have not shown that the Defendant’s assessment of the most credible financial outcome was not open to it: see also [547] below.  In my judgment it is bordering on hyperbole to describe the decision to omit provision for testing by reference to downside pension risks as an “extraordinary oversight.”  It might have been unwise; but that does not render it unlawful. </p>

WTW were commissioned to illustrate the effect on the draft 2016 valuation of applying TPR’s parameters as set out in January 2018 and updated in June 2018.  None of the other major players (the RDG and the RPS Trustee) had agreed those parameters, with the result that no TOCwide solution had yet (or has yet) been achieved, but Mr Baghurst and the Department (correctly) took the view that there was no concrete evidence available to the Department at the time that would have justified adopting a different assumption as to the levels of future pensions contributions.  Furthermore, although the WTW Figures did not reflect all possible downside risks, that was not the function of the WTW Figures or the assessment of the most credible financial outcome.  On this basis, the Department took the view that the WTW Figures provided the best available evidence at the time about future contribution levels.   </p>

One of the things to emerge from the expert evidence in this case is the wide range of assumptions that could reasonably be adopted and the lack of certainty about what assumptions would ultimately be proved to be correct.   In such circumstances it is conceptually easier to conduct a full risk-assessment that takes into account all possible downside risks than it is to identify the most credible financial outcome with any degree of confidence.  The Claimants’ criticisms of the Defendant’s decision to adopt the WTW Figures would be more cogent if the Defendant had been trying to conduct a full risk-assessment or to assess a worst-case outturn; but that is not what the Defendant was trying to do – nor was it obliged to do so. </p>

TPR had specified its parameters.  It is not clear why or whether TPR would unilaterally disclose to the Department any more than was already contained in its published parameters.  Nor would it have been realistic to expect TPR to give an assessment of the prospects of a TOC-wide solution being achieved or not.  If it had done so, quite apart from the fact that doing so would run the risk of queering the pitch on which it might wish to conduct future negotiations, it is not self-evident that TPR’s assessment would have been any more reliable than that of the Department or, for that matter, the RDG or individual bidders.    </p>

They were validated by obtaining TPR’s confirmation that they accurately reflected TPR’s parameters.  Some advice was taken from GAD who, while accepting the obvious fact that the WTW Figures were a limited exercise, did not undermine them.  To the contrary, on a best estimate basis, GAD supported the view that DRCs were unlikely to change materially after the 2019 or 2022 valuations.  It was not, in my judgment, necessary for the Defendant to take further steps or to seek further advice before making its decision as it did.  It is not clear what advice the Claimants allege would have been given.

As explained earlier in this judgment, the prospect of further regulatory intervention was uncertain and unquantifiable.  What cannot be said is that adoption of TPR’s current parameters was manifestly erroneous. </p>

The terms of the ITT not merely permitted but mandated that the Defendant should take all relevant information into account in deciding what was the most credible financial outcome: see paragraphs A3.1.4 and A3.3.2 of Appendix 3.  I accept the evidence of Ms Palmer that there might be a significant change in costs in the six months or so between bid submission and risk adjustment of a leading bidder’s bid.  Such a change should properly be taken into account.  It would therefore have been wrong for the Defendant to have pinned its colours irrevocably to the WTW Figures’ mast before submission of bids. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As a matter of fact, the Defendant gave the Claimants every legitimate encouragement to recognise the likely relevance of the WTW Figures by incorporating them in the Rebid instructions for each competition, having previously discussed them on multiple occasions in bilateral meetings attended by Stagecoach (and others).  Thus, for example, on 17 May 2018 Mr Baghurst told representatives from Stagecoach that “the Department may make reference to [the WTW Figures] when it risk adjusts.”  He made the same point at a bilateral meeting with Stagecoach on 17 October 2018 when he said that “we will take the Willis Tower illustration into account but you won’t be limited by it.”  Mr Kavanagh’s note was to the same effect, recording that the Department would take the WTW Figures as a start point for its risk adjustment.  Mr Baghurst’s formulation was carried over into the Rebid instructions, informing bidders that “the Department will take into account but will not necessarily be limited by” the WTW Figures.  That was accurate and was a reasonable statement of the Department’s decision given the possibility that the Department’s view of the most credible financial outcome might change after submission of bids. </p>

And they rely upon the fact that the Secretary of State decided on 1 April 2019 to award the EM franchise to Abellio, to continue with the SE competition and to continue with the WCP competition with First as lead bidder after being advised of the contents of the PwC advice.   </p>

It is, or should be, common ground that it would have been unlawful to add the PwC Analysis as a requirement, criterion or sub-criterion (however expressed) that was additional to and supplemented the ITTs’ criteria (a) for the evaluation of which bidder should be treated as the leading bidder or awarded the franchise or (b) for deciding whether to disqualify the Claimants.  The criteria for those two lines of decision-making were set out in the ITT and, having set them, the Defendant was obliged to stick to them.  The discretion to cancel the competitions was separate and distinct: it was not determined, trammelled or fettered by the need to follow the ITT methodology or to apply the ITT criteria for those other decisions.  The grounds upon which the Defendant could cancel the competitions were not specified in paragraph 1.9.1 or elsewhere in the ITT and would be subject to principles of EU Law including those identified at [12(h)] of <span style="font-style:italic">Amey</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On this evidence I find that all concerned were aware at all material times of the critical need to insulate the evaluation process from the PwC Analysis and vice versa, and to confine the PwC Analysis to the question whether to proceed or cancel.  That awareness is reflected in the CCS, which shows the determination of officials to ensure that the Minister did not confuse the discrete decisions he had to make or the relevance of the PwC Analysis to one but not to the others.  I therefore do not find the fact that Mr Smith equipped himself with the PwC Analysis for the meeting with the Secretary of State on 29 March 2019 to provide any support for the Claimants’ submissions and case.  The stated concern of the Secretary of State went directly to the question whether the competitions should be continued or cancelled, for which the PwC Analysis was relevant material: see [334] above.  There is no basis for a speculation that officials would have ceased to be aware of the need to confine the ambit of the PwC Analysis at that meeting: all the evidence, as summarised above, supports the finding I have made that they were aware at all material times of the need to confine it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Claimants assert that “the PwC work was used as an integral part of the franchise award decisions” and that “the PwC advice was … used to determine whether the “leading” bids would be successful in the respective competitions”.  But, to my mind, these statements merely assert what the Claimants seek to prove.  Nor is it informative to rely upon the Defendant’s acceptance in opening submissions that, if the PwC Analysis had reached different conclusions, the Defendant would have considered rebids or cancellation of the competitions.  On the evidence that I have summarised, what in fact happened was that the Defendant took the PwC Analysis into account in deciding whether or not to cancel the competitions.  The question then is whether it was legitimate for him to do so.  That question is not affected by the fact that, if the Defendant had cancelled the competitions, the leading bidders would not have been awarded the franchises.  Such an outcome would have been the result of the Defendant’s exercise of his discretion to cancel and not of the evaluation process mandated by the ITT.  It is, in my judgment, unduly loose use of language when considering this issue to assert that the PwC Analysis was “used” to determine whether the leading bids would be successful in the respective competitions.  Once it is accepted that there is a theoretical difference between “evaluation”, “award” and “abandonment” decisions, what matters is whether the Claimants have proved that the difference was theoretical only and that the PwC Advice was not excluded from consideration when making evaluation and award decisions.  There is, in my judgment, no evidence at all to support such a finding; and, in the light of the evidence which I have summarised, there is no basis for drawing an adverse inference in this case because of the decision maker not giving evidence. </p>

The limitations of the PwC Analysis were known and were not misrepresented to the Secretary of State by the CCS.  As a piece of information being used in relation to the Defendant’s discretion to continue or to cancel in accordance with paragraph 1.9.1 of the ITT, the Defendant’s use of the PwC Analysis did not offend against the principles of transparency or equal treatment in circumstances where the evaluating requirements of the ITT had been implemented properly and the Claimants were lawfully to be disqualified in any event. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">effect of pension risks and other downside risks misunderstand the nature and purpose of the work that PwC were commissioned to undertake.  As commissioned and as delivered it was and was expressed to be limited in scope, as discussed earlier in this judgment.  PwC pointed out more than once in its report that its consideration of pensions risks was in isolation from other risks; and it had previously told the Defendant that it would struggle to express a view on pensions risks per se for a number of reasons that contributed to the inherent uncertainty in pensions, including possible future intervention by TPR.  PwC therefore caveated the Analysis appropriately both before and within the report itself.  Therefore, in each of the respects alleged by the Claimants, the Defendant knew the limitations of the work it had commissioned and received. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Similarly, the purpose of the work was limited in three important respects.  First, it was to provide a measure of assurance: it did not purport to be and was not a full risk assessment of all features that might affect the eventuation of pensions risks.  Second, it did not purport to provide assurance about what the outcome might be if pensions risks were combined with non-pensions risks.  The PwC Analysis itself was explicit about these limitations and they cannot have been misunderstood by the Defendant.  Third, its purpose was to provide some information for the purpose of the Defendant’s decision whether to continue or cancel the competitions.  The Defendant was not bound to obtain any report going to the question of robustness for the purpose of taking that decision; but it was entitled to do so.  On choosing to do so, there was no particular form, scope or content for such a report mandated or prohibited by the ITT and considerations of transparency or equal treatment.  The Defendant was exercising a broad discretion that may be exercisable in a wide range of circumstances, with a correspondingly broad discretion about the nature and scope of the information it chooses to take into account.  No known principle of EU or UK law required the Defendant to commission PwC to carry out a full and comprehensive risk assessment covering all possible risks, provided that the limitations of the work that was in fact commissioned were known and did not materially mislead.  On the facts of this case the limitations were known and there is no evidence to support a finding that they materially misled the Secretary of State in exercising his discretion on continuation or cancellation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The criticisms based on PwC’s use of the GAD figures and exclusion of consideration of Reset pension risks are also without substance.  Accepting that the GAD figures excluded potential liabilities accruing post-2019, it has not been shown that this would have made a material difference to PwC’s Analysis or conclusions or that any difference would have been material to the Secretary of State’s exercise of his discretion so that their omission was materially misleading.  At most, it suggests a lack of precision in the output from the PwC Analysis, but not that it would have been influential or material.   </p>

The CCS was explicit in stating three times that the PwC Analysis had considered the pensions risks “in isolation”.  It is necessarily implicit in these statements, and should not need to be spelt out to any Ministerial decision maker, that the PwC Analysis was limited in scope and did not give a full picture of all relevant risks.  But, in any event, it was not the purpose of the PwC Analysis to give a full picture of all relevant risks.  It was to provide some information that would give a measure of assurance in relation to the decision whether or not to cancel.  There is no reason to believe that the Secretary of State was materially misled about the decisions he had to take or the materials on the basis of which he was being asked to make his decisions.   </p>
