	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">On 31 May 2012, Essex County Council entered into a 25-year contract with UBB Waste (Essex) Limited for the design, construction, financing, commissioning, operation and maintenance of a mechanical biological waste treatment (“MBT”) plant in Basildon to process the county’s household waste. The facility was built and on 25 November 2014 it was certified as having passed the Readiness Tests. The facility then entered the Commissioning Period and was required to pass the Acceptance Tests before the extended Planned Services Commencement Date of 12 July 2015. It is common ground that the facility has not passed the Acceptance Tests either by such date or by the Acceptance Longstop Date of 12 January 2017. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Authority argues that UBB failed to design and construct the facility so that it was capable of passing the Acceptance Tests. It contends that UBB’s failure either to pass the Acceptance Tests or to attempt to do so by the Acceptance Longstop Date was an event of Contractor Default and seeks, among other relief, damages and a declaration that it is entitled to terminate the contract pursuant to clause 67.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">UBB, which is a joint venture company incorporated by Urbaser Limited and Balfour Beatty Investments Limited, denies any default. It argues that, upon the true construction of the agreement, the facility is capable of passing the Acceptance Tests and that Essex was wrong not to recognise the Quasi-Acceptance Tests as evidence of the same. Further, UBB contends that the performance of the facility was critically dependent on the composition of the waste. It argues that the facility would have passed the Acceptance Tests and would now be in the Services Period but for the Authority’s failures: </p>

It argues that the Authority is itself in breach of contract and seeks damages in excess of £77 million as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. This is, UBB submits, “termination for convenience dressed up as termination for contractor default.” Finally, UBB also claims compensation in respect of the temporary cessation of deliveries in February 2017 following the discovery of suspected asbestos-containing materials at the facility. </p>

This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose – though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.”</p>

It is always desirable that an expert should have no actual or apparent interest in the outcome of the proceedings in which he gives evidence, but such disinterest is not automatically a precondition to the admissibility of his evidence. Where an expert has an interest of one kind or another in the outcome of the case, this fact should be made known to the court as soon as possible. The question of whether the proposed expert should be permitted to give evidence should then be determined in the course of case management. In considering that question the judge will have to weigh the alternative choices open if the expert’s evidence is excluded, having regard to the overriding objective of the <span style="font-style:italic">Civil Procedure Rules.</span>”</p>

Prudence dictated that the instruction should either have been withdrawn or refused. Upon deciding instead that it could proceed, there was no excuse for failing properly to disclose the conflict of interest. Instead, Dr Weatherby wrote seven expert reports for use in adjudications and his main report in this litigation before the matter of the claim was first disclosed in his reply report on 15 March 2019. Further, he failed to disclose the claim when questioned about his independence by Kim Franklin QC in April 2017 in the context of adjudication number 3. Dr Weatherby’s failure to understand and declare the problem inevitably causes further concern that he does not really understand either the difference between acting as a consultant advising a client and acting as an independent, impartial and objective expert, or his duty to the court. </p>

Equally, it would have been open to the Authority to raise the question of the admissibility of Dr Weatherby’s evidence. Against that, it would no doubt have been argued – as UBB now argues – that in reality there are very few experts in this field and that since Mott MacDonald was conflicted, UBB had little choice but to call Dr Weatherby. I accept the broad submission that there is a small pool of potential experts and that one should not therefore be overly precious simply because Dr Weatherby had previous dealings with the usual lenders and with Urbaser. There is, however, no evidence before me that UBB could not have found someone without any connections to this project. </p>

None of these experienced companies raised issues with the design assumption at the time.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">In order to deliver the objectives of the Waste Strategy, Essex and Southend-on-Sea Borough Council prepared an Outline Business Case in July 2009 proposing the procurement of a MBT plant in order to process the residual waste stream. The contract would be entered into pursuant to the government’s private finance initiative (“PFI”). In the previous financial year, Essex and Southend had disposed of 449,848 tonnes of municipal solid waste to landfill thereby incurring landfill tax of £14.4 million. The Outline Business Case forecast that its proposed solution would divert 6.3 million tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste (“BMW”) from landfill over the life of the project and avoid the emission of some 2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. </p>

A significant capital cost would be the development of a network of waste transfer stations across the county. Furthermore, the base case predicted an affordability gap of £133.4 million over 25 years. Mrs Lee explained the Authority’s position at paragraph 24 of her first statement:</p>

In particular, the benefits of the project identified by the authority included its alignment with the objectives of the Waste Strategy, its significant contribution towards mitigating the potential effects of climate change, the maximisation of useful potential outputs such as high quality composts and Solid Recovered Fuels, reduced exposure to landfill tax and certainty of compliance with the LATS regime.”</p>

In other words, each hall is itself roughly the size of two football pitches.  Pre-processed waste is fed by conveyors into the infeed area of the halls. It is stacked the full width of the halls to a height of 3.5 metres. As originally designed, the waste is then resident in the biohalls for seven weeks. During this time, the waste is advanced along the length of each hall by the rotopalas (large rotary wheels) that both ensure the progress of the waste down the hall but also turn the rotting waste. At the end of the bio-stabilisation period, the remaining material is loaded on to discharge conveyors and sent to the refining unit. </p>

While noting that the law does not imply such a duty into all commercial contracts, he observed that a duty of good faith is implied as an incident of certain categories of contract, such as contracts of employment and contracts between partners and others in a fiduciary relationship. Leggatt J concluded, at [131], that there is no difficulty in the law implying a term of good faith in accordance with conventional principles on the basis of the presumed intention of the parties. </p>

Further, for my part I would question whether the first factor identified by Fraser J is really a characteristic of a relational contract at all. As the judge rightly identified, an inconsistent express term will be fatal to the argument as to whether there is an implied term of good faith but it is at least arguable that that is not because the existence of such term fundamentally changes the nature of the relationship but rather because it is trite that a term cannot be implied so as to defeat an express term. </p>

I reject the Authority’s submission upon the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Hipwell </span>that such rule is limited to cases where a term is implied to give business efficacy to the contract. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>(33<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt">rd</span> Ed.) puts the matter simply, at para. 37-073: </p>

In addition to honesty, there are other standards of commercial dealing which are so generally accepted that the contracting parties would reasonably be understood to take them as read without explicitly stating them in their contractual document. A key aspect of good faith, as I see it, is the observance of such standards. Put the other way round, not all bad faith conduct would necessarily be described as dishonest. Other epithets which might be used to describe such conduct include ‘improper’, ‘commercially unacceptable’ or ‘unconscionable’.  </p>

To apply a contract to circumstances not specifically provided for, the language must accordingly be given a reasonable construction which promotes the values and purposes expressed or implicit in the contract. That principle is well established in the modern English case law on the interpretation of contracts: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky SA v. Kookmin Bank</span>  [2011] 1 W.L.R.; <span style="font-style:italic">Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland v. Lloyds Banking Group plc </span>[2013] UKSC 3, at [23], [45] and [54].

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">What good faith requires is sensitive to context. That includes the core value of honesty. In any situation it is dishonest to deceive another person by making a statement of fact intending that other person to rely on it while knowing the statement to be untrue. Frequently, however, the requirements of honesty go further. For example, if A gives information to B knowing that B is likely to rely on the information and A believes the information to be true at the time it is given but afterwards discovers that the information was, or has since become, false, it may be dishonest for A to keep silent and not to disclose the true position to B. Another example of conduct falling short of a lie which may, depending on the context, be dishonest is deliberately avoiding giving an answer, or giving an answer which is evasive, in response to a request for information.  </p>

Although its requirements are sensitive to context, the test of good faith is objective in the sense that it depends not on either party’s perception of whether particular conduct is improper but on whether in the particular context the conduct would be regarded as commercially unacceptable by reasonable and honest people. The standard is thus similar to that described by Lord Nicholls in a different context in his seminal speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Brunei Airlines v. Tan</span> [1995] 2 A.C. 378, at pp.389-390. This follows from the fact that the content of the duty of good faith is established by a process of construction which in English law is based on an objective principle. The court is concerned not with the subjective intentions of the parties but with their presumed intention, which is ascertained by attributing to them the purposes and values which reasonable people in their situation would have had.”</p>

That a normative standard is introduced by good faith is clear. It will, however, not call for the same acts from all contracting parties in all cases. The legal norm should not be confused with the factual question of its satisfaction. The contractual and factual context (including the nature of the contract or contextual relationship) is vital to understand what, in any case, is required to be done or not done to satisfy the normative standard.’”</p>

Without doubt, it creates a hierarchy which must be applied ‘as a priority order in waste prevention and management legislation and policy’. Even when applying the hierarchy in this context, however, member states must take measures to encourage the options that deliver ‘the best overall environmental outcome’. In my judgment that is a clear recognition that a strict application of the hierarchy in all circumstances is not always justified. So, for example, a policy which dictates or encourages the expenditure of large sums of money solely on prevention – the top rung of the Waste Hierarchy – would not be a ‘necessary measure’ if it made no contribution to the best overall environmental outcome. Put another way, if the best overall environmental outcome would be achieved by a policy which spread the expenditure between prevention and a number of other measures then, in my judgment, the terms of Article 4 would be satisfied and there would be no breach by the body which adopted and applied such a policy.   </p>

In my judgment such an approach would be wholly impracticable.    </p>

The purpose of the Directive is set out expressly in Article 1 ... It would be a very strange outcome if Article 4 was interpreted in such a restrictive way that on occasions its application had the opposite effect in practice to that intended by the Directive as articulated in Article 1. Indeed there is much to be said for the argument that ‘the result to be achieved’ by the Waste Directive is the result dictated by Article 1 and that the member states are free to choose the means by which that result is achieved, although, perhaps fortunately, this case can be resolved without determining the validity of that particular contention. </p>

In other words, biohalls capable of processing waste at a density of 0.3 t/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt">3</span> would need to be almost twice the size of the halls required at the design density of 0.55 t/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt">3</span>. </p>

As Professor Stentiford explains, this makes the BMc test unsuitable for the day-to-day monitoring and adjustment of a facility. There are, as the professor explains, other tests such as DR4 that can produce far quicker results for such everyday purposes and which, if properly correlated to BMc, can provide an operator with useful data in order to optimise BMW reduction performance. This does not, however, invalidate, the use of the BMc test for use in determining whether the facility has passed the Acceptance Tests. Indeed, even if inconveniently slow, the BMc test was the contractually agreed method of assessing BMW reduction for such purpose unless and until a site-specific correlation was obtained to allow the use of DR4. </p>

This data shows that the biogas potential in the fine fraction (339 litres/kg LOI) that would be used for CLO is slightly greater than that of the coarser fraction (330 litres/kg LOI). If it is assumed that the amount of SRF separated as CLO is 54.6%, as currently indicated by UBB’s recent measurements, I estimated the BMW reduction, calculated using the Authority’s interpretation, would be 61.1% (an increase from 32.3% reported in the QAT period).

As the company recognised, the bio-stabilisation halls were approximately half the size required to process the contracted tonnage of waste.

The essential difference is that while SRF is the output from the facility after biostabilisation in the bio-halls, the QSRF Line bypasses the bio-halls entirely. Waste in this stream is simply shredded, passed through an electromagnet to extract ferrous metals and then diverted away from the facility into 40-yard containers. It is not further processed in order to remove other recyclates or aggregates. Nor is any biodegradable waste in this stream stabilised through the bio-halls. QSRF is not, therefore, a stabilised output. </p>

Obviously, we can’t send any fraction with organic waste. We want to send directly to the refining area bulky waste and fraction &gt; 300 mm (trommel overflow) shredded. These fractions suppose 200 t per day. This way, depending on the percentage of collections, we will have to send to the biohalls 800 t per day, to fill one infeed. Now, we are filling the infeed with 550-600 t. We are going to do some tests to increase this capacity. In terms of volume, we are going send to the refining area low density fraction, so we expect to increase the density of the waste sent to the biohall.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">UBB recognised, however, that there were risks in these proposed modifications. First, there was a risk that the capacity improvements might not be achieved. In any event, UBB projected a continuing shortfall in capacity in the biohalls of 113 t/day even with these modifications. Further, UBB recognised the practical effect of the diversion of waste was that it would need to achieve an even higher level of mass reduction in the biohalls to meet the contractual requirements for Recovery. Indeed, it calculated that the level of Recovery required to compensate for the diversion of waste would have to be 57% which, it recognised, was “much higher” than the design parameters. As to the remaining deficit of 113 tonnes, the paper proposed possible further solutions, including an even more radical bypass by reducing the size of the largest screen in the pre-processing trommels thereby increasing the amount of waste in the trommel overflow. </p>

He explained that the Authority was content to respond under the simplified review procedure set out in schedule 9. He responded “Level A – no comment” which, pursuant to paragraph 4.1 of schedule 9 to the contract, meant that UBB was then contractually required to make the modifications. He added that it would be necessary to make consequential changes to the service method statements and also to the as-built drawings. He did not require immediate submission of the proposed amendments to the method statements but said that they should be provided in April 2015 upon the forthcoming annual review. </p>

Thus third parties may have an interest in a public document, such as a planning permission or a consent under s.36 of the 1989 Act, in contrast with many contracts. As a result, the shared knowledge of the applicant for permission and the drafted of the condition does not have the relevance to the process of interpretation that the shared knowledge of parties to a contract, in which there is no third party interest, has. There is only limited scope for the use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of a public document, such as a planning permission or a s.36 consent: <span style="font-style:italic">R v.

In my judgment, these statements plainly stated that the waste would be processed and, after the extraction of recyclates, composted in the bio-stabilisation halls before passing through the refining unit.

In any event, I do not accept the central premise that these further modifications were necessary in order to operate the QSRF Line as previously approved since the by-pass of bulky HWRC waste had been proposed and approved for the limited purpose of diverting low-density non-biodegradable bulky waste away from the biohalls and not for the full-bore diversion of all HWRC waste.

Further, while the Authority would be estopped from now seeking to challenge the approved modifications for their stated purposes, there is no estoppel in respect of UBB’s further modifications to install a walking floor and trailer-loading system. In short, UBB proceeded at its own risk in proposing and installing more limited modifications to introduce a QSRF Line for the claimed purpose of diverting the low-density non-biodegradable bulky waste and the trommel-overflow fraction away from the biohalls. If it considered that such investment was only viable in the event that it could also install the walking floor and trailer-loading system then it should have brought forward its full proposals for the bulk diversion of waste from the outset rather than proceed piecemeal. </p>

The point can be taken shortly. I accept Mr Creecy’s evidence that the penny only dropped in October 2015 and that he was genuinely shocked when he realised that UBB was proposing to produce QSRF and normal SRF in equal proportions. This is borne out by his contemporaneous emails and I reject the idea that his surprise was contrived. For what it is worth, I do, however, accept UBB’s argument that Mr Creecy should perhaps have identified rather sooner than he did the true extent of UBB’s proposed diversion of waste. There were, as Mr Creecy accepted in cross examination, earlier clues that should have allowed him to piece together the picture. Nevertheless, such finding does not assist UBB: </p>

It sought the complete removal of the BMW reduction guarantee and proposed that the Recovery and Recyclate tests should be run over 12 rather than 6 weeks. Such variations would, it was suggested, allow the parties to bring forward the Planned Services Commencement Date by some 12 weeks. In return, UBB offered a one-off payment of £2,825,000 payable upon achieving Service Commencement. Thereafter, the removal of the biological tests would see a reduction in the Services Gate Fee worth some £356,491 per annum at 2010 prices. </p>

Chris McCarthy added that he could not see how the BMW test could be met and that the project would hit the longstop.

Pat Wheeler of DEFRA confirmed that approval would not be a quick process and was highly likely to lead to a reduction in WICs that might make the project unaffordable.

UBB blamed the BMc methodology for this poor result and proposed its replacement with AT4. The matter was taken up by Mr McCarthy in his letter of 21 October 2015. He explained that UBB would like to discuss the basis for a revised commercial arrangement as soon as possible. Specifically, he suggested moving to another testing regime such as AT4 or RDRI. He added that should such a change still result in the facility falling short then UBB would like to discuss a contingency plan for moving to some other metric to measure performance. To encourage the Authority to engage, the letter referred to the risk that the senior lenders funding the project might call in their loans in the event that the contractual longstop date were missed. </p>

He suggested that the BMW reduction figure of 84% had only been guaranteed on the assumption that they received waste matching the Base Case composition and that, in the event of variance in the composition, UBB was only guaranteeing BMW reduction of 60%, being the minimum percentage acceptable to the Authority in its ISOS. Equally, he suggested that UBB was only guaranteeing Recovery of 48% on the Base Case and that the default position in the event of variance was the Authority’s minimum acceptable bid of 44%. </p>

If he is right, then the contractual machinery for dealing with composition issues kicks in and might ultimately lead to an Options Review and Authority Change Notice before the waste fell into Band B on the basis of a rolling annual average. Mr Stewart argues that such conclusion is not surprising since otherwise resolution of any composition issue might be postponed by up to a year, and yet the Commissioning Period was only intended to run from 6 July 2014 to 12 July 2015. </p>

Mr Faraldo confirmed in cross-examination that he had not replied to Mr Creecy, that there was no further dialogue on the issue and that his own position had been that he wanted the Q1 2015 results to be used in the rolling-average calculation. Indeed, that emerges from an internal email to Gemma Saunders on 3 February 2015 in which Mr Faraldo indicated that he intended to respond to Mr Creecy and “prove that the results should be used.”</p>

In April 2016, the Authority reacted to the decreasing putrescible content by insisting that UBB should accept source-segregated green waste. The incident led to an exchange of correspondence as to the lawfulness of delivering source-segregated waste to the facility. UBB rightly argues that deliberately mixing such waste with the residual waste stream is a breach of the waste hierarchy, although it might be justified by life-cycle thinking. In any event, it is now clear following the judgment of Lieven J in <span style="font-style:italic">UBB Waste (Essex) Ltd v. Essex County Council </span>[2019] EWHC 1924 (Admin) that the introduction of source-segregated green waste was in breach of planning permission.

Its case is, however, firmly rooted in the flawed premise that Essex was in breach of contract by failing to enter into an Options Review following the premature reports produced in March and June 2016. There is no doubt good reason why UBB focuses on Q1-Q2 2016 since the Q4 2016 composition test results were not issued until 13 January 2017; one day after the Acceptance Longstop Date. Thus, while the waste might have fallen below the Band A threshold in the last quarter before the longstop date, there could be no Compensation Event simply on that basis: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">In late January 2017, laboratory testing conducted by the Authority’s contractor, SLR Consulting Limited, suggested that there might be airborne asbestos fibres at the facility. The asbestos scare led to all waste deliveries to the site being suspended between 2 and 24 February 2017. By its counterclaim, UBB alleges that Essex wilfully directed or allowed waste to be diverted from the facility during this three-week period. Accordingly, it argues that the diversion of the waste was a Compensation Event pursuant to clause 21.2.5 of the contract and seeks compensation. </p>

At paragraph 328 of its written opening, UBB tentatively argued that the Authority might be liable pursuant to clause 1.6.1 on the basis of SLR’s own default. Alternatively, it was said that the Authority should never have instructed SLR in the first place and that it could not take advantage of its own wrong in order to seek to justify a departure from its contractual obligations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.04in">372.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Accordingly, I construe clause 21.2.5 as simply requiring that the direction or permissive act of allowing the diversion of waste be intentional or deliberate. The clause is not otherwise qualified so as, for example, to excuse liability if the wilful act is taken for good reason. Thus, a wilful direction or permission to divert waste away from the facility remains a Compensation Event even if it is an entirely logical act in order to protect the health and safety of workmen. Properly construed, clause 21.2.5 is not concerned with blame but rather with the allocation of risk as between the contracting parties in the event of the deliberate diversion of waste. Indeed, such construction is consistent with the contractual definition of a Compensation Event which distinguishes between breaches of contract, as in limbs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition, and the occurrence of any of the events referred to as Compensation Events in (among others) clause 21.2.5 in limb (d). </p>

In my judgment, this was not a wilful direction to divert waste, but rather an attempt by the Authority to ensure the delivery of waste that would otherwise not have been delivered to the facility. Of course, there was a possibility that this less direct route might affect the composition of the waste. As considered extensively above, any deterioration in the biodegradability of the waste might have other contractual consequences, but such two-stage deliveries did not of themselves give rise to a Compensation Event pursuant to clause 21.2.5. </p>

Of course, the Authority might perfectly reasonably decide that it was inappropriate to require its contractors to continue to make deliveries and therefore either agree or take no action to prevent the diversion of deliveries. As I have already observed, clause 21.2.5 is not about blame but the allocation of risk. A deliberate agreement or failure to prevent the diversion of waste might be reasonable in such circumstances but it would still give rise to a Compensation Event. The conflicting expert opinion as to the reasonableness of the Authority’s own risk-averse approach is not therefore relevant to the question of whether there was a Compensation Event. </p>

The question of whether the Authority wilfully allowed the diversion of waste by failing to <span style="font-style:italic">prevent</span> Veolia from ceasing deliveries does, however, require further analysis. Of course, one party cannot ultimately force another to do something. There is no contractual obligation here to take reasonable or best endeavours to secure the continuation of deliveries. This may be because clause 21.2.5 does not impose contractual obligations on the Authority but rather gives UBB relief, by way of a Compensation Event, in the defined circumstances. The analogy with such clauses is, however, apposite. Simply sitting back and taking no action to cause its contractors to maintain deliveries to the facility would be a breach of such a contractual obligation and, more pertinently, would in my judgment amount to a wilful act of allowing the diversion of waste. </p>

Accordingly, I reject the Authority’s argument that it was ultimately for UBB to convince Veolia that it was safe to continue to make deliveries.

Reasonable efforts to persuade Veolia to continue to make deliveries to site might have included the early sharing of the Authority’s own reservations as to the reliability of the SLR report; the fact that SLR had not used Scanning Electron Microscopy and accordingly could not reliably discriminate between asbestos and non-asbestos fibres; and that IOM had been instructed to carry out such testing. Furthermore, reasonable efforts to ensure that deliveries restarted quickly might have included pressing Veolia and the WCAs to accept the findings of the IOM report on 7 February 2017 that there were no asbestos fibres in the facility and withdrawing the flawed SLR report. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It is unclear from the pleading itself whether the alleged requirement for promptness asserted at paragraph 251A(1) is put on the basis of the proper construction of the contract or the general law of affirmation, election or waiver, each of which are pleaded at paragraphs 251A(2)-(3). Certainly, it can be observed that the pleaders do not cite any express term in support of the contention and that they fail to plead any such implied term when setting out a number of other alleged implied terms at paragraphs 37 and 85 of the pleading. At paragraph 16(a) of appendix 15 to UBB’s written closing submissions, it asserts, in response to the suggestion that its waiver argument is defeated by clause 93 of the contract, that UBB’s case is in any event put on the basis of an implied term that the right to terminate must be exercised within a reasonable time. While any such implied term should have been clearly pleaded from the outset, I am satisfied for the reasons explained more fully below that there is considerable overlap between the proposed implied term and the pleaded argument of waiver by election and further that the question of such term is one of law that can be determined upon the basis of the facts already pleaded and explored at trial without unfairly prejudicing the Authority. I am therefore content to construe the ambiguous plea at paragraph 251A(1) as implicitly including a plea that there is an implied term that notice of termination must be given promptly. </p>

Staughton J (as he then was) held that the authorities clearly demonstrated that lapse of a reasonable time deprives the owner of the right to withdraw and that, for the purposes of the appeal to the Commercial Court, it did not matter whether such right was lost by reason of an implied term or through waiver. </p>

On the other hand, there are decisions - conveniently summarised by Lloyd J in <span style="font-style:italic">Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co. A.B. v. Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana (The Scaptrade)</span> [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 425 which appear to make it clear that such a right will only be lost by election, whether expressed or inferred from the circumstances. In the appellants’ submission the dicta which are relied upon as suggesting an implied term or rule of law regardless of an election were made in cases where this problem did not arise and do not support the proposition. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Scaptrade</span> … Lloyd J analyses Lord Wilberforce’s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">The Laconia</span> … as laying down that it is a question of waiver or election not of an implied term.

More common are cases dealing with the right to withdraw a vessel from a charterparty for nonpayment of hire. Those cases all agree that such a right has to be exercised within a reasonable time of the non-payment, but they do not agree on the juridical basis for such a requirement. As an alternative to an implied term, principles of election, waiver and estoppel have been advanced as the explanation. These principles can raise difficult theoretical questions as to the manner of their application (see <span style="font-style:italic">… The Scaptrade …</span>), although they do not appear to have done so in practice. We believe that there is a good reason for this, as we shall explain. Having regard to the different theories to which we have referred above, it is at least arguable that there is a serious doubt as to whether the juridical basis of the requirement to exercise a right to withdraw from a charter within a reasonable time is an implied term. For the reasons which follow we do not need to express a final view on this matter.”</p>

I reject, however, the argument that there is an immutable rule of law that all rights of termination must be exercised within a reasonable time after such right first arises. Rather the shipping cases demonstrate a number of circumstances where business efficacy and fairness as between the contracting parties call for promptness. Clearly any right to load an alternative cargo is time sensitive and must be lost (whether by an implied term or waiver) if unreasonably delayed. Equally, the right to cancel a charterparty will be lost through unreasonable delay at some point where the party entitled to cancel stands by as the ship is loaded and sets sail. In my judgment, the proposed term in this case that the contractual right of termination of this PFI contract must be exercised promptly should be tested upon the usual principles. </p>

Conventionally, they have, however, been used in different contexts: affirmation to describe the innocent party’s loss of a common-law right to accept the other party’s repudiatory breach of contract and treat the contract at an end; and waiver by election (at least in this context) to describe the loss of the right to exercise a contractual right of termination.
