	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The quay wall that required strengthening was a steel sheet pile wall (sometimes called the SSP wall) at the water’s edge topped by a coping beam. It was propped horizontally at the top at intervals by vertical triangular counterforts. The piles were about 27m in length. In cross-section, the piles were approximately U-shaped, alternate piles being oriented in opposite directions, and adjacent piles being interlocked. Behind the wall, at a depth of about 6m, was a relieving platform consisting of a concrete slab. The relieving platform was supported by H-piles (piles with an H-section). Its purpose was to bear the weight of the overlying soil and the cranes and other things on the dock and to transmit that weight to a low level, thereby reducing the lateral forces acting on the wall. The quay wall was constructed on reclaimed land in the early 1970s.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The design of the strengthening works incorporated the installation of ground anchors attached to the steel wall and the installation of very high pressure (VHP) vertical grout columns along the length of the berth. The VHP columns were installed by a process known as jet grouting. That process involves pumping grout, a mixture of cement and water, down a pre-cut hole so that it jets out of nozzles in a rotating “monitor” at the bottom of the hole and penetrates and mixes with the surrounding soil. The monitor is gradually drawn upwards while the jetting proceeds. The mixture of soil and grout makes a material commonly called soilcrete, which hardens forming the VHP columns. The columns are commonly called the grout wall or the VHP wall, but the expression refers to a series of discrete columns, whose average separation as designed was approximately 1.7m. Each column was in the form of a pair of cylindrical columns each of design diameter 900mm. The axial separation between the members of each pair was designed to be 700mm. The second was constructed immediately after the first and before the first had hardened, so the two members of the pair were designed to function as a single column.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The strengthening works took place between March and November 2002. During the course of the works the sheet piles cracked and bulged outwards by an amount up to one metre. It is common ground that further remedial works are now required to enable berth 205 to be dredged to -16mCD plus 0.5m overdredge allowance. The principal dispute is as to the cause of failure of the strengthening works and which party bears responsibility for payment for the necessary remedial works.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">It is common ground that the effect of clause 12 of the contract is that if during the execution of the Works HSS has encountered physical conditions (other than weather conditions or conditions due to weather conditions) or artificial obstructions which conditions or obstructions could not reasonably have been foreseen by an experienced contractor, then HSS is entitled to extra payment for extra work rendered necessary thereby. In this case HSS rely upon a physical condition, namely the physical state of the sheet pile wall. They say that it was overstressed and contained plastic hinges. That meant that it was unable, without bulging, to resist the pressure of the grout applied at the back of the sheet pile wall when the VHP columns were made. HSS contend that it was reasonable to expect that the sheet pile wall would have had a factor of safety of about 2, and that if it had had such a factor of safety it would not have bulged or cracked when the grouting process took place.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Bowdery submitted that the condition of the sheet pile wall was not a physical condition falling within clause 12, since a contractor should not have the benefit of a clause 12 claim if his strengthening works fail because of some pre-existing condition in the works which he has undertaken to strengthen. Clause 12 was not intended to apply to the condition of the very thing that was to be strengthened. In my judgment, the concept of encountering something during the execution of the works tends to import something adjectival that hinders the work, rather than a substantive element of the works themselves. Nevertheless, the words are wide enough to cover the latter, and the clause must be construed against the person (here, ABP) who offers the document for agreement. Accordingly, I reject Mr. Bowdery’s argument. The questions remain, what was the condition of the sheet pile wall, and was it unforeseeable by an experienced contractor. I shall first consider the first of those questions.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In outline, the position is this. It is common ground that before the works were carried out on berth 205, berths 204 and 205 were in the same condition, and that berth 204 is still in the same condition as it was. The present condition of berth 204 has been investigated in order to determine the condition in which berth 205 was before the works were carried out. Surveys of berth 204 above the level of the river bed carried out before the trial showed that most of the sheet piles were not vertical. A small degree of displacement from the chord at mid-depth was to be expected, but generally the displacement from the vertical (where the chord would be expected to lie) was greater than expected. It was said that the maximum bending moments in the sheet piles would be proportional to the maximum displacements from the chord, a displacement of about 300mm indicating a bending moment at relieving platform level sufficient to create a plastic hinge there.</span>

Mr. Bracegirdle considered that the piles had been driven consistently with a rake, so that the toe of each pile would be seaward of the vertical drawn from the top of the pile. Thus the displacement from the chord would be less than the displacement from the vertical, and one could not conclude that there were plastic hinges in the wall.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> September 2005, Mr. Bracegirdle put forward the thesis that the steel sheet piles had systematically been driven with a seaward rake, i.e. so that the toe was seaward of the head. Thus the displacements of the piles from the vertical would be greater than the corresponding displacements from their chords. He illustrated his thesis with diagrams in his report, contained in figure 24. He said that it was evident from the archive material that the reclaimed bank moved seawards during the driving of the sheet piles to an extent of about 2 inches (50mm). That was confirmed by the witness statement of Colin Gilbert</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">. That movement was consistent, said Mr. Bracegirdle, with lateral loading imposed by the reclamation bank. As outlined in figure 24, movement of the reclamation bank and loading of the sheet piles would have caused curvature of the sheet piles. Seaward movement of 50mm at the top of the reclamation bank would be sufficient to induce a curvature of about 1/360 per metre in the sheet piles beneath the relieving platform. In reality, it would not be possible to carry out a definitive analysis of the complex issue of pile wandering. While the analysis presented was simplistic, it was sufficient to illustrate the mechanism of seaward wandering of the piles during driving.</span>

For the purpose of this survey the contamination on boreholes X1 and X3 is minor and can be ignored for the purpose of defining the general trend of the sheet pile profile to an accuracy of about ±100mm.

This corresponds to an offset of about 350mm over the length of the sheet piles; here the offset is nearly double that figure. If the sheet piles were installed vertically, as maintained by HSS, this would have required the top of the sheet pile to have moved seawards  by 0.6m. Given that the top of the sheet piles is restrained by the relieving platform and coping beam and that the structure supports the seaward crane rail beam, such a displacement of 0.6m would have resulted in substantial damage to the quay, preventing the operation of the cranes and the port. It is most likely, therefore, that the offset from vertical occurred during driving of the sheet piles.</span>

You can’t get such a thing as perfect verticality but they will be very close to vertical in my opinion and…..I can’t see how they can wander….. in the frame they are kept vertical…..So if in a normal situation there were soils without obstructions even though they are dense I would expect the piles to go in absolutely vertical.

It was implicit in those calculations that EI was 226,600 kNm²/m. In his finite element analysis, Mr. Bracegirdle used a bending stiffness of 220,000 kNm²/m.</span>

(In the expression 3.55E5 the letter E refers to the exponent: it is not to be confused with the element E in the expression EI. The notation 3.55E5 means 3.55 X 10 i.e. 3.55 X 100,000; 6.5E-3 means 6.5 X [10 raised to the power -3], i.e. 6.5 divided by 1000, i.e. 0.0065).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The documents relied on by Professor Pavlovic were not identified, but I have researched the files of papers put before me. The figure of 212,000 (2.12E5) for EI appears on page 18 in section 5.2.2 of a document emanating from Haecon which is an as-built design report identified by the code USR2334 637 and marked revision 2 22-08-03. On the same page the figure of 2537 kNm/m appears as the bending moment capacity of the wall. Although I have not had the benefit of oral evidence or submissions on this point it appears that the figure of 2.12E5 kNm²/m is erroneous. The area A per unit length is stated as 4.2488E-2 m²/m, and EA is stated to be 8.92E6 kN/m (i.e. kN/m² times m²/m). From that, E can readily be calculated as 210E6 kN/m². I is given as 1.00952E-3 m. Multiplying that by E does indeed give a figure of EI equal to 2.12E5. But the units must be kNm². The units in which EI is stated are kNm²/m. It is stated on page 9 in section 5.1.1 of the same report that I is 1.00952E-3 m for the combined section, i.e. an inpan and an outpan. It is also there stated (and corroborated by Mr. Reid’s page from the Larssen catalogue) that the length of a combined section is 0.84m. Thus I, expressed in m/m, would be the figure stated divided by 0.84, i.e. 1.20E-3. EI, expressed as bending stiffness per metre, is thus 2.52E5 kNm²/m. Those are indeed the units in which EI is wrongly expressed to be 2.12E5 on page 18 of the report.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The figure of 2537 kNm/m for the bending moment capacity of the sheet piles is stated to allow for a safety factor. Given the yield stress of 3.55E5 kN/m², also expressed on the same page, 18, of the report, and information given as to the axial force, it is possible readily to calculate that the safety factor is 1.1. Thus the bending moment capacity implied is 2537 kNm/m multiplied by 1.1. That bending moment capacity is arrived at by multiplying the sectional area by the yield stress and by an undefined factor 2α which is evidently 0.185m. (The whole is then divided by the safety factor of 1.1 to arrive at the figure of 2537 kNm/m). To arrive at the bending moment capacity, that is the bending moment which causes (in theory) all the fibres at the relevant section to be subjected to their yield stress, it is necessary to integrate the elementary moments of the forces in the fibres about the neutral axis of the curved sheet pile. The elementary forces are the product of the yield stress (force per unit area) and the area of the element in question. The lever arm is the distance of the elementary area from the neutral axis. Thus the dimensions of the elementary moment (and hence of the integrated moment) are stress times area times distance. Hence the factor of 2α measured in metres. I can find no source which explains how the figure of 0.185m was arrived at. The page from the Larssen brochure gives data from which the factor 2α can be calculated. The figure is the ratio of the plastic section modulus to the sectional area. Both those figures are given on that page of the brochure. The plastic section modulus is stated to be 5.924E-3m³/m; the sectional area is stated to be 4.19E-2 m²/m (I have converted the units). The ratio is 0.141m. If that figure is substituted for 2α, the bending moment capacity comes out at 2127 kNm/m without a safety factor.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">E is an elasticity modulus which applies in the elastic regime, where stress (force, here longitudinal force, per unit area) is proportional to strain (here, fractional increase in length). Where that regime applies, the ratio is a constant E known as Young’s modulus. The value 210E6 kN/m² for E is implicit in the section of the Haecon as-built design report to which I have referred above. The same value is explicit in an earlier design report of Haecon, identified by the reference USR2334 31 and dated 08-11-01, where it appears at page 14. Mr. Reid has taken the value 206E6.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">For the foregoing reasons, I cannot accept Professor Pavlovic’s figures of 2.12E5 kNm²/m for EI or his figure of 2500 kNm/m for the bending moment capacity of the sheet piles. I accept the figures used by Mr. Reid. There are, it is true, minor discrepancies in the parameters A, I and W (see below) between the page of the Larssen brochure that he relied on and the information contained in an undated Larssen Steel Sheet Piling Handbook which was exhibited to the witness statement of a witness who was not called to give evidence before me, and between those sources and the Haecon calculations. In fact, the differences between Mr. Reid and the Haecon reports as to the values of E, I and EI make little difference to the outcome that is relevant for present purposes, that is the curvatures necessary to produce the maximum elastic moment and the moment capacity of the sheet piles. I set out in the table below the figures, implicit or explicit, in the various sources. The parameter W is the so-called section factor or elastic section modulus. The last line of the table gives the curvature required in each case to give the maximum elastic bending moment.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Since I have not accepted the value of 2500 kNm/m as the bending moment capacity of the piles, the only acceptable evidence of the ratio between the maximum bending capacity and the maximum elastic moment is that contained in Mr. Reid’s extract from the Larssen brochure. That ratio is 5924/5005. It leads to the value of 2103 kNm/m for the maximum bending capacity on Mr. Reid’s figures, which I have accepted. A figure of 2100 kNm/m was spoken to by Mr. Bracegirdle. If the moment remained proportional to the curvature beyond the value of 1776 kNm/m, the constant of proportionality being EI, the curvatures which give rise to the capacity bending moment would be respectively 9.27E-3, 9.12E-3, 9.09E-3 and 9.09E-3.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The bending moment that mobilizes the elastic limit of the steel is 1776 kNm/m. That causes a curvature of 7.83E-3 per metre. At that bending moment, the outer fibres of the steel are stretched to their elastic limit. They can be stretched further, but offer no increase in resistance. At that point, a plastic hinge starts to form. The hinge is fully plastic at a bending moment of 2103 kNm/m. The moment increases less than proportionally to the curvature as the plastic hinge forms. Thus the curvature of 9.27E-3 given in paragraph 43 above must represent a lower limit. Once a plastic hinge is fully formed over a significant length of the sheet pile, 2 metres or so, the pile, if unrestrained at its sides or adjacent to piles in similar condition, can be pushed out further with little increase in the force acting on it. The same applies to the whole wall, with adjacent piles interlocked, if similar forces are acting along all of it.</span>

From those curves one can determine the curvature. A smooth curve must be drawn since there will have been random errors in the measurements. The sheet piles could not have been in a shape other than a smooth curve: both Professor Pavlovic and Mr. Reid gave evidence to that effect. A profile of a pile shows a vertical section of the wall, perpendicular to the line of the wall. It expresses the relationship between y and x, where y is the horizontal position of the pile in question, measured at right angles to the line of the wall, at any given depth x.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Reid and Professor Pavlovic responded to that invitation. Both found the smooth curves by computer programs which found the best fit of a profile, subject to the constraint that y was a polynomial function of x of a given degree. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x that it contains. Broadly speaking, the higher the degree the more closely can the curve follow the vagaries of the points. But following the points too closely will give a false picture since the shape of the piles is smooth but there are random errors in the positions of the points. Mr. Reid calculated a quartic polynomial as a best fit for the profile of X3. Professor Pavlovic calculated a number of polynomials. He calculated polynomials of all degrees from the third to the ninth for each of X1, X2 and X3. Both gentlemen specified the polynomials in question by reference to their coefficients of the powers of x. Professor Pavlovic also calculated polynomials to fit data presented by Mr. Reid in his report. Those data related to six other piles in berth 204 which had not been examined by the magnetic sonde but had been measured by divers on behalf of HSS. Mr. Reid had drawn profiles of them above the level of the sea bed. Professor Pavlovic used the polynomial curve-fitting procedure in relation to four of those six profiles. He did not specify the relevant polynomials. He concluded that away from the ends of the range of measurements the highest curvature shown by any of the profiles was 6.5E-3.</span>

The main reason for this is that these measurements are sparse (since they were taken every metre along the sheet pile’s height) and may contain significant errors. These errors ….. result in unreliable values of the second derivatives, i.e. curvatures and hence bending moments, as the latter are extremely sensitive to even small departures from true local values of displacement.</span>

Such local irregularities are the results of errors that do not describe the actual deformed shape of the sheet pile (in fact, it would be physically impossible for the sheet pile to deform in such a discontinuous way). These irregularities affect the shape of the fitted curves used to describe the profile of the deformed shape of the steel sheet pile, especially their second derivatives, thus compromising the accuracy and validity of the analysis of the most relevant parameters, namely the bending moment distribution which is directly proportional to the curvatures, i.e. second derivatives.</span>

To take Professor Pavlovic’s second point first, there is the error in curvature which best-fit polynomials are prone to exhibit towards the ends of the ranges that they are designed to cover. I accept that that error exists, and that the curvature figures generated for the points towards the ends of the respective ranges are useless.  Second, there is the proposition that differentiation of a function, especially double differentiation, is liable to produce wholly unreliable values of curvature, whatever the function, polynomial or other.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The essence of the argument is this. Suppose there is a relationship between two physical quantities that can be represented graphically by a smooth curve. Suppose measurements are taken of those quantities in a real experiment or observation. Suppose the measurements are subject to random errors and are plotted as a graph. A “best fit” curve will be a smooth curve showing the trend line, but a curve that passes through all the points will be a squiggly line. It is of the nature of squiggly lines that their curvature rapidly varies from point to point on the line. The values of the curvature will change between high positive values and high negative values, necessarily passing through zero in between. Thus if one measures, or calculates, the curvature at any point it is likely to have a value far removed from the average value in the vicinity of that point, i.e. from the value of the curvature of the trend line in that vicinity. If the squiggly line is represented by a mathematical function, polynomial or other, the curvature can be calculated by differentiation and double differentiation of that function. The answer will be correct, but useless, since it not the curvature of the squiggly line, but that of the trend line, that is desired.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The polynomials that have been generated by Professor Pavlovic are (I accept) the best-fit polynomials of the given order in each case that can be found to fit the data, at any rate to as high a degree of accuracy as is necessary for present purposes. They thus represent the smooth curve, not the squiggly line. That the objection to double differentiation is in most cases negligible for present purposes is clear from the actual results. In appendices 1, 2 and 3 to this judgment I set out figures that I have calculated from Professor Pavlovic’s polynomials relating to the sonde measurements using boreholes X1, X2 and X3. I have calculated both the y (horizontal position) value for each given value of x (the vertical position) and the second differential of y with respect to x for each given value of x. I have also shown the measured y value for each value of x. Thus it is possible to see how far the smoothed-out curves depart in their y values from the measured values. The second differential of y with respect to x gives a sufficiently accurate value of the curvature of the polynomial function, given that the gradient (the first differential of y with respect to x) is everywhere small. I have not calculated results for every polynomial. But the consistency of these results along each curve is proof enough that the objection to double differentiation does not apply for present purposes. If it did, one would expect rapid oscillations in the values of curvature as the x value gradually changed.</span>

Mr. Ballard rejected the results from borehole X2 since they were highly erratic as a result of stormy weather, which interfered with the measurement of the y-values. Mr. Williamson submitted that an averaging of the various results obtained from borehole X2 gave a good match to the netsurvey results (see paragraph 69 below) for the same sheet pile. Thus, he submitted, they were reliable. There was in my judgment sufficient force in that submission for me to have thought it worth while to calculate, as I have, the curvatures represented by that average. But the profile is far from a smooth curve, and I cannot regard the resulting curvatures as calculated from the polynomial of orders 5 and above as reliable in that case. Further, there is a kink in the y value from borehole X2 at about -15mCD which clearly cannot represent reality (nor has it been suggested that it does) and which is reflected increasingly in the higher polynomials.</span>

That was put forward by Mr. Williamson as a representation of the profile obtained by the sonde. The original profile obtained by the sonde was exhibited to Mr. Ballard’s witness statement. It was in the form of a graph of horizontal location y against vertical position x. Thus it showed the shape of the profile, modified by the difference in scale between the horizontal and the vertical axes. The scales were small, and the plot was not on graph paper. Thus it was impossible to read off the precise data from the graph. That was no doubt a perfectly reasonable way to represent the data, given the wide margin of error to which Mr. Ballard spoke. The horizontal scale of X22 was even smaller, and it was even more difficult to read off the horizontal positions accurately. When I read off the data in the two cases, I obtained different results. Mr. Reid’s quartic and Professor Pavlovic’s quartic do indeed yield different y values for the same x values. I have carried out a least-squares exercise, and I find that Professor Pavlovic’s quartic represents the y values as I have read them off X22 better than Mr. Reid’s quartic represents the data as I have read them off Mr. Ballard’s graph. But in my judgment, if there is a discrepancy between the two sources, Mr. Ballard’s is to be preferred to X22, being the original source and easier to read.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">As mentioned in paragraph 47 above, Mr. Reid appended to his report of September 2005 a copy of output from that survey. I have examined all his plots of the output, six in number. They show “deflection” (horizontal position) against level. At location 20, readings were taken from +1mCD to -12.8mCD (sea bed level). There was a bulge with a maximum at -8mCD. The displacement between relieving platform level (0mCD) and the maximum of the bulge was about 95mm. I have made a rough calculation of the average curvature in the region where it appears greatest by measuring the gradient of the plotted curve at two points and calculating the average rate of change of the gradient per metre change in level. The curvature as so calculated is less than 5E-3 per metre. At location 25, where readings go down to -11.72mCD, there is no bulge. The maximum displacement is 12mm and the curvature obviously negligible. At location 160, the graph goes down to -8.37mCD. There is the top part of what may be a bulge at -7 to -8mCD. The maximum displacement is 160mm. The curvature, as calculated by me, is 7E-3. At location 185, where readings go down to the level -9.29mCD, there is a bulge at -5mCD. The maximum displacement is about 65mm. My calculation gives a curvature of 5.5E-3. The plot of location 215 goes down to the level -8.68mCD. No bulge is reached by that level. The maximum displacement shown is 260mm. The curvature is clearly negligible. Finally, location 310 goes down to -11.42mCD. The maximum displacement shown (though apparently increasing with depth at -11.42mCD) is 425mm. The maximum curvature below the relieving platform is negligible.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In the Netsurvey, points were plotted which showed the profiles of the piles above seabed level at 5 metre intervals along the wall in several berths including berths 204 and 205. I have looked at all the profiles covering berths 204 and 205. Berth 204 extends from bollard 216A to a point close to bollard 236; berth 205 extends from that point to bollard 258. Bollard 258 is the zero datum of the survey for measurement along the quay in metres. Bollard 236 is close to the 330m point; bollard 216A is close to the 630m point. There is a striking difference between the profiles for berth 204 and those for berth 205. That is scarcely surprising, since, as is common ground, the piles in berth 205 have been pushed out by the grouting works. The curvature and displacement of the piles is apparent, with the maximum displacement generally at about the level of -9 to -10mCD. The profiles of berth 204, by contrast, are comparatively straight and show less displacement. It is not possible accurately to tell the curvature of the piles from these small-scale profiles. But the curvatures of the vast majority appear to be negligible for present purposes. Those which appeared to me to embody the greatest curvatures are identified in the table below.</span>

The respective horizontal displacements from the positions at 0mCD are also set out in the table. I made a rough estimate of the maximum average curvatures over a few metres’ depth in each of those cases by measuring and calculating the change in direction of the profile in radians per metre depth. The curvatures I obtained were respectively 5E-3, 5E-3, 8E-3, 3E-3, 3E-3, 5E-3 and 5E-3 per metre. Only the third of those represents a bending moment in excess of the maximum elastic moment. The horizontal displacements could not be measured with any precision; the stated curvatures are even less reliable. Nevertheless, it is clear that in the vast majority of these numerous profiles no curvature at the bulge and above the sea bed is shown which approaches that representing the maximum elastic bending moment, let alone a plastic hinge.</span>

The curvatures at chainages 340, 360 and 375 suggest the presence of plastic hinges. But the Netsurvey readings in the vicinity of the relieving platform may be affected, as pointed out by Professor Pavlovic, by the presence of low water corrosion plates attached to the sheet piles by way of repair or reinforcement in that vicinity. Corrosion had to be particularly guarded against in the intertidal zone, which extended down to -0.6mCD. If such plates appear in the Netsurvey profiles, they will have the effect of increasing the apparent curvature of the sheet piles near the relieving platform. Thus I cannot regard the curvatures that I have estimated at that level as reliable.</span>

One of those, at metrage 375, turned out to be close to X1 (which was at about 380m) and to Mr. Reid’s location 310. Another, at 515m, was close to X2 (which was at about 507m) and to location 160. A third, at 570m, was close to location X3 (which was at about 573m). Thus, whether by chance or by design, X1, X2 and X3 were located at or near points of exceptionally high visible curvature. The profile that I have noted in paragraph 69 above at metrage 530 is, I think, the one that appears as having a 650mm displacement, the maximum shown, in figure 4 of Mr. Reid’s report.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Williamson relied on a finite element analysis produced by Mr. Bracegirdle which showed a bending moment of 600 kNm/m at -10mCD corresponding to a bulge of 100mm at that point. He invited me to conclude that X3, showing a bulge of 300mm, must have been sustaining a bending moment of 1800 kNm/m, a moment in excess of the maximum elastic moment. The sonde profile shows a deviation from the chord of 283mm. If the proportionality held exactly, and the figure of 600 kNm/m were exactly accurate, then the bending moment at the maximum of the bulge on X3 would be 2.83 times 600 kNm/m, i.e. 1698 kNm/m. These figures are not, of course, at all as accurate as their apparent precision. But Mr. Bracegirdle’s finite element analysis has the pile almost vertical at 0mCD, and its tangent rotates outward before it starts to rotate inward as one runs one’s eye down towards the maximum of the bulge. That may produce a different curvature, and a different calculated bending moment, at the maximum of the bulge, than would be the case for the shape of X3 where (as in the case of X2) the pile is raking seaward even at relieving platform level. It is nevertheless noteworthy that the bending moment of 1698kNm/m is close to the figure of 1668kNm/m arrived at in paragraph 62 above.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The above considerations in my judgment tend to confirm rather than otherwise the usefulness of estimating curvature to determine bending moment. Both methods are affected by errors in the original profile measurements. Apart from that, inaccuracies in determining the curvature by using polynomials arise principally, in my judgment, not at all from the process of differentiation but from non-conformance of the polynomials with the smooth curve represented by the true profile. But to extrapolate from the displacements shown in three instances, X1, X2 and X3, (which themselves show that the piles have not in all cases been driven vertically) to the conclusion that the bending moment is in all cases proportional to the displacement of the pile from the vertical passing through the pile at the relieving platform level is in my judgment wholly unjustified.</span>

If the toe really was at 600mm landward, as measured by the sonde, that would, I think,  require a curvature below the sea bed (and thus not visible to the Netsurvey) involving a bending moment in excess of the maximum elastic bending moment. However, the sonde produced no reliable readings for the levels between -4mCD and -14mCD. That fact, coupled with the stated inaccuracy in its measurements, leads me to a state of uncertainty as to the degree of curvature of X1 below the sea bed.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">When the excavation for the relieving platform was carried out, the pressure of the ground and water on the seaward side of the sheet piles above the level of the relieving platform caused the sheet piles to tilt above that level so that the top of the sheet piles moved landward. Mr. Bracegirdle and Mr. Reid were agreed about that. Mr. Reid expressed the opinion that the sheet piles had been driven vertically, but that when the land on the seaward side of the sheet piles was excavated to -12.8mCD, the piles bulged outwards with a maximum bulge at about -10mCD by reason of the bending moment caused by the tilt above the relieving platform. That movement would reduce the bending moment that had caused it. No calculations were proffered in support of Mr. Reid’s theory, but he made a model which graphically illustrated it. It involved rotation of the sheet pile wall outwards “through” the passive soil below -12.8mCD (i.e. moving the passive soil outwards and compressing it) during the course of the excavation to -12.8mCD, with the toe of the pile stationary. Mr. Reid’s theory may have some element of truth in it, but I cannot accept it in its entirety, for reasons that follow.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Bracegirdle expounded a theory that because of seaward movement of the heads of the piles while they were being driven, the piles would be driven with a seaward rake, i.e. so that the toe was seaward of the head. It is not controversial that such seaward movement of the heads of the piles occurred. So far as I understand it, Mr. Bracegirdle’s theory works as follows. The seaward movement of the top of the pile in the landfill above the Valley gravels at an early stage of driving induced curvature in the pile since the bottom part of the pile was more or less vertical in the Valley gravels. The curvature in the sheet piles was maintained as driving continued, so that the toe of the pile described an arc as it descended, and the upper parts of the pile followed in its track. Thus when the pile was driven it bulged landward. Subsequent excavation of the landfill to construct the relieving platform caused the head of the pile to move landwards, as mentioned above. That more or less relieved the bulge and left the pile more or less straight but raked, with its toe seaward of its head. That appears to me to require lateral movement (rotation) of the pile “through” the Valley gravels at that stage, and to a lesser extent “through” the Selsey sands. When the berth was dredged to -12.8mCD the sheet piles bulged outwards, but retained their general seaward rake. I cannot accept (since I can see no reason for it) that a pile retains its curvature while driven. There is no suggestion that it does not remain elastic: its curvature at any given time depends upon the stresses to which it is subjected at that time. Thus there seems to be no reason why the toe of the pile while being driven should carve out for itself a path with a curvature similar to that of the part of the path which it has already traversed.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I prefer Mr. Reid’s theory to that of Mr. Bracegirdle. But the actual measurements convince me that neither represents the complete truth. I am satisfied on the evidence of X1 that the piles were not all driven vertically. And the seaward offset of the piles is not always explicable by a bulge. Piles that are straight as far down as the Netsurvey could detect their position show an offset in several cases. Only one shows a landward offset. Thus there was a tendency for the piles to be offset seaward regardless of bulge.</span>

The article pointed out (p.570) that a significant amount of human error is involved, and that implied that the users had insufficient training and/or experience in the use of advanced numerical analysis. It was not put to Mr. Bracegirdle that the persons carrying out the numerical analysis he used had insufficient training or experience. The program he used was called ICFEP: the Imperial College Finite Element Programme. That program had been developed by the same Professor Potts. Mr. Bracegirdle had derived advice and assistance, particularly in relation to small strain analysis, from Professor Richard Jardine of Imperial College. Professor Jardine had developed the non-linear soil model and had applied it to soil mechanics problems for a period in excess of 20 years. Variations in the model and soil parameters had been applied to assess the sensitivity of the model to wall friction and dilation. It was found that the outcome of the model was insensitive to those parameters. More to the point was the question of the validity of some of the other data used in the program. Mr. Bracegirdle’s use of a value of 35° for φ´ was criticized. Mr. O’Brien said, and I accept, that the model did not allow for variations in the geology along the wall. The analysis modelled only the locations where there was a deepened channel of valley gravel. Elsewhere, the Marsh Farm formation was higher. The model was a 2-dimensional model for a 3-dimensional situation. Mr. O’Brien considered that the assumptions and idealizations made for the ICFEP analysis used by Mr. Bracegirdle meant that the result was of little value in identifying the main issues: there was insufficiently detailed knowledge of the relevant soil parameters to give a reliable outcome. There were other criticisms, e.g. that the grid used was not fine enough.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Reid made a specific criticism of the finite element program by reference to a graph of shear force in the grout wall as a function of depth (run 200) appended to Mr. Bracegirdle’s report. Mr. Reid said that it was self-inconsistent. He said that by differentiating the function produced by the program as representing the shear force as a function of depth one would obtain the (horizontal) loading. If that were done, it would appear that the loading below –23m CD was in the same direction as the loading between –7 and –13m CD. He said that that showed an inconsistency. He pointed out (correctly) that Mr. Bracegirdle had said that the force below -23mCD was in a direction from seaward to landward, whereas the loading from –7 to –13m CD must be from landward to seaward. Mr. Bracegirdle in reply stated that above about –14m CD locked-in stresses on the seaward side of the grout column exceeded the stresses on the landward side. It was below that level that the stresses on the landward side exceeded those on the seaward side. Thus the stresses which Mr. Reid said were wrongly shown to be in the same direction were indeed in the same direction, from seaward to landward. Mr. Reid also made the criticism that differentiating the function produced by the program as representing the bending moment as a function of depth would produce a shear force function which differed from that produced by the program. Mr. Bracegirdle pointed out that since the grout wall was subject both to compression and to bending, differentiation of the bending moment plot to derive shear forces was incorrect and would produce erroneous results.

The passive pressures will act on the grout wall in a seaward to landward direction. What is “mobilized”, however, an unfortunate word, is a reduction in such pressures. If considered separately as a pressure on its own, it will act on the grout wall from landward to seaward. This is not, of course, a sensible way of looking at the matter. The pressure in the soil between the grout wall and the sheet pile wall will actually operate in an opposite direction on the landward face of the sheet pile wall to that in which it will operate on the seaward face of the grout wall.

The maximum deflection, and the corresponding local maximum bending moment of 580 kNm/m, both occurred close to a depth of -10mCD. The value of (K0) used in the calculation was 1.5. Although the finite element analysis was criticized, Mr. O’Brien considered that apart from a number of factors that he mentioned, the calculation (or “base case” as he called it) was likely to produce a maximum bending moment in the sheet pile wall of something between 700 and 900 kNm/m.</span>

The second matter is that the driving of the H-piles would have increased the value of (K0) (ib., paragraph 12.2(vii)). But in my judgment there is an important difference between the two uses of the parameter (K0). That parameter is a characteristic of the soil, and represents the ratio of the horizontal stress to the vertical stress. In a large mass of soil, the greater the depth, the greater the pressure from the overlying soil, hence the greater the horizontal pressure for a given value of (K0), other things being equal. That pressure applies through the whole mass of the soil at the relevant depth. But the effect of driving the H-piles is different, since it is local to the H-piles. The H-piles bear the weight of the soil above the relieving platform and the surcharge loads on the ground at the top principally by reason of the frictional grip on them of the soil surrounding them. The driving of the H-piles in those circumstances is reflected not only in a vertical but also in a horizontal stress in the soil, especially in the layer of very dense sand, which lies typically between -10 and -11mCD. That horizontal stress is resisted by elastic forces in the soil which produce a horizontal pressure gradient so that the extra horizontal force produced by the H-piles becomes negligible after some distance from them.</span>

One thing is the impact during the driving process on the sheet pile wall itself and in particular, the clutches, and the clutches are a potential weak point. In terms of the locked-in stresses, again we get back to the point about the connection detail. If the wall was free to rotate and [sic] Professor Jardine would be exactly right, it would leave and quickly the locked-in stresses would reduce. But I think the real point here, because of the counterforts the wall is not that free to move so it is not that easy for it to deflect, but you can do it at deeper levels when you get remote from the stress-relieving platform, but as you get closer to the stress-relieving platform the counterfort effect becomes more and more important…..</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. O’Brien’s calculation shows the force said to be applied to the sheet pile wall by reason of the driving of the H-piles. It does include a calculation of the strength of the clutch, but it does not show the response of the sheet pile wall to the applied force. Until the berth was dredged to -12.8mCD, the sheet pile wall would have been supported by the soil on the passive side of it. It may be that a small movement of the wall would have relieved the net force on the wall. Whilst there may have been some difference between the actual situation and a situation where the H-piles were driven before the sheet piles were driven, no evidence as to the amount of any such effect has been offered.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The passages from Mr. O’Brien’s report quoted above suggest that the calculation is a calculation of permanent effects of the driving of the H-piles, not of transient effects, even though some of the causes appear to be transient. Part of the force calculated is a force existing below the level of the toe of the H-pile. That force at any given level of the sheet pile wall is transient, occurring only before or at the time when the toe of the H-pile passes the relevant level as it is driven. And in the calculation, the rate of hammering of the H-piles is a relevant factor. That again is clearly a transient cause. (Mr. O’Brien stated in his calculation that at the current state of the art it was not possible to carry out an appropriate dynamic calculation. He applied a factor of 1.2³ [equal to 1.73] to the calculated stresses to allow for the dynamic effect of the hammering. That figure was derived from what appear to have been empirical published figures). </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I cannot accept Mr. O’Brien’s evidence that the effect would not have occurred if the H-piles had been installed before, rather than after, the installation of the sheet piles. It is of course true that the calculated forces would not act on the sheet pile wall if the sheet pile wall were not there. But the stresses calculated to have been in the soil were not dependent upon the presence of the sheet pile wall. If the sheet pile wall were driven subsequently, the forces each side of the wall resulting from those stresses in the soil would be substantially equal and opposite, and hence balanced. They would cause negligible relevant stress to the sheet pile wall. But once the dredging to -12.8mCD took place, the balancing passive force from the soil would be removed. The situation would not then be substantially dependent on the order in which the two sets of piles had been driven.</span>

The stresses induced in the sheet pile wall by such transient forces have not been calculated, and there is no material before me to suggest that they might have been significant.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">There is a further, related, consideration. The H-piles cause a local increase in the horizontal stress in the soil by reason of their displacement of the soil as they are driven. I accept evidence of Mr. Bracegirdle that that cause has an effect on the sheet pile wall which is negligible for present purposes. Whether that consideration is included in the Jardine and Chow method does not appear. But the conclusions expressed in paragraphs 103 and 104 above still apply.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Another point pertaining to the fact that the H-piles were driven after the sheet piles was made by Mr. Reid. He said in his report, paragraph 29(3), that during the driving of the H-piles unwanted horizontal displacement of the sheet piles would occur. The effect would have been exacerbated by the system used to support the piling rig. One end of the piling rig was supported on the ends of the cantilevered sheet piles. Unfavourable forces and vibrations would thereby have been imparted to the sheet pile wall. He explained in oral evidence (day 22, page 102) that the vibrations caused by the hammer and by the horizontal movements of the piling rig would loosen the soil and reduce its capacity to resist the landward movement of the tops of the sheet piles. He said (report, paragraph 29(9)) that the combined influence of all those secondary effects was impossible to assess with accuracy, but it could be deduced that the first plastic hinge that could develop in the sheet pile wall after dredging would occur close to the river bed, rather than at relieving slab level as would otherwise be the case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I need not consider that last deduction. As to the movement of the sheet pile wall caused by the movement of the massive piling frame and cranes, the forces generated would depend on the acceleration of those objects as well as their location. No figure for their acceleration, or indeed any calculation, was offered. I regard this evidence of Mr. Reid as speculative and I attach little weight to it. I am not satisfied that the order of driving the H-piles and the sheet piles had any significant effect on the state of the sheet pile wall before the grouting works were executed.</span>

He did not say how he arrived at the amount of that increase. Mr. Bracegirdle (ICFEP run 206) calculated the maximum bending moment on the basis of a value of (K0) equal to 2.4 at all strata as 850 kNm/m, an increase of 12 per cent. over his figure of 760 kNm/m for (K0)=1.5.</span>

The expression “all the soil self weight” clearly refers to the loads on the platform that I have mentioned above. Mr. Bracegirdle said that that assumption was incorrect and unjustified. However, he did say (report, paragraph 6.11.7) that some small settlement of soil could be expected beneath the relieving platform. In that case, there would be no load on the top of the soil beneath the relieving platform. I thus interpret Mr. Bracegirdle’s denial of the assumption to his recognition of the fact that the H-piles would support the load above the relieving platform in part by friction in such a way as to increase the stress in the soil above the level of the toe of the sheet pile wall.</span>

His bulking theory is to be distinguished from dilatancy, which is the volume increase of soil caused by shearing forces. The latter is well established; the former appears to be unique to Mr. Reid. As I understand it, the bulking theory asserts that when a load which has compressed soil is released, the soil loosens and expands. Thus when the ground is excavated for the purpose of casting the relieving platform, the soil beneath loosens and expands by heave. When the ground is restored above the platform, the soil immediately beneath the platform bears some of the load. Not all is transferred to the H-piles.

However, I did back in the late 1970s quite a bit of research on mining subsidence where I was preventing what we call plump holes in the ground under motorway embankments and I stretched membranes over circular holes in the laboratory and I created a plump hole and I measured what happened. What I found was that the soil arched round the hole but it also bulked as it went down so the amount of volume you got by allowing the membrane to sag wasn’t mirrored by the amount of settlement you got on the surface. I have spoken to quite a number of eminent soil mechanic people and they say nobody has written a paper on this so therefore it can’t happen. I don’t subscribe to that, that just because somebody has not written a paper about it, and I didn’t either, that does not mean to say it doesn’t happen. What, when I looked at the sheet pile, it seems to me that although it is to a wall it will behave like a membrane and if you have dense soil, which you have here, and it is allowed to yield, what will happen is it will loosen, and that is just to let you understand what I’m saying there is that if you were having your driveway concreted and the contractor came along and he dumped a load of gravel on your soil and then he came along with a roller; so if he had 200mm layer of gravel underneath his roller, it would go down to about 175. So it started off loose when you dumped it down there and when you roll it in it becomes dense. What I’m saying is going to happen behind the wall is the reverse of that: the dense soil that is there becomes loose as it yields away and the effect of water and so on in it. Now, that was what I suggested to Babties at the time and they said I was wrong: there would be a gap under the wall [sic: slab?] …..</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Reid calculated the percentage of the load on the relieving platform carried by the H-piles in this way. Assuming a certain percentage load carried by the H-pile, he calculated the consequent shortening of the pile. That would involve the lowering of its top. He then computed the heave that would generate the assumed percentage. He used assumed characteristics of the heaved soil to determine the proportion of the load that would bear directly upon it and the proportion that would be supported by the H-pile. Mr. Reid said (day 21, page 128) that in his view the soil would move back down, upon loading of the relieving platform, only by the amount it had heaved when the soil had been excavated. Having assessed the heave, by other means, at 2mm, he then arrived at his figure of 50 per cent. I take it that he used the results of the research he mentioned in order to assess the heave. He said (day 21, page 128) that it was impossible to calculate the heave. However, it appears from the appendix to his report, sheet 17, that the heave that according to his calculation produces the 50 per cent. division is not 2mm but 4.444mm. 2.222mm is the shortening in the length of the H-pile.</span>

At working load the displacement required to mobilize their shaft resistance is likely to be relatively small, of the order of 5mm. However, the stress relieving platform is underlain by relatively stiff competent materials…[He then considered the characteristics of those materials]…Settlement calculations for the platform (based on the methods of Burland et al., 1977; and Burland and Burbridge, 1983), ignoring the presence of the bearing pile, indicate that at bearing pressures of between 20 and 40kN/m², the platform would settle about 5mm. Hence, there is likely to be a significant load sharing between the bearing piles and the platform itself, i.e. the piles would carry out [sic: about?] 70% to 85% of the overburden above platform level, whilst the soil below platform level would carry the remaining 15% to 30%.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In table 12.1 in paragraph 12.3(iv) of his report he postulated an increase in the stress borne by the top of the soil below platform level from 0 (the base case) to 40kN/m². The latter figure represents approximately 30 per cent. of the load on the relieving platform (130kN/m²: see paragraph 119 above). He considered that that increase would cause an increase in bending moment in the sheet pile wall of 5 to 15 per cent. He did not say how he arrived at those figures. Mr. Bracegirdle’s figure of 760kNm/m was based on the assumption that there was no stress on the top of the soil below the relieving platform. He calculated that if the whole of the load on the relieving platform were borne by the soil beneath it, the maximum bending moment would be increased by 45 per cent. to 1100kNm/m. On the assumption of proportionality, which is the best one can do, that implies that the maximum bending moment if the relieving platform allowed 15 to 30 per cent of the load on it to be transferred to the top of the soil beneath it would be increased from 760kNm/m by 6¾ per cent. to 13½ per cent.</span>

Mr. Bracegirdle, using run 220 for some reason that is not apparent, calculated that over-dredging from -12.8mCD to -14.1mCD would increase the maximum bending moment from 727kNm/m (cf. run 200: 760kNm/m) to 750 kNm/m, an increase of 3 per cent.</span>

The best that can be done to give a rough estimate is to treat them as mutually independent.

Mr. O’Brien’s estimate of the combined effect is 1.2 to 1.5. Thus there is not a wide degree of dispute between Mr. Bracegirdle and Mr. O’Brien on the combined effect of these matters, on the assumption that Mr. O’Brien is right as to the change in the factors mentioned in paragraph 96 above.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Taking the maximum figure of Mr. O’Brien’s base case, 900kNm/m, and the figure of 2100kNm/m as the bending moment capacity of the sheet pile wall, 43 per cent. of the structural capacity of the sheet pile wall would have been utilized. That accords with his opinion that “one would normally expect the applied bending moments to be a low percentage of the wall capacity, with perhaps less than 50% of the structural capacity being utilized” (his report, conclusion of section 12.3). He concluded that the changes in parameter which he considered appropriate, and which I have considered above, could have increased the utilization factor to about 80% to 90%. Those figures represent increase factors of 1.87 to 2.1 from a base of 900kNm/m, and of 2.4 to 2.7 from a base of 700kNm/m. He concluded that the maximum bending moment moves perilously close to the bending capacity of the sheet pile wall, giving a far lower margin of safety than would normally be expected. But those factors go well beyond the rest of his evidence. If one takes his maximum estimate of the base case, namely 900kNm/m, and his maximum estimate of the uplift factor, namely 1.5, one arrives at a utilization factor of 64 per cent., giving a margin of safety of 55 per cent.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I accept Mr. Bracegirdle’s evidence as to the individual factors representing the effect of the changes in parameters proposed by Mr. O’Brien. That is to say, I accept that they correctly reproduce the effects of the changes as calculated in accordance with the ICFEP analysis. Mr. O’Brien himself said that ICFEP was a highly respected software package (section 12.2 of his report). It was the assumptions and idealizations that he criticized. In so far as the assumptions did not meet Mr. O’Brien’s criteria and gave rise to his suggested increases in bending moment, they have been amended in the manner indicated above. There remain criticisms, including the fact that the analysis is a 2-dimensional analysis of a 3-dimensional problem. But in my judgment, those criticisms are likely to be of lesser force when applied to adjustments than when applied to the original calculations. Thus in my judgment Mr. Bracegirdle’s factors of 1.23 to 1.31 are more reliable than Mr. O’Brien’s effective factors of 1.87 to 2.7. Mr. O’Brien does not differ from Mr. Bracegirdle in his base case, though he gives a bracket. If one takes Mr. O’Brien’s median base case of 800kNm/m and applies a factor of 1.3 to it, one arrives at a figure of 1040kNm/m as the maximum calculated bending moment. That gives a factor of safety of 2 in relation to the formation of plastic hinges.</span>

That proposition was somewhat widened to the proposition that the sheet pile wall was in a state of excessive and unforeseeable bending before the grouting took place. The possible effect of the grouting is thus relevant to determination of the initial state of the sheet pile wall. Before considering that question, I shall give here a fuller description of the grouting process than I have given above. The following is a description given by Dr. Greenwood.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In its simplest and original from jet grouting proceeds as follows. A borehole is drilled into soil by any suitable means, of diameter just sufficient to accommodate a drill string and jetting “monitor” (an attachment at the bottom which contains one or more orifices to create radial jets) with an annular space to allow return of circulating waste fluids. This hole is usually 150 to 200mm diameter and it extends to the far limit of intended treatment. The monitor is inserted to the bottom of the hole and the radial jets are turned on whilst the drill string is slowly rotated and withdrawn. The jetting fluid is cement grout. As the jet(s) impinge on the sides of the unlined borehole the soil is eroded and a larger diameter cavity results, extending upwards with the jets as they are simultaneously rotated and lifted. The eroded soil mixes with the grout to form a fluid soil-cement mix in the cavity which, incidentally, helps to support the borehole against collapse. As fresh grout is pumped continuously to maintain the jets a similar quantity of effluent comprising soil-cement is ejected through the annulus alongside the drill string to waste at ground surface. When the desired length of enlarged column is formed the drill string and monitor are withdrawn and the soil-cement remaining in the cavity and bore is allowed to rest and harden in situ. A column of cemented soil results.</span>

Two were diametrically opposed and fitted with 3mm diameter nozzles and one, with a 2.45mm nozzle, was directed downwards at an angle of 5° from vertical. In this case the monitor was used as a drill bit during the formation of the initial borehole and the downward jet assisted penetration through the soil in addition to cutting teeth. Moreover, the horizontal jets worked in tandem with the downward jet to pre-cut (or pre-wash) a larger initial bore than would be cut by a simple drill bit. Thus jetting during withdrawal began from a larger base diameter than the conventional process described above. An Ordinary Portland, P 42.5 cement was used in a grout of water/cement ratio 0.82 by dry weight during both penetration and uplift, both phases being used for jetting/soil mixing.</span>

It was intended that the columns should be formed in continuous lengths from a depth of -24.75mCD to +0.39mCD (the underside of the relieving platform). However, there frequently occurred cracking of the sheet piles, and in consequence, after about 12.9 per cent. of the columns had been constructed,  the process was altered to a two-stage process. The first stage was to construct a column down to -7.0mCD. An admixture was included in the grout to retard its setting. A down-the-hole hammer was used to drill through the hardening upper stage to allow access to construct the second stage, from -24.75mCD to -6.0mCD. The second stage was generally constructed between three and fifteen days after completion of the first stage.</span>

The maximum bending moment in that vicinity would be 580 kNm/m at approximately the same depth.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">When the grouting process was working as intended, the high pressure causing the high velocity of the jet of grout was dissipated as the jet was absorbed in the surrounding soil. The pressure that continued in the soil while the grout was liquid was simply the hydrostatic pressure of the grout, plus the pressure difference required to drive the excess grout up the annular tube back to ground level. If the grout return was lost because the annular tube was blocked, then the high pressure of the jet would extend to the liquid grout in the soil for so long (if at all) as the jetting process was continued. The grout return could also be lost because grout was finding its way to contact with the sheet pile wall, forming a lens behind the sheet pile wall and leaving no excess to pass up the annular tube.

At increment 45 the system (including the state of the sheet pile wall) had been modelled on the assumption of no grout pressure. Dr. Kovacevic established the difference between the total horizontal stress which was acting at each level of the wall at increment 45 and the hydrostatic pressure due to liquid grout at the same level. He then applied, using the program, successive increments of 10 per cent. of that difference, assumed to be acting on the wall wherever the grout pressure exceeded the calculated horizontal soil pressure. That showed increasing bending moments in the sheet pile wall and corresponding increasing bulging in that wall.</span>

The successive subsequent increments represented successive increments of 10 per cent. of that excess. Increment 50 represented an increment of 50 per cent. It is apparent from the transcript (page 21) of the meeting of the experts that was put before me that the model ceased to converge at a grout pressure of 47 or 48 per cent. of the full excess of the hydrostatic pressure over the active soil pressure.

He said that loss of slurry return to the surface would cause the immediate outward displacement of the sheet piles and hydrofracture. I accept that if loss of slurry return through blockage of the annular cylinder occurred the grout could apply pressure to the wall far greater than the hydrostatic pressure. Whether it would produce an effect on the wall greater than that calculated by the analysis depends on the extent of the wall subjected to the pressure. The analysis itself assumes a substantial coverage by grout at hydrostatic pressure. But whether or not the process was hydrofracture strictly so called is not of significance. Dr. Greenwood considered that a more likely process was that the hydrostatic pressure of the grout could be transferred either directly or through a few centimetres of sand or gravel to deform the wall.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The values of l, v, b and a apply to the upper, narrower, section of the annular tube (of outer diameter 0.213m). Dr. Greenwood accepted the formula for the pressure head and its method of calculation, but he arrived at different values of h. He confined his calculation to the case of l=6.5m. He said that the pressure head in the upper section of the tube was 0.17m equivalent water head. He arrived at the figure of 0.17m by taking the value of l as 6.5m (as he explained) and the value of ν as 5.5E-4 m²/sec. (as is apparent). The values of v, b and a are his values, which I accept. Dr. Greenwood explained the method of grouting in his report by reference to a diagram which he identified as figure 3. That shows the upper section of the tube to be of length 13.5m for the second phase of the two-phase working, otherwise 6.89m. That is borne out by the text in paragraphs A16 and A17 of his report. As to the value of the kinematic viscosity ν, he gave a range of values from 5.5E-4 to 27E-4. My figure, which I obtained by the imprecise method of measuring the gradient of a curve in figure A5-1 of his report, is in the middle of that range. He evidently took the minimum value of the range because the shear rate (velocity gradient) of the fluid flowing in the upper, narrower, section was greater than that of the fluid flowing in the broader section. He took the maximum value of the range for the fluid flowing in the broader section, and arrived at a figure of 0.12m as the equivalent water head loss for that section. Thus his total figure for h was 0.29m water equivalent. He was, however, wrong in thinking that the formula gives a water equivalent value of h. The density of the fluid is implicit in the kinematic viscosity, and the value of h given by the formula is the head of fluid, not of water.</span>

According to the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Nico Claessens, who acted as works manager for the installation of the columns, and whose evidence was admitted under the Civil Evidence Act, that device registered all relevant grouting parameters, namely depth, penetration/lifting speed, rotation speed, grout pressure and grout flow. The device showed the data in a digital form and also produced a paper record. It kept a continuous record except on occasions when it malfunctioned; on those occasions, operatives checked the relevant gauges, manometer and flow meter. A visual inspection of the grout return was continuously undertaken. If loss of grout return was experienced, the VHP installation was stopped. Reduced flow rates and pressures were applied, and the rods were moved up and down irregularly, a procedure known as “dancing”. The problem was overcome by gradually building up pressure and flow to the pre-determined rates.</span>

That was our understanding of the cause of the problem, because anyhow, there were no – because we checked the wall over its entire length, we didn’t find any cracking outside the areas where we had been doing VHP grouting. So there was inevitably a link between VHP grouting and the cracking, which at that time we also had concern about steel quality….Our understanding was, we are building up a kind of pressure behind the wall which cannot be taken by the wall, so in order to reduce the wall [sic: pressure?] we can do a multiple stage, because we were thinking, okay, the pressure is build up because the gravel layer is blocking the effluent going upwards – even though you have effluent going upwards, you still have a slight increase of pressure and that pressure must be sufficient to damage the wall. That was our understanding at that time and that’s why we proposed two solutions in order to mitigate the effect.</span>

Partial blockage could raise the excess of pressure over hydrostatic substantially above the extra head of 1 metre of grout that I have mentioned above. Total blockage could raise it to VHP level.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I should answer a particular rhetorical question raised by Mr. Williamson. It was this. The finite element analysis was said to support a conclusion that merely 50 per cent. of the grout loading was sufficient to cause an immediate 1 metre displacement of the wall. That conclusion was in no way qualified. If 50 per cent. of the grout loading instantaneously could cause such a massive displacement (1 metre), why did not 100 per cent. of the grout loading, applied repeatedly and over long periods, cause the wall to fail, or, indeed, cause anything like this displacement? My first point in answer is that the figure of 50 per cent. relates to the excess over the geostatic pressure, and is more than 50 per cent. of the hydrostatic pressure of the grout. However, that does not meet the gravamen of the question. The second point is that Mr. Bracegirdle made it clear that the analysis had been carried out in two dimensions (his report, appendix 16, first paragraph). That was a relevant qualification. The question of the extent to which support to the section of the wall in question was afforded by neighbouring sections was not addressed. Third, 100 per cent. of the grout loading was not necessarily ever applied to the wall: the precise area of the wall covered does not appear. Finally, 1 metre displacement and more did occur at many places, as the Netsurvey of 2004 clearly shows. Mr. Williamson submitted that Mr. Bracegirdle sought to evade the question, and he suggested to Mr. Bracegirdle that he was fencing. On the contrary, I have the impression that Mr. Bracegirdle was doing his best to answer the relevant questions and was not fencing.</span>

The experts’ agreement item 17 that the state of berth 205 before the grouting was carried out was the same as that of berth 204 must mean that the two states were comparable in this sense, that the states of bending of the two quays were similar. Thus the reference in paragraph 81 to X1, X2 and X3 must be read, in relation to berth 205, as a reference to three unidentified lengths of about 20m each.</span>

Thus it is clear from that drawing that in the case of berth 201 the sheet piles must have been driven before the H-piles were driven. A similar arrangement was in fact used for the construction of berths 202 to 205. If Haecon and HSS had not already been on enquiry, that archive drawing, if they had seen it, would have put them on enquiry whether berth 205 had been constructed in the same way.</span>

For the Bracklesham Beds, which are not well researched relative to London Clays, it would be particularly important to have such data if geotechnical analysis was to be reliable for design purposes. The relevance and importance of that kind of information is now well known, and Mr. O’Brien cited two papers, one published in 1989 and the other in 1992.

I treat this submission as also a submission of HSS, where the lack of information in the possession of HSS would be relevant. All that was necessary, submitted Mr. Jones, was for Haecon to raise the assertion that evidence of the physical condition of the quay wall was not foreseen by it or by HSS. Thereafter, ABP must prove that such information was either irrelevant, made available or that it was foreseeable. Mr. Jones submitted that to give any other interpretation to the contractual term would fail to give it business efficacy since it would be analogous to a warranty in respect of latent defects, and in particular the works undertaken in the 1970s, and there would otherwise be an untenable tension between the fitness for purpose obligation and the clause 12 condition.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Reid carried out a number of calculations relevant to the question whether the grout wall was fit for its purpose. He wrote in his report that the calculations had been carried out by WMR Consultancy to demonstrate that the wall system as designed by Haecon at Berth 205 was adequate to carry the loading that would have acted on it provided the relieving slab and the supporting piles [i.e. the H-piles]  were capable of shielding the wall from overburden pressure. The calculations were based on the assumption that the relieving slab and the support H-piles transmitted the vertical load of the overburden and superimposed load above it to a level beneath where the sheet pile wall would be subject to lateral forces from that vertical loading.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The first set of calculations considered the stability of the sheet pile wall under the hydrostatic pressure of liquid grout. Of that set, the first subset related to the case where the whole grout column was executed in one pass. The second represented the upper stage of the two-pass system, and the third, the lower stage of that system. In each such subset of calculations it was assumed that the grout pressure acted over the whole relevant height of the wall. In the first subset, the relevant height of the wall was from 0mCD to -14.8mCD; in the second subset, from 0mCD to -7mCD; and in the third subset, from -6mCD to -14.8mCD. It was assumed that the sheet pile wall was fixed at and below -14.8mCD. It was also assumed that the grout pressure acted on the sheet pile wall over the diameter (0.9m) of one grout column but was resisted by a width of wall equivalent to three such diameters. The maximum bending moments in the sheet pile wall in all cases appeared at relieving platform level, and came to 1800kNm, 1100kNm and 1480kNm respectively. Those figures are equivalent to 667kNm/m, 404kNm/m and 548kNm/m respectively. The calculations also showed shear forces and deflections. The deflections were only a few millimetres. Mr. Reid concluded that on those assumptions the sheet pile wall would have had a significant reserve of strength amounting to about 100 per cent., i.e. a factor of safety of 2.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The second and third sets of calculations, which related to serviceability loading of the sheet pile wall alone, I can pass over. The fourth set related to ultimate loading of the sheet pile wall alone, dredged to -16.5mCD. That set contained two cases, corresponding to subclauses (a) and (b) of BS 8002:1994 clause 3.2.5. That clause provided that a retaining wall should be designed to be in equilibrium mobilizing a soil strength of the lesser of two quantities, the one defined in subclause (a), and the other defined in subclause (b). Those calculations showed that although the sheet piles could in both cases carry the applied loading, the embedment in front of the wall was deficient by 270kN in case (a), and by 315kN in case (b). Those calculations related to a width of wall of 1.7m. The conclusion was drawn that each grout column would be required to deliver an ultimate shear resistance of 315kN. That was based on the design spacing of 1.7m. The worst case was a spacing of 2.7m, requiring a shear resistance of 500kN.</span>

I have used this on numerous occasions to stabilize landslides, but of course the problem is here that we have a large Goliath crane sitting on top of the quayside relying on this structure and the …..beam…..staying in place. And once we start to see movement, particularly lateral movement, differential lateral movements between the crane well being the seaward side and that of the landward side, we see problem with the cranes and we are talking about millimetres of movements to cause those cranes to become inoperative. So it is quite a serious business relying on these H-piles. They have vertical loading but their principal aim is to support the relieving platform, not to take lateral loading. So if we start to rely on them [sc., to take lateral loading] we are in serious trouble with the serviceability of the structure.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Bracegirdle, using the ICFEP finite element analysis, calculated that the grout wall would be required to withstand a shearing force of 200kN/m at -23mCD. (The relevant graph actually showed a figure of 225kN/m). That calculation was criticized. Mr. Reid calculated that each grout column would be required to deliver an ultimate shear resistance of 315kN. That conclusion appeared at page 13 of the appendix to his expert’s report. It was based on the design spacing between the soilcrete columns of 1.7m, and amounted to 185kN/m. Professor Pavlovic said (day 16, page 26), and I accept, that that was very close to the figure calculated by Haecon. Mr. Reid stated that the figure of 315kN had to be increased in line with actual spacing for the worst case of an average spacing of 2.7m. That led to a required shear resistance of 500kN per column. Mr. Reid expressed the conclusion that collapse as a result of shear rupture was not possible in view of the very high dowel action available from the reinforcing tubes. A pair of reinforcing tubes had a shear resistance of 525kN, according to his calculation and his oral evidence in chief (day 17, pages 54 to 57). As he explained, for that shear resistance to be mobilized, the soilcrete itself would have had to suffer a brittle failure, with lateral displacement of the parts of the soilcrete column above and below the failure surface. It is clear from page 14 of the same appendix that the amount of that displacement would be about 157mm. Mr. Reid did not say at that point whether or not the grout column had sufficient shear capacity apart from the dowel effect mentioned above.</span>

He then referred to an additional load from the soil surrounding the tension side of the column and said that that came to 149kN. Thus the axial load was the sum of the two, 347kN. He then applied clause 3.4.5.12, using equation 6a, and arrived at a shear capacity which, correcting a trivial error, amounts to 549kN.

In Mr. Reid’s calculation, table 3.8 in the standard is used which suggests that a characteristic concrete strength of not less than 25N/mm² is envisaged. Mr. Reid accepted (day 18, page 31) that structural concrete is not expected to have a lower value than that. If the characteristic strength of the soilcrete were taken as 12N/mm², the effect would be to reduce a constant term of 0.45 N/mm² in Mr. Reid’s calculation by a factor of 0.783 to 0.35N/mm².

(That is, indeed, 0.783 X 1.25). In one sense, Mr. Reid conceded too much, since he applied the characteristic strength factor (0.783) to the shear strength of the column, when it should have been applied only to the constant term (independent of axial stress). On the other hand, I reject his justification for removing the material safety factor. He said he was confident he could get 12 as a strength.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Professor Pavlovic set out two graphs in his report showing shear strength per column as a function of axial load. Each graph showed three curves representing different safety factors; one graph related to EC2 and the other related to BS 8110. The latter showed lower shear strengths than the graph for EC2, and was thus, to use his language, more “punitive”. He also set out his calculations. They were all apparently based on the formulae in the standards. The other calculations that he said he performed were not put before the court, nor were their results. As to BS 8110, Professor Pavlovic purported to use equation 6b, but I have been unable to see how he arrived at his result. In EC2, the equations corresponding to equations 6a and 6b are labelled 6.2a and 6.2b respectively. It was 6.2a, not 6.2b, that Professor Pavlovic used. He set out his calculation based on that equation. On the basis of the dimensional data that he used, which were not controversial, I accept that his graph of shear strength as a function of axial load, with no safety factors, is a correct representation of equation 6.2a. With no safety factor, the shear capacity of a column at zero axial load comes out at 474kN. At an axial load of 200kN, it comes out at 504kN. That is close to the figure of 506kN mentioned in paragraph 205 above.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The point made by Mr. Reid was this. While the soilcrete was fluid, there would be a hydrostatic pressure at any given level by reason of the weight of fluid above that level. I accept that. When the soilcrete solidified, that pressure would remain because he could see nothing that would relieve it. I am not satisfied that he is wrong about that. When the soilcrete was fluid, the whole weight of a column of fluid vertically overlying the fluid at a particular level would be borne by the fluid at that level. The weight of any of the overlying fluid in the interstices of the soil at the side surface of the column (where the surface “fluctuates in and out”) would be borne, at least in part, by the soil underlying the fluid in the interstice. Whether the whole, or only a part, of the weight of the fluid in the interstice would be borne by the soil depends upon the shape of the interstice. When the fluid solidifies it thereby becomes capable of bearing shear stresses. So the weight of the soilcrete right across any given level could be borne by the soil that has been supporting the fluid in the interstice. That would relieve pressure on the soilcrete below that level. The elastic forces thereby mobilized would involve some movement of the soilcrete relative to the surrounding soil, notwithstanding that, on the evidence of Mr. Reid (day 17, page 67), there is no change in volume of the soilcrete on solidifying. There is no evidence of such movement. Professor Pavlovic, reluctantly I think, accepted that proposition. Consequently, I accept Mr. Reid’s evidence that the self-weight of the column will be borne as a compressive stress in the column.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Williamson submitted that in determining the shearing capacity of the grout columns a number of factors must be taken into account which Professor Pavlovic had ignored. He invited my attention to a paper by Professor H.P.J.Taylor published in 1970. The conclusion expressed in that paper was that there were three factors which contributed to the shear forces in a reinforced concrete beam, unreinforced in shear. Such a beam, or, in this case, column, is, I accept, analogous to the columns of the grout wall in that the latter have tensile reinforcement but are not reinforced in shear. The three factors were the shear forces carried by the compression zone, those carried by aggregate interlock and those carried by dowel action of the main tensile reinforcement. The compression zone is that part of the cross-section that is in compression as a result of bending. Aggregate interlock comes into play only when the beam is cracked. Aggregate interlock refers to the frictional force between lumps of aggregate in the concrete as they rub together when the parts of the beam separate as the crack widens.</span>

Unfitness is simply non-compliance with that criterion. For the claimant and the part 20 claimant to establish unfitness I have to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities not that the wall will (or would) collapse or be unserviceable, but that the criterion I have mentioned is not satisfied. That inevitably involves applying probabilities to probabilities. The codes can properly be taken into account in deciding whether the criterion is satisfied.</span>

Clearly, one can be more confident about the accuracy in estimating permanent loads (such as, for instance, the self-weight of a floor) than one can in estimating accurately variable loads (e.g. passing traffic on a bridge) – as the word suggests, variability implies a larger degree of uncertainty (and hence potential risk or even danger).</span>

The samples tested were not of standard shapes. In each case, measurements of peak stress were made. The in-situ cube strengths of the samples were calculated from the peak stress by use of a formula provided by BS 1881-120:1983. Concrete (and soilcrete) strengthen with age for a period after casting. The in-situ cube strengths were converted to the 28-day in-situ cylinder strengths by use of the following procedure.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Dr. Greenwood adopted two approaches, both different from those of Professor Pavlovic. In his first approach, Dr. Greenwood estimated the water/cement ratio of the grout. I have extracted the following description from his report, paragraphs C125 et seq. The compressive strength of the mixed product (sc., the soilcrete) is determined by the water/cement ratio almost irrespective of the type, sizes and proportion of the other inert mineral content, i.e. the soil, provided that the mineral is stronger than the grout. That is broadly true of all cement based grouts. The relationship between the water/cement ratio and compressive strength has been established empirically. One such correlation was shown graphically in his figure 11. Figure 11 was a family of curves of compressive strength of cement grouts against water/cement ratio for different ages of the grout from 1 day to 1 year. Its source was Farmer, I.W., (1970) “Design of cement grouts”, an unpublished internal report of the Cementation Company Limited research department. Dr. Greenwood set out in a table four values of unconfined crushing strength of 17, 14, 10 and 10 N/mm². He had obtained those values from the water/cement ratio and the use of Farmer’s curves. He said that the calculated results were at best a guide to expectations based on the chosen parameters.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Dr. Greenwood’s second method was to use the test results referred to above. He said that the strengths of cemented soils and concretes increased rapidly during the first few days after casting. The strength roughly doubles from 3 to 7 days and almost a third again to about 28 days. Thereafter the rate slows: increases to 90 days or more are relatively small. He said that it was usual to compare strengths at the arbitrarily chosen time of 28 days. A more appropriate comparison for mixes of 0.8 to 1.0 water/cement ratios should be made by allowing a one-third increase of strengths recorded for tests at 8 and 13 days and a one-third reduction of test results for samples over 100 days old. It was by that means that he arrived at his 21 results mentioned above, which differ from those calculated by Professor Pavlovic. The mean of Dr. Greenwood’s values of “compressive strength 28 day equivalent” was 15.24N/mm². He stated that the characteristic strength was 12.60N/mm². He did not explain how he arrived at that figure. If one applies to Dr. Greenwood’s figures the European code method adopted by Professor Pavlovic the characteristic strength comes out at 5.44N/mm². That figure is to be compared with Professor Pavlovic’s figure of 5.88N/mm², not with his figure of 7.35N/mm².</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I arrive at the figure of 5.44N/mm² as follows. To calculate the sample standard deviation, one sums the squares of each individual value, and multiplies that sum by the number of values (in this case, 21). One subtracts from that product the square of the sum of the individual values. One divides that difference by the product of the number of entries and that number minus one (i.e. by 21 X 20). The sample standard deviation is the square root of the answer. It comes to 7.17. The rest of the calculation is as explained above.</span>

His final conclusion on strengths, taking into consideration all test results, was that the evidence suggested strengths somewhat higher than anticipated from calculation based on design assumptions. Since, like concretes, the soil cement comprises natural, inherently variable materials, variations in its strength from place to place or sample to sample are expected. A publication of A.M.Neville, Properties of Concrete (1995), showed a linear relationship based on numerous test results between mean test cube strengths for concrete and their standard deviation. For strengths in the range 10 to 15Mpa (N/mm²) the standard deviation was about 0.6Mpa. Dr. Greenwood said (quite rightly, as indicated above) that there would be a larger standard deviation for soilcrete than was typical for concretes. He concluded that the characteristic strength of the soil cement would be expected to lie between 8 and 12Mpa.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">My conclusion is that Dr. Greenwood is thinking as a soil mechanician, and he looks at the average mean strength of the samples used, and that is perfectly reasonable in a geotechnical situation, where you know there will be weaknesses, local weaknesses, in the soil. But the collapse of the structure is an overall collapse. In other words, the whole soil mass will move towards collapse, and it makes sense then to average values. So some are stronger, some are weaker: mean strength makes perfect sense. That is simply not permissible in a structural situation. In a structural situation, you are obliged to have a 95 per cent. probability confidence…..In other words, you must have test data that will support your assumed characteristic strength to the effect that no more than 5 per cent. of samples tested can fall below it. All structural codes require that, and even the new geotechnical code requires that now…..In fact, EC2 says very clearly, for example, and this is for concrete which is much more reliable than soilcrete. For those who don’t want to do any statistics, it is a very simple formula: characteristic strength equals mean strength minus 8. So let’s take the mean strength of what we all agree is around 15, and we get a characteristic strength of 7…..you have to define how you are going to use the soilcrete. And if you are going to use it as a soil mass, then the mean strength is correct. If you are going to use it as a structural beam, then you must use the characteristic strength and looking at…..what Dr. Greenwood has done, and what I have done, we roughly have the same data, we have the same conclusions…..</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. O’Brien considered the question of compressive strength without any explicit reference to characteristic strength. In his report at section 11.2.2 he referred to a population of 34 relevant core samples that had been obtained. The mean ultimate compressive strength of those samples was 15.6Mpa and the standard deviation was 6.6Mpa. Whether that standard deviation was ordinary standard deviation or sample standard deviation does not appear, since the data for the individual samples are not given. Mr. O’Brien said that there were three approaches to selecting a design strength and the associated material factor (to change from a characteristic to a design strength). First, one could assess a “mean” strength, and use a high partial factor on material strength, say 3.0. Second, one could assess a plausible worst credible strength and use a low partial factor on material strength, say 1.0. Third, one could directly consider the statistical variability of the material strength, and derive the design strength from that. He did not evaluate design strengths by either of the first two of those approaches. But since the mean was 15.6, on the first basis the design strength would be 5.2Mpa. On the second basis, a least strength greater than the lowest value of the sample would scarcely be plausible. That lowest value is not stated, but one might take a figure of 5.5Mpa, being the lowest value in the sample used by Professor Pavlovic (Dr. Greenwood’s lowest value was 6.1Mpa). On the third basis, referring to research in Japan (Futaki and Tamura, 2002), Mr. O’Brien used a formula that gave a figure of 7.02Mpa. He said that allowing for a modest strength increase due to age effects would probably lead to a 10 per cent. increase in that design strength. He applied no factor of safety to it. He said nothing else about the ages of the samples in the population. If one applied that third method to Dr. Greenwood’s statistics, the answer would be 5.9 or 6.1MPa, depending on which definition of standard deviation is intended in the formula. The corresponding figures for Professor Pavlovic’s sample would be 6.2 and 6.5. The strength of each sample in Professor Pavlovic’s and in Dr. Greenwood’s populations was adjusted to 28-day strength.</span>

The strength of the soilcrete was likely to reduce below that level by reason of the increase in silt/clay content. For the laminated silts he believed it to be reasonable to assume that the design soilcrete strength was about 60% to 70% of that in the overlying sands, i.e. between about 4.2 and 4.9Mpa.</span>

I conclude that the characteristic strength of the soilcrete was about 7. If one takes Professor Pavlovic’s figure of 7.35, then the shear strength of a column under a compressive stress of 198kN falls from the figure of 504kN (see paragraph 210 above) to 433kN.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">As to the material factor of safety, Professor Pavlovic has, in my judgment, undoubtedly been generous in arriving at a strength of 4MPa after the application of a safety factor. I reach that conclusion disregarding Professor Pavlovic’c points “secondly” to “finally”. I take the characteristic strength as 7.35, so the factor of safety that he has applied is effectively 1.84. Since the strength of the material comes into the calculation of shear strength as a cube root, the effect of the factor of safety is to apply a divisor of the cube root of 1.84, namely 1.225, to that element of the shear strength which is independent of the axial compression, namely 403kN, leading to a figure of 329kN. But EC2 recommends the application of a material factor of safety of 1.5 even in the case of concrete (see section 2.4.2.4 of EC2), which is not to be reduced by taking its cube root. I am entirely satisfied that a factor of safety for soilcrete should be taken which is greater than that recommended for concrete, especially in view of Professor Pavlovic’s second point quoted above (that the strength of the soilcrete is likely to be less at the depth which is relevant for present purposes). Application of a factor of safety of 1.5 to a shear strength of 403kN yields a shear strength of 268 kN. To that figure 30kN has to be added to allow for the axial compression, making a figure of 298kN.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">One of Professor Pavlovic’s graphs based on the EC2 formula was drawn on the basis of the following three safety factors: first, a material factor of 1.5 appropriate to concrete; second, a material factor of 1.15 for steel reinforcement; and third, a load factor of 1.35. His graph based on those factors showed a shear strength at zero axial stress of 230kN. I do not know how he arrived at that figure. He may have performed a more sophisticated calculation than is provided by the EC2 design code. Whether one divides 474kN by the product of those three factors, or by the product of the last two and the cube root of the first, one does not arrive at 230kN. In the former case, one arrives at a figure of 204kN.  In the latter case, one arrives at a figure of 267kN. At this point I am not concerned with load factors, so I shall for the time being ignore the load factor. The strength of the steel reinforcement does not come into the formula since the reinforcement is tensile reinforcement and the formula is given under the heading “Members not requiring design shear reinforcement” in EC2. Thus I shall ignore the steel material factor. On the totality of the evidence I conclude that for the purpose of determining whether the wall is fit for the purpose so far as the shear strength of the columns is concerned, each column must be taken to have a shear strength of 298kN.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Reid countered the argument that the grout wall would fail in shear by propounding the opinion that the wall would act as an arch against transverse forces. One has to imagine a vertical arch resisting transverse forces in the same way as a horizontal arch resists weights (and hence supports objects) placed or moving upon it. The grout wall is not, of course, in the shape of an arch, but the proposition was that the forces within the material would react to the horizontal forces in the same way as an arch would react to vertical forces. An arch, in order to develop its strength, needs to be firmly fixed at its two ends by forces pointing inwards. In the case of an ordinary arch, those forces would be horizontal. But in the case of the arch postulated in the grout wall, they must be vertical, downwards at the top of the arch and upwards at the bottom of the arch.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">One objection to this theory is that the curvature of the grout wall changes direction twice (at least) along its length (an opinion held both by Professor Pavlovic and by Mr. Reid). Mr. Reid said (day 17, page 70; day 18, page 63) that in that case three arches would have to be postulated. The arch in the middle would have its notional concavity facing in the opposite direction to those of the other two arches. It is clear that such an arch would not be sufficiently supported at its ends. Mr. Reid put forward another argument in which there was a single arch, the vertical support being provided by the reaction of the seaward soil to a horizontal point load imposed by the landward soil at the level of the bottom of the sheet piles. Any tendency of the wall to move vertically would be resisted by friction arising from that reaction. That would provide the necessary firm fixing, at any rate at one end of the arch. However, the reaction in question would operate principally at the point where the lateral load was imposed. That is analogous to the load on a horizontal arch being imposed at the end of the arch. The effect of the arch as such is lost. Mr. Reid said this during the course of his cross-examination by Mr. Bowdery (day 23, page 52):</span>

The second such mode was by failure of the soil below the dredge level on the seaward side of the sheet pile wall to resist the pressures imposed on the landward side of the wall. In that scenario, he said, the passive wedge in front of the wall yields and allows the sheet piles to move forward. When that occurs, the grout columns are mobilized to provide additional shear resistance and prevent the wedge of soil behind the sheet piles from translating forward. He considered that the grout columns were indeed sufficient for that purpose, because of the dowel effect</span>

One might suppose that that was evidence that the system would fail if the grout wall could not sustain that shear force. Indeed, Mr. Bracegirdle gave evidence (day 8, page 27) that the VHP wall did not have enough strength to sustain the loads imposed upon it by the proposed dredge to -16.5mCD. I would interpret Mr. Reid’s opinion as merely asserting that the grout wall would sustain the shear loading that he calculated would be imposed upon it.

I have looked at residual capacity…..of the steel tubes…..and the restraint they might provide if this failure was to take place, and what I found was they were capable of providing about 180 or 190kN/m as a restraining force.

Second, if it were the case that there would be no land slip even if the grout wall were not there, I cannot accept that placing the grout wall there would cause it to be subjected to stresses that it could not sustain. If the soil is itself strong enough to resist the tendency to slip, it would not impose any shear strain on the grout wall, apart perhaps from a small effect caused by introducing the wall itself, since the soil would already be stable. Hence there would be no significant shear stress on the wall. Putting the matter another way, if there were no risk of the soil slipping, there would be no point in introducing the grout wall.</span>

Under sub-artesian conditions a factor of safety greater than one would be achieved if the basal sand layer mobilises a friction angle greater than about 31 degrees, once the interbedded nature of the overlying soils is allowed for. If Mr. Bracegirdle’s simplified soil profile is assumed, then the basal sand strength needs to be about c´=5 and φ´=36° for the overall factor of safety to exceed 1.0 under sub-artesian conditions.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In what follows, I refer to the friction angle (angle of shearing resistance) φ (φ´ means effective friction angle) and cohesion c (c´ means effective cohesion). Whilst different kinds of soil have to be treated in different ways in calculations, for the purposes of this part of this judgment, the following can be assumed: (1) The greater the angle φ, other things being equal, the greater the strength of the soil; (2) the greater the value of c, other things being equal, the greater the strength of the soil. In particular, the greater the angle φ, the less the active pressure coefficient and the greater the passive pressure coefficient. Putting the matter simply, the stiffer or stronger the soil, the less likely it is to push a wall over, and the more effective it will be in supporting the wall against being pushed over.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In his exhibit X38, Mr. O’Brien plotted a putative profile of a global failure surface through the soil passing through a level of -21mCD at its lowest point. That was drawn to illustrate his proposition that there would be a factor of safety greater than 1.0 if the stratum below -18mCD had a friction angle φ greater than 31°. It showed a dredge level of -16.0mCD. Mr. Jones put to Mr. Bracegirdle that if you dredge down another half metre, that might reduce the safety factor by about 3 per cent. He replied:</span>

That profile represented a factor of safety which Mr. O’Brien had calculated as 1.247. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that a figure of at least 3 per cent. is about right in all similar cases. The factor of safety in the X38 profile was expressed to be 1.010. Thus if dredging to the level -16.5mCD were allowed for, the factor of safety would be not more than about 0.98 as calculated by Mr. O’Brien in that instance. Mr. O’Brien, however, considered that the friction angle was greater than 31° at the relevant level.</span>

So for example, the failure mechanism Mr. Reid investigated is different to what I have been looking at in terms of global stability. So what I was trying to look at in terms of global stability was the sort of failure mechanism that Mr. Bracegirdle was postulating, which is this large global, almost circular slip. So that’s a different type of mechanism altogether to even the mechanism that I was looking at using Wallop or the mechanism Mr. Reid has been looking at in his calculations.</span>

So in terms of the other analyses I have looked at, when you just look at out-of-balance earth pressures, the demand [at] depth is much, much lower. So you know, you can’t confuse the different types of deformation and failure mechanisms, they are very, very different and the demands on the wall are very, very different. If you had global failure at great depth there would be large shear demands, but in terms of my analyses it shows that that type of global mechanism couldn’t develop. If that type of mechanism doesn’t develop then the demands on the wall at depth are much, much lower.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I cannot accept that the risk even of a global failure is negligible, having regard to the factor of safety of less than one even for a friction angle of 31°. Mr. Reid explained in his report (appendix, sheet 7) that he was considering a different mechanism. Although it involved consideration of the global surroundings, it was a study of the balance of forces and identified the extent to which the passive resistance in front of the sheet pile wall was deficient in carrying the ultimate loading applied. A diagram of the mode of failure in question appears as the third illustration (bottom left) in figure 3 at page 22 of the British Standard to which Mr. Reid referred (BS 8002:1994). It would certainly involve local movement of the land, but is to be distinguished, as Mr. O’Brien did, from overall global slip. I do not understand Mr. O’Brien’s remarks about the demands on the wall being “much lower” as being intended as a comment on, or as disagreement with, Mr. Reid’s evidence. If I am wrong, then I prefer the evidence of Mr. Reid.</span>

Those same parameters were used by Haecon in their design to represent the soil below -18mCD. I do not accept that they are “worst credible” values, but they are cautious estimates. Professor Pavlovic gave evidence, and I accept, that an action factor of safety of 1.35 should be applied, that is a factor of safety in relation to the imposed forces. No mention has been made of the application of any action factor of safety in the ICFEP analysis. It seems from a remark of Mr. Bracegirdle (day 13, page 12) with reference to a run of the program which has not been put before me that a factor of safety had to be applied to the result, that no factor of safety was included in the program.

He calculated that the bond stress, by which he meant the stress tending to break the bond, was 1Mpa (i.e. 1N/mm²), whereas Haecon had determined that the columns should have a designed bond strength of only 0.6Mpa, having calculated that the bond stress would not exceed 0.43Mpa. Thus the design was defective. Mr. Williamson submitted, and I accept, that the relevant comparator to the bond stress was not the design bond strength but the actual bond strength.</span>

Professor Pavlovic (day 6, page 138) agreed with the figure of one-tenth. In cross-examination he referred to a grout strength of 11.3Mpa which had been determined in experiments carried out by Professor England and Dr. Tsang of Imperial College. Those experiments had been instigated by Professor Pavlovic and were reported as Appendix 6 to his expert’s report. The purpose of the experiments was not to determine the bond, but the report in appendix 6 contained a reference to the grout/steel bond being impaired by channels created by flow of water as the grout “bled”. Professor Pavlovic’s primary point, however, was that the bond between the grout and the soilcrete had not been determined.

The two columns constituting a combined double column were grouted at different times. Dr. Greenwood was concerned with the adhesion of the newly grouted column to the column where the grout had gone some way, or all the way, to solidifying. He concluded that for a compressive strength of 15Mpa there would be a bond strength for a “cold” soil cement (i.e. soilcrete) joint of about 3Mpa.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">It was said that it was no longer the practice to consider local bond stress, because of anchorage. If a reinforcing bar in concrete is bent round at the end it is thereby anchored into the concrete. It takes a large force to pull it out of the concrete against the hook. The force required to pull it out is the anchorage force. The anchorage length or equivalent anchorage length, though not defined in any document that has been put before me, appears to be the length of a straight reinforcing bar that would require the same force to pull it out. Be that as it may, the standards no longer require the calculation of local bond stress because of the general experience of anchorage. Eurocode 2 (EC2; BS EN 1992-1-1:2004), which relates to concrete structures, provides in section 8.4.2, headed Ultimate bond stress, a requirement of principle that the ultimate bond strength shall be sufficient to prevent bond failure.

If you look at EC2, EC2 assumes anchorage stresses become zero as soon as you exceed a value of 132mm; this bar is gargantuan: 168. So what the code says, there is a linear decrease in bond strength. At 132mm, it becomes zero. Clearly, it is not going to be zero, but it is a diplomatic way of saying you can’t rely on bond for such large bars. So one can’t check anchorage using EC2. However, I have also looked at – I agree anchorage is essential – I have looked at both ends of the pile. Anchorage stresses are bond stresses but at the end of the beam, if I can put it that way, local bond stresses are throughout the beam. They’re all important, but I would agree anchorage is more important. Why more important? They are more onerous, and if you satisfy anchorage stresses, usually you satisfy bond stresses. That is why the code makes that simplification…..</span>

No, because I have looked at EC2, which is a leading code agreed to be by far the most sophisticated code so far, and there is no point in calculating anchorage lengths if the bond strength is zero, and the reason for that is that all these formulas you quote are for normal bars. Bars of 1, 2 – 1, 2, 3cm maximum, not 16. There is no data….there are no tests, the code never envisaged these huge bars. Nobody knows what the bond strength or the anchorage length of these bars is.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Reid said (day 17, page 82) that because of its large surface area (sc., per unit length) the tube was equivalent to a 52mm bar in bond terms. In strength terms, it was equivalent to a 91mm bar. I think Mr. Reid’s reasoning must have been as follows. The cross-sectional area of the steel of the tube reinforcement was 6874mm². The diameter of a solid bar of the same cross-sectional area is 93½mm, say 91mm. Applying a diameter of 91mm in the formula in EC2 section 8.4.2 yields a value of (η2) equal to 0.41. Increasing that figure in proportion to the curved surface areas per unit length (i.e. in proportion to the diameters) of the tube and of the 93½mm bar, that is, in the ratio of 168.3 to 93½, yields a value of (η2) equal to 0.738, giving φ=58.2mm, say 52mm. I may be doing Mr. Reid an injustice by attributing that reasoning to him, but it is fallacious. It is true that the bond strength in terms of force, for any given bond strength in terms of stress, will increase in proportion to surface area. But the strength in terms of tension or compression has nothing to do with the bond strength. I reject Mr. Reid’s evidence that in bond terms the reinforcement is equivalent to a 50mm bar.</span>

Composite action greatly increases the bending moment capacity of the VHP columns. Professor Pavlovic said that loss of composite action results in a clear bending failure. Loss of composite action can occur if the diameters of the columns are substantially less than the design diameter, or if the axes of the two columns forming the pair are not parallel. Any error in positioning of the initial point of the drilling can also affect the outcome. It appears from Professor Pavlovic’s report, though the matter has not been the subject of comment, that loss of composite action actually increases the shear strength of the pair of columns (assuming any given diameter). The question of failure of the wall in bending, as opposed to shear, has not been pursued before me in the evidence and I shall not consider it.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">As designed, the maximum overlap between the two members of a pair was 200mm, since the design diameter of each column was 900mm and the design separation of their central axes was 700mm. There is no direct evidence of the diameters achieved. The parties’ experts were at one in considering that the diameters would be likely to be less than 900mm at depth. Their views were not widely divergent. Mr. Bracegirdle considered it highly unlikely that the diameters would exceed 800mm, and the likely diameter was probably about 600 to 800mm. Dr Greenwood considered that the diameter could fall to 800mm at the toe of the columns, but might be in excess of 900mm at a depth of -10mCD. Mr. O’Brien suggested 750mm to 850mm.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">A spirit level had been used to assist in making the columns vertical. Dr. Greenwood considered that a spirit level could have been used which would, in practice, give an accuracy of 1 in 250. He concluded that the deviation was likely generally to be much less than 100mm for “first phase” treatments and less than 150mm for “second phase treatments”. The latter would apply, in particular, at a depth of about -20mCD for the work done after the system of making each column of a pair in two passes had been adopted. The figures of 100mm and 150mm allowed for error in the initial placing of the drill. Clause 8.4.3 of EN12716:2001 allows a tolerance of 50mm in the drilling starting point. Dr. Greenwood considered that that was reasonably attainable in normal working circumstances, but not generous. He said that he would expect that positioning the drill rig to the point marked out by surveyors would be within that standard tolerance but not necessarily by much margin.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">If one column is vertical, the maximum displacement between its axis and that of its pair at -20mCD is likely to be 150mm. If that occurs, and if the diameters of the two columns are 800mm at that depth, then the separation between the columns will be 50mm. If the deviation of the inclined column were in a direction making an angle within ±127.4° of the line joining the intended centres at the top, the axes would be not more than 800mm apart at that depth, and there would not be complete loss of composite action. If the deviation of the inclined column were at a random direction relative to the line joining the intended centres at the top, the probability that there would be complete loss of composite action at a depth of -20mCD would be about 29 per cent. (2 X 52.6/360). What is perhaps more likely in any given case is that each column deviates from its intended position by 75mm at the depth mentioned. That leads to a corresponding probability of about 12 per cent. The calculation is set out in appendix 4 to this judgment. It is a rough calculation, precision not being justified by the imprecision of the data. Other combinations of pairs of deviations from intended axes from 0mm, 0mm to 150mm, 150mm are also possible. The calculation depends on two assumptions: that all angles of deviation from the intended position are equally likely, and that the probabilities of the directions of the deviations of the two members of a pair are mutually independent. In my judgment, those are reasonable assumptions. There is no reason to suppose that any errors in positioning or verticality of the two members of a pair of columns are other than random or are interdependent, nor has the contrary been suggested. There is, in my judgment, in view of the figures given by Dr. Greenwood, a substantial probability that the sum of the deviations (whatever their directions) of the members of a pair of columns will equal or exceed 100mm. I conclude that it is highly likely that several columns have lost their composite action at-20mCD.</span>

I would accept that if there were only a small number of columns, the statistical evidence, whatever answer it produced, might well be insufficient to enable the court to make a finding. But here there are 412 columns and I am well satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there must be several instances of loss of composite action. Whether the effect of that in the event of further dredging is likely to be a complete collapse of the wall, or local deformation to an unacceptable or an acceptable extent does not appear. But in my judgment, a wall such as the present where several of the columns have lost their composite action at the relevant level and others have diminished shear resistance and bending moment capacity cannot be regarded as fit for its purpose.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">I am satisfied that the grouting works were not fit for their purpose in that they caused cracking and bulging or further bulging of the sheet pile wall. The question arises whether that was a result of the design of the works. If the consequence was confined to instances when the annulus was blocked and grout or soilcrete pressure on the back of the sheet pile wall rose substantially above hydrostatic pressure plus the pressure required to drive the effluent up the annulus, then I would not attribute the consequence to design. When blockages occurred and there was continuous fluid between the vicinity of the monitor and a substantial area of the sheet pile wall, it was necessary almost instantaneously to lift the monitor. If there was not continuous fluid, there would be some period of grace. The length of that period is not in evidence. Whilst there may well have been such occasions when the monitor was not lifted in time, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there were. I am satisfied that the consequence could occur in the absence of such blockages and in such a case the consequence is attributable to the design. However, the evidence is insufficient to enable me to decide which is the more probable: (a) that there were occasions when the monitor was not lifted in time, or (b) that there were no such occasions. Thus I am not satisfied that this aspect of the unfitness of the works for their purpose is attributable to the design of the works.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Williamson’s point here is, I think, that ABP do not state that remedial work prior to further dredging is rendered necessary by the distortion of the sheet piles. But it must be implicit in the view expressed by Mr. Reid and Mr. O’Brien (though this item as such was not put to them) that whatever the cause, it was the pre-existing condition of the sheet pile wall that necessitated the remedial works. Thus its condition after the grouting, being, to say the least, no better than it was before, must also on this view have necessitated the remedial works. I do not regard this agreement as removing from controversy in relation to the fitness for purpose issue the question of the cause of the configuration that the sheet pile wall bore after grouting.

Mr. Foster did not give evidence, but it may well have been Mr. O’Brien who agreed the proposition. It seems that all the relevant experts contemplated the possibility (though perhaps only hypothetically) that the sheet pile wall could have had an adequate factor of safety initially and yet been pushed out of shape by the grout pressure. But given that it had undoubtedly been pushed out of shape, its initial factor of safety appears to be irrelevant to the rest of the proposition. Moreover, it is not entirely clear what is meant by the grout wall operating as intended, since it was intended to operate in concert with the sheet pile wall.

So at that stage, in the very early stage, we got opinions on the structure to see whether that would be adequate. All my analyses all the way through have shown that, if the structure itself were adequate, then the strength of the works would be adequate. (Day 15, pages 14, 15).</span>

The claim was for an additional payment of £303,424.97 exclusive of VAT. The amount has now been agreed at £69,653.12, subject to proof of liability. The basis of the claim is that the extra thickness of concrete constituted a physical condition or artificial obstruction which was not reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor. It is common ground that HSS had to drill through thicknesses of between 250mm and 2400mm of concrete in addition to the 600mm thickness of the coping beam for which HSS made allowance in its price.</span>

I have looked at the same drawings and I came to the conclusion that it would be a strong possibility, because of the difficulty in back-filling between a very awkward area, where you have service culverts and things, that you have a cast concrete wall next to a sheet pile wall, and somehow or other you have got to get shuttering in there, take the shuttering out, put the back-filler in and then do the rest. It is much easier just to form a block of concrete and then cast the beam up against that. It is much easier.</span>

An experienced contractor would see from the drawings that the designer’s intention was that the beam would be conventionally shuttered That this was the designer’s intention is now confirmed by documents disclosed by ABP that record that John Laing, the original contractor, made a claim for additional payment for the use of mass concrete.

It may mean handed to the contractor without any request on the part of the contractor, or it may mean available for inspection on request. The relevant documents were not handed to HSS without request, but I there is no reason to think that ABP would not have allowed the contractor access to the archive if it had been asked. Mr. Brown had told tenderers of its existence. In the context, namely “all information whether obtainable by [the Contractor] or made available by the Employer”, I think the words must bear the latter meaning. The information was available and had been made so by the Employer. But HSS was unaware of it.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">However, the question I have to decide is whether the claim falls within clause 12(1). The concrete in question was undoubtedly a physical condition or artificial obstruction. By common consent, and indeed on the pleadings, although the drawing was not labelled “As built”, it was apparent that it was issued for the purpose of constructing the works, and that both HSS and ABP understood it generally to represent the structure of the quay wall. In my judgment, once it had been decided that the VHP columns would require drilling through the coping beam, (and that would have required 412 drillings instead of 24 as originally envisaged), an experienced contractor would carefully consider the implications of drawing 2015/133C. He would ask himself how much drilling would be likely to be required, especially given the size of the job. I am impressed by the evidence of Mr. Bracegirdle. An experienced contractor would be able to deduce, as he did, that the original contractor might well have found it convenient and economic to use mass concrete beneath the coping beam. Notwithstanding the drawing, an experienced contractor in my judgment would at least make enquiries of the employer whether the employer had information on the subject, or would have carried out an investigation using a percussive drill or some other method. This contract is framed in terms onerous to the contractor, but I must give full effect to clause 12. The question is could the mass concrete reasonably have been foreseen by an experienced contractor. I have stated above what in my opinion an experienced contractor would do. But even if I am wrong, an experienced contractor could, I am satisfied, have adopted the reasoning of Mr. Bracegirdle or otherwise have appreciated the risk of the existence of the mass contract. Thus he could reasonably have foreseen it. This claim fails. I am far from saying that an experienced contractor would necessarily do that of which I have found him capable. Under pressure of competition, or in the hope of making a successful claim, he might be willing to take the risk. But in my judgment the drawing would not so set the mind of an experienced contractor at rest as to give him a false sense of security so that he did not appreciate the risk.</span>

ABP’s and HSS’s experts, Mr. Bracegirdle and Dr. Greenwood, agreed, under the heading of grout disposal, that the volume of raw effluent was approximately 10,000m³, and that that figure could have been calculated at the time of tender. For ease of pumping, water was added to the raw effluent, making it into a slurry. That accounted for the fact that the total volume disposed of was more than double the figure of 10,000m³.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> December 2001 the parties met. Mr. Brown’s manuscript note of that meeting mentions disposal cost of inert grout of £8 a tonne, density 1.75 tonnes/m³, cost £14/m³; not inert £13 to £20/tonne. It also states “5000m³ calculated amount”. The disposal costs mentioned in the note are equivalent to £22.75 to £35/m³. Mr. Brown gave the following evidence, which I accept. At the meeting, Mr. van der Eecken again explained his method of calculating the figure of 4400m³ before rounding the figure up to 5000m³ to allow for contingencies. Mr. Brown felt that Mr. van der Eecken had reassured him as to the maximum volume of grout for disposal, but he recognized that the price given by Mr. van der Eecken had been based on a verbal quotation and he wanted HSS to confirm its price in writing. The two men discussed the question whether HSS could confirm the surplus grout disposal rate at £20/m³. Mr. Brown gave to the court examples from his own experience of £9/m³ at the relevant time and £11 and £12/m³ currently. At the meeting, Mr. van der Eecken explained that the reason the quote was seemingly expensive was that the landfill operators had not been convinced that the surplus grout would be inert. Mr. van der Eecken stated that for inert material disposal costs would be £8 per tonne, and that for material not classed as inert the cost of disposal could range from £13 to £20 per tonne. It was agreed at the meeting that the disposal costs should be based on the surplus grout being considered to be contaminated. As no sample could be provided to the landfill operator until the start of the works there could be no prospect of confirming a lower rate prior to contract. Mr. Brown was confident that the surplus grout would not be classified as contaminated as there was little or no possibility of there being a contaminant in the ground to be grouted.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Williamson submitted that the sum of £110,000 could not be a provisional sum as defined in the contract, since (1) the sum was not a contingency for works which might not be carried out: the surplus grout was necessarily going to require disposal; and (2) the disposal of grout was not to be at the direction and discretion of the Engineer. Moreover, he submitted, the parties could not have intended the sum to be a maximum since they contemplated that the cost of £20/m³ could well have been exceeded and the volume of 5000m³ could have been exceeded. I reject the latter submission. Having regard to Mr. van der Eecken’s calculation, it must at the least have been in the contemplation of reasonable parties that 5000m³ was a likely upper limit to the volume of grout. And the figure of £20/m³ was generous for inert grout, which Mr. Brown considered was the likely description of the grout. It is clear on the evidence of Mr. van der Eecken (day 4, pages 6 and 7) that in the event, the cost paid to the landfill contractor was only £8.67/m³. Mr. van der Eecken said:</span>

I accept Mr. Williamson’s point (2), however. The expression “provisional sum” in this context cannot mean exactly what it means in clause 1(1)(l) of the contract.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> April 2002 HSS sent a fax to ABP asking for an urgent meeting to discuss a temporary method of grout disposal involving the use of skips. A meeting was held the same day. At that meeting David Holt of Southampton Container Terminals (“SCT”) suggested a location for the skips at the back of SCT’s offices. Mr. Voorhuis, the project manager, said “It sounds perfect”. Ms. Bellardinelli’s note of the meeting records that Mr. Voorhuis, Mr. Holt and she visited the potential storage site. It says “The site looks perfect for our plans”. The whole of Ms. Bellardinelli’s notes appear to be conscientiously and efficiently prepared. I am satisfied that the expression “The site looks perfect for our plans” records something that was said by one of those persons, presumably Mr. Voorhuis. The evidence given by Mr. van der Eecken in his witness statement was that the area was suitable as a temporary storage area, but it was more than 500m away from the VHP locations and it was therefore not possible to pump the grout effluent. I am satisfied from Mr. Brown’s plan GWB1 that the area in question was located largely, about four-fifths, within the 500m radius. In examination in chief (day 3, page 87), Mr. van der Eecken gave a different reason why that area was unsuitable for pumping. He said:</span>

HSS had requested of ABP an area of 400m² for the grout batching plant. Mr. Brown gave evidence that the extent of that area was 2500m² which, he said, would have been adequate for a far larger number of skips than were actually used by HSS. And, he said, there was an unused underground conduit from the quay wall to that area which could have been used to service the area.

Water would be added to the surplus grout to allow it to be pumped to that retaining structure. But additional space would be required and it would have to be within pumping distance of the works. Mr. Voorhuis was estimating that there would be up to 1500m³ of surplus grout per week and that a structure with at least 3000m³ capacity was required. Mr. Brown found a solution to the problem later the same day. He made available an area behind berth 109 where there were a number of large underground tanks where surplus grout could be stored. The area was about 2km by road from berth 205. The tanks were then being used to stockpile glass cullet. HSS cleared the area of glass cullet, the tanks were excavated and the skips were then decommissioned. The volume of the tanks, however, was less than 3000m³. On 29</span>

The advantages of the silos in Mr. van der Eecken’s opinion was that they occupied a relatively small amount of space on the quay wall and they could be moved by crane within the working area. In addition, HSS hired tankers and concrete mixer trucks to transport the surplus grout from the silos to the storage tanks located behind berth 109. Large quantities of water were added to the grout in the silos to ensure that it remained in liquid form prior to its transfer to the tanks. That led to additional costs.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr. Williamson’s argument was that the quoted sum of £77,616 was agreed on the basis that ABP would provide a suitable storage area within 500m of the grouting works for temporary storage and hardening of the grout before off-site disposal. If and to the extent that that was not provided, the additional expense would “therefore” be borne by ABP. In the circumstances, when considering quantum, it was necessary to do so on the basis that the £77,616 was subject to adjustment by reason of the non-provision of a suitable disposal area within the vicinity of the works.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The legal basis of Mr. Williamson’s argument was not stated. The claim as pleaded is under clauses 12 and 52 of the contract and “Further and in the alternative, the Engineer has wrongfully refused to certify the aforesaid sums and/or ABP has wrongfully refused to pay such sums claimed and HSS and/or DIUK claim the same by way of damages”. Clause 12 is the clause relating to unforeseeable physical conditions or artificial obstructions. It clearly has no place in the present argument. Clause 52 relates to variations. But the disposal of surplus grout, though additional to the tender, was part of the original agreement. Therefore it did not constitute a variation. There remains to be considered the further and alternative argument. It must entail a duty on the part of ABP, in the events which happened, to pay to HSS the costs incurred by HSS in disposing of surplus grout, whatever those costs might be.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The basis of the claim must, I think, be one or both of the following. First, that it was a term of the contract, sounding in damages, that ABP would provide a suitable area for grout dumping. Second, that the price of £77,616 included in the contract sum was conditional upon such provision, and that in the absence of such provision the price for grout disposal would be at large.

At that point it is clear that a 500m limit was not a necessary feature of the method.

Whilst no mention is made of barge or trucks, in my judgment the reference to pumping equipment does not imply the 500m limit. If I am wrong about that, then I would accept that the offer was made on the basis submitted by Mr. Williamson, namely that a suitable area within that limit would be provided. I do not accept that it follows from that that if such area were not provided, the sum payable would be at large. That is inconsistent with the terms actually agreed by 19</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Thus HSS’s grout disposal claim fails in point of law. But I find the 2500m² grout batching plant area to have been an area located within 500m of the jetting operation. The balance of the area, amounting to about 2100m², outside the grout batching plant I find to have been suitable for pumping surplus grout there for the purpose of dumping, though not for prolonged storage of surplus grout. HSS could have asked, but did not ask, for that area to be made available for the purpose of dumping surplus grout. That area was made available when asked for, and there is nothing to suggest that it would not have been made available when asked for if it had been asked for earlier. I am not satisfied that it would not have been. Thus if I am wrong in holding that there was no term or condition that ABP make available a suitable area within 500m of the jetting area, I am not satisfied that there was any breach of such term or non-fulfilment of that condition.</span>

I have carried out an exercise similar to that mentioned in paragraph 285 above on the hypothesis that the diameters at depth of the columns of a pair were 900mm as designed. I have taken the example of two deviations each of 130mm: the results are set out in Appendix 5. The probability of loss of composite action in that case comes out at approximately 9 per cent. It must be borne in mind that for any possibility of loss of composite action the sum of the individual deviations of the columns must be at least 200mm in this case. I find that the probability of that is rather remote. I am not satisfied that 3(a) would have caused any loss of composite action but for 3(b).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">This table relates to a horizontal plane at about -20mCD. Consider the points at which the axes of two columns of a VHP column pair cut that plane, and the points at which the intended axes (vertical) of those two columns would have cut that plane. The distance of each actual point from its corresponding intended point is taken as 75mm. The line joining the two points of each pair I call the deviation. The angle θ(1) is the angle between the deviation of column 1 and the line joining the intended point of column 2 to the intended point of column 1, produced. The angle θ(2) is the angle between the deviation of column 2 and the line joining the intended point of column 1 and the intended point of column 2. The range of θ(2) is the range of angles θ(2) such that the distance s between the two actual axes ≥ 800mm. P[θ(n)] is the probability that the angle θ(n) will lie within the range shown. It is assumed that all directions of displacement are equally probable, so that the probability is proportional to the range. The problem is symmetrical in this sense, that P[θ(1)] = P[360°-θ(1)], and the value of θ(2) corresponding to 360°–θ(1) is 360° minus the value of θ(2) corresponding to θ(1). The last column gives the probability that s≥800mm. The total probability is approximately 12 per cent. It is assumed that the probabilities of the directions of the deviations are mutually independent.</span>
