For both the new call centre and the existing centres, Sky requested that the responses should include milestone plans showing “key commitment and decision dates” and also show “detail within each key project phase (i.e. design, build, test, integrate, accept and implement)”.    </p>

Our estimating process makes use of  Function Points and has been independently assessed by the Guild of Function Point Analysts, who approved of our approach. A Function Point is a unit of measure used as an indication of relative size of a software development in terms of the amount of business functionality delivered to the end user. For each discrete logical functional component of the required system the inputs, outputs and entities are counted and weightings applied to establish a function point count. Totalling the function points across all the identified functions then derives the function point count for the system. Schedule estimation then makes use of the function point count and productivity rate estimates to derive manday estimates.</span>” </p>

He had been working in the Contact Centre practice of SHL from October 1998 until EDS bought SHL in 1999. As a result he moved to an EDS subsidiary, Centrobe, responsible for Customer Relation Management and other related areas. In late 1999 there was a reorganisation within EDS and Centrobe ceased to exist. Instead EDS set up a CRM Practice within the e.solutions line of business for the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Joe Galloway became Managing Director of that CRM Practice, reporting to Barry Yard, the UK head of e.solutions who, in turn reported to Steve Leonard, the head of e.solutions in the EMEA region. He had been involved in an upgrade for the Thomas Cook CRM Project in 1999 whilst at SHL and had come into contact with Mike Hughes. In early 2000 he was contacted by Mike Hughes and this led to EDS being sent the ITT for the Sky CRM Project. Joe Galloway was the mastermind for EDS’ Response to the ITT which was presented to Sky on 1 June 2000 and was closely involved in all subsequent developments. He left EDS in December 2000 to form a CRM consultancy, ITIVITI. A number of staff from the EDS CRM Practice also joined ITIVITI. He later was employed by EDSC in the US from 2006 as an IT consultant but was dismissed from that role during the course of this trial in circumstances which are set out below.    </p>

He said that he attended Concordia College whilst he was employed by BSG/Alliance IT working on a project on St John for Coca Cola, which required him to be based for the majority of his time on St John. He said that he travelled to and from St John by plane, flying into and out of the island.

Such a lie might have had a limited effect on credibility and might be explicable on the basis that Joe Galloway wished to bolster his academic qualifications and was embarrassed about the way he did it. However his dishonesty did not stop at that. He then gave perjured evidence about the MBA, including repeatedly giving dishonest answers about the circumstances in which he gained his MBA and worked in St John on a project for Coca Cola. In doing so, he gave his evidence with the same confident manner which he adopted in relation to his other evidence about his involvement in the Sky CRM Project. He therefore demonstrated an astounding ability to be dishonest, making up a whole story about being in St John, working there and studying at Concordia College.

The fact that the 12 July email contained no reference to an attachment is irrelevant as it is not always the case that the name of an attachment is recorded in the text of an email. The fact that John Chan sent Barry Yard a copy of the rate card from 11 July 2000 rather than the updated rate card is consistent with the fact that John Chan and the other intended recipients of the 12 July email had not received that email.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">The 12 July email has a number of features which make it unusual. First, it was not received by Keith Russell or Gary Gordon, according to the email of 26 July 2000 and does not appear to have been received by John Chan. Secondly, it lacks any sign that there was an attachment either in the form of an Icon or text “<span style="font-style:italic">&lt;&lt;MP Chord Third Pass Revised 12 July.xls&gt;&gt;</span>”. Whilst Joe Galloway was correct to state that the way in which attachments are shown varies, there is usually an indication on the face of the email that there was an attachment. Equally on 26 July 2000 John Chan had to add in the attachment because it had obviously not come from the email chain from Joe Galloway. Thirdly, whilst the title to the 12 July email of “<span style="font-style:italic">Spreadsheet</span>” would be explicable on the basis that Joe Galloway was copying and pasting an email into the chain the context is strange. It would be expected that Joe Galloway would forward the email sent by him on 12 July at 10:11 and include his apology rather than creating a completely new email with a subject matter “<span style="font-style:italic">Spreadsheet</span>”. That is obviously what he did on 26 July because of the use of “<span style="font-style:italic">FW: EDS Revised Rate Card 11-7-00.xls</span>” as the subject heading. Equally on 26 July when he “forwarded” the 12 July email he adopted the unusual method of copying and pasting the email rather than forwarding the email with a subject heading “<span style="font-style:italic">FW: Spreadsheet</span>”. Fifthly, if the “<span style="font-style:italic">MP Chord Third Pass Revised 12 July.xls</span>” was seen on 20 July 2000 as the relevant commercial rate card then it would have been expected that John Chan, who created it, would have been aware of it and sent it to Barry Yard or that Joe Galloway would have identified that to John Chan as the relevant document or immediately have picked up that John Chan was sending the wrong rate card to Barry Yard when copied into that email.     </p>

Having come to the conclusion that I have about his conduct in relation to the Concordia MBA and the evidence that he gave in court, I have no hesitation in finding that Joe Galloway simply created the 12 July email to cover his error in the hope that he could convince everyone that he had spotted the error at the time and dealt with it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Sky say that the question of whether he had used his Yahoo account was relevant to the issue of whether Joe Galloway had deliberately concealed the email. Sky say this, in turn, raised the question whether it was possible for him to have accessed his Yahoo account if it had not been used at all since late 2000. He confirmed in his evidence on Day 40 that the account was an ordinary free Yahoo account as opposed to some other account. Sky obtained and put to him the statement as to policy in relation to dormant accounts, from the current Yahoo.com website and from an archived version of the website from October 2000. The 2000 document stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">dormant accounts are deactivated</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">at the end of four months. A dormant account is one which has not</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">been logged in to over a four-month period, regardless of whether or</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">not email has been received in the account during that time.

Sky submit that on this basis, given that Joe Galloway did successfully access the account in November 2007 it is impossible for that account to have been accessed last some seven years before because the account would have been long dormant and its contents irrecoverably deleted. Sky say that the email address must have  remained in sufficiently regular use by him throughout the period from 2000 to November 2007 for it not to become dormant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">I have to say that I did not find his explanation when faced with the material from Yahoo on dormant accounts at all convincing. Further the letters from EDS’ solicitors show that their investigations have provided no support for what he was saying. I regret that I simply do not believe his evidence that he had not had access to the email account since 2000. This was another case where he made up what on the face of it was a potential explanation to cover his statement that he had not had access when that explanation on further investigation could not be supported. However, I can deal shortly with Sky’s submission that his use of the Yahoo account was somehow intended to conceal from EDS what he was saying to Sky and was done in the knowledge that what he was saying was a lie. I do not accept that submission and agree with EDS that the submission does not stand scrutiny. Joe Galloway had also sent his letter to Richard Freudenstein of 18 June 2000 via his personal Yahoo email account, with a copy to Steve Leonard. The context for the letter of 5 July 2000 was Mike Hughes’ request to send a letter to Richard Freudenstein as part of “a final push” and the content of that email did not, on Sky’s case, go as far as the statement in Joe Galloway's email of 11 July 2000 which was copied to people at Sky and EDS. Rather I consider it inherently likely that, as many people did in 2000 and still do today, Joe Galloway used his personal email address when either working from home or travelling, because of difficulties in gaining access to his  EDS email account on the EDS servers. </p>

Her evidence was not supported by the witness statement of Penny Hicks or by the evidence of Richard Durling. Equally, though, this would not establish that Joe Galloway made the “car park” comment on 12 October 2000.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">However for the following reasons I have come to the conclusion that Scott Mackay’s evidence is to be preferred. Whilst, as I say, his evidence has to some extent been coloured or influenced by his involvement in the litigation, that is entirely different to making up an elaborate story which, on any view, whilst relevant is not of central importance. Furthermore, in relation to the reference to Joe Galloway’s girlfriend and martial arts, that reference is entirely accurate and could have been said. The only issue would be that of timing. Based on Joe Galloway’s evidence of timing, he only met the girlfriend later in October 2000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in;text-indent:0.00in">However,  it is clear  that after 12 October 2000 he had little involvement with Joe Galloway and it is therefore unlikely that Scott Mackay mistook the conversation for a later one or is recalling matters which he heard about later. That timing aspect is crucial. Whilst in other circumstances mistakes about timing might be attributed to lack of memory of dates, given my view of Joe Galloway I have no difficulty in finding that he has created the timing issue to cover what he said at the time. </p>

He also tended to be more discursive in his answers which at times was not helpful to a proper understanding of the issue or his evidence. Many of his calculations were formulated from broad estimates and were therefore more difficult to analyse. This also meant that when some assumption or parameter changed, it was not easy to see the consequence. Ian Murray was a person who obviously had more detailed knowledge but, at times, his evidence was less compelling than that of Robert Worden and, as he accepted, he had made errors. His approach to effort estimates and the way in which they changed I found less than convincing.  Similarly, in the very specialist field of function point counting, where Neil Douglas is undoubtedly a leading expert, the figures which were derived under his supervision could not be supported and had to be changed. Mark Britton was an impressive witness who evidently had a great deal of experience in systems and system integration. However, as mentioned above, he needed to learn about Siebel for the purpose of the issues in this case. </p>

However, I found that his evidence failed to live up to expectations. It seemed that he had little grasp of the detailed facts and had not properly understood some features which were necessary to make churn predictions for Sky. For example, his initial evidence on the relevance of Syscan was, at the very least unclear, and his explanation of the position was not convincing. Equally, he did not seek to do any detailed analysis of the effect of the CRM functionality until very late. He did, though, have some useful insights into effectiveness of that functionality in preventing churn. As he accepted, making churn predictions in the case of Sky raised a number of difficulties and this meant that the court needed to have more justification for his figures than he was able to give.           </p>

When seeking to identify the person who is to count as the company for the purposes of a substantive rule of law it is necessary to consider the nature and policy of that rule. The essence of fraudulent misrepresentation, so far as is relevant for this case, is making a statement that is known to be untrue intending that the person to whom it is made will rely on it. Liability therefore depends on the conjunction of a false statement and a dishonest state of mind. In a case where it is said that a company has made a fraudulent misrepresentation the first step must be to see whether a false statement has been made by someone who is authorised to speak on the company's behalf. Once that has been established the starting point in deciding whether the company acted dishonestly must be to enquire into the state of mind of the person who made the statement.

It cannot therefore be inferred from the present case that other sub-agents will be held directly liable to the agent's principal in tort. Let me take the analogy of the common case of an ordinary building contract, under which main contractors contract with the building owner for the construction of the relevant building, and the main contractor sub-contracts with sub-contractors or suppliers (often nominated by the building owner) for the performance of work or the supply of materials in accordance with standards and subject to terms established in the sub-contract. I put on one side cases in which the subcontractor causes physical damage to property of the building owner, where the claim does not depend on an assumption of responsibility by the sub-contractor to the building owner; though the sub-contractor may be protected from liability by a contractual exemption clause authorised by the building owner. But if the sub-contracted work or materials do not in the result conform to the required standard, it will not ordinarily be open to the building owner to sue the sub-contractor or supplier direct under the </span><a href="http://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;&amp;context=11&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=IBC23A100E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9">

I acknowledge at once the distinction, namely, where obligations are founded in contract they depend on the agreement made and the objective intention demonstrated by that agreement whereas the existence of a duty in tort may not have such a definitive datum point. However, I believe that in order to determine whether a duty arises in tort it is necessary to consider the circumstances in which the parties came together in the initial stages at which time it should be considered what obligations, if any, were assumed by the one in favour of the other and what reliance was placed by the other on the first.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">475. In my judgment the various terms of the principal contractual documents upon which Chase relies (i.e. the Relevant Provisions), and which I have set out above 104, clearly show that Springwell and Chase were dealing with each other on a stipulated and accepted basis that, whatever advice or recommendations may have been given by Chase in the course of their trading relationship (i.e. the sale by CIBL/CMIL to Springwell of emerging markets securities, and the financing by CMB of various of Springwell’s purchases), no obligations to give appropriate investment advice, or duties of care as an investment advisor, were being assumed by either the Private Bank, CMB, or the Investment Bank, as the entity actually selling Springwell the relevant securities, (i.e. CIBL or CMIL), whether in relation to Springwell’s emerging markets portfolio or, more generally, as to what Springwell should do, given the existence of that portfolio. Thus I accept the submissions made on behalf of Chase that the contractual documentation, whether taken at a straightforward contractual level, or looked at more widely, as an indication as to whether any common law duties of care arose, showed that the parties specifically contracted upon the basis of a trading and banking relationship which negated any possibility of a general or specific advisory duty coming into existence. </span>

Hobhouse LJ referred to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hedley Byrne</span> and the speeches of Lord Reid at 492, Lord Morris at 504 and Lord Devlin at 533 on the relevance of the disclaimer and summarised the position as: </p>

It negatives the assumption of responsibility for the statement. It implicitly tells the recipient of the representation that if he chooses to rely upon it he must realise that the maker is not accepting responsibility for the accuracy of the representation. The disclaimer is part of the factual situation which the court has to take into account in deciding whether or not the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.

It is to be noted that it does not in terms refer to representations. The defendants, however, submit that the word “understanding” covers the representation alleged in this case. I cannot accept this submission. Although it is true that, in one sense, the common assumption by all parties that the plaintiffs were to be in charge of the day-to-day running could be called “an understanding” between them, the plaintiffs are not suing on that bilateral “understanding”, but on the representation of intention implicit in it. Clause 11(1) plainly excludes any contractual claim based on a bilateral understanding, but it does not go further. In my judgment the word “understanding” is directed to excluding any claims arising from warranties collateral to the main agreement. If it were designed to exclude liability for misrepresentation it would, I think, have to [be] couched in different terms, for example, a clause acknowledging that the parties had not relied on any representations in entering into the contract. I therefore hold that the word “understanding” in this contract is not apt to cover representations, and accordingly does not exclude the plaintiffs' claim.” </span>

Although the second sentence is worded in terms of an absence of any representations etc. outside the agreement itself, it does in fact operate as a contractual renunciation of the right to rely on anything said or done in the course of the negotiations as giving rise to a ground of complaint, or indeed for any other purpose. To that extent the clause does alter the parties' positions, but it is subject to the exception in the final sentence which makes it clear that they did not intend to give up the right to hold each other liable for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentations made before entering into the agreement.

Mr. Glick was, in my judgment, plainly right to submit that the obvious commercial purpose in the conditions and limits was to enable the Warrantors to know that they would not be sued on the warranties if no notice was served in time and proceedings were not brought in time and that, if they were sued, there was a quantified limit to their liability. That purpose would be frustrated if the claim for breach of warranty could be regarded as a claim in misrepresentation. The final words of cl. 3(a) would permit a claim for rescission of the Agreement. That gives sufficient effect to those words, without having to give them the meaning contended for by Mr. Wardell which flouts commercial good sense.</span>” </p>

The purpose of the settlement was to wipe the slate clean in respect of claims  for breach of the Prime Contract. If the parties wished to,  they could have incorporated words to include wider claims such as claims which could be advanced by way of breach of contract. They did not do so. It is not for the court to rewrite their bargain. Whether Sky can bring a claim to circumvent paragraph 17 depends on the wording of paragraph 17 and the nature of the claim. If the court re-wrote an exclusion of contractual claims to exclude all claims which could be framed in that way, that would be to change the bargain which the parties had made.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">At the CRM Executive Steering Group meeting on 20 December 2001, EDS had reported an 8 week slippage in the implementation of Phase 2 and was proposing a change in the approach to one of Joint Application Development (JAD). Sky in response questioned the appropriateness of the “Big Bang” approach in which all the Phase 2 CRM functionality was delivered at the same time. There followed a review which culminated in presentation of a CRM Programme Review dated 18 February 2002 by Simon Post and Jeff Hughes to Tony Ball and Richard Freudenstein. The Review made recommendations which included a change in implementation approach from a “big bang” to an incremental approach and also that Sky should take  a more active role in the project which it was said meant that “<span style="font-style:italic">commercial and legal changes maybe required</span>”. The review set out the two possibilities as being the Big Bang approach with EDS as the Systems Integrator and an incremental approach with EDS not being the Systems Integrator. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Meetings took place between Sky and EDS commencing on 15 February 2002 at which these changes were discussed. Greg Hyttenrauch summarised the conclusion of that first meeting as an agreement in principle that Sky would assume the role of Systems Integrator and the risk of overruns or warranty claims and that EDS would give up its claim to a profit share. On 18 February 2002, Jeff Hughes sent Greg Hyttenrauch a note setting out in more detail Sky's understanding of the discussions at the meeting which was broadly as set out above. The note stated that EDS would not be the Systems Integrator but would continue to work closely with Sky as a supplier of resources and close partner in the success of the program and that EDS’ profit sharing would be “on the table” to compensate for the warranties and the System Integrator risk sharing which Sky was giving up. </p>

On 27 February 2002 Greg Hyttenrauch sent Mike Hughes an email attaching two options, including an option of transferring the Systems Integrator role to Sky on terms. Greg Hyttenrauch said that he wanted to know whether there was agreement in principle to one of the options so that he could discuss the position with Steve Leonard and start work on a Memorandum of Understanding. </p>

Richard Freudenstein made a note of what was said at the meeting in a notebook at 11:35am on 6 March 2002. He recorded Steve Leonard as saying “<span style="font-style:italic">fully working new approach as of now</span>”. He said he thought that on this basis EDS were accepting that Sky would take over as Systems Integrator from that time. In an internal Sky email on 6 March Richard Freudenstein said: “<span style="font-style:italic">we agreed that EDS would behave from today as though the new deal was signed and he would communicate that to Greg H</span>”.

Steve Leonard says that he asked whether Richard Freudenstein was happy to go ahead and after saying that he felt that he had been let down by EDS he confirmed that he was going ahead and would sign the Memorandum of Understanding within 30 days. In oral evidence on Day 64 he said that the purpose of the telephone call on 6 March 2002 was to reach the agreement which triggered the cascade of changes in responsibility of what EDS and Sky were doing.

On the same day, Caroline Waterer responded by email to Richard Freudenstein and advised that, having gone through the agreements, she did not think either side could safely sign a short Memorandum of Understanding. She proposed that the cleanest solution would be to terminate the existing contract and replace it with a new contract which repeated all the relevant provisions of the Prime Contract and the Letter of Agreement and appointed EDS as a service provider under Sky's control as Systems Integrator. She then proceeded to draft a new long form contract which she emailed to David Walter of EDS on 18 March 2002 who, in his response on 25 March 2002, said that an attempt was being made to reach agreement in principle by the end of the month and that this would give "a little more time to settle the terms of the full form agreement."

He says that he never considered that the Memorandum of Understanding was to be in full and final settlement. In his oral evidence he said that he thought that Sky would continue to pay EDS and he accepted that EDS had been paid on the basis of the rates in the Memorandum of Understanding, including a 33% increase referred to in that document. He said that he thought he had agreed commercial terms with EDS as of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March under which they stopped being Systems Integrator and under which Sky would continue paying EDS going forward. He said though that the document which he signed subject to contract was not a legally binding document. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Steve Leonard says in his witness statement that his understanding was that anything in the existing contract, the Prime Contract as amended by the Letter of Agreement, which clashed with the Memorandum of Understanding was no longer effective. He says that he thought that the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding were binding and although it did not replace the existing contract in its entirety, it “set the stage” for the modified contract to be put together. The new contract, not the Memorandum of Understanding, would then govern the relationship between Sky and EDS. He says that, like the Letter of Agreement, the Memorandum of Understanding involved a waiver of claims by Sky and that was the intention of the parties, although it has no express clause to that effect. In his oral evidence he said that the purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding was to “freeze that agreement until such time as the lawyers could memorialise it” which he thought could take some months. In essence, he saw the signature on 26 March as being to give effect to what he had said on 6 March 2002.     </p>

The result was a decision that Sky would take over the role of Systems Integrator from EDS  and would do so on the basis that EDS would continue to supply staff. The detailed commercial terms on which that change was made had first to be agreed in principle and the parties evidently agreed that there then had to be a new contract which reflected the terms of the existing Prime Contract, as amended by the Letter of Agreement, as then modified by the terms agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding. </p>

In my judgment it is evident that both parties conducted themselves on the basis of the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding but did so in the contemplation that those terms would subsequently form the basis of the new contract. Once the conduct of the parties started out on that basis then there would need to be some change in position to show that conduct which initially was on that basis was transformed into conduct by which one party intended there to be a new offer made and the other party intended to accept that offer. What happened in this case is that the parties proceeded on the basis that there would be a new contract but that process failed to come to fruition, partly because the immediate need for a new contract faded because Sky took over EDS’ role as Systems </p>

Although Caroline Waterer produced a first draft on 18 March 2002 there were clearly questions about how far the terms of the original Prime Contract would continue and what would be the rights and liabilities of the parties. Indeed, as can be seen from the current dispute, the question of whether there was a full and final settlement or how past liabilities were to be dealt with would have to have been dealt with, indicating the need for the “subject to contract” rubric. Indeed the process of reaching agreement on the new contract seems to have foundered when EDS sought, through their lawyers, to introduce the concept of settlement.</p>

Those clauses have to be considered to see whether they affect the duty of care which I have held would otherwise exist. In particular, the duty of care will have to take account of any exclusion or limitation clauses in the Prime Contract so as not to permit SSSL to circumvent or escape the consequences of those terms. In the light of my findings as to the scope and effect of Clauses 1.3.1, 7.2 and 20 of the Prime Contract, it is necessary to consider whether there are duties of care owed by EDSC or owed to BSkyB so as to give rise to claims for negligent misrepresentation at common law by BSkyB and SSSL against EDSC and by BSkyB against EDSL and EDSC which would avoid the effect of the limitations in the Prime Contract.</p>

Evidently if they had done so that would have avoided the situation. However, as is made clear in the authorities, the tests imposed to determine whether there is a duty of care and the scope and extent of any duty do not depend on whether there is an exclusion clause. They are based on questions of fairness, justice and reasonableness taking account of all the relevant circumstances. </p>

This is not a case where the duty being considered is a parallel duty of care to a duty in contract. Nor is it a case of a contractual chain where the duty is said to arise between two parties separated by one or more parties in the chain. Rather it is a case where parties in a group have chosen the parties between whom to have a contract and it is sought to rely on a duty of care so that another member of the group can pursue a claim which circumvents the contractual arrangements.

Those plans did not form part of the EDS Response and were based on a waterfall method of working where each stage is carried out before the next, rather than a RAD project where steps are carried out together and in parallel. If anything it seems that a waterfall programme would show a longer duration than a RAD programme. It seems that questions of time were left to Steve Vine and Mahmoud Khasawneh, neither of whom were witnesses. Joe Galloway said that he gave “no credence” to the Vine Plans. Gerard Whelan referred to the Vine Plans as being the output of the estimating process. He also referred to discussions with Steve Vine but was not aware of any more detailed plan being produced by Steve Vine. Andy Sollis was involved for a short time in April 2000 in relation to data warehousing. His evidence was that he spoke to Steve Vine to understand when other activities would be carried out on which data warehousing depended and to consider the duration for his work.

At the presentation on 1 June 2000 EDS repeated its statements about global resources and proven experience and expertise and stated that it was ready to start the project. At the presentation on 7 July 2000 EDS stated that they were ready to start with the “right skills”. </p>

It was a general statement similar to the phrase in Section 1.3 where they stated that that they had the <span style="font-style:italic">"ability to leverage the global resources.</span>” That availability of global resources was evidently referred to by EDS to give Sky the confidence that EDS could and would have the necessary resources available when they were required to carry out the project.  </p>

The definition of the work and therefore the effort is something that develops throughout the course of the project. This has been expressed by McConnell in his book Software Estimation in terms of a cone of uncertainty, with the effort or cost becoming more certain as the project progresses through Initial Concept, Approved Product Definition, Requirements Complete, User Interface Design Complete, Detailed Design Complete to the final stage of Software Complete.

It had identified the need for Chordiant skills which would be met both from those in the CRM Practice from the former SHL who had those skills and also from the particular resources that were to be obtained from Chordiant.

He said that his confidence in the availability of sufficient resources was based on the combined experience of EDS and its consortium partners.

In relation to general integration resources, I consider that EDS had reasonable grounds for considering that these resources could be made available from the CRM Practice, from elsewhere in EDS, from consortium partners or outside contractors. For the key Chordiant resources, EDS did make arrangements with Chordiant and the evidence from Chordiant’s communications with Sky was that they were clearly willing to provide assistance. This supports EDS’ confidence that they could obtain the necessary Chordiant resources. There were also general discussions with the other consortium members such as the one which I accept took place with Scott Yarnell of Forte, as referred to by Gerard Whelan.

In the EDS Response, EDS proposed that a business process workstream led by A T Kearney was to proceed by two parallel paths: one a “SWAT” team was to identify current customer service failures and “quick wins” over a period of 8 weeks; the other team was to define the vision for Sky's world-class customer service in 4 weeks and then over 8 to 10 weeks to validate the design, defining the use cases for certain processes and producing a use case catalogue together with a functional and technical specification for those processes. However by the end of June AA had replaced A T Kearney with a revised approach to both the process workstream and change management, as set out in the Joint Delivery document of 20 June 2000. Part of that revised approach was a 6 to 8 week “Define” phase to set “the scope of the work and identify  priorities within it”. </p>

He says he transferred the conclusions into the formal tabs of the spreadsheet and then deleted the “scratch-pad” tab. Initially, he says, only he had access to the estimating sheet and he updated it with the numbers of people in the different skill areas and the number of days’ effort that had been estimated. He says that he kept the spreadsheet entirely to himself as he did not want members of the team to see the rates at which they would be charged to the client.

In the “EDS” tab are the various categories of resources expected to be required from EDS, showing the overall numbers and the mandays of work expected of them. He says that it can be seen that a team of about 100 people (deployed at various times over the lifespan of the project) was predicted. He says that the spreadsheet contained a classification of rates in the “Staff Model” sheet, with contract staff being in a separate column. He says that the practice during the estimating exercise was to identify a role as being filled by a contractor only where it was particularly desirable to do so, or it was inevitable that a contractor (which included a resource from another consortium member) would have to be used. He says that it was expected that some of the roles in the EDS column would eventually be filled by a contractor, notwithstanding the contrary indication in the spreadsheet.  </p>

He says that the professional judgement lies in the identification of the tasks themselves, the amount of time required for each task and the number of people required to complete it within a notional timescale.

Sky accept that some form of estimation of development effort must have been used to arrive at the contents of the Costing Spreadsheets, but say that the way in which Joe Galloway explained that an analysis had been carried out for all of the functionality at use case level was embellishment. In particular, Joe Galloway in his evidence said that a spreadsheet similar to that later produced by Steve Fleming, setting out use cases and functionality had been used. No such document exists and neither Gerard Whelan nor Andy Sollis refer to one. Whilst I accept that a form of “scratch-pad” was most likely used, I consider that Sky are justified in their criticism of Joe Galloway. He changed and gave inconsistent evidence on the relationship between the analysis spreadsheet which he said he had used and the one produced later by Steve Fleming. In the informal meetings I consider that a much broader brush approach was taken to estimating development effort by using a “scratch-pad” or rough working tab on the spreadsheet which was later deleted. Doubtless some information was produced by considering certain use cases but other information on development effort was likely to have been derived from the experience of EDS and the consortium members.

Now, the reason that they are left complete in the Interdec tab is because we believe this is the appropriate work that needed to be done, and Mr Hughes was going to find, according to Mr Hughes, quote unquote, 'another bucket of money,' that this was going to come from and that we should only consider items we felt absolutely vital to keep in the systems that were appropriate to getting the existing contact centre up and running.

He said that there were two phases to his discussion and that in the second phase of discussion with Mike Hughes the number comes down again. There was no evidence from Mike Hughes on this aspect and no  opportunity for this to be put to him because this aspect of the case only developed long after Sky’s witnesses had concluded their evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">The EDS Response made it clear that they had only allowed for about £5 million for location costs for the existing and new spaces (para 7.2.1) and about £1.5 million for consultancy (para 7.2.2) giving a figure close to the  £6,460,372 in the Costing Spreadsheet. The comments from Sky in the cost comparison sheets showed that Sky was aware that costs for such items as “possible upgrade of building” and “additional location considerations” of £4m and £14.984m would have to be added to EDS’ total. The cost comparison sheets strongly suggest that Sky was treating location costs relating to possible upgrade of the building and other costs over the base case such as “dismantling, removal and clearance” as additional costs. This led to the £20 million figure being placed in the figures for both PwC and AA/EDS in the cost comparison of 18 July 2000. This is consistent with Sky not being concerned with having the full costs of the location within the bid. Given that Mike Hughes was evidently in contact with Joe Galloway and wanted him to succeed in the bid, I believe it likely that Mike Hughes would have communicated Sky’s approach to Joe Galloway. </p>

By way of an example, the Testing Team in the EDS tab of ITT Costings IV calls for 3 EDS staff for that team, each working for 180 days.

A large number of resources with DTW of 320 were changed to 280.

That, however, does not mean that the alterations made to the rates and DTW did not occur because of a proper estimating process. If an error is found then it necessarily leads to a review of other calculations to see whether they are accurate or not. Joe Galloway’s evidence that the figures were changed as a result of a continuing process of review with some input from Mike Hughes may well be correct. Again this particular aspect was not dealt with in evidence.

He said in relation to the Vine Plans that it had no resourcing in it and was not “a resource levelling plan”. He accepted that he made no attempt to take the Vine Plans and the Costing Spreadsheet and to see what were the resourcing implications of the plan. He said that “<span style="font-style:italic">we, the team, depended on Mr Vine to take the view of whether his plans that he has created here would nominally fit the nine-month plan that we put together from the resourcing standpoint.</span>” This might seem to suggest that some resourcing was done but he confirmed what he said at paragraph 252 of his first witness statement that the planning by Steve Vine was not resourced. Joe Galloway confirmed at Day 40 that he had not sought to work out what work was to be done in the first nine months. </p>

When it was pointed out to him that the costing spreadsheet allowed for 18 people to work for 320 days on GUI work but that if this was going to be carried out in the 80 days allowed in the Vine Plan to achieve go-live in nine months, the work was going to be compressed, he said that “<span style="font-style:italic">I did not give credence to this plan…as it related to effort that was going to be required.</span>”    </p>

Robert Worden considers empirical data in the form of the Constructive Cost Model (CoCoMo) data which relates total effort to elapsed time. He says that for a project with a headcount of 96 EDS staff and an effort of 19,000 man-days, the CoCoMo nominal schedule for a project of this sort would be about 24 months rather that the 9 months planned. This would have called for some justification for the short timescale and he has found no evidence of this. </p>

However, the overall programme for EDS had to take account of the work which EDS was to carry out. Although, the central framework software was Chordiant, the method of working and the interaction of the workstreams, including other contractors was a matter for EDS. Further, there is no evidence of direct detailed Chordiant involvement in making the time estimate and general involvement is not sufficient. Nor is there any evidence from any of the other consortium partners on their involvement at the bid stage. The overall time, it seems to me, was a matter for EDS and, in the absence of relevant evidence from Chordiant or the consortium partners, EDS cannot draw support for their time estimate from the involvement of the consortium members in taking part in discussions or in reading and approving the draft Response. </p>

The report was distributed to Joe Galloway, as well as to Steve Leonard, Barry Yard, Elwyn Jones and Jonathan Malin. In addition, it was later provided to Laurence Anderson, who in turn provided it to Steve Mayhew. John Chan referred to the report at the meeting on 24 August 2000 and at paragraph 73 of his first witness statement said that he had provided Scott Mackay with “the Red Team action document” and believed he had handed the document out at the meeting on 24 August 2000.  It seems very likely that Dr Chan made reference to the "actions arising" sheet from the Red Team Review because the bulleted paragraphs in the “Briefing on Red Team Review” section of the minutes of the meeting on 24 August 2000 follow those actions closely. Certainly there is no reaction from the Sky personnel at the meeting and if a copy of the Red Team Review itself had been made available it is extremely unlikely that Sky would not have raised concerns at its contents.  </p>

That seems also to have been the approach of the Red Team Review and of Laurence Anderson and Barry Yard. It was a problem which had to be dealt with by finding a solution. That, I consider, is the usual reaction of those involved on a project. It seems that there was no review of what had been done at bid stage to reach the conclusion that the timescale was achievable at the time of the EDS Response. Without that and without finding out that there was no proper basis for the time estimate at that stage, I do not consider that the way in which others at EDS dealt with the situation can be criticised.        </p>

His evidence as to what had been done in relation to the time estimate shows that he was aware that no proper attempt had been made to assess whether go-live could be achieved in 9 months and complete delivery in 18 months. His approach was to ignore the need for analysis. I am driven to the conclusion that he proffered timescales which he thought were those which Sky desired, without having a reasonable basis for doing so and knowing that to be the position. He knew that no proper analysis of time had been carried out and he knew that he had no basis for saying that go-live could be achieved in nine months and complete delivery in 18 months. Indeed, he said that he did not consider the timescales to be sufficient. I consider that his reaction to the Red Team Report provides support for this finding. In my judgment his conduct went beyond carelessness or gross carelessness and was dishonest. I consider that he acted deliberately in putting forward the timescales knowing that he had no proper basis for those timescales. At the very least he was reckless, not caring whether what he said was right or wrong.  </p>

It was that motive which led him to say that he could achieve the Sky CRM Project in the required timescale when he knew that he had no proper basis for doing so. EDS say that there can be no motive in obtaining a project on the basis of times which cannot be met. I do not think he took that type of long term view. His wish was to be awarded the CRM Project and use that for advancement. </p>

The role he performed was more that of an administrative bid manager, co-ordinating matters, but not himself being involved in deciding what had to be done by whom for the purpose of estimating and putting in the bid. He received information from other people who had carried out the work and incorporated it into the EDS Response. He was also the conduit for communications between EDS and Sky. He appeared to be unable to believe that someone, probably Steve Vine, had not done the necessary analysis to establish that go-live could be achieved in nine months. He sought to look for support for a nine month period in Chordiant publicity and in other projects. I consider that he simply failed to spot that an essential part of the bidding process which he thought had been carried out had not in fact been done. He did not have the knowledge of Joe Galloway in relation to what was being done for the overall estimating process. </p>

In any event, other people were then becoming involved in finding a solution.

Liability can arise where a person has “manifestly approved and adopted” a statement, with the necessary knowledge and intent. I have found that John Chan did not have the necessary knowledge or intent. But, in any event, I do not consider that any conduct on his part manifestly approved and adopted the false representation that a proper process had been followed to arrive at the time estimate. His conduct in acting as Project Manager did not demonstrate that he approved and adopted that representation. I therefore do not see any basis on which John Chan could have been made liable for the original representation.             </p>

I consider that having written what she did and realising the obvious impact of that evidence on EDS, she tried to characterise it in a different way and one which was patently unsupportable. She was evidently furious at the actions of Joe Galloway in October 2000. She was, after all, a very experienced programme and project manager who had worked for EDS on a number of major assignments. She was brought into the re-planning process in October 2000 reviewing the plan which gave a go-live date of November 2001. </p>

He stated that there had been wide authorship and that a final review session had been held involving Sky and EDS that morning to tie up loose ends.

They were aware that their process led to the initial plans of 24 October 2000 gave dates in August 2001 but that subsequent plans gave dates in November 2001. That did not mean that they were aware that no proper process had been followed by Joe Galloway to arrive at the 31 July 2001. Indeed the planning effort which was still continuing was trying to meet that date but had not yet been able to do so. Equally there might be other possibilities for why the planning effort could not achieve the same date as Joe Galloway. Joe Galloway might have made an error or made different assumptions and these would have explained why they could not meet the date.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">EDS also say that Sky did not rely on the 31 July 2001 date as a representation but relied on it as a promise in the form of a contractual obligation under the Prime Contract. Whilst the date was a date included within the Prime Contract, it is clear both from the Executive Steering Group’s requirements and from the approach of Mike Hughes that a central requirement was to have go-live in one hall in July/August 2001, if not earlier and certainly in advance of November 2001 and the busy Christmas period. The meeting on 13 October 2000 also reinforced this. Sky needed to know when go-live would take place not only as a matter of contractual commitment but also because that was a fundamental part of their business strategy. As a result, it was the representation made by Joe Galloway, reinforced by Steve Leonard and ultimately included in the contract which was relied on by the relevant Sky personnel.  </p>

It is now quite common for multi-national companies to decide that from a branding point of view all companies within a group should use the same logo and refer to themselves by a name which is neutral as to the particular company but demonstrates an affiliation with a large group consisting of a group company and subsidiaries. I do not consider that this means that when an employee uses the EDS logo or refers to himself as acting on behalf of EDS, he is acting on behalf of not only the company which employs him but also on behalf of EDSC any more than the employee would be acting for all other companies in the group. I do not consider that the corporate policy on branding gives rise to authority for the employee of a company to act other than on behalf of that company. It may make for uncertainty but that does not create actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of any party who might be authorised to use the logo and the name EDS.</p>

The fact that such authority may have come from EDSC would not mean that he was given authority to act generally on behalf of EDSC. EDSC may, for instance, authorise someone to act on behalf of EDSL but that does not mean that the person is then acting on behalf of EDSC.

This is most clear from Section 6 of the EDS Response. In doing that the employees of EDSL who produced the Response were not putting in the EDS Response on behalf of EDSC or any other company within the EDS group.

In this case when the parties put their mind to who should be the contracting party as a result of the EDS Response, both in the Letter of Intent and in the Prime Contract they decided that the contracting party should be EDSL. In addition in the recitals to the Prime Contract they referred to the EDS Response being issued by the Contractor, that is EDSL. The absence of mention of EDSC in that context and the fact that there is no mention of EDSC being involved in the EDS Response in the recitals to the Deed of Guarantee between EDSC and SSSL provides some support for EDS’ submission that EDSC did not make representations in the Response.</p>

The fact that he had a role within EDSC does not mean that, without more, he was making representations on behalf of EDSC.

There was reference to Sky Services which includes SSSL and Sky Home Services Limited. The EDS Response was phrased by reference to BSkyB. There was no definition of which companies within the Sky group which were defined as “BSkyB”. Those involved in the ITT, in receiving the EDS Response, in discussions with EDS and in dealing with the Letter of Intent were both employees of SSSL and BSkyB, with a good deal of overlap between those two companies. The same is true of the lead up to the signing of the Prime Contract. In principle that would mean that parties with the Sky group were, as a class, intended to rely on the representations. I consider that the Letter of Intent signed on behalf of BSkyB indicates that EDS intended one of the companies to be BSkyB. Equally, by signing the Prime Contract with SSSL, I consider that EDS intended another of the companies to be SSSL. The aim of EDS was to be selected initially, then to have a Letter of Intent and then enter into the Prime Contract. In those steps the two parties who EDS intended to rely on anything they said, including the representations, were both BSkyB and SSSL.  </p>

However, in his witness statement Gerard Whelan then noted that there was a contradiction between Sky’s desire for a “leading edge” solution and its desire for a solution that had to be proven. He says that EDS interpreted “<span style="font-style:italic">proven solution</span>” to mean that EDS needed to offer a solution which could be supported by reference to previous experience of this type of project. He refers to the fact that this led to the choice of Chordiant.  This does not mean, though, that the whole solution had to be proven in the sense that Chordiant, Arbor BP and Forte Fusion had previously been used or integrated together. Rather it meant that the solution had to be based on proven technology.  </p>

Even if the phrase were to be ambiguous, I do not see that the references to proven technology or the other wording can be said to have been written so as to be ambiguous. Rather it seems to me that EDS were addressing the particular matters which were set out in the ITT and there is nothing in the ITT which required a proven solution in the way in which Sky interpret it. </p>

He says at paragraph 22 of that witness statement that whilst Sky wanted the “vision” he describes and that a leading technology solution would be required to achieve it, Sky were also concerned that what they were buying was proven and not “<span style="font-style:italic">bleeding edge</span>”.

He drafted section 3.5 of the ITT which, as I have said, did not make a previously proven solution one of Sky’s requirements. If he had intended that the solution or parts of it had to have been used and integrated together previously then the ITT should have stated that. It appeared that he was making a leap, as was suggested to him in cross-examination, in assuming that the only way a bidder could be confident that the components of the solution could be integrated would be if they had done it before.  </p>

This is typically done by business analysts working with the business staff to produce specifications of functional and non-functional requirements. This then leads to the second stage when IT design and development is carried out where the requirements are translated into the necessary IT architectural and detailed design. That IT design is then transferred into programme coding to implement the design within the software. When that is complete it is necessary to carry out testing prior to implementation.

The two particular methodologies which are referred to in the statements relied on by Sky are Transform and PM2. Whilst in relation to these two methodologies there are references to “EDS’ formal Transform methodology” (Technology Document Section 12) and to PM2 as an EDS corporate methodology (Response 4.3.4), it is only in the CD for the presentation on 1 June 2000 that it is stated that EDS has developed powerful delivery methodologies, apparently in the context of Transform. Otherwise references are to EDS having used or possessing those methodologies rather than EDS having developed them.  In my judgment, the representation does not go as far as to say that EDS had developed all the methodologies which they possessed. </p>

First, they challenged EDS’ intention to use Transform on the basis that the description of the Transform methodology in Section 12 of the Technology Document was in fact a description of EDS’ SLC3 methodology. This, Sky say, shows an intention not to use Transform, a methodology which was produced by SHL and which, after SHL’s move to EDS was not supported by EDS. Equally, Sky say there was no apparent intention to use SLC3 at any time. Secondly, they challenged any continuing intention to use Transform after John Chan became involved in the project. John Chan’s name first became linked with the project on 11 May 2000. He was then approached to be Project Manager on 28 May 2000 and attended the presentation to Sky on 1 June 2000, albeit in a non-participating role. It is clear from the evidence of  Gerard Whelan and John Chan that John Chan did not favour Transform. He focused more on the need for a project and programme management methodology and intended to use PM2 and not the parts of Transform which were applicable to those functions. He was not going to impose any SDLC methodology on the workstreams but was to leave it to them to select methodologies. </p>

Whether the SDLC methodology was Transform, SLC3 or some other methodology to be chosen by the workstreams, I am satisfied that EDS had an intention to use one or more SDLC methodologies. The proposal in the response, subject to further discussion with Sky, was to use Transform and PM2 methodologies as part of a rapid, iterative development application.

Equally, the evidence that John Chan did not intend to impose any SDLC methodology but to leave it to the workstreams shows an intention to use an SDLC methodology or methodologies.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">The cross-examination of Gerard Whelan and John Chan was aimed at establishing that EDS did not have a continuing intention to use Transform but that is not the pleaded allegation or a representation which could be supported on the facts. In closing Sky tried to change the emphasis of its case to a representation that there would be “a single overarching methodology”. They pointed out that the reference to “<span style="font-style:italic">project management and SDLC methodologies</span>” would encompass a case of a project management methodology and an SDLC methodology. However for Sky to proceed in closing on this basis would go against the way in which the case had been conducted. Further, Sky made comparatively late amendments to the pleaded representation and, if they had wanted to plead an allegation of  “single overarching methodology” they should have made that clear. That case would have had difficulties in terms of the case pleaded in paragraph 38 of the Particulars of Claim as it is clear that Chordiant and AA methodologies would have to be taken into account. What the change of tack does show is that Sky’s case on an intention to use “<span style="font-style:italic">project management and SDLC methodologies</span>” could not, as I have found be sustained. </p>

In Sky’s closing submissions at paragraphs 556 to 561 it is relied on as being relevant to EDS’ general attitude. This is not relevant to the alleged representation or to the question of falsity. In any event, the evidence from Gerard Whelan, Joe Galloway and Dan Barton indicates that this would be taken to mean that 80% of the software development would be based on Chordiant’s out of the box functionality and materials from previous projects. Mark Britton accepts that 80% could be calculated on that basis but says that it would not be normal to refer to that in this way.

In the letter, Barry Yard stated that ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Greg Hyttenrauch has been assigned to provide the necessary delivery oversight to bring the programme to a successful conclusion, together with an experienced team of people that will bring additional focus to the tasks at hand</span>’. Sky say that the representation implied that EDS had the right people available and that those people had been assigned to the project.  </p>

EDS say that this is not what the letter says and is inconsistent with the main point of the letter which was that the programme was to be replanned, the issues were being addressed and various options were to be considered. Moreover, EDS say that it would be inconsistent with other statements relied upon, such as those at the Marriott Hotel on 18 May 2001, which made clear that more resources were needed. </p>

Sky refer to the fact that Richard Freudenstein had spoken to David Courtley, an ex-EDS employee, in an attempt to establish the quality of EDS’ senior staff and that David Courtley had told him that “<span style="font-style:italic">EDS had some very good people but it was important to get access to the right ones</span>”.  </p>

At that time the development and testing teams were not fully staffed. Therefore, Greg Hyttenrauch enclosed information on new and potential resources for the development team. Equally he provided information on new resources for the testing team. As Greg Hyttenrauch said in his evidence on Day 62, on the basis of this information, Steve Leonard could say “this is what we have and what we can access”.

He was a straightforward and honest witness and he said in evidence his recollection is that he would have said words to the effect: “<span style="font-style:italic">Those people we have, although you may have heard from your teams some concerns, we have looked into it, we are standing by those people. We believe we still have to add people and we want to ensure they are of the right quality.</span>” As he said in his second witness statement, he recalls saying that the development and testing team EDS had deployed had the right skills, experience and quality for the job. However, as he points out these comments related to those who had already been identified and to EDS’ intentions for the future. He did not believe that Sky could have thought that EDS had already identified the full team. Richard Freudenstein gave similar evidence and said that he could not recall Steve Leonard telling him that he had identified all the people, just that he had assured him that EDS would get the right people.          </p>

EDS refer to a joint technical workshop meeting on 11 July 2001 and say that Sky was well aware that work still had to be done on the knowledge databases.

This evidence was not challenged and I accept it. As a result I consider that the statement that all three knowledge databases (Technical, Billing and Sales) had been built and populated was correct so far as the scope of work for EDS was concerned.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Sky cannot therefore base any claim on any misrepresentation arising from the executive group meeting on 13 July 2001.      </p>

Further, I am not persuaded that the work completed and later found to be of less or little value would necessarily have been a view which should have been formed in the period up to the Letter of Agreement. For instance, at paragraph 80.3 of the Particulars of Claim Sky allege that the work done on the Data Architecture, the Data Warehouse, Data Migration and the GUI was of no value, was ultimately jettisoned and had to be redone. This obviously relates to what happened after the Letter of Agreement.  </p>

There were reasons why work ultimately proved to be of limited value to the project, because the project changed rather than because that work was inherently of little value. For instance, the functional specifications were changed from Baseline 1 to Baseline 3/4 and the project moved to an incremental basis which would mean that some of the existing data migration work would be redundant.  </p>

He says that, whilst Sky were keen for delivery to take place as soon as possible, the main priority was to have Phase 1 in place before the pre-Christmas period in 2001, with final delivery in good time to allow it to be up and running for the preChristmas period in 2002.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Richard Freudenstein was clearly in a difficult position in deciding whether to recommend that Sky should continue with EDS on the basis of the terms in the Letter of Agreement. There were obviously a number of factors which he had to take into account. Whilst the commercial terms reduced the risks of proceeding with EDS and were important, from that point of view, it is clear that Sky was interested in being assured as to the time to reach go-live. The process of replanning in 2001 was evidently carried out to give Sky assurance that EDS had carried out proper planning and had an achievable plan to complete within the timescale. The assurances given to Sky and, in particular to Richard Freudenstein, by EDS were necessary to counter the clear view of people within Sky that EDS could not deliver. In my view, Sky had alternatives but obviously if EDS could perform that would be the better option.  </p>

On that basis, he says that considering only the manpower costs but not hardware and software costs, based on his view of the effort estimates he considers that EDS’ estimates of costs were adequate. PA say that the estimating process was inadequate because they were derived from resource requirements which were not arrived at through a proper process. They do not appear to have considered the evidence which Robert Worden cites and which, in my judgment, does show that there was a proper process. There had to be assumptions including assumptions about the value of work already carried out. The fact that the estimate of time was wrong would not, in my judgment, of itself, mean that the estimate of overall resources was not itself based on a proper process but would have been based on an estimate of time which would have been assumed to be correct.    </p>

Because, as I have found, Sky was induced to enter into the Letter of Agreement by the negligent misrepresentations made prior to the Letter of Agreement, Sky claims that, but for the negligent misrepresentation, it would have been able to recover as damages for breach of contract and therefore the damages are claimed as a head of damages for negligent misrepresentation.  </p>

He also says that the “double log-on” problem was caused by and inherent to the way that EDS had chosen to approach the implementation of Phase 1 and occurred as a result of the CA logging onto Chordiant. He says that Chordiant would then do a double log- on to the DCMS and although EDS explained that the idea was to increase the CA's productivity by speeding up the screen navigation, the step doubled the number of users logged onto the system.  </p>

This function allowed users to logon to the system but when the number of concurrent users became too high, as was the case after EDS had effectively doubled the number of user logins, the bug manifested itself by slowing the system down until it eventually "hung” and users were not able to either log-on or log-off. He says that recovering the system then required a lengthy re-boot which effectively rendered the call centres without a system for around an hour. The problem was eventually dealt with by a patch but it was known on the programme that the double log on should have been picked up in EDS’ Full Relief Environment Test, rather than Phase 1 being allowed to go-live by EDS.  </p>

Those problems would have been identified and resolved had the necessary stress and integration testing been carried out before the commencement of the roll-out. As it was, problems with the performance of the system and the telephony meant that the Phase 1 roll-out had to be suspended whilst those problems were resolved. The stress testing was then performed and this led to the satisfactory performance of the system demonstrating that this was a matter of further work which was required rather than a fundamental problem with the Phase 1 such as missing functionality.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">In summary the position is set out by Mark Britton in paragraphs A423 to A427 of the first PA report. The only major milestone of the five due to be completed prior to March 2002 was the first, August Milestone due on 31 August 2001 but only completed on 25 October 2001, some six weeks late and this was subject to remedial actions before sign-off. The August Milestone required the project approach, requirements, analysis and architecture (system design) to be completed. There were 11 minor milestones for the August Milestone and by March 2002 there were still 9 remedial plans open. The August Milestone obviously was of importance because the approach and requirements formed the basis for the continued progress of Phase 2.     </p>

They refer to progress in relation to functional specifications as a result of the Business Service Validation workshops, in the application architecture and in the logical data model. However, EDS say that because of the poor state of the requirements, any further progress required the requirements to be on a firmer basis. Therefore, EDS accept that design and development work was suspended because of this while Joint Application Development (JAD) sessions were held to attempt to clarify requirements. </p>

Whilst EDS may seek to blame Arthur Andersen for the failure to capture the requirements in a proper and timely manner, Arthur Andersen were a sub-contractor to EDS and EDS were responsible for any lack of performance by Arthur Andersen. In addition, there was clearly an obligation on EDS to have sufficient involvement in the process to ensure that the necessary Functional and Non-Functional Requirements were obtained. I do not consider that Sky can be held responsible for the failure to obtain the necessary requirements. Whilst it was their requirements which were being captured, it was for EDS and Arthur Andersen to involve Sky and to ensure that the requirements necessary to the design process were captured.     </p>

His view is that the validity of the architectural documentation was further compromised by being based on requirements that had not by that stage been captured and agreed, in particular, the Non-Functional Requirements and there was inadequate basis for believing the architecture would deliver the requirement. He says that a large amount of work remained before the architecture should have been judged mature enough to start detailed design. </p>

EDS say that it was a short conversation, the salient point being that it was agreed that “<span style="font-style:italic">EDS would behave from today as though the new deal was signed</span>”. EDS say that Sky’s case that the effect of this was that Sky removed EDSL as Systems Integrator and that this amounted to an acceptance of EDSL's repudiatory breaches of contract is at odds with the evidence. EDS submit that, even if there had been a repudiatory breach of contract, there was no act of acceptance on the part of Sky, let alone one that would have clearly and unequivocally conveyed to EDS that Sky was treating the Prime Contract as at an end. </p>

The January 2002 Joint Application Development sessions had been aimed at capturing the requirements and EDS was making slow progress and lacked some key resources. There is no doubt that EDS’ performance was poor and by then they were not going to achieve go-live by July 2002 as set out in the Letter of Agreement. There is also no doubt that, as I have found, EDS was in breach of a number of the provisions of the Prime Contract, as varied by the Letter of Agreement.

Those provisions themselves must in my judgment form part of an appreciation of the benefit the parties were intended to derive from the contract. Thus circumstances otherwise within the scope of the termination provisions but falling short of the precise terms would in my judgment not give rise to the right to terminate at common law for the very reason that the parties agreed when and how such circumstances should have that consequence: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Lockland Builders Ltd v.

In particular, if a breach of a term had to reach a degree of seriousness before a contractual termination clause could be applied, it is unlikely that a breach which was less serious would, by itself, amount to a repudiatory breach. Equally, the fact that for a particular breach the contract provided that there should be a period of notice to remedy the breach would indicate that the breach without the notice would not, in itself, amount to a repudiatory breach.      </p>

The issue of costs would not, I consider, have been decisive. Indeed the costs fluctuated during the bid period and this does not seem to have been a major factor in deciding between EDS and PwC. The major factor would have been whether Sky would have proceeded with PwC and Siebel when there was a clear preference for Chordiant. The evidence shows that PwC were not prepared to offer Chordiant. PwC had a business relationship with Siebel and given the aggressive way in which Siebel was promoting itself, I do not consider that PwC would have offered a solution using Chordiant. Stephen Kelly, Senior VicePresident of Chordiant, approached PwC with a view to partnering them in the Sky bid and he reported to Mike Hughes that he had encountered “significant hostility”. Mike Hughes tried to persuade PwC to combine with EDS and Chordiant but this came to nothing, in all probability because Chordiant was not approved by PwC. Richard Freudenstein gave evidence to similar effect. In my judgment, there was no realistic prospect of PwC using Chordiant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">I consider that the time factor would have been so important that if EDS disclosed the true position as to timescale then Sky would have moved to favour PwC much more strongly. The position would not just have depended on Sky’s view of the uncertain time but EDS’ position on time would, in my view, have eroded Sky’s confidence generally. With costs being effectively a neutral factor, given a choice of EDS with Chordiant with an uncertain time frame and PwC with Siebel and golive in nine months, in my judgment the preference would have moved to PwC. I have no doubt that Sky and particularly Mike Hughes would have again tried to push PwC to accept Chordiant but that PwC would again have resisted that, as EDS accept in paragraph 1199(1) of their written closing submissions. Given the choice between PwC with Siebel or no alternative to EDS, I consider it very likely that Sky would have chosen PwC.              </p>

After selection and the Letter of Intent, the process commenced which was to lead to the signing of the Prime Contract. The scope changed and the estimates of time and cost changed. That did not however nullify the representation that in the EDS Response EDS had carried out a proper analysis of the amount of elapsed time needed to complete the initial delivery and go-live of the contact centre and that they held the opinion that, and had reasonable grounds for holding the opinion that they could and would deliver the project within the timescales referred to in the Response. Nor did that lead to the discovery of deceit. Rather the process continued with EDS making new time and cost estimates. Even without the further misrepresentation which was made prior to the Prime Contract, in my judgment, the chain of causation leading up to the signing of the Prime Contract was established and not broken. That is sufficient to permit Sky to recover the losses caused by entering into the Prime Contract. They were caused, as required by the tort of deceit, by the misrepresentation. </p>

First, this gives an independent cause of action which would give Sky the ability to recover damages caused by entering into the Prime Contract. Secondly, there was a continuing misrepresentation in the sense that EDS were representing both prior to selection and the Letter of Intent and then prior to the Prime Contract that  they had carried out a proper analysis of the amount of elapsed time needed to complete the initial delivery and go-live of the contact centre and that they held the opinion that, and had reasonable grounds for holding the opinion that they could and would deliver the project within the timescales referred to in the Response. Thirdly, quite apart from EDS being able to assert that there was a break in the chain of causation, the misrepresentation prior to the Prime Contract maintained the chain of causation. </p>

They conducted a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis to compare the options of continuing with EDS or proceeding with AA. That analysis shows that the strengths of continuing with EDS were that EDS’ senior management was committed to delivering and that the EDS team was confident that delivery of Phase 1 would be possible within the timeframes.

In the summary of what had been discussed the first objective was identified as “<span style="font-style:italic">discuss and review the commercial decision whether or not to continue with EDS as the Phase 2 integrator</span>”. The three options were for EDS to continue as SI, for AA to replace EDS as SI, for Sky to assume SI responsibility or to stop Phase 2, which involved terminating the contract with EDS and possibly appointing another SI. It was stated that the option of continuing Phase 2 with another SI (ie not EDS or AA) was not considered because “<span style="font-style:italic">the lead time to appoint another SI would push Phase 2 delivery out too far</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">the cost would probably be significantly higher than the current EDS estimate</span>”. It was added that such an appointment could be considered as part of the “Stop Phase 2” option after due consideration. The consideration of the options identified major concerns with EDS’ ability to deliver and some concerns about AA’s ability to deliver. Price, risk and legal ramifications were seen to be lower with the option of continuing with EDS. In the conclusions, the option of continuing with EDS was said to be untenable because of Sky’s lack of confidence in EDS’ ability to deliver. There were concerns that AA did not have the necessary large scale Chordiant CRM delivery experience. The recommendation was for Sky to assume SI responsibility, depending on Sky’s willingness to accept certain points. It was also said that it was believed that the eventual CRM Programme cost would be significantly higher than that quoted by EDS. </p>

He said that having started from the position that he thought they could deliver because so much was at stake and because of what they were telling him, he was making a commercial judgment that continuing with EDS was the best option. If he had thought they could not deliver he would not have taken that option.  </p>

Sky considered three options: to continue with EDS, to continue with AA or to take over themselves. There was also a fourth option which was to consider other third parties. In deciding on which option to take it is clear that there were two competing factors in the case of the option of continuing with EDS. First there was the concern with EDS’ ability to deliver which was a negative factor. Secondly there was the positive factor in the form of the commercial package which EDS was offering. In that balancing exercise the question was whether the commercial factors outweighed the concern that EDS would not be able to deliver.  </p>

This found recognition in the SWOT analysis which mentioned that EDS senior management were committed to delivering and that the EDS team were confident that delivery of Phase 1 would be possible within the timeframes. EDS’ representations that they had developed an achievable plan, which had been the product of proper analysis and re-planning was evidently part of this.  </p>

In coming to the overall conclusion it is difficult to doubt him when he says that he was relying on what EDS was telling him, which included the relevant representations. In my judgment, the commercial factors alone were insufficient to overcome the real concerns which Sky had about EDS’ ability to perform. It seems to me that if EDS had not represented that </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">In order to use the CoCoMo II model in relation to a Siebel development Robert Worden had to consider two further matters. First, whether it was necessary to adjust the number of Chordiant SLOC for the Chordiant component in order to obtain the equivalent number of Siebel SLOC. On the basis that much of the development would have needed to be carried out in Java to construct a nonSiebel component to accommodate the inability of the Siebel database to represent much of Sky's business information, Robert Worden assumed that 717,000 SLOC, the number of SLOC required for the Siebel based functionality, integration and non-functional test, would have been the same as that required for the Chordiant component of the actual system which was developed in Java. Subsequently, the experts agreed a reduced SLOC count in their Third Joint Memorandum of 31 March 2008. This reduced the number of hand-written SLOC to 577,377 and this then formed the basis of revised estimates by Robert Worden.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Secondly, as set out in paragraphs 1173 and 1174 of his fourth report Robert Worden considered that the values of the scale factors and cost drivers chosen for the CoCoMo II model would differ in a number of respects for a Siebel based project compared to a Chordiant based project. As a result, he adjusted the scale factor “RESL” and the cost drivers “PLEX” and “TOOL” to allow for the greater difficulty of developing in Siebel VB rather than in Java and for the difficulties presented by the split of the application between a Siebel based component and a non-Siebel component.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">He considered that, in many areas, the effort which PwC would have expended was similar to that which a CSI would have expended because it was not dependent on the functionality offered by Siebel. This was therefore his approach to estimating effort in the case of Arbor Billing, the Data Warehouse, Data Migration and other smaller areas. He considered that in some areas, for instance Channels and Correspondence, using Siebel would have saved effort because of the pre-built functionality which it offered and he took this into account. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">The estimate for elapsed time for PwC was again based on the CoCoMo II elapsed time formula, assuming a schedule compression of 85% compared to the nominal schedule. In Robert Worden’s fourth report this produced an estimate of 53.5 months for the development. To this, he added a further 7 months to allow for requirements analysis, and for the probability that, as had proved to be the case for EDS, PwC would not have agreed a contract with Sky and completed programme mobilisation until the end of November 2000. In revisions to his figures made on 15 April 2008, he added a further three months to allow for Increments 2.4 and 2.5, and the CoCoMo II elapsed time estimate was reduced to 49.5 months to reflect revised SLOC figures and hence reduced effort. The resulting estimate was that PwC would have required 59.5 months elapsed time to deliver the CRM system. On this view, PwC would have delivered the system in July 2005, some eight months before Sky actually delivered it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">PA's first report calculated the effort which would have been required by an ASI taking over in July 2001 by taking Neil Douglas’ function point estimate of the system as at March 2002 with the addition of a 10% contingency to increase confidence in the estimated size and multiplying it by the productivity figure of 16 hours per function point. This produced a figure of 36,817 man-days, to which Ian Murray added 1000 man-days to account for data migration (which was not captured by the function point count) and an 8 week assessment phase which would have been required by the incoming Systems Integrator.

They obviously did not want to commit to those figures without an 8 week scoping study but I do not see that this deprives the estimates of their main purpose which was to provide an estimate based on the information they had at the time. What is clear is that there was a degree of uncertainty in PwC’s estimate because of the need for the scoping study which might change the estimates as a result of further information. This is reflected both by the need for the 8 week scoping study and by the fluctuations in the price to which EDS refer. Whilst I do not consider that the estimates in the PwC Response could be relied on as being equivalent to final estimates, they represented a significant piece of evidence which could be used as a starting point for an estimate of the time and cost for the PwC CRM System.   </p>

Uncertainty in a software estimate results from uncertainty in how the decisions will be resolved. As you make a greater percentage of those decisions, you reduce the estimation uncertainty. As a result of this process of resolving decisions, researchers have found that project estimates are subject to predictable amounts of uncertainty at various stages. The Cone of Uncertainty in Figure 4-1 shows how estimates </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">The diagram shows that at the base of the cone, represented by “Initial Concept” there is a range of uncertainty of 4 to 0.25 times the estimate whilst at the apex of the cone there is zero uncertainty when the software is complete. In the intermediate stages, at “Approved Product Definition” the range is 2 to 0.5; at “Requirements Complete” the range is 1.5 to 0.67 and at “User Interface Design Complete” the range is 1.25 to 0.8.          </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">There is no doubt that the cone of uncertainty reflects the fact that software estimates made at an early stage have inherent uncertainties. The PwC estimate was clearly made at an early stage and therefore cannot be taken as being what it would have cost or how long it would have taken for PwC to complete the PwC CRM System. However, I consider that it provides a reasonable foundation or starting point for estimating the time and cost for the Siebel package implementation. In using that estimate, the Cone of Uncertainty demonstrates that a degree of caution should be applied as to the accuracy of any estimate made at such an early stage when compared to the ultimate outcome. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">In my view, PwC’s estimate of time and effort contained within the PwC Response can be relied upon as a starting point for an assessment of the time and effort for the PwC CRM System but must take account of the uncertainty in that starting figure given the early stage at which the estimate was made. This is reflected both in the need for a scoping study and also by the need to define the requirements, particularly in the context of the use of a Siebel package which would, I consider, have taken time and added to the element of uncertainty in the estimate in PwC’s Response.                              . </p>

I do not gain much insight into the ability of Siebel to match Sky’s requirements from the general material put before me. It is clear that Siebel is used in the telecommunications sector and that some problems have arisen but the documents dealing with those problems explain the situation comparatively superficially and, in any event, it is difficult to compare Sky’s requirements with the requirements of that sector. In any case, it is always necessary to treat with caution information which is produced as publicity for a company. In this case there are Oracle Case Studies which set out achievements for Slovak Telecom and Manitoba Telecom. Equally the same caution has to be exercised when industry publications give information about problems on particular projects.           </p>

However Sky rely on the fact that PwC would in fact also have made use of Siebel’s eCommunications package. EDS contend that PwC may not have used this further development in Siebel and refer to the fact that there was no mention of this package in PwC’s bid documentation. It seems to me that when a Systems Integrator specifies a package in its bid, the choice of that particular package is not cast in stone. If a further version or a particular development of that package or some other associated package were to become available, a competent Systems Integrator will review the advantages and disadvantages of using that further development. In this case I think it is likely that PwC would have made use of the  Siebel eCommunications package. That was essentially accepted by Robert Worden in cross-examination on Day 79. The eCommunications package provided functionality particularly in the area of sales which would have made PwC’s task of implementing the CRM system for Sky easier and, on that basis, I consider that PwC would have been likely to have used it just as they would have used any available developed software which would have assisted them. Therefore the basis on which the fit should be assessed is Siebel 6 with eCommunications.  </p>

I consider that the risk of problems in a major upgrade would have made such an approach inadvisable. On the basis that Siebel 7 was released in or after October 2001, I do not consider that this would have been adopted as part of the Siebel solution, on any view. Further, there is mention by PA of the use of a data warehouse component for Siebel, eAnalytics. On the evidence before me I am not persuaded that this would have been available at the relevant time or, in any event, that it would have been advisable to use it.  </p>

Part of that analysis related to the suitability of Siebel. It seems that the view of that department was that either Siebel or Chordiant could be used. It is clear, though, that the Sky business users wanted to have the flexibility of the Chordiant framework implementation which gave them more ability to tailor their own processes. They saw the Siebel package as being less attractive in that it would tend to dictate the business processes so that the “out of the box” functionality provided by that package could be used without significant development.  </p>

Whilst she indicated that a strength of Siebel was that it had more than 80% of the required functionality “out of the box”, I accept EDS’ submission that this was a general indication and was not specific to Sky. Obviously it depended on the extent to which Sky’s requirements could be met by such functionality and also whether Sky were prepared to alter their business processes to use the “out of the box” functionality. Andy Waddell recalls in his evidence that Sky’s view was that about 70% of their functionality might be met “out of the box”, leaving about 30% to be developed.        </p>

He therefore carried out a data mapping exercise by which he sought to determine the extent to which Siebel could meet Sky’s requirements by comparing the detail of Siebel’s data model with the Enterprise Class Model that Sky built for the Actual CRM System (‘the Rose model’). Robert Worden’s view was that if Siebel’s data model did not contain entities that matched Sky’s Enterprise Class Model, it could not hold the data that Sky needed for its business and, if Siebel could not hold Sky’s business data, then he considered that it would follow that Siebel could not meet Sky’s requirements. </p>

There are, though, limitations to Robert Worden’s analysis which have been properly identified by PA. First, the Rose model reflected the data structure for a Chordiant framework application which would not be the same as the data structure for a Siebel package application. Secondly, some data would be located either in the generic database tables in Siebel or elsewhere within or outside the Siebel package. </p>

My conclusion is that, subject to the inherent limitations of a data mapping exercise, a working figure of 60 to 75% provides a reasonable estimate of the data fit between Sky’s requirements and the Siebel package. However, as Mark Britton pointed out, the proportion of functionality “out of the box” is likely to be much lower.   </p>

In particular, as Mark Britton effectively accepted, input would be needed from the Siebel organisation to be confident of being able to move from the Demonstrator to the whole system. I consider that there are certain features of the Demonstrator about which caution is indicated in the Siebel manuals and which are likely to cause problems when scaled up. This would, to that extent, undermine the conclusions to be derived from the Demonstrator. I therefore consider that the conclusions from the Demonstrator, whilst useful in showing what can be done and indicating that the package has rich “out of the box” functionality, cannot, without more, be taken to reflect the potential fit of Siebel to the whole of the Sky’s requirements for the CRM project. </p>

Part of this would have been due to the fact that the requirements were too complex to be catered for without bespoke development. In addition, even if a solution were available “out of the box” or with little development, I am far from persuaded that those responsible for Sky’s business would have been satisfied with a “vanilla” solution but, consistent with the “blue sky” or “clear blue water” philosophy of Mike Hughes, they would have </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Robert Worden considers that the rules for the Mk II technique rules require every alternative pathway through a use case to be counted as a separate logical transaction and that Neil Douglas has failed to do this. Robert Worden describes “alternative pathways” as branches or places within a transaction where the process can follow different alternative pathways depending on the data that is being processed. Robert Worden considers that any reasonable counting method would take account of such alternative pathways because they probably make a big difference to the size of a system. He says that alternative pathways through a piece of functionality may require to be counted because the software required to provide such functionality may make a difference to the size of the system and this would not be sufficiently recognised by counting a single logical transaction. He says that Neil Douglas has largely ignored alternative pathways through a logical transaction, each of which may<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>involve several elementary interactions with the user.  </p>

Small systems generally exhibit lower average [productivity indexes] than large systems. We can only speculate as to the reasons but two important influences may be management influence and economies of scale. Larger projects may have higher profiles and are often strategically important to the organization. For this reason they are generally managed and staffed by more skilled and experienced teams of managers. They are more likely to be heavily capitalised with access to the best technology available. This may explain in part why they perform better. There may be economies of scales enjoyed by large projects. The typical startup activities and learning curve have less impact when spread out over a longer project schedule... Small systems on the other hand are often managed in a more informal fashion. Team members must slice time between several smaller projects. Small projects often have a lower priority and so on. The start-up period occupies a greater percentage of a short project’s schedule.

First, much of the data is based on IFPUG Function Point data and the relationship between MkII and IFPUG Function Point counts for different size projects cannot be easily derived. Secondly, there is little MkII Function Point data within the data sets and very little data above 1000 function points. Thirdly, on the data I do not consider that for a large project it is appropriate to assume that there will be economies of scale unless the project can be dealt with as a number of smaller sub-projects or there are other special characteristics to differentiate it. This, in my view, is not the case here. Fourthly, I am not persuaded that the accuracy of Neil Douglas’ function point count is a factor which can be used to justify a reduction in the estimated effort for each function point, as Ian Murray suggested. There is still uncertainty in estimating the amount of effort and attempting to modify the productivity factor of hours per function point is not, in principle, an appropriate way of dealing with uncertainty in the number of function points. </p>

On this analysis, he concludes that a competent Systems Integrator would have required 12,906 man-months to implement Sky’s Chordiant-based solution, with an elapsed time of 49.5 months. He then adjusts this estimate for the PwC and ASI CRM Systems. </p>

He explained in evidence on Day 85 that he looked at Sky's cost spreadsheet for March 2006, converted the effort to man-months and, looking at each major component of the effort and considering what went wrong or what might have been saved, arrived at an estimate of what a competent Systems Integrator would have done. </p>

They rely on his explanation in evidence on Day 85 that his approach has only been selective in that: “<span style="font-style:italic">Where I believe the evidence is reliable and gives me useful constraints on the number, I have used it and where I believe there is reason not to trust a number or that the number is inappropriate, I have always used the most appropriate numbers.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">In my view the treatment of generated code has to be approached with care and the end purpose for which the SLOC count is to be used has to be taken into account. However, I do not consider that generated code can simply be ignored nor do I think that the CoCoMo II model can simply be applied to handwritten code on the basis that, as Neil Douglas suggests, the model somehow takes into account the element of generated code. That seems an incorrect approach, particularly given the wide variance in amount of generated code in any project. It is also contrary to industry practice as set out in Barry Boehm’s book, the two papers and the email from Brad Clark. Whilst I accept that Robert Worden’s determination of expressiveness and his percentage reduction are both highly subjective figures, he has in my view identified the correct concept and the necessary factors to be taken into account. In all the circumstances, given the estimating process which is under review, I consider that Robert Worden’s analysis provides a reasonable measure of the equivalent handwritten code to account for generated code given my view that some allowance must be made for the work involved in designing and testing that code.  </p>

They refer to a change to the ‘RESL’ scale factor which reflects the architectural and risk resolution attributes of a project by one increment from ‘High’ to ‘Nominal’  on the ground that ‘<span style="font-style:italic">adding large amounts of Visual Basic to Siebel raises more difficult architectural issues than using a Chordiant/J2EE framework</span>’. Sky say that leaving aside the question of whether Robert Worden is correct in identifying that there is a difficulty by adding large amounts of Visual Basic to Siebel,  it is apparent that the translation of his opinion into a value for the RESL scale factor is a highly subjective one. Sky refer to the CoCoMo guidance relating to RESL as illustrating how difficult it is. They say that the estimator is required to reach a conclusion by balancing six separate and rather nebulous project characteristics including the adequacy of risk management plans, schedule and budget, time devoted to architectural issues, availability of software architects, tool support and ‘<span style="font-style:italic">level of uncertainty in key architecture drivers</span>’. </p>

For the purposes of their exercise, as set out in PA’s fifth report at paragraph 182, Neil Douglas adopted Robert Worden’s settings of all cost drivers except four of the six relating to personnel capabilities (ACAP, PCAP, PCON and APEX), which were altered to reflect their view of the likely attributes of a competent Systems Integrator undertaking the Actual CRM development. PA say that the adjustments made to the cost drivers, if applied to his calculations, are sufficient to reduce his Chordiant CoCoMo estimates by 60% and his Siebel estimates by more than 75%. </p>

EDS point out that, as Neil Douglas set out in paragraph 596 of PA’s third report, he used the scale factors and effort multipliers selected by Robert Worden in his calculations and stated that he believed that they were generally appropriate for the purposes of estimating cost and duration of the Sky CRM Project with a Chordiant based solution. He did indicate that in some circumstances, such as Product Complexity (CPLX) and Architecture/Risk Resolution (RESL), he believed that the multiplier should be Nominal rather than High, but nonetheless used the same figures as Robert Worden. Similarly, EDS point out that whilst Ian Murray referred to the potential subjectivity introduced by the effort multipliers/cost drivers, he said at paragraph 132 of PA’s fifth report that he agreed that Robert Worden’s selection of values were chosen appropriately. <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Analysis  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">It is clear that the CoCoMo II method is very sensitive to the choice of values for the costs drivers/effort multipliers and the scale factors. That means that the figure chosen contains a large element of judgment and that two experts could reasonably differ in their views of the values to be used. The evidence indicates that in their reports neither Neil Douglas nor Ian Murray put forward a serious challenge to Robert Worden’s views on the relevant values, although they have now made some criticisms of those values. Overall, I do not find that those criticisms are made out. Rather, they indicate that there can be different views and that effort estimates based on CoCoMo II have to be seen in the context of a sensitivity analysis based upon the adoption of alternative values.  </p>

However, as explained above, like the avoidable costs analysis, this estimate is not directly applicable to the effort that would have been needed by PwC to provide a Siebel package, so that his estimate for the PwC CRM System has to be substantially reduced to reflect the fact that a Siebel package implementation would have needed much less bespoke development than he considered to be needed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Approaching the Sky estimate, I consider that the 839 man-months based on the PwC estimate should be increased because of the stage at which they made that estimate. I consider that a substantial increase is required in the figure of 839 man-months. My assessment is that about a further two-thirds of that effort should be allowed, giving a figure of 1,400 man-months. I consider that this would reflect the likely outturn of the effort from that starting point, given the need for the 8 week scoping study and the need for the capture of the requirements both of which I have no doubt would have increased the scope of the project.  I note that originally PA allowed a 20% contingency at paragraph F182 of their first report. I consider that a larger amount is needed to cater for the uncertainty at the ITT stage.   </p>

If the Baseline 2 function point count were to be 31,000, as I have found by allowing for the margin of error and the lack of entities, then the 30% needing bespoke development would be 9,300 function points. I note from Table 12 of PA’s fifth report that on average 5.5 hours per function point represents, in Ian Murray’s view, the productivity level implied in PwC’s Response based on the Baseline 2 function point count. The implied productivity would be greater for the increased function point count. On the original function point count the implied productivity was 3.38 to 4.01 for the bulk of the development work and I propose to take 3.7 hours per function point as representing the implied productivity in the PwC Response for the areas which I consider would require bespoke development.   </p>

The overall period from 31 July 2000 would then have been 28.54 months (18 + 5.54 + 4 +1), giving an implementation date of, say, 17 December 2002.  In these circumstances the implememtation would have been delayed until 1 February 2003 for the reasons set out in paragraph F 189 of PA’s final report.                 </p>

In this case there is not the difficulty in Robert Worden’s assumption concerning the development effort of Siebel but there is concern about the avoidable loss method.  Again, the approach used by PA provides a more transparent method but I must consider Robert Worden’s conclusions to see whether the outcome of an amended assessment based on  PA’s approach appears reasonable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">Based on 19 days per month this figure of 90,226 man-days gives 4,749 manmonths of effort. Robert Worden’s estimate is summarised at section 10.6 of his fourth report as amended on 15 April 2008 at 12,906 man-months. This includes 4,433 man-months for “Chordiant + integration + Other” based on the SLOC value and the CoCoMo II effort formula. Given the concerns that I have expressed about the deficiencies in the avoidable costs method and given the sensitivity of the CoCoMo II method to the parameters chosen, I consider that the adjusted assessment based on Ian Murray’s approach provides a reasonable basis for estimating the effort. On that basis, I propose to use a figure of the total effort of an ASI of  4,749 man-months.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Time  </span></p>

His view is that the useful work amounts very approximately to 150 man-months out of the 1,000 man-months that EDS expended overall. The quantum experts agree the estimate of wasted costs on the basis of Robert Worden’s opinion at £15.4 million in paragraphs 3.78 to 3.84 of the Revised Third Joint Memorandum.  </p>

Although the Quantum experts raised the question of whether the damages should be discounted, I have had no submissions on that issue. I therefore find that the wasted costs are £16.3 million and this forms the basis of the award of damages for breach of the Prime Contract prior to July 2001.</p>

As set out above there is an issue as to the basis on which the damages are to be calculated. Sky claim that damages should be measured by reference to the costs incurred after 6 March 2002 in reaching the stage of development that EDS would have reached if they had expended the effort they had charged for in performing their obligations in accordance with their obligations under the Prime Contract as amended. Sky’s calculation of damages is based on the cost of reaching the stage in the CoCoMo lifecycle that EDS should have reached by 6 March 2002. Whilst EDS do not contend that this is not a possible basis, they contend that the appropriate measure is the costs wasted prior to 6 March 2002. </p>

As Sky did carry out work to reach the appropriate stage then, in principle, they should be entitled to recover the cost of the effort they in fact expended. Unless EDS can establish that Sky failed to mitigate their loss or some loss was not caused by the breach, the actual effort expended by Sky should be recoverable. In this case, EDS has not established either a failure to mitigate or that loss was caused by some other matter. I therefore consider that Sky’s damages should be based on the effort Sky in fact expended in reaching the relevant stage.        </p>

In their written closing submissions, EDS have not dealt with the six complaints but at paragraph 1517 of their written closing submissions have stated that, on the basis of what Ian Murray had said in evidence “<span style="font-style:italic">it seems unnecessary to examine the detailed criticisms advanced by EDS. To the extent it is necessary EDS’ position is set out in its IT openings and in [the IT experts’ Third Joint Memorandum]</span>”. EDS went further in their written closing submissions in reply where at paragraph 338 they confirmed their view that Ian Murray’s view that a competent Systems Integrator would have performed much better than Sky made the investigation of the six complaints somewhat academic. EDS did however attach a 15 page table of extracts in relation to the six complaints. They did not, however, develop any submissions on the basis of that material.           </p>

First, the fact that Sky took over as Systems Integrator when they did and therefore became involved in managing the CRM Project and the workstreams does not mean that their conduct must be judged against that of a reasonably competent Systems Integrator so that they can only recover the costs of such a Systems Integrator. Secondly, the fact that EDS accept that Sky’s decision to take over as Systems Integrator was reasonably made meant that they did not go down the route of employing another party to act as a reasonable competent Systems Integrator. Thirdly, the fact that they employed experienced people and had expert advice and support available does not mean that they, as an organisation, have to be judged by the standard of a reasonably competent Systems Integrator.     </p>

The fact that Sky had leadership of the overall CRM programme at all times and had close involvement in the definition of the functional specifications at Baseline 2 shows that Sky was acting reasonably. After Sky took over as Systems Integrator, the fact that they retained experienced project managers and made use of the availability of expert advice and support from a range of specialist contractors including PwC, IBM, Chordiant and CSG (formerly Lucent) also indicates that they acted reasonably. Unless, as I have said above, there was some action by a third party which broke the chain of causation then Sky can recover for the loss incurred unless they acted unreasonably.          </p>

The underlying purpose of the new CRM System was to provide Sky with a replacement for DCMS about which it is clear that Sky had concerns both in terms of performance and stability. I consider that Sky reasonably decided in 2003 that they had to replace the core DCMS functionality by introducing the equivalent functionality on the new CRM System as a first priority in the circumstances in which they found themselves at that stage. Whilst the decision was taken at a time when Sky thought that the implementation of Increment 2.3 would only take a few months, they were aware of the inevitable risk that even the de-scoped system would not be available within that timescale.  </p>

In relation to any delay that then occurred the natural and reasonable reaction of Sky would not have been to seek ways to increase the scope so as to re-introduce the de-scoped parts of the project with its impact of the programme and resources. The fact that the de-scoped parts of the project might have involved a small amount of effort to achieve significant benefits does not, in my view, render the decision to de-scope those parts or not to re-introduce them at a later stage unreasonable when viewed in the light of all the circumstances relevant at the time.          </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.24in">I consider that the greatest benefit and improvement was obtained by the introduction of the stand-alone KMS rather than hard copy documents which had to be referred to by the CA to deal with a call. The subsequent integration with the Chordiant-wrapper of DCMS and then with the Actual CRM System has, in my judgment, produced additional availability of and accessibility to the KMS. So far as the date on which PwC would have delivered the KMS, on the basis of my finding that PwC would have delivered the PwC CRM System after February 2002, I consider that the KMS would have been delivered as part of that integrated PwC CRM System and not as a separate delivery in February 2002.              </p>

This was the basis on which Sky approached this case. First, consistent with that position Scott Mackay gave evidence that the Baseline 2 FS reflected Sky’s business requirements for the CRM System, as set out in the ITT. He said in paragraphs 22 and 26 of his second witness statement that his main concern was to ensure that the requirements in the Baseline 2 FS, once completed, could be tied back to the original table of requirements set out at section 2.4 of the ITT and so reflected what Sky required from the system and encompassed all the requirements of Sky’s business, as expressed in the ITT. Secondly, this approach is reflected more generally in Sky’s submissions. In their written opening submissions at paragraph 1377.2 they stated that the Baseline 2 FS provided “<span style="font-style:italic">the ‘largest’ statement of Sky’s requirements</span>” and in their written IT opening submissions they stated at paragraph 179 that “<span style="font-style:italic">Baseline 2 is, if anything, likely to represent a more extensive set of requirements than that which PwC would have needed to fulfil. It follows that Baseline 2 represents an upper bound on what PwC would have been </span></p>

It is therefore necessary to look at how this “end product” was further defined as the project progressed. In the case of the PwC Siebel based CRM System, the question is raised whether the PwC Response to the ITT provides a better definition of the functionality of the Siebel based system than the Baseline 2 FS which, of necessity, is based on a Chordiant CRM System.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">As can be seen from the PwC Response, PwC were much more circumspect in the terms in which they submitted their Response to the ITT. They proposed an eight week definition phase at the start of the project which they referred to as being “key” and producing a “blueprint” which “<span style="font-style:italic">will contain your view of the exact scale and scope of your ‘world class’ solution. Our cost estimates will then be aligned with this.</span>” As a result, PwC stated that their Response was submitted on a “for information only” basis and did not constitute an offer capable of acceptance for the implementation of the project. In those circumstances, I consider that the best guide to scope would be the Baseline 2 FS in which Sky set out their ITT requirements. I am not persuaded that in respect of the three enhancements the Siebel system would have had significant differences in functionality from those expressed in the requirements incorporated into the Baseline 2 FS, although the manner of achieving those requirements would necessarily have differed in a Siebel package application.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">It is evidently not possible to consider the Actual CRM System and the DCMS in a vacuum and I do not consider that Helen Jenkins does so. It is clear that over a period of time Sky developed strategies for churn reduction and continued to develop these strategies post-implementation of the Actual CRM System. That meant that, at any given time, the strategies would be different. If a particular strategy was not available in the “business as usual” scenario and it is that strategy which reduces churn then the mere fact that it is introduced with the CRM System does not mean that the churn reduction is to be attributed to the CRM System. If however that strategy can be implemented more effectively with the CRM System then that incremental improvement is a churn reduction benefit attributable to the Actual CRM System. Equally, if a new strategy can only be implemented effectively because of the functionality in the Actual CRM System and would have been ineffective with the DCMS then there is a churn reduction benefit attributable to the Actual CRM System. I shall therefore approach the question on this basis.            </p>

Merlin Stone has used Tracker Reports. Helen Jenkins has used reports referred to as “State of the Nation” reports. In addition, Helen Jenkins has chosen to divide customers between “Basic” and “Premium” customers dependent on their subscriptions. I shall now consider these differences.  There is also one particular matter relied on by Helen Jenkins. She says that there should be an adjustment to the Cuscan figures because 2% of those cancelling will do so as a result of the death of a customer and that category is not saveable.  In addition, I have formed certain views about the percentages which the experts have used.   </p>

The methodology used to produce the Tracker Reports was that market researchers telephoned customers who had left Sky within the previous four weeks and asked them if they had to give a single reason for cancelling their subscription to Sky, what would it be. The answers given by the customers were summarised and then allocated to one of a number of pre-defined reasons by coding them according to a coding sheet. A table was then produced allocated the number of answers to each of the Tracker Reasons. A monthly Tracker Report was then prepared.  </p>

She says that, for example, the CRM system is more likely to be able to save a premium churner with “poor perceptions of value” than a basic churner because the CA has more options for downsizing the premium customer: She has accordingly sought to assess the impact of the system separately for each category of churner and each churn reason.  </p>

Finally, I am not persuaded that because of the lack of relevant data and the need to make simplifying assumptions, the distinction will make any significant overall difference to the outcome of the analysis.

The person who contacts Sky will selfevidently not be the customer but a household member and similar issues will arise such as right sizing for the household. He also points to the evidence of Jo Ashcroft who said that dead customers do apply for new subscriptions and this is referred to the “Lazarus phenomenon”. She also set out the reasons why some customers might cite death as a reason to avoid having to explain cancellation. Merlin Stone also says that many deaths will lead to Syscan.

It seems to me that much lower figures of saveability will apply to each of the reasons and I am not persuaded that any reasoning given by Merlin Stone has justified those figures.

Equally, EDS accepted a point made in Sky’s closing, but not put to Helen Jenkins, that she would have to adjust her 9.5% to take account of the fact that 23% of reasons given by Home Movers were financial for which she now assessed the saveable effect at 5%. This would increase her 9.5% by an additional 1% (5% of 23%) to 10.5%. </p>

First, a December 2006 document produced by Clarity Blue and referred to as a Homemover Diagnostic in which that organisation analysed the position at the stage when people moved home and reviewed strategies for Sky to deal with it. This included the implementation of a dedicated Home Moving Team which was subsequently adopted by Sky. As part of the analysis they set out underlying reasons why customers considered leaving Sky at the point of moving home. These were, it seems, taken from the Boston Consulting Group document referred to below: Financial 23% which were broken down into various reasons which, as Merlin Stone said, were similar to Value for Money reasons; Product no longer meets needs 17%; Can’t have at new home 18%; Go to competitor 6%; Reassess once moved 11%; Customer Service issues 2%; Technical issues 3% and Other 20% against which Clarity Blue stated that “<span style="font-style:italic">at least a third of these causes of cancellation should be addressable</span>”.           </p>

I am not persuaded that this limitation on the MIDAS database is something that was caused by the DCMS but rather I accept the evidence given by Neil Spencer-Jones that this could have been overcome by Sky without difficulty.  </p>

There is also some benefit in being able to avoid re-keying in the customer’s number and address into the FMS and DCMS, although I accept that this was limited because the FMS had an integrated address checker and there is no evidence that this was a problem. Indeed there seems to be only 2% churn because of a problem with the home moving process.  </p>

I have preferred the approach of Helen Jenkins but consider that her percentages need to be increased to take account of Sky’s submissions. I consider that her estimate for the core Actual CRM System of 2% is low and should be increased to 5% to reflect improvements in navigability, the integration of the FMS and the ability to use data for management reporting. I also add 0.5% for the “financial” correction made in EDS’ closing submission. I see no reason to change her percentages of 2.5 % for Merlin, other than to increase it by 0.5% to 3% for the “financial” correction, or to change her 5% for Case Management. Overall therefore I have assessed the percentage saveable as 13.5% (5.5% + 3% + 5%) which at 60% saved gives a saved in practice percentage of 8.1%.  </p>

It is evident from paragraph 95(b) of his first report and his answer to question 10 of his CPR Part 35 responses that originally Merlin Stone concentrated on price and product as influencing a customer’s perception of value for money. However, in his second report he broadened out the aspects which influenced that perception and included image and communication as being factors which could have a positive impact. Equally, if there is poor service quality or the customer feels that they are not being valued as a customer then these aspects can have a negative impact on the perception of Value for Money.

That is not to say that other factors such as image and communication with Sky will not be relevant to the perception of Value for Money and customer satisfaction, but any reduction of churn must take account of the limitations imposed by the main factors. Indeed Merlin Stone has assessed that 30% of the customers who might churn for Value for Money reasons would be saved by the CRM System, compared to 60% for Customer Service or Home Moving because “<span style="font-style:italic">this area of possible churn reduction is highly contingent on Sky’s success in focusing its efforts on adjusting its packages, products and offers to retain those most likely to churn, and in addressing the constant challenges of competition.</span>” </p>

I consider that Merlin Stone’s assessments of 21.6%, 12% and 28.8% are too high. Equally, though, I do not think that Helen Jenkins’ figures reflect the functionality in element 7 (offer eligibility) or element 2 (navigation) which would allow offers to be more accessible and enable the CAs to move around the screen quickly, see the customer’s history and make appropriate offers. Equally, the ability to use the data captured in elements 5 and 13 for the effective management of offers is of importance. As set out above I do not accept that Self-Service will assist in reducing churn.  On this basis I consider that Helen Jenkins’ figure of 2.5% for the core CRM System is too low and that a figure of 5% is more appropriate. On the data available I consider that a figure of 5% for all customers for the impact of Merlin would be appropriate. Thus I consider that the appropriate figure is 10% saveable which, with the 60% factor, gives 6% saved in practice.                   </p>

There will however be improved reaction to technical queries because of knowledge of the customer history and improved navigation in the core functionality of the Actual CRM System. In relation to this aspect, as set out above, I do not consider it appropriate to make a distinction between Basic and Premium customers. Self Service over the period when the customer subscribes to Sky will reduce churn although I accept that, in the end, serious technical problems will not be resolved by this route.

In summary, if a customer misses payment then after a number of days they are given a status known as  “active block”, which results in their Sky TV channels being “blue screened”. Unless the customer pays their outstanding balance within 35 days after they go into “active block” (49 days for invoice customers) their subscription is terminated. Between 45% and 55% of customers who enter  “active block” are terminated. Sky has a “winback” programme for such Syscanners who have been terminated within the last 12 months.

Neither do I think that it is anything near as low as one in 600.

This leaves 70.5% of the general Syscanners who are to be assessed for saveability as general Syscanners.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">I treat the Hidden Cuscanners as equivalent to relatively saveable Cuscanners who I have assessed with a saved in practice percentage of 9% derived from my analysis of poor perception in value above but to take account of the range of reasons which might apply. The general Syscanners have an element of saveability but I consider that Merlin Stone’s figures of 30% being saveable and 40% being saved put the figure far too high. I consider that 10% being saveable and 20% being saved reflects the reality that they are customers who have such serious financial problems that very few are saveable and that the only method by which they might be saved would be by the limited improvement available to save them compared with the ability to save them with strategies using the DCMS. This leads to a saved in practice figure of 2%. The total saved in practice is therefore 1.8%, derived from 0.4% (9% of 4.5%) plus 1.4% (2% of 70.5%). </p>

If Simon Roncoroni took 80% then he started by assuming that 20% of calls were not amenable to Self Service. A further 24% should then be deducted for cancellation/downgrade calls so that only 56 out of 100 calls would be amenable to Self Service. If 45% is applied to this figure then 45% of 56 out of 100 calls would mean that only 25 out of 100 or 25% of Customer Service calls would be transferred to Self-Service.

He therefore concluded that the maximum call rate reduction from web based Self-Service would be 8.5%. I consider that the approach of Neil Spencer-Jones to the assessment of the percentage of Customer Service calls amenable to Self-Service is robust as his analysis is based on Sky data relating to the top 20 transactions which make up 79% of Sky’s annual call volume. He finds that that 56.1% of calls relating to the top 20 transactions relate to Customer Service and that 31.9% of such calls are amenable to Self-Service.

As Sky point out, the case proceeded on the basis that EDS’ case was as set out in Neil SpencerJones’ report and that it would be unfair for EDS to raise these matters only in closing submissions.  On analysis, EDS seek to reduce the percentage by 7.4% (OPPV transactions) and 1% (Customer feedback) which are not claimed but then add back 14% for upgrades. The other figures are in fact criticisms of Neil Spencer-Jones’ assessment of what transactions would be amenable to Self Service. I do not consider that EDS can depart from their expert’s views in this way in their closing submissions. If those criticisms are ignored then EDS’ proportion of top 20 transactions reduces to 23.5% (31.9% less 7.4% less 1%) which represents a percentage of 41.9 % (23.5/56.1) and if 14% is then added back, the result is 55.9% compared to EDS’ figure, based on Neil Spencer-Jones’ evidence, of 56.8%.

However, there was no evidence of how that worked into his calculation. Neil Spencer-Jones accepted that Customer Service was available on the STB but said that he was looking at new Customer Service functionality and, in his view, there was no new Customer Service functionality which would deliver benefit. I have come to the conclusion that there is only limited further Customer Service functionality on the STB compared to what was previously available and my review of Simon Montador’s revised appendix SAM1 demonstrates that. The main difference appears to be that the functionality would be available on the internet which had greater usability. On that basis, I consider that it is the transfer to the internet from phone calls which is of importance in relation to Customer Service rather than a transfer from calls to the STB. The screenshots which were provided during Neil SpencerJones’ evidence minimised the problems which occur in practice and I am not persuaded that new CRM functionality will lead to benefits in terms of transfers from a phone call to Self-Service over the STB which have not been captured by Neil Spencer-Jones’ calculation based on the internet.

It is evident that some such analysis could have been carried out using DCMS and Sky did so.

Thus, if 80 out of 100 calls are being resolved in the first call, the assumption is that the remaining 20 calls will be resolved by 50 to 80 calls with 65 calls being chosen in this case.

He has considered how Sky’s call centre relates to other call centres as set out in the data from the Benchmark Report. The Benchmark Report contains average data for three parameters derived from a range of different call centres: abandoned calls, agent talk time and average call length. Neil Spencer-Jones compares the average values of those parameters with data obtained from Sky’s weekly reports from July 2000 to July 2005. He finds that Sky has 17% higher abandoned call rates; 5% less agent talk time and 15% longer call length. He considers that this data is not consistent with an average figure of 145 and because Sky’s parameters are, in his opinion, “worse” than an average business, he says that this is evidence that Sky should be assessed to operate at the upper end of the range.   </p>

He considers that the relatively small improvement which would be required for Sky to achieve the benchmark would be realised due to the History and Memo functionality, the single view of the customer and the integration of the previous manual “wrap” actions into the “in-flight” call process. In relation to the B1 Scenario, he considers that Sky would have achieved the 80% benchmark within two years of go-live.

Sky say that Neil Spencer-Jones’ view that 100% of abandoned calls were included in the data does not make sense in the light of the number of survey responses which stated that the problem took only one call to resolve. For instance, in 2001/2 where Sky failed to answer 34%, the Teleconomy surveys showed that about 60% of customers said that their issue had been resolved in one call. Sky say that on this basis the other 40% of calls must have taken at least two calls, so that the minimum number of calls to resolve 100 issues would be 140. On Neil Spencer-Jones’ figures 149 calls were required, indicating that 2.2 successful calls were needed per issue. Sky say that this is implausible taking into account the number of people who indicated that they needed between 6 and 15 calls to resolve their case. With a benchmark TCR of 145 equivalent to a FTR of 80%, then the remaining 20 issues would require 3.25 calls per issue and even higher if the TCR was 155.

They also say that Sky’s submission as to the 2.2 successful calls proceeds on the basis that the 60% FTR from the Teleconomy data is accurate but if in fact, taking account of abandoned calls, that represented an 80% FTR, then the figure would be 3.45 which is entirely plausible. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">I have come to the conclusion that it is reasonable to infer that some abandoned calls are likely to have been included by those who reported that two or more calls were needed to resolve their query. I consider, though, that the extent to which abandoned calls were included is much less than Neil Spencer-Jones suggests otherwise the number of people reporting resolution in one call would have been much less. I accept that Simon Roncoroni has erred on the conservative side in reducing the average number of calls. Further, whilst I consider that as finally explained some elements of the Actual CRM System would assist in FTR, I found Simon Roncoroni’s initial explanation of how the introduction of the Actual CRM System in 2006 would assist in reducing FTR far from convincing.  </p>

I also propose that a reduction should be made of about 15% in the resulting “Number of calls in excess of 155”.  </p>

Essentially, those are to apply the views of the churn and call rate experts of each party with the views of both the IT experts for that party and the IT experts for the other party. My findings have not coincided with the views of one party’s experts and so the four illustrative combinations cannot be applied to my findings. The parties recognised that this might be the outcome.

The issue between the parties is as to when the 10% uplift should be applied and whether it should be the only uplift. Richard Boulton applies the 10% uplift to the £137.01 from 17 July 2001 and the same rate throughout the duration of the project. He considers that his approach, which involves assuming that the ASI was charging at the rate of a “best in class” Systems Integrator but producing work at the effort rate of an average Systems Integrator, already potentially undervalues the claim by overcosting the work of the ASI. He compared the weighted average of PwC plus 10% to EDS’ own charges which were about £80 per hour. </p>

In my judgment, the Hidden Cuscanners should be valued as any other saved Cuscanners. I do not accept that it is appropriate to value general Syscanners with financial problems in the same way. As Timothy Hart has set out in his illustration at paragraphs 5.22 and 5.23 of the Revised Third Joint Memorandum, for Sky to gain a benefit from a saved Syscanner, they have to recover their costs of providing the service to that subscriber. I consider that the general Syscanners with financial problems who are saved by the Actual CRM System are likely to make a higher contribution that more than covers the cost to Sky of providing the service. I consider that they are likely to provide a lower contribution than saved Cuscanners and in my judgment a figure of 33% of the value of a saved Cuscanner is appropriate to reflect the nature of the difficulties faced by those who Syscan for financial difficulties compared to those who Cuscan. </p>

This means that his figure before deductions is £242.41, which is 7.1% less than Richard Boulton’s figure.  He then makes a deduction to the contribution from Premium subscribers for the fact that a proportion of Premium subscribers had to be down-sized to be saved and therefore the average contribution will be less than for a normal Premium subscriber. Timothy Hart analysed data and concluded that the average proportion of saved Cuscanners which were saved by down-sizing was 10.3%. He calculates that this is equivalent to a 9.4% reduction in the contribution from all saved Premium Cuscanners. Applying this discount gives an average contribution of £225.57 which represents a 13.5% discount. </p>

However I consider that Timothy Hart’s analysis is, in principle, likely to derive a better assessment of the average contribution. First, whilst it may not be possible to distinguish between basic and premium subscribers by attributing different percentages of each group that are saved in practice, I consider that in calculating loss, given the significant differences in contribution of the two sets of subscribers, it is necessary to relate the average to the proportion of premium and basic Cuscanners in the churner base, not the overall subscriber base. Secondly, an adjustment is appropriate for the fact that some premium subscribers will be saved by downsizing. The figure derived by Timothy Hart appears to me to be logical and the periods used as illustrated in the Revised Appendix 5-3 of the Revised Third Joint Memorandum appear to be appropriate. I do however accept that a small proportion of subscribers might be saved by upgrades and that not all Premium subscribers who downsize will move to become Basic subscribers. The impact of these matters is small. I consider that to allow for these matters a figure of £227 should be used.  </p>

For some of the costs, vouchers or invoices could not be found. Timothy Hart stated in his oral evidence that the sums claimed had more likely than not been incurred by Sky and that the focus was more on whether the costs related to the Actual CRM System.

The robustness of the analysis is confirmed, in my view, by Timothy Hart’s conclusion that in the 47 cases where there were invoices and other documentation, the allocation to the Actual CRM System was found to be correct. On balance I am satisfied that the costs which are set out for IBM/PwC costs have been properly allocated and, where appropriate apportioned to the Actual CRM System.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.24in">This issue between the quantum experts concerns the costs of training that would have been incurred in relation to either the PwC or the ASI CRM Systems, assuming Robert Worden's opinions on the timing of CRM go-live. There is no difference of view based on PA's opinions as to timing. Timothy Hart assumes that the but-for training costs in B1 and B2 on Robert Worden's opinion as to timing would have been £1.9m, which is the actual aggregate cost of both the first abortive and second training sessions. Richard Boulton calculates, based on the actual hours for the first abortive training sessions and CA costs per hour at the relevant times, that the training costs in B1 and B2 would have been £1.3m and £1.0m respectively. This gives rise to a difference with Timothy Hart of £0.6m in B1 and £0.9m in B2.  </p>

He says at paragraph 11 that there was an abortive training session in October 2004 in the run up to anticipated go-live shortly thereafter and that the training was abandoned after 6 weeks as a result of the postponement of the go-live date. This is claimed and included in the Actual CRM System Operating Costs.  </p>

On my findings as to timing, I do not consider that it is correct to assume that there would have been an abortive training session such as that arranged in October 2004. I have no reason to think that on the timing I have found, the particular circumstances which led to this abortive training session would have been replicated. Rather I consider that that the training costs should be based on Richard Boulton’s analysis.   </p>

The case involved hundreds of bundles and thousands of documents. Over a period of 10 months there were 109 hearing days, including submissions, witness and expert evidence. I would wish to thank counsel and solicitors for the way in which they conducted the proceedings. I have been much assisted in the preparation of this judgment by the detailed expert evidence and by the written and hyperlinked submissions which were provided by the parties. I would also like to thank the court staff who ensured that proceedings ran smoothly, including sitting late or early on occasions to ensure witnesses completed their evidence in accordance with the timetable.   </p>
