BSCP were to visit the properties and report. BSCP then visited the site on 18 August 2004 with Mr Spencer of SHL. BSCP said they were broadly in agreement with the opinions and recommendations expressed in the Knowles report dated 25 June 2003. They said that both they and Knowles agreed that there had been some significant settlements of the uncompacted landfill under and around the affected houses. They also said that it was very likely that the fill in settling around the tops of the piles had caused some negative skin friction to develop at the pile/soil interface thereby causing some of the piles to settle. They said that inevitably this had then caused distress in the walls of some houses, evidenced by the extensive cracking. They said they agreed that the cracking in the walls of 6 Barley Close required urgent action to be taken to remedy the situation. </p>

The Encia case came to trial in mid 2007 on the issues of liability, causation of damage and entitlement to contractual indemnity. In the Encia litigation it was ultimately common ground that Encia had not exercised reasonable skill and care in the design and construction of the piling of any of the 94 properties on the part of the estate built by the defendant. The judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Shepherd Homes Ltd v Encia Remediation Limited</span> [2007] EWHC 1710 (TCC) (“the Encia Judgment”) was delivered by Jackson J in July 2007.</p>

Thirdly, there is a question of whether the obligations merged on conveyance. Fourthly, there is a question whether the terms, as properly construed, are affected by the statutory control on contract terms under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (“the 1999 Regulations”) or the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (“UCTA”).

As May LJ said “<span style="font-style:italic">A carpenter's choice of a particular nail or screw is in a sense a design choice, yet very often the choice is left to the carpenter and the responsibility for making it merges with the carpenter's workmanship obligations.</span>” Where a contractor carries out both the design and construction of the works the intention is to avoid the blurred borderline, or sometimes gap, that may exist between the obligation to design and the obligation to construct. In such circumstances, a contractor responsible for both the design and construction who agrees that the works will be carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner, that is with proper skill and care, cannot say that the works were constructed in a proper and workmanlike manner and avoid the same obligation applying to responsibility for the design. The works which include both the design and the construction must be carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner. </p>

It provides in Sections 2 and 3 a remedy where there are Defects or Damage in years 1 and 2 or in 3 to 10. However Section 1 of the Buildmark Cover, which deals with the position before completion, is only concerned with insolvency or fraud of the Builder or with what happens when the Builder fails to do what is instructed by the NHBC.

When paragraph 501 refers to obligations and liabilities which the contractor has “specifically assumed” it must naturally refer to the obligations which arise out of the express terms of the contract with all the incidents which the law ordinarily attaches to them, since those incidents are inherent in them. It may, of course, be possible for the parties to agree otherwise, but unless they have done so, they can only be presumed to have accepted that the ordinary incidents apply. To proceed on any other basis would make commercial life impossible. To say, therefore, that under this form of contract the contractor specifically assumes an obligation to operate the rig but does not specifically assume an obligation to do so carefully is to approach the question from the wrong end. Prima facie it assumes the obligation as expressed and all that the law attaches to it, unless there is agreement to the contrary.</span>” </p>

In this case, it is evident that the purpose of Clause 8 was to ensure that the sales contract constituted the entire contract between the parties. Clause 8 starts by precluding any variations or modifications to the agreement unless they are in writing. It then continues by saying tha<span style="font-style:italic">t “any terms undertakings promises or agreements not set out in this Agreement are released by both parties and shall have no effect.</span>” That evidently is aimed at precludin<span style="font-style:italic">g “terms undertakings promises or agreements</span>” which were the subject of discussion or other consideration by the parties and which could have been but were not set out in the sales contract.

The Claimants say that the foundations of their houses were not designed and constructed as they ought to have been, resulting in uncertainty as to the future performance of the houses and inability to sell at a normal price and that they have already suffered that uncertainty and restriction for 7 to 8 years. The Claimants say that in such circumstances for SHL to contend that the contracts permit SHL to take full payment from the claimant purchasers and provide them with a house that is not readily mortgageable and saleable at a full price because it was badly designed is a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and is contrary to the requirements of fair dealing.</p>

Further it is pointed out that for solicitors executing cut-price domestic conveyancing, the small fee does not allow for time spent trying to guess whether the seller, as a reputable housebuilder, might in the future raise some ingenious argument on its standard terms. The Claimants also refer to the fact that many of the Claimants received a financial inducement to use a solicitor recommended by SHL and submit that, whilst the financial or other arrangements between SHL and that solicitor have not been disclosed, it is likely that the solicitor regarded SHL as reputable and it is unlikely that the solicitor understood that his duty required him to search for possible traps in SHL’s standard wording. The Claimants also say that the fact that they were all represented by solicitors who did not see the possibility of the meanings and effects now contended for by SHL indicates that the unclear language was a trap.</p>

The Act does not in general affect the basis of liability, so the first inquiry is whether or not the person seeking to rely on the terms is in fact under any obligation apart from the term.  Thus, UCTA cannot be argued to apply to all the clauses of the contract as contended for by the Claimants but rather only to any truly exclusionary or exemption clause.  It cannot be used to define what the contractual obligations are in the first place, for example, what terms survive upon completion.</p>

It cannot be suggested that the term is not fully, clearly and legibly expressed or was not given appropriate prominence. No doubt Mr Francis was short of money when he made the contract for the sale and lease-back of the property but it cannot be said that he has been “taken advantage of” unfairly. The very nature of the transaction necessitated that he instructed a solicitor which he did. There was (probably inadmissible) evidence that his solicitor made a careful report to him on the contracts which he was about to sign drawing specific attention to the fact that, if the court granted an order for possession in the event of his being in breach of the terms of the tenancy agreement, he would not receive the final payment. This evidence was probably inadmissible because the matter has to be judged at the time when the contract was made without regard to privileged communications passing between a solicitor and his client. But the fact is that Mr Francis necessarily had the protection of a solicitor at the time and he would have the protection of the court if and when a possession order was sought by the landlord.

	    <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If Clause 8 had that effect I do not consider that the terms would have been expressed fully, clearly and legibly and they would have contained concealed pitfalls in excluding the implied terms. Clause 8 generally deals with other matters and there is no reference to implied terms. Again, albeit unconsciously, I consider that SHL would be taking advantage of the Claimants as house purchasers and whilst they were advised by solicitors, they were not alerted to any problems with the terms. As with Clause 7.1 whilst the opportunity for them to be advised has to be weighed in the overall assessment of good faith, I do not consider that it detracts sufficiently from the other matters to show that there would have been fair and open dealing in this case.</p>

I consider that, on SHL’s contentions as to the meaning of Clauses 7.1, 7.5, 8 and 10, those provisions would  exclude and/or restrict SHL’s liability for breach of an express or implied contractual duty to take reasonable skill and care and/or SHL would by reference to those terms, when in breach, be seeking to exclude or restrict liability or be claiming to be entitled  to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of it or  in respect of the whole or any part of its contractual obligation, to render no performance at all.</p>

	    <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question would then be whether those terms satisfied the requirement of reasonableness. On balance I do not consider that they would. I bear in mind the existence of Buildmark Cover and its limitations, the inequality of bargaining power between the Claimants as house purchasers and SHL as developer at the time the sales contracts were made, the fact that the Claimants had legal advice and the other matters considered under the 1999 Regulations. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that overall it would not be reasonable for SHL to rely on those Clauses. Again in coming to that decision I have considered the impact of the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Robinson v Jones</span> but have concluded that it does not affect my view of the reasonableness of the particular terms in the context of the present case.</p>

The word “owes” is used in the present tense, and the duty is not to ensure that the work has been done in a workmanlike manner with proper materials so that the dwelling is fit for habitation when completed, but to see that the work is done in a workmanlike manner with proper materials, so that the dwelling will be fit for habitation when completed. The duty is one to be performed during the carrying on of the work. The reference to the dwelling being fit for habitation indicates the intended consequence of the proper performance of the duty and provides a measure of the standard of the requisite work and materials. It is not, I think, part of the duty itself. If, at an early stage in the provision of the dwelling — for instance, the putting in of the foundations — someone who had taken on that part of the work failed to do it in a workmanlike manner, then in my judgment, assuming that the section applied, an immediate cause of action would arise. It would not be necessary to await the completion of the dwelling to claim relief on the basis of a breach of statutory duty. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Simpson gave evidence that in about 2002 he had noticed that some cracks had appeared internally in the ceiling and stairs and that there was rucking of the ceiling tape. He says that he reported it to the SHL site office and was given some paint to cover up the cracking and glue down the tape. On the basis of the engineering experts’ evidence such rucking of the ceiling tape is, as Mr Simpson states, very likely to have been caused by movement. In his evidence on Day 4 he said that he thought he had given notice by going into the office although he did not put the notice in writing. I accept Mr Simpson’s evidence as to what he did.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is accepted by SHL that any notice does not have to set out the cause or any detail but only has to set out the defect. It is clear that Mr Simpson’s oral notification would have been sufficient if it were in writing. As was accepted on behalf of SHL in closing oral argument, correctly in my judgment, if somebody gave oral notice of a problem with a request for the contractor to deal with it then the contractor ought to say that a written notice must be given. Equally, it would be expected that a visit to a site office might give rise to a record which would provide a written notice. In my judgment the important aspect of the notice under Section 2 of the Buildmark Cover is for there to be notice. Whilst a written notice is required as a record to prevent disputes, in the circumstances of this case I consider that the actions of Mr Simpson were sufficient to be a notice in this case and SHL cannot now say that they did not have sufficient notice of the defects in the Simpsons house at Plot 39 within the relevant two year period.</span>

Is it sufficient for affirmation that there is knowledge and a communication (by words or conduct) which, assuming such knowledge, demonstrates an unequivocal choice? Or must the communication itself or the surrounding circumstances demonstrate such knowledge to the other party? In principle, it seems to me that the latter approach is correct in the context of affirmation. The communication itself or the circumstances must demonstrate objectively or unequivocally that the party affirming is making an informed choice … Whether conduct amounts to an unequivocal communication of a choice to affirm requires therefore, an objective assessment of the impact of the relevant conduct on a reasonable person in the position of the other party to the contract. A reasonable person in that position must, it seems to me, be treated as having a general understanding of the possibility of choice between affirmation and objection. In affirmation (as distinct from estoppel), the actual state of mind of the other party is not the test. Affirmation depends on the objective manifestation of a choice.</span>”</p>

The experts have followed a procedure in assessing the performance of each of the lead properties. First, the experts have individually assessed the loading applied to each pile but have agreed to take the loads calculated by Mr Johnson to calculate factors of safety. Secondly, the experts have assessed the ground models based on available borehole information and have agreed to use the ground model prepared by Mr Johnson for the Encia litigation. This has been used to calculate predicted ground movements to 2032 and these have been validated, where possible, against actual ground movements. Thirdly, in assessing the performance of the lead properties the experts have started by calculating pile capacity and Factors of Safety and have then considered observations of cracking, including available level and crack monitoring data. Fourthly, the experts have followed a decision making process for each property which consisted of assessing the pile design, the structural stability of the properties and any evidence of current movement and, if so, whether it is progressive and whether it will need remediation.</span>

FOS(A) is calculated using only the loads applied by the house structure whilst FOS(B) is calculated also taking into account the possible loads arising as a result of negative skin friction applied on the pile by the made ground and the alluvial deposits. Negative skin friction applies loading when the soil around a pile is settling relative to the pile so that the pile will settle under negative skin friction even if there is no other load on the pile. In assessing the piles, the experts differ slightly in what they consider to be appropriate values of the Factor of Safety. For the design stage they take a value of 2.5 to 3.0 (Mr Taylor) and 2.0 to 3.0, say 2.5 (Mr Johnson) but for the assessment of piles at this stage with the knowledge now available they take values of FOS(A) of 2.0 (Mr Taylor) and 1.5 (Mr Johnson) and FOS(B) of 1.5 (both Mr Taylor and Mr Johnson).</span>

It seemed to me that his approach took account of the knowledge which he had of this development built up over a number of years. He had to assess all the houses for the purpose of the Encia litigation and, whilst there are some differences, his evidence has been broadly consistent with the evidence given in that case. It seems to me that his views on the risk or probability of future damage should be given great weight. As a geotechnical engineer whose ground model and calculations of factors of safety have been relied on, I consider that his assessment of risk is the one on which I should rely. I therefore accept and adopt his views on the risk of significant future damage. The approach of Mr Taylor on this issue seemed to me to be that he wished to have a position where there was no risk. That is an unrealistic approach and one which is not achievable in practice. There is always a risk that something unforeseen may happen, for instance a change in water table or some other such event, and that event may give rise to movement of houses built on piles. It is the assessment of the risk which is of importance. On this aspect it seemed to me that Mr Johnson’s approach was correct.  </span>

In many cases, as became clear during the concurrent evidence of both experts given in relation to each plot, Mr Johnson’s evidence was that he could not be sure what the cause of a particular crack would be. Whilst that is understandable because many of the cracks were fine and were difficult to interpret, it seemed to me that Mr Taylor’s assessment of the cause of the cracking being derived from building movement as a result of the foundations settling was justified both in terms of likely causes and also given that the cracks appeared some time after the normal drying or shrinkage defects.   </span>

The Claimants say that the economic arguments are the same for the lead properties as for the remediated properties: in neither case can repiling be justified simply on economic grounds, because the cost is far greater than the diminution in value; the justification for it is that it provides the homeowners with what they ought to have received in the first place.</span>

SHL submit that had the contract been performed according to its terms, the Claimants would have had properties with values now agreed by the expert valuers. Instead they have properties with a substantial value and if they are awarded the costs of repiling, that cost will exceed the value that their properties would have had if properly constructed in the first place. If the Claimants are therefore awarded the cost of repiling then SHL submit that the Claimants’ position will be substantially improved because they will have a valuable asset in the form of their existing property in its existing condition and damages which substantially exceed the value which the house would have had if undamaged. SHL say that it is exceedingly unlikely that any of the Claimants will actually use any damages awarded for the costs of repiling, to re-pile their properties. Rather they will not remediate the properties  but sell their properties at  a discounted price and the result will be that the Claimants will own more valuable properties than they could ever have afforded.</span>

Where the contract breaker has entirely failed to achieve the contractual objective it may not be difficult to conclude that the loss is the necessary cost of achieving that objective. Thus if a building is constructed so defectively that it is of no use for its designed purpose the owner may have little difficulty in establishing that his loss is the necessary cost of reconstructing. Furthermore in taking reasonableness into account in determining the extent of loss it is reasonableness in relation to the particular contract and not at large. Accordingly if I contracted for the erection of a folly in my garden which shortly thereafter suffered a total collapse it would be irrelevant to the determination of my loss to argue that the erection of such a folly which contributed nothing to the value of my house was a crazy thing to do.</span>

In my opinion however the hypothesis is not correct. There are not two alternative measures of damage, at opposite poles, but only one; namely, the loss truly suffered by the promisee. In some cases the loss cannot be fairly measured except by reference to the full cost of repairing the deficiency in performance. In others, and in particular those where the contract is designed to fulfil a purely commercial purpose, the loss will very often consist only of the monetary detriment brought about by the breach of contract.

Where the cost of reinstatement is less than the difference in value, the measure of damages will invariably be the cost of reinstatement. By claiming the difference in value the plaintiff would be failing to take reasonable steps to mitigate his loss. In many ordinary cases, too, where reinstatement presents no special problem, the cost of reinstatement will be the obvious measure of damages, even where there is little or no difference in value, or where the difference in value is hard to assess. This is why it is often said that the cost of reinstatement is the ordinary measure of damages for defective performance under a building contract.</span></p>

Having already decided that the appeal should be allowed I no longer find it necessary to reach a conclusion on this matter. However I should emphasise that in the normal case the court has no concern with the use to which a plaintiff puts an award of damages for a loss which has been established. Thus irreparable damage to an article as a result of a breach of contract will entitle the owner to recover the value of the article irrespective of whether he intends to replace it with a similar one or to spend the money on something else. Intention, or lack of it, to reinstate can have relevance only to reasonableness and hence to the extent of the loss which has been sustained.

What is then to be the position where, in the case of a new house, the building does not conform in some minor respect to the contract, as, for example, where there is a difference in level between two rooms, necessitating a step. Suppose there is no measurable difference in value of the complete house, and the cost of reinstatement would be prohibitive. Is there any reason why the court should not award by way of damages for breach of contract some modest sum, not based on difference in value, but solely to compensate the buyer for his disappointed expectations? Is the law of damages so inflexible, as I asked earlier, that it cannot find some middle ground in such a case? I do not give a final answer to that question in the present case.

If these three conditions are satisfied, as they are in the present case, then I consider that the claim for damages should not be rejected on the ground that the fulfilment of that obligation is not the principal object of the contract or on the ground that the other party does not receive special and specific remuneration in respect of the performance of that obligation.</span>”</p>

The distinction between the "physical" and the "non-physical" is not always clear and may depend on the context. Is being awoken at night by aircraft noise "physical"? If it is, is being unable to sleep because of worry and anxiety "physical"? What about a reduction in light caused by the erection of a building under a planning permission that an errant surveyor ought to have warned his purchaser-client about but had failed to do so? In my opinion, the critical distinction to be drawn is not a distinction between the different types of inconvenience or discomfort of which complaint may be made but a distinction based on the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort. If the cause is no more than disappointment that the contractual obligation has been broken, damages are not recoverable even if the disappointment has led to a complete mental breakdown. But, if the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort is a sensory (sight, touch, hearing, smell etc) experience, damages can, subject to the remoteness rules, be recovered.</span>”</p>

That they say requires an assessment of the position they would have been in and the position they are now in. SHL say that had the contract been performed according to its terms, the Claimants would have had a more valuable house with a value which has been agreed by the valuers. Instead the houses have a less substantial value. SHL point out that if the Claimants are awarded the costs of repiling, that cost will exceed the value that the house would have had. They submit that the unreasonableness of the damages is demonstrated by the fact that it is exceedingly unlikely that any of the Claimants would actually use the damages awarded on account of the costs of repiling, to re-pile their properties but will sell their properties at a discounted price so that the Claimants would be overcompensated by the cost of repiling.</span>

They can be categorised on the basis of the recognised categories of damage in Building Research Digest 251 as being of Damage Category 1 which are aesthetic in nature or, as referred to in the Encia litigation and here, as “cosmetic”. </span>

Plot 20 has a remote probability of such movements and for all the other plots the probability is extremely remote. Such low to remote probabilities do not in my judgment make it reasonable to provide entirely new foundations. On the expert evidence, the overwhelming likelihood is that the properties will suffer, at most, some continued small movement over future years which will require cosmetic repair by way of some pointing of the brickwork and redecoration internally. </span>

The current external and internal damage can be made good at small cost of the order of £10,000, external areas can be remedied at similar cost and any risk as to future performance is properly compensated by the diminution in value which the market reflects in that way.

However these properties have now been built for some 8 years and the investigations which have been carried out have given a much clearer picture than would usually be the case. Calculations have been made, ground models have been prepared and predictions have been made based on the known performance of the properties. To that extent the uncertainties are now less than they were at the beginning. Those uncertainties are properly compensated, in my judgment, not by carrying out work which is not otherwise justified, but are properly dealt with by the assessment of diminution in value.</span>

In the end, I have come to the conclusion that the approach of each of the experts is applicable and can appropriately be used. Of the two experts, Mr Lewis had more experience of the particular locality of the Estate and experience of valuing defective properties. Mr Watson, on the other hand has less experience of the locality but had a great deal of valuation experience. Both experts had changed their views on certain matters during the course of the evidence and Mr Watson’s approach to his Investment method of valuation was amended in the light of the late auction information.

In November a purchaser who required a mortgage of about £150,000 had offered £174,950. Mr Lewis said that a sale at £174,950 would support his valuation for a Langdale of £230,000 less 25%, that is £172,500 and similarly a cash sale on the basis that it was unmortgageable at £162,500 would be above his figure of £140,000.

Mr Watson in his report also gave evidence which he had obtained from the estate agent at Robinsons. The property was put on the market on 31 July 2010 and two offers, both subject to mortgage, at £174,950 and £170,000 had been made. There had been 51 viewings. The Halifax had made a mortgage offer to the person offering £170,000 and the buyer at £174,950 was said to require a mortgage of £150,000. He provided evidence which he had obtained of the only other activity being related to Mr Simpson’s continued unsuccessful attempts to sell Plot 39 (15 Clover Drive). Mr Watson commented on the BGP report that, with his knowledge, it would not allow him to conclude that the property was suitable security for a mortgage and he said he had not seen the mortgage valuer’s report. He said the number of viewings indicated the difficulty of selling and he referred to the fact that on the basis of Mr Taylor’s report on 47 Meadowgate Drive the property was not suitable for a mortgage. Mr Watson said that even if the property was sold it did not mean that the lead properties were mortgageable. He raised concerns over pre-contract disclosure based on the fact that the vendor of 47 Meadowgate Drive had not lived in the property whereas the lead properties had been occupied by those who would be selling them. He did not alter his view on whether the ten lead properties were mortgageable.</span>

In relation to the use of 31 Clover Drive as a comparable to be applied to the capital comparison method, the first problem is the use of one property as the only comparable. Without detailed knowledge of the one transaction there are clearly uncertainties as to whether the transaction fell within the necessary RICS criteria for the use of that property as a comparable. SHL say that there is now the information about the sale at 47 Meadowgate Drive which is relied on by Mr Lewis to support his view that a comparable method based on a 25% discount can be used. He says that based on this Langdale house the value without the problems would be £230,000 and that a 25% discount would give a value of £172,500. Even accepting that, there is in my judgment a danger in using the capital comparison method where there are only two comparables. Further, while I accept that other properties elsewhere can be used in forming a judgment, the specific nature of the discount applicable for a house on the Estate is a matter which depends on particular comparables on the Estate. Equally, there are difficulties in using the sales in 2006 as comparables. As Mr Lewis accepted it is evident that a limitation on the number of comparables limits the weight to be given to the comparables when applying that value to other properties. The range of possible values will be wider. I consider that this applies whether there is one comparable or two comparables.    </span>

The evidence up to the date of the trial was that other attempts to sell houses had not met with success, whatever the criticisms of the manner in which they had been marketed. In addition, even on the assumption I am making that the properties are mortgageable, this is a case where the existence of piling defects in the properties would necessarily mean that a structural engineer’s report would be required and the market will be limited to purchasers who want to buy a property at a lower price but who know that, whatever assurances the structural engineer gives, there are defects and some degree of uncertainty because of that. Whilst there will be purchasers who are prepared to purchase, on the assumption that a mortgage is available, the limited market is a factor to take into account.             </span>

Mr Lewis on reconsideration in his Expert Report reinstated the deduction but made no addition. The basis for Mr Watson’s addition of £5000 is the fact that there is a conservatory, as with Plots 15 and 34. I accept that there is more significant damage to the conservatory at Plot 20 and in my judgment the full addition of £5000 should not be made but an addition of £2500 should be made, making a value of £235,000 to which the discount is applied. </span>

In my judgment, the market value without the problems should, like the other properties be based on there being vacant possession. The value I use is therefore £225,000, to which I apply the discount.     </span>

Mr Lewis, on the other hand, says that the figure should be 5.5% but he allows an additional 1.5% for risk, giving 7%. This means that the difference between the experts is small but I consider that for these properties, on the assumption that they are unmortgageable the figure of 8% put forward by Mr Watson is to be preferred. </span>

Mr Watson has now amended his view to 10 years on the basis of the information of the sale by auction of the property at 47 Meadowgate Drive. His view of 12 years had been based on the fact that it would be 10 years before the purchaser could sell the property but that an extra 2 years should be allowed because of the further remedial works that are to be carried out to five further houses. I consider that the period of 10 years provides a better basis on which an investor would approach the transaction, particularly given the work to be carried out to further houses. </span>

Essentially, the experts difference on the question of mortgageability depends on whether I accept Mr Taylor’s view of matters or Mr Johnson’s view of matters. The experts agreed in the First Joint Expert Report that on the basis of Mr Taylor’s opinion on Plot 39 they would consider the property unmortgageable. Mr Watson initially appeared to agree that Mr Johnson’s comment that the “probability of any significant movement of this structure is extremely remote” would be sufficient for the property to be treated as mortgageable if by “probability” Mr Johnson meant the “likelihood”. In cross-examination he said that he would refuse it for a mortgage as a valuer if the report said the “possibility” of any significant movement of this structure is extremely remote”.</span>

Whilst there is a significant risk of further movement, the consequences of that risk are that the damage to that property will continue to be in the form of further movement and cracking of the house of a similar type to that seen today. The risk of any significant movement is low to extremely remote.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The original report for 47 Meadowgate Drive from Mr Taylor can be contrasted with the report from BGP. This indicates that the question of mortgageability depends on the reports which are written by the engineers instructed for any particular property. Towards one end of the spectrum would be a report like Mr Taylor’s which would set out his views and refer to the Encia litigation and this case. Towards the other end of the spectrum is a report by BGP which mentions none of the litigation or the position in relation to the piling on 47 Meadowgate Drive. It is evident that this judgment will not dictate the engineering advice which is given any more than the judgment in the Encia litigation appears to have done, by reference to the BGP report.</span>

In other words one which reports on the position fully and refers to the Encia litigation and this case. On that basis, I do not consider that obtaining a mortgage will be straightforward and I would expect that would apply to all the lead properties. For the worst of the ten lead properties I would expect that the most probable outcome would be that either the property would be unmortgageable or that the value put on it would reflect that fact even if in the end a lender is found who is prepared to lend. For the best of the ten properties I would expect that the most probable outcome will be that the property, with some difficulty, is mortgageable or that the value put on it would reflect that value. I have therefore approached the diminution in value on a gradated basis. The worst properties I have valued at the unmortgageable value and the best at the mortgageable value, with the properties in between being valued between those two values. This, in my judgment, is the best way to reflect the situation for these properties in terms of the evaluation of damages to compensate them for their loss. </span>

First, on analysis, Mr Pearson’s valuation differs considerably from that produced by Mr Miller and direct comparison is not easy. It would therefore be better for those experts to carry out the exercise of splitting the difference. Secondly, the schedule includes work to external areas and it is not clear whether there is a need to remove items from this list of defects and, if so, what effect it has. On that basis, I leave the matter of quantum for further consideration by the quantity surveying experts who, on past experience, have been able to agree matters. If they cannot be agreed then I will deal with them.</span>

The geogrid provides the necessary mechanical interlock at the base of the construction to bind the construction together and I do not consider that wrapping the membrane up a slip membrane or the edge of the construction or the concrete edge detail adds any significant benefit but complicates the construction. In relation to the thickening of the edge detail, I consider that this will add to the overall strength and robustness of the composite construction and I am not persuaded that there will be differential movement because of the change of sections. The geogrid reinforces the change of section which is made gradually by there being a sloped section.</span>

For Mr Johnson’s scheme, Mr Pearson values the total work at £126,991.03 and Mr Miller values it at £64,466.93. There are three areas where there are differences between the experts. First there are differences in quantities where Mr Pearson has stated a quantity but Mr Miller has set out his dimensions which come to a different figure. I do not consider that I can resolve the difference without some evidence of the figures. Equally, there are some differences in rates. Again I do not consider that I can resolve those differences without some evidence. Finally there is a question of what additional costs should be added on for preliminaries and other “on costs”. I consider that the cost should be based on there being proper management and supervision of the contract rather than some informal arrangement. </span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts have predicted future settlement of the piles due to “spring stiffness” and also due to negative skin friction between 2010 and 2032. This indicates generally low values of settlement of the piles in the poorer ground. The piles in the better ground give rise to settlements due to spring stiffness of about 15 mm and settlements due to negative skin friction of some 20mm. The engineering experts agree that it would be wrong to cumulate those two figures for settlement. Mr Johnson concludes that the settlement of the pile might be between 10 and 20 mm. Mr Taylor raises concerns that if there is ground movement it will remove support currently being given to the ground beams from the surrounding soil which will cause greater movement. As Mr Taylor pointed out, given that the piles with the higher factors of safety are in the worst ground there will be some redistribution of loads and stresses through the building to the piles with lower factors of safety in the better ground. Mr Johnson’s conclusion was that the property would suffer movement of 10 to 20 mm; that there would be no risk of significant structural damage; that there would be no safety issues but there would be a risk of minor cracking. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts were agreed that on this property the difference in movement between the individual corners was very, very small. Mr Taylor had concerns as to the magnitude of movement in relation to the connections between the ground beams and the piles. He said he could not be as conclusive as Mr Johnson as to the value of total movement and total tilt of the structure but he accepted that the settlement should be slowing logarithmically. Mr Taylor accepted that the way the structure was behaving meant that the order of damage in the future would be likely to be what it was today.</p>

There had been recent movement and there was a need to monitor the property to confirm any trends in movement. The future pile settlements will cause further movement of the ground beams and redistribution of the stresses within the structure. This will give rise to further future cracking. Mr Johnson’s view was that there was a low probability of significant movements in the future.</p>

Mrs Joanne Dobson, who gave evidence, said that in 2002 she and her husband were looking for a new house. They had a plot reserved on Elwick Rise but when they became aware of the Eden Park Estate they were interested in purchasing a house on the smaller estate, with no through roads but still within the catchment area for the children’s school at High Tunstall. They said that they met an SHL sales person Sandra, who told them that because the land had been piled prior to construction of the houses it was now stable enough to build high-rise flats on. The Dobsons purchased the property off-plan and exchanged contracts on 15 February 2002 and the purchase was completed on 21 June 2002. When they moved in on 22 June 2002 there were a few minor problems and whilst on holiday in 2004 their garage was flooded during very heavy rain fall causing water to flow into their hallway and kitchen. Their claim was settled by the insurance company. </p>

In October 2004 they received correspondence from SHL stating that some of the houses on the estate had developed problems which were isolated to one area and could be repaired by decoration. They reported the position to their insurance company who started monitoring the conservatory and front elevation of the property after they had reported the problems to them. In due course in June 2008 they accepted a settlement from the insurers in respect of the conservatory rather than have remedial works carried out because they were concerned that the work, for which they obtained a quote from Roger Bullivant, might cause damage to their property or the property next door. Mrs Dobson says that as part of the settlement their insurers, Legal and General initially removed buildings cover from their policy but this was reinstated although subsidence cover has been excluded. They also have to pay an excess of £1,000.</p>

They reported “<span style="font-style:italic">cracking in the external brickwork is very minor and does not appear to have worsened since our last visit. The cracking at the junction of the conservatory and the main house does appear to have increased slightly, particularly at the left hand corner of the main house.</span>” They said that this was because of differential settlement of the conservatory foundation which was not piled. They also stated: “a number of very fine cracks and ridges have developed in both ground and first floor ceilings since our previous visit. Whilst these are very minor at present they may be the result of some settlement.”</p>

This gives a total movement of 15 mm. The FOS (A) and FOS (B) figures for the majority of the piles at this property were near to or below 1.0. At the front right hand corner of the property there are four or five piles with higher factors of safety, otherwise the values of FOS(A)/FOS(B) for the piles vary from 1.36/0.95 to 0.71/0.42. The predicted future movement of the piles at this property varies from some 3 mm to some 15 mm due to spring stiffness and generally some 10 mm for settlement due to negative skin friction.</p>

He thought this would create some small movements of the foundations but the piles all had relatively high factors of safety so that there would only be small changes and small differences in movement. Mr Taylor agreed that the full effect of negative skin friction had not been developed to date but that it would develop. He considered that it would cause further redistribution of loads between the piles and some more cracking. Mr Taylor considered that the cracking in the property was again inconsistent with the factors of safety predicted for the piles.

The ground is likely to settle a further 21mm with pile settlements of up to 6mm due to spring stiffness. The further ground movement is likely to induce negative skin friction which could lead to further small movements. Mr Taylor has concerns that the cracking to the gable wall may be due to foundation movement and on balance I consider that to be justified, given that the boroscope survey showed no defect in workmanship. The future pile settlements will cause further small movement of the ground beams and redistribution of the stresses within the structure. This will give rise to further future cracking. Mr Johnson’s view was that the probability of any future significant movement is extremely remote.</p>

	    <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This property should be treated so far as diminution in value as being half way between an unmortgageable and mortgageable property. Much will depend on the view of the mortgage lender’s engineer on the gable wall crack when there is a sale.  On that basis, the value of the property without the problems would be £185,000 as agreed by the valuation experts. The current value would be £99,000 if unmortgageable and £124,875 if mortgageable and I assess the value at mid way between those values at £111,937.50. The diminution in value is therefore £73,062.50 </p>

The others do not because they are not related to foundation movement or are costs incurred as Mrs Frostwick said in her statement to decorate the house to their taste in 2004/2005. I am satisfied that the Frostwicks did incur expenditure on those items and I accept the sum of £547 for the redecorating costs for which there is documentary evidence.

Mr Michael Simpson, who gave evidence, said that he and his wife became aware of Eden Park around late 2001. He said that they were originally attracted for a number of reasons, primarily, it was the investment potential of buying a property on the Estate as it was in the up-market area of Park Ward. He said that it was in the catchment area for Westpark Junior School and High Tunstall which are the best schools in the area. He also said that he wanted to buy on the Estate because the houses were all 4 or 5 bedroom executive houses and there was only one entrance road which limited the number of houses that could be built on the estate as well as the incoming traffic. He said that it made the Estate more exclusive and safer for children. </p>

He said that he envisaged at the time that if they received £196,000 for the property then they would be able to realise their dreams. He said they sold their existing house for £79,000 and paid SHL £120,000. </p>

In October 2002 they decided to add a conservatory at the rear of the property and were in the process of instructing a local builder to begin work when they discovered that a number of people on the Estate were having problems with their conservatories cracking and subsiding. He said that they had not noticed any real problem with their property except that some cracks had appeared internally in the ceiling and stairs. He said that there had also been some rucking of the ceiling tapes. He reported this to the site office and they gave him some more paint to cover up the cracking and glue down the tape. </p>

He then switched to Dennis Dowens who originally valued the property at £210,000. However, in an effort to sell the property quickly, they put it on the market for £196,000 and they had a few viewings and some interest. However he says that only a few weeks after putting the property on the market newspaper articles began to appear about problems with some of the houses. He said he was concerned that nothing was happening at all and started to get concerned. He went back to Whitegates in 2004 and then finally to Robinsons in April 2005. He said that Robinsons advised him to drop the price but this did not seem to work. He said they ended up marketing the property for nearly £45,000 less than its original valuation but no one was interested. </p>

He said that in March 2006 after the property had been on the market nearly 3 years they again contacted Whitegates to ask whether it was worth having another go at a sale. He said they told them that they were unlikely to get any viewings as they were finding it very difficult to persuade potential buyers to even view properties on Eden Park. He said he was advised by the valuer at Whitegates that the property was only likely to sell if it was considered a bargain to potential buyers and was placed on the market for between £160,000 and £180,000. He said that, given that house prices had risen elsewhere, they could not afford to sell the property for such a low amount as they would not have been able to buy anywhere else. </p>

He said he contacted Persimmon Homes but having met the sales agent on a number of occasions during Summer 2005 he was eventually told that Persimmon would not consider part exchanging any Eden Park properties. He then approached Bellway Homes who instantly refused to part-exchange. He approached Bryant Homes and on 29 August 2005 it was agreed that Bryant Homes would part exchange their property for their show home that was priced at £279,000. He disclosed that there were faults with some of the properties on the Estate which were being dealt with by SHL but pointed out that his property was not one of the properties currently being repaired or involved in any remedial works. He was given the green light to proceed with part exchange and paid a deposit. He proceeded through the house evaluation stage and the property was valued on 1 September 2005. He said that at approximately 4pm on 1 September 2005 Bryant Homes telephoned him and cancelled the purchase/part exchange agreement. He says that the valuation report said that Bryant Homes should not touch his property as its value is estimated at below £175,000. </p>

He also tried to carry out further part exchanges but was verbally informed by sales agents that they would not consider part exchanging with properties on Eden Park because of the problems with them. He said that by this stage they were becoming desperate to sell and they approached National House Buyers who offered £190,000 for the property. He said that they were so desperate they were seriously considering accepting this offer however National House Buyers withdrew it when they discovered the problems on the Estate. He said he then began to realise that they were not going to be able to sell their property and realise their dream to buy a property in France because the housing market in France was rising dramatically. He said that he was still attempting to part exchange the property and in April 2007 considered taking on a very expensive mortgage to part exchange with a large Bellway Homes house but they refused to proceed with it. </p>

He said that the property was still on the market and the asking price was being reduced every week. By December 2008 it was on the market for £150,000 but there were no viewings or offers made. He decided to see if he could persuade someone to buy it and he reduced the asking price by £20,000 every few weeks over the course of a few months. It was not until the asking price reached £100,000 that he had any interest at all. He then had two interested parties but quickly realised that they were offering sums on the basis that the property had been remediated.</p>

At the time his family were living in Welwyn, Hertfordshire. He and his wife, Susan Manners, decided to relocate their family to the North East where she was originally from. He said that because house prices were much lower in the North East than where they currently lived this meant they could sell their current family home and have sufficient capital to purchase two properties in Hartlepool with the help of a mortgage. He said this would enable them to rent out one of the properties and make a small income from that as well as securing two capital assets for their long term future. The other house, which was 7 Clover Drive, would act as a family home for when they returned from Dubai on holidays and eventually would become their family home for a period when his contract in Dubai was completed. He said that they eventually ended up buying two houses on the Eden Park Estate, one built by SHL and one built by Tay Homes. </p>

In the summer of 2004 they decided to purchase a property at St Bega’s Gate being constructed by Kibbell Homes Limited.

They therefore put both their properties on the market, putting 7 Clover Drive on the market in August/September 2004 with Robinsons for £275,000. He said they had no viewings on the property and eventually they lost the plot at St Bega’s Gate which they had reserved. They received an offer on the Tay property and completed the sale of that house in March/April 2005. He said that they hoped still to buy one of Kibbell’s properties but Kibbell stated that they would not part exchange for any house on the Eden Park Estate. He said that the property at 7 Clover Drive was on the market until 2007 when they decided to rent the property out as they could not afford to keep it empty for any longer. </p>

The factors of safety, FOS(A) and FOS(B), were all above 1.0, with only two piles having factors of safety of less than 1.5.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts agree that this property was the least bad of the 10 properties. Mr Johnson thought there was no ongoing settlement at this property and it was highly unlikely there would be problems. He said the factors of safety of all the piles were, apart from two to three, good. The ground beams would be able to deal with the few piles with slightly lower factors of safety although there might be some slight movement of the structure to accommodate it. Mr Taylor thought that there were some piles which would probably settle a little bit more than they had done but, in his view, this was probably the most stable of the properties. This property had a number of fine cracks with some fine horizontal cracks on the rear elevation.</p>

The ground is likely to settle a further 5mm with pile settlements of up to 5mm due to spring stiffness. The future pile settlements will cause further small movement of the ground beams and redistribution of the stresses within the structure. This will give rise to further future cracking.

Mrs Susan Willis, who gave evidence, stated that in or around August 2002 she and her husband became aware of the development at Eden Park and, having made the decision that they would like to move house, went to look at the properties. She said that they wished to set up a family home for the future. After viewing an Ashbrook House in Sunderland, they reserved the house at plot 50 on 1 September 2002. They completed the purchase on 21 February 2003 for £125,950. Shortly after moving into the property they decided to landscape the garden and laid a patio area and re-turfed the lawn. The Willis’ first child was born in February 2004. </p>

On 15 June 2004 they instructed Robinsons to value the property with the intention of putting it up for sale. It was valued at £220,000. She said they were starting to feel very uncomfortable living on the Estate and even talked about renting it or part exchange options. In March/April 2004 the house at 9 Barley Close was bought back by SHL and in the summer of 2004 the house at 10 Barley Close was also bought back by SHL. Mrs Willis said that now that both properties to the rear of their property had been bought back by SHL due to cracking and settlement problems, the biggest investment of their lives was turning into a nightmare. </p>

She referred to an article in February 2005 in the Hartlepool Mail and Northern Echo which stated that SHL had bought back houses and that there were problems with the Estate. </p>

The report dated 16 February 2005 concluded as follows: “<span style="font-style:italic">Although there are concerns by those property owners in close proximity to the houses built and repurchased by Shepherd Homes, a two year period has elapsed on this property with no signs of foundation failure or major structural movement. The only defects noted were internally which one would inspect under a normal maintenance period of up to two years. These should cost no more than £750 to rectify. My final comments are that this report be placed with your legal documentation for the purchase of the property and three monthly checks should be carried out by the property owners internally and externally over the next 12 months. If during that period there is any cause for concern please contact ASP Services when we will re-inspect.</span>”</p>

The ridge tiles immediately above have been displaced upwards. These faults may have been caused by defective roof construction. An internal inspection should reveal the cause(s) of the problem. On the rear of the property cracking has occurred in the brickwork under the patio window, under the ensuite window and at the left hand side of the window of bedroom 1. A pattern of vertical cracks was also seen in the brickwork under the kitchen window.

In terms of FOS(B) this varied between 0.98 and 2.82, there being 8 piles with a factor of safety of less than 1.43. In terms of further individual pile movement due to spring stiffness the predicted movement was between 1 and 9.6 mm with possibly some further movement of 17 mm on the pile with the lowest factor of safety. </span>

Mr Taylor thought that all that cracking was associated with foundation movement. Mr Johnson confirmed that the cracking under the patio window, which was a stepped crack, was in an area where that type of crack would be expected if the central pile had gone down a little relative to the other piles and that pile was one with a low factor of safety. He could not say what the cause of the other cracking was. In a later survey in February 2007 there was a crack reported along the DPC. Mr Taylor thought it was associated with settlement of the foundations. Mr Johnson said that there appeared to have been some settlement leading to movement of the superstructure of the building. In relation to the statement that the horizontal crack along the DPC appeared to have widened towards the centre of the elevation, Mr Johnson thought that this could be as a result of differential settlement of the piles underneath. </span>

He said that if the factor of safety turned out to be lower than predicted there could be some long-term creep under negative skin friction loads which would have some very small redistribution of loading leading to very minor cracking or movements of the sort that had been noted on the internal structure. In terms of internal damage after February 2007 the experts accepted that there was no evidence of anything changing internally after the period of movement when the negative skin friction loads were being applied. They agreed that this house had been affected by negative skin friction but there was no evidence of any continuing movement afterwards. </span>

In a letter dated 3 February 2005 from Encia to SHL there were twelve properties identified by Knowles Technical Services as having problems that required remedial works. Mr Henderson says that given the problems that were identified with their property, the uncertainty of fully enjoying the house or making any return on further investment in the property and the fact that it appeared that little would be done by SHL to resolve the  problems, they felt they should try and sell the property and make a new start elsewhere. </p>

In a form completed for Charles Church by Mr Gregg, a local estate agent, the following was stated about their existing property: “<span style="font-style:italic">a very nice property but with sale prospects unfortunately likely to be blighted similarly to what other properties have experienced in the same development. Although there are no defects apparent and it is understood that the owners have a report to that effect from Shepherd Homes, confirmation of which should be obtained prior to any purchase</span>.” Mr Henderson said that, on the basis of the valuations carried out, Charles Church refused to make an offer for their house. He said that all they wanted to do was to leave the Estate and move on with their lives but they felt trapped and extremely concerned that all of their life savings were locked into the property. </p>

He says that the house was remortgaged on 30 April 2008 and they stayed with their existing lender as they already had the risk associated with the property and they knew of a number of people who had experienced difficulty in remortgaging.</p>

Mrs Kelly Adamson, who gave evidence, said that with her husband Stephen, she moved into the property on 6 February 2004. They have since had two children and they moved from the Bishop Cuthbert Estate because they wanted to be in the catchment area for Westpark Primary school which her husband had attended and was near where his parents lived. They became aware that a property in Meadowgate Drive was available and after returning with her husband’s parents for a second opinion they decided to make an offer of the full asking price. She says that the property had all of the items on their wish list and more. She said that when they moved into the property they were not aware of any problems either with their property or with the Estate as a whole. </p>

When she spoke to someone she was advised of the problems with the properties. She said that she recalls walking home with her new baby feeling an immense sense of worry. That evening, as soon as her husband returned home, she mentioned the conversation to him. He is a qualified civil engineer and he went to have a look at the property. When he returned he explained that the problem seemed to be something to do with the foundations. Mrs Adamson says that having recently moved into the property they were still making numerous improvements but they decided at that point to cease all of the work until they knew what was happening with the properties. </p>

She says that at this stage they decided to put their house on the market. In July 2005 she said she received valuations from Robinsons, Michael Poole and Whitegates and was advised by Robinsons that the property should be valued at £300,000 but due to issues with the estate he would not be prepared to value the property at more than £285,000. Whitegates valued the property at £284,000 and Michael Poole advised that the full market value would be £310,000 but suggested that they market the property for £269,950. Mrs Adamson says that despite the reduced price they received no viewings and later removed the property from the market in February 2006. </p>

In a marketing progress report provided in December 2005 Michael Poole estate agents said “The market has slowed now in the run up to Christmas, we would suggest an advert in the paper in the New Year to stimulate viewings.” Mrs Adamson says that their hearts sank at the reduced value of the property and they felt that they could see their financial security slipping away from them. She said they could not sell the property at a reduced price as it was their primary investment for the future and they knew they would not be able to buy a house elsewhere if they lost money on the property. She referred to an offer from National Home Buyers of £165,000 which was then reduced to a cash offer of £25,000 when they objected to it. </p>

She said that when they purchased the property they did not consider the property to be a long term home. They intended to stay there until their younger son went to school and then intended to look for a plot of land where they could build their own home or secure a restoration/modernisation project within Westpark close to the school and her husband’s parents or find a semi-rural or rural home in or around Elwick or Hart Village area.</p>

In terms of factors of safety, the piles have FOS(A) of between 1.62 and 3.15 and FOS(B) varies from 0.94 to 1.62, with three piles having FOS(B) below 1.0 and a further seven having a value below 1.27. In terms of individual pile movements, further settlement due to spring stiffness is estimated to be between 2mm and 18.9mm. It is considered that there might be some further small movement of 3 to 4 mm on some piles due to negative skin friction. </span>

Mr Taylor said that on the basis that the predictions of movement were accurate, the further damage would be the kind of cracking which had been seen to date. The experts agreed that there had been tilt caused by settlement although they could not be conclusive about that because of construction tolerance. The experts agreed that the evidence of Ms McDermott that doors were not shutting properly and that cracks were getting worse would be indicative of movement occurring. However such complaints related to matters which had occurred early on and could be matters of workmanship. The experts agreed that the compression ridges seen in the dining room and kitchen were consistent with some internal movement, but that, on the basis that redecoration had taken place in 2008, the experts had not seen anything further between 2008 and 2010. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The experts agreed that for this property there was some evidence of past movement reflected in elements of external damage and possibly some internal damage, but at the moment there was no evidence of any kind of continuing movement or internal continuing damage. The experts agreed that this is a property where the maximum negative skin friction would have been applied by now. In terms of the future Mr Johnson did not anticipate anything occurring to upset the present position but said that it was not impossible that there could be a little redistribution of load going forwards but the potential for movement was very small. Mr Taylor agreed but said that with low values of FOS(B) in relation to certain piles there would possibly be some ongoing movement but it would be no more than had been seen to date. Mr Johnson said that the potential for movement of the foundations related to the fact that the factor of safety of 3 or 4 piles was just below 1.0 so that some very small movements would occur as the foundations and loads readjusted there and elsewhere in the property. Mr Taylor said he would expect some minor movements due to redistribution of loads but that would only be of the same order as at the moment and they were of a fairly minor nature. He explained that this might cause minor cracking in various locations on the brickwork and fabric and that the compression ridge internally might develop into a compression crack.</span>

The future pile settlements will cause further small movement of the ground beams and redistribution of the stresses within the structure. This will give rise to further future cracking.

They were interested in an Ashbrook house and visited Northallerton to see a finished house. They decided to lose the reservation fee they had paid on the Bishop Cuthbert Estate and pay a reservation fee for the property on the Eden Park Estate. They exchanged contracts on 11 July 2003 and completed the purchase on 19 December 2003, moving in during February 2004.

He said that they approached SHL and their solicitors to raise this but were told they were tied into the contract and could not pull out of the purchase. He then said that to get to the bottom of this he went back to SHL’s sale office where he spoke to Val Davidson and raised his concerns with the piling. He said that she told him there was absolutely nothing to worry about and that the piling had been changed from the Phase 1 houses and that this was “the best piling possible”. He said that she also made a reference to her father who was allegedly an expert in this field and he had reassured her that everything was in order. He said that, based on those assurances he did not pursue getting out of the purchase, which is what he really wanted to do. </p>

Mr Pettite’s main concern was noted to be a joint in the hardwood timber flooring which had opened up around Christmas 2004. In the report it was stated “<span style="font-style:italic">There is no evidence of hogging or sagging across the joint, although the structural floor below the boarding does appear to dip locally in one front corner of the dining room.</span>” They said “<span style="font-style:italic">elsewhere internally, there are a number of fine shrinkage cracks, in dry-lined surfaces, over doors, adjacent to stringers etc and these cracks are of little concern to us or to Mr Pettite. However, one such crack, over the door from the ensuite into bedroom one is displayed as a slight ridge, which suggests compressive movement.</span>” In relation to external defects they noted “<span style="font-style:italic">some very fine, mainly horizontal cracking has occurred in each gables part way up the wall. There is however, no evidence of cracking at DPC level which has been experienced in other properties on the estate. There is further evidence of cracking in both front and gable walls around the front right hand corner of the house. The cracks are fine, stepped, in both bed and perpend joints approximately coincident with first floor level. We were told that this cracking occurred very recently. There is no evidence of cracking near to ground level at this corner of the house.</span>” </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">They concluded that the gap in the flooring had resulted from shrinkage in the natural timber and they did not consider it was the result of movement of the structure. They said that much of the minor internal cracking was considered to be related to shrinkage but added “<span style="font-style:italic">of slightly more concern is the minor crack over the door between bedroom one and the ensuite which is displayed as a slight ridge which suggests compressive movement and may be indicative of other, very minor movements within the building structure</span>”. They also said “<span style="font-style:italic">the cracking in the external masonry around the front corner of the property is also unusual and of some concern. Whilst there is no evidence of movement at ground level at the present time it is possible that this cracking is related to movement in the structure other than thermal movement</span>”. As a result of the indications that some minor structural movement had occurred within the property they recommended that a plumb and level survey and monitoring regime should be set up so that any future movements could be monitored and addressed should the cracking/movement worsen.</p>

	    <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This property should be treated so far as diminution in value as being half way between an unmortgageable and mortgageable property. Much will depend on the view of the mortgage lender’s engineer when there is a sale and the further movement has taken place.  On that basis, the value of the property without the problems would be £196,500 as agreed by the valuation experts. The current value would be £103,000 if unmortgageable and £132,637 if mortgageable and I assess the value at mid way between those values at £117,818.50. The diminution in value is therefore £78,681.50. </p>

Reports were made by BSCP in April 2005, May 2005, July 2005, January 2006 and November 2006. Monitoring has been carried out. Up to the date of trial I propose to allow the modest sum of £1,500 for the relevant periods of the distress, inconvenience and loss of amenity caused by cracks in the house, inspections and monitoring and the inconvenience of the defects in the external areas.</p>

Of them I consider that only the cost of redecorating of £200 would arise from the defects in the foundations.  In the absence of documentation I allow £100. I am not satisfied that the costs of flooring, tiling, paving stones or the patio arise from or are recoverable for the defects in the foundations. Claims are also made for increased mortgage payments and a product switch fee for changing a mortgage. Mr Pettite deals with the question of mortgage in paragraph 31 of his statement. I am not satisfied that the claim has been proved. Whilst mortgage payments are set out, the ability to obtain a lower mortgage rate is not sufficiently established.  Finally, I do not consider that loss of earnings are a head of damage which arises or are recoverable because of the claims for the defective foundations.</p>
