The sewage arrives at Mogden STW through three main sewers: the Bath Road high level sewer, the Chiswick low level sewer and the Western low level sewer. The flow to the works is divided into two main streams: the East stream and the West stream, both treating the sewage by similar processes.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The sewage flow to the West side works is taken from the Bath Road sewer. The rate of flow coming into the West side is controlled by a hydraulic gate known as “Lucifer’s gate”. The flow rate to treatment in the West side is measured after Lucifer’s Gate. Sewage from the Chiswick and the Western low level sewers is measured in the main pumping station where it joins the remaining flow from the Bath Road sewer which has not passed to the West side works. This sewage then flows to the East side works. After screening and grit removal any flow in excess of the treatment capacity of the East side works passes over an overflow weir and goes to the storm tanks. The rate of flow is measured after this overflow weir and the amount to be treated is controlled from the control room using a valve known as “Penstock John”. Closing this penstock valve causes the flow level to back up which then leads to more sewage overflowing to the storm tanks. If the penstock is opened then the water level at the overflow weir is reduced and this in turn reduces the amount of overflow passing to the storm tanks.  </p>

After primary settlement, the sewage then receives biological treatment by the activated sludge process (“ASP”). That process introduces air and uses naturally occurring micro-organisms in the sewage to treat the organic matter in the settled sewage by oxidizing and synthesising it. The air used in the process is blown into aeration units in the form of domes to keep the dissolved oxygen level in the sewage/bacteria mixture aerobic. That sewage/bacteria mixture is referred to as “mixed liquor”. When the waste organic matter and ammonia in the sewage have been oxidised to a satisfactory level, the mixed liquor flows to the final settlement tanks (“FSTs”). Here the mixed liquor is allowed to settle and some of the sludge is then pumped back to the aeration units to seed the incoming settled sewage with micro-organisms so they can treat more incoming sewage by the ASP. This return cycle of sludge is called return activated sludge (“RAS”).  </p>

In these Digesters the sludge is heated to approximately 35°C and mixed for a period of 12 to 14 days in the absence of air. This process of anaerobic digestion allows micro-organisms to grow in the heated sludge and break down the polluting organic matter and kill harmful bacteria.  </p>

This anaerobic digestion process provides, as a by-product, gas which is rich in methane. At Mogden STW this gas is combusted in spark-ignition engines which produces electricity used for the sewage treatment works with excess being fed into the National Grid. It is also used to fire the boilers which produce heat for the anaerobic digestion process. Any gas that is surplus to requirements is then flared. </p>

Thames Water contend that one of the reasons for the delay was that various Claimants were exerting pressure on the London Borough of Hounslow to refuse to agree the terms of the accompanying section 106 agreement containing various planning obligations placed upon Thames Water as a condition of the formal grant of permission. The section106 agreement was signed on 23 December 2009 and contained obligations concerning the construction to the extension, as well as governing the more general operation of the site including the phasing of the planned works to the sludge handling plant, the digester roofs and the various processes forming the extension to Mogden STW.  </p>

It stated that, in general, there were two key aspects to ensuring that odour nuisance was prevented where possible. The first option was to ensure that existing procedures were operated in such a way as to minimise the generation of odour. It stated that Thames Water had now defined and documented best operational practice which was implemented and regulated through quality management systems. The second option was to produce minimum odour by design. It stated that potential odour nuisance from new plant and processes must be assessed at the design stage and process operations reviewed and designed where appropriate to select the least odorous process option. It stated that examples of current standard practice options include raw sludge thickening in covered picket fence thickeners, separate thickening of surplus activated sludge rather than cosettlement in PSTs and the choice of fixed roof sludge digesters with bag-type gas holders to minimise biogas leakage.  </p>

Hence the process when co-settling is hopelessly overloaded and can’t generally cope with the throughput rates required.

This identified a number of shortfalls. First, all seven blowers were in operation because of leaks in the air distribution main, reduction in blower output and deteriorating aeration because of a reduction in the efficiency of the diffuser domes. Secondly, during the Tideway agreement period when river flows were low, Thames Water agreed to achieve a daily average ammonia effluent concentration of less than 1ppm. Thirdly, Mogden STW could not treat the Flow to Full Treatment because of a fall off in the aeration performance and so regular peak lopping was needed using the storm tanks to balance the flows which exacerbated odour. Finally, there was a deficiency in the Return Activated Sludge flow in the battery C FSTs.

They therefore considered that, in dry summer periods, the effect of any septicity in the incoming flow would increase the likelihood of odour complaints. They made recommendations on options which would have the largest effect on reducing the odour from Mogden STW. One of those recommendations was to carry out additional FeCl<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">3</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>dosing to the East side inlet and storm weir to reduce odour on the East side and in the storm tanks and to reduce corrosion of the Combined Heat and Power plant.  </p>

There was an exchange of emails in April 2003 when Adrian Wallis reported to Ian Cranshaw that they had taken samples on 15 April 2003 and had found sulphide levels of less than 0.1mg/l. On 30 April 2003 Mathew Ladds, a Thames Water process engineer at Mogden, said that Barry Wyeth had been regularly measuring the dissolved sulphide levels with negligible traces of the compound. Adrian Wallis responded to this on 1 May 2003 and said that Barry Wyeth had told him that he had obtained a reading of 0.2 mg/l sulphide but that was the highest so far. He said he would like one to two checks per week over the coming hot months to see if any trend upwards developed. Adrian Wallis said that these were the only exchanges on sulphide levels and that spot tests for dissolved sulphide were carried out over several weeks on crude sewage after April 2002. He said that from memory no more than 0.1mg/l was measured and the view expressed at the time by Mr Cranshaw was that levels above 1mg/l<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>were indicative of septicity. When Mr Wallis was asked questions about this he indicated that this was the only period where testing had been carried out and he thought that if there had been a problem with septicity it would have been apparent during that period.  </p>

The lack of records by Thames Water on this aspect is surprising and given the contemporary documents I do not consider that the lack of testing was justified by or establishes any lack of septicity. I accept that, as Dr McIntyre explained, there is a process of oxidization as the sewage flows down gravity mains but that process would be less likely to occur during periods of low rainfall and higher temperatures which, as Mr Hibberd says, are likely to occur in August and September of each year.  </p>

This is also borne out by the records of the East side inlet works pumping station Odour Control Unit which shows that in the period between February 2004 and October 2007 high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide were measured. </p>

Dr McIntyre explained at paragraph 44 of his first report that Thames Water installed a sludge liquor permanganate dosing facility and operated it for a short period in 2003. He said that the system had operational problems and was not very effective so it was only operated for a short period of time. He expresses the view that in his experience dosing the sludge liquors is very rare.

The practice appears to be to discharge the grit and raw sewage onto a hardstanding so that the grit dries before being placed in skips. This seems to be an uncontrolled process which has occurred on a significant number of occasions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There are a number of ways of estimating the BOD loading for the incoming sewage stream at sewage treatment works. One way is to estimate the population equivalent (PE) and then use a figure in kg/day for the BOD loading for that population equivalent to obtain the overall BOD loading. Thames Water used a population equivalent calculation which is set out on a “SOLAR” summary sheet updated on 18 November 1997. That showed an overall PE of 1,660,000 in 1996 increasing to 1,684,339 by 2011 and remaining at that level until 2016. It is stated that the population growth was based on 1996 demographic projections which only went to 2011. Using a figure of 60g per head per day BOD with a PE of 1,660,000 gives an overall BOD of 99,600kg/day.  </p>

First, he says that when the BOD and ammonia loads used to calculate the average population equivalent (PE) of 1.66m are re-analysed, on the basis of data available at the time of the 1997 SOLAR, the PE figure should have been 1.8m. He refers to exhibit RM4 to Mr Roger Matthews’ witness statement and uses the average BOD and ammonia loads for the East side and West side works to obtain a weighted average which is based on 3:1 East:West division to reflect the larger flow to the East side of the works before the UWWTD extension. He also uses an average flow of 490Ml/day to correct for data showing that this was a dry period and the fact that the Flow to Full Treatment value was 540Ml/day prior to the UWWTD extension. On this basis compared to the SOLAR figures of PE of 1.9m based on BOD and 1.3m based on ammonia, his figures are 1.815m and 1.701m. On this basis he says that the PE which Thames Water should have used was 1.8m instead of 1.66m. At 60g BOD per head per day he says that the additional PE of 0.14m would give an additional 8,400kg BOD per day which is some 8% more.  </p>

First they point out that using a PE of 1.8m and a BOD loading of 60g per head per day gives a total BOD figure of 108,000 kg/day which, as Mr Koodie explained, was the figure which the Thames Water project team used. In relation to the population growth, Thames Water say that this is based on hindsight because Mr Hibberd has adopted the later population projections to 2016 used in the AMP4/5 design, not the very modest rise of 24,000 in PE to 2016 as shown on the SOLAR form. They say that Mr Hibberd has no basis for criticising the demographic projections used and that Mr Ratcliff found nothing surprising in a “flat” population projection being adopted in the AMP 2 scheme because, as he said on Day 15, this accorded with his recollection of similar decisions about populations being taken by United Utilities when he was working on AMP 2 and 3 schemes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As explained by Dr Koodie, Thames Water used a BOD loading of 108,000kg/day in their calculations for the UWWTD scheme in AMP2. As Thames Water now point out, Mr Hibberd has arrived at that figure in the first stage of his analysis. His only basis for increasing that figure to 120,000kg/day is by increasing the population projections made in 1997 to reflect the population projections made much later as part of the AMP4/5 figures. I do not see that this can form any basis for criticism of the figures which were used in 1997. The SOLAR document refers to the basis on which population projections were made and that basis is not criticised as being incorrect at the time it was made. Further, Mr Ratcliff’s evidence supports the population growth figures used by Thames Water as being consistent with the approach of others in the industry at the time. I am also conscious that in his third supplemental report Mr Hibberd has changed his previous view that Thames Water should have used a BOD loading of 130,000kg/day and has introduced this new line of approach. I consider that this weakens his evidence on this aspect of the case. It cannot be said that there is any obvious error in the approach taken by Thames Water in adopting 108,000kg/day as the BOD loading and I reject the Claimants’ criticism of this aspect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Hibberd has considered the data produced by Mr Ratcliff in figure 6 of his first supplemental report and concludes that as the sludge was retained in the primary settlement tanks for a longer period, there was an increasing trend in the value of SSVI and that for the period of December 1995 to December 1996 the data shows that at the East side (A and B Batteries) an SSVI value of 80ml/g was exceeded on 19% of the time and an SSVI value of 100ml/g was exceeded for 4% of the time. The figures for the West side (Battery C) show values in excess of 80 and 100ml/g 5% and 2% of the time, respectively. He concludes that the use of a design value of 80ml/g did not match the operational data at the time.   </p>

Thames Water say that Dr Koodie and the project team responsible for the UWWTD were not negligent when they selected an SSVI value of 80ml/g with a significant safety factor over and above the general running value of 40 to 60ml/g.                 </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It can be seen from the memo of 10 July 1996 that Dr Koodie was comparing the number of additional final settlement tanks which were necessary if values of SSVI were assumed at 80, 100 and 120 ml/g. He considered the possible impact of an increase to 100ml/g if the design value was 80ml/g used. The underlying assumption, which he said was confirmed from the records, was that the SSVI at Mogden was generally between 40 and 60ml/g. I have come to the conclusion that Dr Koodie and the design team were justified in approaching the design of the extension on the basis of the data which they had of the settlability of sludge on the existing works.  </p>

As a result, I do not consider that Thames Water were negligent in adopting an SSVI design value of 80ml/g for the sludge settlability characteristics, particularly at the West side of the works, at that time.    </p>

First Mr Hibberd criticised Thames Water for not making an allowance in the design for the loads in the recycled flows from sludge treatment. In his third supplemental report he accepted that the original flow and load calculations included allowances for recycled loads to the extent that they were used to establish the 1997 loads at Mogden STW. He therefore accepted that it was incorrect to add a further 10,000 kg per day to the revised </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, Mr Hibberd originally considered that the performance of the primary settlement tanks, expressed in terms of the percentage BOD load removed for average flow condition, was well above that expected for well designed and operated primary settlement tanks. In his supplemental report, having seen exhibit AK1 to Mr Koodie’s Witness Statement, Mr Hibberd noted that Mr Koodie had assumed 35% BOD removal for the West side works and 40% BOD removal from the East side. He considered that these values were much more realistic than the 45% BOD removal values which he had been advised had been used in the process design for the average flow condition.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Thirdly, based on a BOD load of 120,000 kg/day and taking account of the reduced percentage BOD load removed, Mr Hibberd made a further criticism which is that the sludge loading rates adopted in the UWWTD design were too high for reliable nitrification by the process of oxidation of ammonia to nitrate. Mr Hibberd pointed out that nitrification was essential to achieve the Environment Agency and Tideway Discharge Requirements at Mogden STW. Based on 108,000 kg/day Mr Koodie calculated that with BOD removal rates of 35% for the West side works and 40 % for the East side works the food to mass ratio would be 1.2. Mr Hibberd calculated that the actual figure was 1.24 but in his evidence on Day 14 he accepted that a figure of 1.24 was “right at the very limit” for reliable nitrification to take place. Given my finding as to the appropriateness of a BOD figure of 108,000 kg/day I do not consider that there is anything that can be criticised in the food to mass ratio derived by Dr Koodie. On this basis I do not see that the food to mass ratio adopted by Thames Water forms the basis a valid criticism by the Claimants.  </p>

He says that in deriving the ultimate design load and by selecting conservative design parameters based on the historical performance of the works, he believed there was ample tolerance for normal operational issues. He pointed out that if there were issues with the sewage stream then chemical dosing could be initiated earlier. He considered that on the sludge stream there was ample capacity such that only 16 of the 20 digesters were required operationally. He said that it was also assumed that deterioration of assets such as the aeration lane diffusers would be dealt with by capital maintenance as is standard in practice in the water industry.  </p>

Dr Koodie said that whilst he does not recall what consideration was given to sludge capacity as part of the UWWTD works, he recalls that between 1995 and 1997 the sludge stream capacity was increased by the installation of two gravity belt thickeners to thicken the majority of the surplus activated sludge at Mogden STW. He said that, in addition , under the UWWTD works a centrifuge was installed so that 100% of the surplus activated sludge was thickened without use of the Picket Fence Thickeners.  </p>

He says that the rise in operational MLSS concentration was caused by the backup of sludge in the upstream PSTs and that the storage of large volumes of primary sludge in the PSTs resulted in limited BOD and Suspended Solids removal. He says that this, in turn, resulted in the downstream Activated Sludge Process batteries having to operate with a higher mixed liquor to ensure complete nitrification. He says that once the sludge backlog was cleared from the PSTs through the permanent solution of drum thickeners, Thames Water were able to control the MLSS at or below the design MLSS level.  </p>

One of the objectives of the study was to identify the most significant contributors to offsite odour annoyance and discuss practical options to reduce those impacts in the longer term. That report concluded, amongst other things, that the overall magnitude of emissions from Mogden STW was substantial due to the size of process operations, the open nature of the treatment process and the ineffective functioning of current odour control systems. It stated that the current capital investment program involving modification to the operation of two storm tanks was likely to result in an 8% reduction in the total odour emissions released from Mogden STW.

They indicated ways in which these causes might be reduced. They said that over and above those options further reductions might be achievable by reconfiguring the flows to enable the SSTs and the PSTs to be operated in series as a single-pass settlement system. They said that the viability of this approach would need to be evaluated in more detailed engineering and hydraulic terms so that the degree of odour emission reduction could be assessed.

The document also stated that the reasons for the increase in air demand year-on-year and the fall off in aeration performance were three fold. First there was deterioration in the condition of the air distribution main, with two very major leaks. Secondly there was a reduction in blower output with a loss of air due to leaks and with reduced efficiency due to the prolonged use without extended maintenance. Thirdly there was a reduction in the oxygen transfer efficiency because the aeration domes were over ten years old against a recommended length of service of about seven years. Domes had been examined and found to be in poor conditions because they were badly blocked.  </p>

The air blowers force air through these domes creating fine bubbles which help naturally occurring bacteria in the sewage to grow and remove ammonia. She explained that, over time, the aeration domes become blocked by fine sludge particles or they crack and develop holes through normal wear and tear.

He said there were only two deliveries in March and July 2000 of the relevant polymer used as part of the process of chemical settling and this would have been essential to achieve the 60% solids removal required for the UWWTD scheme to perform satisfactorily at 810 Ml/d. He says that Mr Ratcliff’s view confirms the poor sludge handling capacity of Mogden STW between 2002 and 2005 which he says Thames Water failed to recognise in the UWWTD project and in the subsequent sludge treatment scheme 2CKC. He says that if mechanical thickeners (for example drum thickeners, gravity belt thickeners or centrifuges) had replaced the PFTs by 2000 then extending chemical dosing treatment to assist the PST performance on both the East and West sides would have made up for most of the deficiencies which he considers there were in the UWWTD design. The Claimants also point out that Dr Koodie says that the design of the UWWTD works assumed that, should the works become stressed for whatever reason, or should plant be out of service for maintenance, chemical dosing could be introduced at lower Flow to Full Treatment values to mitigate the impact.  </p>

He says that the operators identify opportunities to return storm water to the East side treatment stream when the flow on the East side reduces below 450 Ml/d. He says that the operators then start the pumps in a particular storm tank, looking to empty those tanks which are filled first and have had the greatest storm water retention. He believes that the storm water cleaning and emptying is in line with other large sewage treatment works in the UK.  </p>

One of those items was automation of storm tank operation. It stated that automation of the storm tanks operation would ensure that storm flows are managed within the tanks and returned at the earliest opportunity. It proposed an initial stage for automation of storm tank control for half of the storm tanks. In the document produced by Mr Kingdon on 17 July 2001 he referred to work by Binnie, Black and Veatch who had been asked to look at a number of issues concerning the storm tanks and future investment. One of those items was automation of storm tank operation and he confirmed his belief that the best benefit would be gained by initially automating half of the storm tanks and also changing the storm return point and adding the scum weir.  </p>

He stated that in September 2001 Thames Water submitted an internal capital application for £400,000 to carry out some advance works based on the July 2001 Mogden project team recommendations, as Project 997D. He said this application was approved in October 2001 and completed by April 2002 and involved the installation of a storm weir scum board and relocation of the storm return pipe. He said that in October 2001 funding was granted and approval was given in May 2002 for £2.57 million worth of work, Project 50WC. He said that this included the installation of an actuated inlet flow control penstock which allowed Thames Water to balance the flow to the West and East sides of the works, modification to the storm tanks to operate in sequential fill modes so that the first to fill was the first to be emptied and installation of increased capacity storm return pumps, together with associated control system so that the tanks could be drained more quickly. He said that these works were substantially complete in October 2003.  </p>

Mr Kingdon, in his witness statement, accepted that one of the main problems with the storm tanks was the old cleaning system. He explained that it was a cable and rail system which had cables about 1 foot above the floor of the tanks with a pulley system. Scrapers with rubber bases were dragged along the cables by the pulley system with the intention of dragging the sludge which had settled on the bottom of the storm tanks into the storm tank hoppers. However he said that the scrapers would leave a film of sludge on the bottom of the tanks which could become odorous. He said that in order to overcome the limitations of that old technology Thames Water would use fire hoses to ensure that the sludge was kept moving and did not cling to the sides or bottom of the tank as it emptied. He said they would also back fill the tanks with final effluent to rinse them out. His evidence was that towards the end of 2001 or the beginning of 2002 four additional dayworks team members were hired to increase Thames Water’s manpower to carry out that task. Similar evidence was given by Mr Fishlock, Mr Williams and Ms Thomas. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">However, the question still remains as to whether or not Thames Water should have carried out the covering of storm water tanks prior to AMP4 period. Mr Peirson referred to a number of new plants where cover and treat solutions have been adopted, both for coastal and inland sewage treatment works, such as Thames Water’s new Reading STW where construction started in 2001. He refers to Northumbrian Water covering aeration lanes at Newton Aycliffe STW in a scheme completed in 1992. He attached to his report a paper describing that covering work given at a symposium in 1994. It is evident that the covering of the aeration lanes was carried out because it was found in that case that the main source of odour was the activated sludge plant. Mr Peirson also refers to United Utilities’ Davyhulme STW. He refers to a case study which says that cover and treat works were completed prior to 2004 and says that one of the early phases of cover and treat was, like Newton Aycliffe, the aeration lanes where ADAS, for whom Mr Peirson works, carried out commissioning tests on the biofilters for those aeration lane covers in August 1998. He also refers to a United Utilities plant at Sandon Docks which was a new plant which was subsequently covered and says that in 2002 when he visited it the cover and treat works seemed to be more or less complete. He refers too to Northumbria Water’s cover and treat works at Howden STW which he recalls included the primary settlement tanks prior to around 2002.  </p>

The main change was the addition of work to cover and treated the extracted air from the East side circular PSTs. They said that, in respect of the storm tanks, “we propose to cover the frequently used first fill tanks only, with the remaining tanks, which are used intermittently, operating a clean and flush system (as currently in use) to prevent the build up of sludge and hence odour.

However PFT performance remained unstable throughout the late 1990s. He said that in 1998 to 1999 Ms Tracy Williams of Thames Water led a review of the Mogden sludge stream which reported in November 1998, with recommendations in December 1998 and January 1999. He said that whilst some improvement was made to the PFTs, the performance of the PFTs again deteriorated when the weather warmed up in the summer of 1998 and 1999. He said that the recommendations made as a result of the review were implemented either by Mogden’s operations team during 1999 and 2000 or by way of the digester refurbishment project (Project 2CKC), carried out between 1999 and 2002. He said that, as recommended, additional SAS consolidation capacity was installed in May to June 1999 and that, as part of the digester refurbishment works, the PFTs were refurbished. </p>

In those circumstances in December 1998 a locally identified need was raised for funding of up to £400,000 for additional SAS thickening capacity to eliminate flow of SAS to the PFTs during normal operation and to provide some further capacity in the SAS thickening plant. The proposal was to install two additional gravity belt thickeners to take the SAS thickening capacity to 100%. As a result, he said that in February 1999 Thames Water recommended the relocation of the SAS centrifuge from Maple Lodge at a cost of about £110,000. This centrifuge was installed in May/June 1999 and did take Mogden’s SAS thickening capacity to 100%.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Crump said that the problems experienced with co-settling in 1996 to 1997 affected Thames Water’s ability to keep the liquor levels at around 2500-2700 mg/l necessary to keep the SSVI level below 100ml/g. He said that this had an impact on how hard Mogden STW had to operate to achieve the discharge consents and that following the commissioning of the SAS centrifuge there was an immediate positive effect on Mogden’s sludge stream, with the amount of sludge held in the works in 1999 and early 2000 generally much lower than it had been. However he said that the gravity belts presented a particular problem because the belts would bind and wear out, requiring maintenance. This meant that the belts had to be taken out of service for a short period which caused some spill-over of the SAS into the PSTs where it was co-settled and sent to the PFTs. </p>

Because of the need to meet new regulations for the disposal of sludge to agriculture Thames Water then embarked on  Project 2CKC to improve the heating of sludge in the digesters. The project commenced in 1999 and lasted until 2002. It involved, amongst other elements, the progressive decommissioning, refurbishment and decommissioning of the digesters. Mr Crump said that the work being carried out did temporarily reduce the capacity of the digesting process to accept thickened sludge and also reduced the flexibility of the operating sludge stream. He says that, despite planning the digester refurbishment project so as to stagger the decommissioning of the digesters, the reduction in the number of operational digesters at any one time did result in a temporarily reduced capacity to process sludge. He referred to problems which were encountered in carrying out the digester refurbishment project. It was necessary to move large amounts of asbestos cladding which covered the hot water pipes feeding into the digesters and there were problems of gas escaping from the digesters in the form of methane and H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S which had an impact on the project.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Ratcliff says the digester refurbishment project restricted the sludge volumetric throughput by 25%. He says that Thames Water calculated that, with the combined performance of the SAS mechanical thickening and the primary sludge gravity thickening, the digester retention would be 15.5 days based on a thickened sludge concentration of 4.5% dry solids. On this basis Thames Water released a bank of four digesters at a time for refurbishment. Mr Ratcliff has plotted the sludge retention across the PSTs and is of the view that, due to unexpected restrictions in the digester throughput caused by the refurbishment, the sludge built up in the PSTs resulting in long sludge retention in the period between 2001 and 2004. He says that the main issue of long sludge retention is that the dissolved oxygen is used up by bacterial action and the sludge becomes anaerobic and therefore less amenable to gravity settlement. This, he says, in turn, results in the reduction of the PFTs’ performance by producing thinner sludges.  </p>

After these trials, drum thickeners were selected as the preferred technology for mechanical thickening and in April 2002 the first machine was installed, followed by two more drum thickeners in April 2003.

He says that proper risk analysis in relation to Project 2CKC would have identified the probability of inadequate sludge handling capacity. In essence what he says is the measures subsequently adopted between 2002 and 2006 to install adequate sludge handling capacity for both the primary and secondary sludges should have been taken at least 5 years earlier. </p>

Rather they submit that they took all reasonable steps to remedy the problem once they became aware of it. They say that in 1989 to 1991, when the decision was made to install PFTs, that decision was entirely reasonable. They rely on Mr Ratcliff’s view at paragraph 104 of his main report where he says that the original decision to use PFTs was sensible as the alternative of using centrifuges was relatively unproven at that time, especially for the process of thickening. He says that Thames Water’s approach to sludge consolidation was in line with the rest of the UK Water Industry. He also says that the initial installation of PFTs in 1992 was seen as the best technology for thickening co-settled sludges, as defined in the WRc UD819 document.  </p>

There is no doubt, though, that they had performance difficulties at Mogden STW soon after they were commissioned. I do not consider that Thames Water can be criticised for attempting to deal with those matters and to optimise the performance of the PFTs as they did in the period between 1992 and 1995. It was then in 1995 that it became clear to Thames Water that the PFTs were not going to work with a high SAS content in the cosettled sludge.

That percentage reduction in the amount of co-settled sludge passing to the PFTs was not found to be enough and in 1997 Thames Water then increased the proportion of co-settled sludge diverted away from the PFTs to 75% by installing a further belt thickener. Again I do not consider that this approach was unreasonable. The final diversion then took place in May 1999 when all of the co-settled sludge was diverted away and this was done using a centrifuge which was diverted from another Thames Water site.  </p>

They point out that Mr Ratcliff also deals with alternatives, such as pumping raw and digested sludge to Perry Oaks, but considers that this would not be an appropriate temporary solution as methane would potentially have formed in the pumping main causing both health and safety and pumping issues. In addition he considers that there would have been difficulties because all of the sludge at Perry Oaks would have had to be limed to produce an acceptable bio-solids product.  </p>

She says that her priority was to reduce Mogden’s sludge backlog as quickly as possible.

To try and understand how additional plant would work in practice, she says that between July and September 2001 trials were carried out on the use of centrifuges, aqua belts and drum thickeners to thicken Mogden’s primary sludge. She says they brought onto site a centrifuge from Beckton STW and also used one of the existing SAS belt thickeners to carry out a trial putting primary sludge through this technology. She also refers to the fact that they brought a drum thickener on site to do the same. As a result of these trials she says that they discounted aqua belts because they were not particularly effective and they also discounted centrifuges as they were completely ineffective at thickening Mogden’s primary sludge. Instead she says that they decided to hire in a temporary drum thickener from Alfa Laval and in late 2001 and 2002 they progressed with acquiring and setting up this temporary drum thickener alongside the existing PFTs. She refers to the installation of this drum thickener being an onerous task and that it took approximately a month to install it and to match flows to the piece of equipment.  </p>

She says that, in 2001, drum thickeners were a relatively novel technology and when the first drum thickener was installed in February 2002 she could not be sure it would work. There were the usual teething problems with the drum thickener, she says, but it was ultimately successful and during the course of 2002 they were able to reduce the sludge backlog at Mogden STW.

First he says that the sludge trigger levels were agreed in 2005 between Thames Water and LBH as part of the negotiation to settle Thames Appeal against the July 2001 Abatement Notice. He says that as those trigger levels were agreed with LBH, who were advised at the time by the Claimants’ expert Mr Peirson, there is no basis for criticism. He says that, in any event, Mogden’s operators aimed to keep sludge levels in each PST as low as possible and certainly in line with or better than the trigger levels. Secondly Mr Gardner refers to Mr Hibberd’s evidence that best practice requires that rectangular PSTs are de-sludged four times a day so as to keep the sludge age in the tanks below six hours. Mr Gardner says that, whilst that is laid down in the guidance, it does not take account of circumstances specific to Mogden STW. At the relevant time he says that there were 20 PSTs and SSTs in operation at Mogden STW and the age of the sludge in all of those tanks had to be kept to a minimum and each tank needed to be de-sludged regularly. As a result he states that the sequence for de-sludging aimed to make best use of the desludging pumps and the sludge mains on site to keep a constant feed to the sludge thickening plant and to keep the sludge volumes in all the tanks as low as possible.  </p>

On this basis he said it is not practicable to de-sludge the West side rectangular PSTs four times a day.

During the 1990s they say that a program of refurbishment works was instituted replacing digester roofs, cleaning out the digesters to remove accumulated rag and grit, replacing the overpressure valves on the digesters and increasing the gas flare capacity. They say that this reduced the build up of excess gas in the digesters and consequently significantly reduced the number of times excess gas escaped to the atmosphere.  </p>

In the 1990s attempts were made by experimenting with various types of seal but those evidently proved to be ineffective. During Project 2CKC in 2000 to 2003 Thames Water implemented changes to the digesters which had an impact on the surplus gas production from the digesters and so relieved the pressure on the gas which was escaping through the digester seals. It also carried out other modifications which I deal with below. I have come to the view that Thames Water acted reasonably in attempting to solve the problem of leaking digester seals and have made substantial progress. The current complaint is that there is occasional foaming of the seals giving rise to gas emission. This is being dealt with by using anti-foaming agents. </p>

They refer to Thames Water’s Mogden Odour Study of December 2001 which, at paragraph 2.2.5, deals with the problem of digester seals leaks when the gas pressure in the digester dome rises, causing the dome to rise. Thames Water’s solution was to prevent high dome heights by active dome management. The report said that each of the 16 digesters would be provided with an actuated valve to control the gas take off and that this would allow the control of each individual digester dome height. </p>

It is understood that the regular release of gas is due in part to the current operational regime of balancing the extraction rate of digester gas from each digester to the gas engines. Due to the significant variation in the generation of gas from each digester at any given point, balancing of extraction cannot be sufficiently controlled to prevent release. Although in overall terms, the total odour emission associated with the release of digester gas is relatively low, it is important to note that concentrations of these releases are likely to be extremely high (measurements conducted in 2003 indicated concentrations of over 80,000ou</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span><span style="font-style:italic">/m3).

He said he thought the reason why that solution was not adopted was that it would have necessitated the conversion of the digesters from a draw and fill arrangement to a displacement arrangement which would have required major civil and hydraulic modifications but he did accept that this technology was available in the early 1990s, just as it was today.

This system, installed as part of Project 2CKC, operates by providing each digester with a radar level sensor. These sensors, or detectors, are then linked to automatic valves to allow the rate of gas take-off to rise and fall in line with digester bell heights. Thames Water rely on Mr Cranshaw’s evidence that this, together with other alterations has meant that, for at least the past seven years, the digesters on the whole can be operated without allowing gas to escape from the digester seals. The other alterations include the installation of an additional third gas main to increase capacity for drawing off digester gas for use in the combined heat and power engine; refurbishment and cleaning out of the existing gas pipe work to remove blockages and installation of condensate traps on all three gas mains to drain water which could cause blockages in the gas mains.

Thames Water therefore reasonably, in my judgment, sought to make modifications to the digester seals in order to overcome the problems. It experimented with various forms of seal but it was unsuccessful in providing a form of seal which was capable of retaining the gas within the annulus around the digesters. In my judgment, it was at that stage that consideration should have been given to some further method.  </p>

She says she recalls spending a considerable amount of time chasing the maintenance  contractor, Engenica, between March and July 2001 for a new water pump for the bioscrubber. She said because of the continuing delay in obtaining this pump, in July 2001 as recommended by Mr Wallis, Thames Water took PFT Bioscrubbber 1 out of commission and ducted the air to PFT Bioscrubbber 2 as a temporary solution. She says that this solution was effective at abating odour from PFT Bioscrubber1 with the H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S level for the combined flows at 0.32 ppm down from 12 ppm for PFT Bioscrubber 1 in July 2001.  </p>

She said that because they are a biological process, the bioscrubbers were not always very good at responding to rapid changes in odour load and she said it was an uphill battle to keep the OCUs functioning while still addressing problems with the sludge stream. She said that therefore during 2002 they tried to improve the performance of the bioscrubbers by tackling the root cause which was the PFTs themselves.  </p>

In relation to the PFT Bioscrubber they said that the measured efficiency of treatment for both scrubber towers was negative, implying that in addition to release of the sludge odours extracted from the tanks, the towers themselves were generating odour emissions. The right hand fan was found to be extracting at 10% of the extraction rate applied by the left hand tower.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Gardner says that during 2003 and 2004 this PMG OCU preformed well, as demonstrated by the OCU Monitoring data. He said that the new pasteurisation plant was then commissioned from May 2005 and with the installation of this new pasteurisation stage in the sludge stream, between sludge thickening and digestion, the TSHTs were converted into pasteurised sludge holding tanks. He says that OCU performance monitoring first picked up a problem with the PMG unit on 13 June 2005 when H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S readings were 1.1 to 1.2ppm, above the 1.0 ppm trigger level. On 24 June 2005 readings were 1.3-1.5ppm. However Mr Gardner says that OCU performance improved by the end of June and remained below the trigger level in July and part of August. He says that in June 2005 PMG staff were monitoring the OCU performance as part of the pasteurisation commissioning process and detected reduced performance of this OCU. They therefore replaced the carbon in this OCU in mid July 2005. Despite this, for a short period in August 2005 and again in November and December 2005 the OCU was found during monitoring to breach the 1.0ppm trigger level.  </p>

In an email he reported that, on analysis of the samples of the carbon bed, it was very wet, the alkaline impregnate was still present and active but physical absorption capacity of the carbon was being compromised by the high humidity. He reported on low H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S outlet readings but said that, despite this, there was a definite “cabbage like” odour in the outlet air, attributable to the presence of chemicals which would normally be absorbed by the carbon. He said that the high humidity was of concern and much more condensation had been noticed since the conversion of the two sludge vessels. He said that the humidity should enhance rather than reduce the efficiency of H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S removal as this is dealt with by the alkali impregnate. He said that the cabbage like odour could be removed by installing a second stage vessel containing a suitable base activated carbon.  </p>

He says that the high humidity in the OCU was eventually confirmed as being due to the fact that air from the pasteurised sludge which passed through the OCU was hotter and wetter than anticipated and contained a very high level of H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S, up to 1,200 ppm.

In late 2006 investigations revealed that the high humidity had caused the carbon media to contract and collapse the internal supports in the OCU. As a result of these discussions it was decided to carry out works temporarily to duct part of the air from the pasteurisation holding tanks to the sludge thickening building OCU so as to remove part of the load from the PMG unit and that work was completed by the Summer of 2007. Whilst this reduced the odour from the PMG unit there was concern that it overloaded the thickening building OCU.  </p>

He says that the media used in this OCU, whether mainly activated carbon for the PMG unit or a higher proportion of chemical oxidising material for the Peacemaker unit will always have a limited life, depending on the combination of the concentration of odorous compounds and the volume or weight of activated carbon and chemical oxidants in the filter. Mr Peirson says that, for this reason, it is critically important that such abatement units are very carefully monitored to determine when the carbon is fully saturated or the chemical oxidation component of the media has been depleted so that the media can be changed as soon as it is spent.  </p>

He explains that the pasteurisation OCU is an ERG wet chemical scrubber unit designed to achieve an outlet air odour concentration of 1,000 odour units. He says it was commissioned in May 2005 and almost immediately proved to be problematic. He recalls that it used up chemicals at a much faster rate than it was designed to use. He says that problems were first identified during commissioning although at first, in early 2005, the OCU achieved adequate levels of odour abatement, with an H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S reading of less than 1.0ppm, except on three occasions between May and October 2005.  </p>

As a result, commissioning ceased in November 2005 and ERG were asked to investigate. He says that in November 2005 iron dosing was introduced year round in the PSTs to reduce the loading on the pasteurisation OCU. The OCU unit was, he says, found to be performing inadequately in 2006 and Costain, who were responsible for the overall works of which this OCU was part, found and reported in June 2006 that the OCU was performing to high efficiency by removing 99% of the odour but that there was still a residual odour greater than the specified 3,500 odour units. Costain said that based on the olfactometric tests and from practical experience on site the discharge from the stack was not offensive.  </p>

He says that in early 2006 in order to provide a back up OCU for use if the ERG unit’s performance became unacceptable, a thermal oxidiser was installed but in August 2006 minor explosions occurred in the thermal oxidiser plant. These were found to be caused because small amounts of methane had built up which were not anticipated. This meant that from early 2007 the thermal oxidiser has not been used. He says that a new biofilter was being procured to replace the thermal oxidiser and act as a backup for the ERG OCU. </p>

In relation to olfactometric testing he says that the general view within the water industry up until 2000 was that olfactometeric testing was expensive and imprecise and that the use of H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S measurements was more precise, cheaper and could be deployed on a regular basis to provide information on odour. He considers that it was entirely reasonable for Thames Water to rely on the established testing regime with H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S on a monthly or fortnightly or weekly basis. He said it was known from the late 1990s that overloading of biological OCUs could result in continuing good removal of H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S but poor removal of other odorous components resulting in poor overall odour abatement efficiency.

He says that until 2002 the main indicator used for the odour control units was an approximate 95% reduction in H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S from inlet to outlet. Following the upholding of the abatement notice, he says that these trigger levels were then set at 1.0ppm in the odour management plan provided to LBH. Dr McIntyre’s view is that, over time, the trigger levels have been reduced as set out in correspondence with LBH. He says that the setting of trigger levels is an iterative process and it is important to set the trigger levels recognising the potential onset of an odour problem. Equally he says that it is important not to set the initial level at such a value that it generates many false alarms. His experience of the process is that an initial provisional trigger level is tried for a period and its performance is then reviewed so that the level can then be adjusted if necessary.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Subsequently Thames Water provided odour management plans to LBH. In the version in June 2005 it provided for boundary monitoring at section 3.4.1 and OCU monitoring at section 3.4.2. That monitoring was to be carried out on a weekly basis using a Jerome Hydrogen Sulphide analyser. There was a provision for trigger levels of 0.5ppm H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S at the main pumping station and 1.0ppm H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S at the imported sludge, thickening plant, pasteurisation plant and transfer pumping station OCUs. If any of those trigger/action levels were exceeded, this was to be reported to LBH the next working day. It stated that olfactory performance tests on each OCU would be carried out annually. In revision 6 to that document dated December 2007 the trigger level was amended, as stated above, with figures of 0.2ppm to 1.0ppm for all plant and 0.05ppm for the new plant at the East and West inlet works.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In his witness statement Mr Gardner explains that the trigger levels adopted in June 2005 were derived by considering historic performance of OCUs and their specified performance levels and were set in conjunction with LBH’s Environmental Health Officers. He says that in late 2007 a number of these trigger levels were revised downwards at the request of LBH and because the relevant OCUs were consistently performing below the trigger level.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In principle the purpose of the trigger level must be to avoid situations in which there are undesirable emissions of odour from the OCUs. As a result there should be a correlation between the H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S trigger levels and the stage at which emission of odour exceeds acceptable levels. The evidence, including that of Mr Gardner, shows that the trigger levels were first set in June 2005. There does not appear to have been a detailed analysis to consider the relationship between H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S trigger levels and odour emissions. Dr McIntyre in his evidence on Day 16 confirmed that the setting of trigger levels is an iterative process in which an initial provisional trigger level is set and trialled and adjusted if necessary. He said that process would take two to three months or in other cases it would take a year if not longer. It depends on the frequency of the measurements and the trends that can be identified in those measurements.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In this case there appears to have been no reaction by Thames Water when the sludge reception OCU was showing very substantial emissions of 100,000 odour units as detected by OdourNet’s testing in 2005 and yet as shown by Mr Peirson’s analysis at paragraph 21.5.48 of his main report the outlet H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S concentrations were only 0.24 – 0.34ppm. It is also of concern that regularly H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S emissions were in excess of the trigger level of 1.0ppm for the Sludge Reception OCU, as set out in table 21 to Mr Peirson’s main report but this does not seem to have led to any action by Thames Water. As Dr McIntyre says in his main report at paragraph 4.1.99, it was reasonable for Thames Water to rely upon the established testing regime with H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S. However he says that it had been known from the late 1990s that overloading of biological OCUs, in particular, could result in continuing good removal of Hydrogen Sulphide but poor removal of other odorous components, resulting in poor overall odour abatement efficiency. He says that these limitations in Hydrogen Sulphide testing were then recognised at Mogden STW in 2002, following the survey for the First OdourNet Report and that annual olfactometric and Hydrogen Sulphide testing was initiated.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On the basis of this evidence I do not consider that Thames Water acted reasonably in the way in which they set trigger levels prior to 2007 in those cases where, despite H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S concentrations being below those trigger levels, there were still excessive emissions of odour from the OCUs. By 2002 it is apparent that Thames Water had realised that olfactometric testing was necessary to capture odour emissions in addition to emissions of Hydrogen Sulphide. In those cases where I have found that there were failures in respect of the OCUs then I consider that the Claimants are justified in their contention that Thames Water have failed to take adequate account of the limitations of Hydrogen Sulphide testing and have failed to define suitable trigger levels for the OCUs. In addition, as identified above, Thames Water   have failed to utilise the  odour monitoring equipment on the OCUs in those circumstances where the H<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>S concentrations have been in excess of the trigger levels but this has not led to appropriate action by Thames Water within a reasonable time. </p>

My first two case studies demonstrate how models can be successfully applied, not just in a technical sense but also as a public relations tool.

There was then consideration on a number of occasions of the odour impact of particular pieces of plant but the focus of attention by Thames Water was on specific projects to comply with new statutory requirements such as the UWWTD and the regulations concerned with pathogens in sludge used, in the end, for agriculture. My general impression is that emphasis was not placed on odour reduction measures until 1999 at the earliest, with matters developing in the applications for funding in the AMP periods. </p>

I accept Mr Peirson’s evidence that other water companies such as Severn Trent and Northumbrian Water had policies in relation to odour earlier in the 1990s. I would have expected Thames Water, as a reasonably competent operator of Mogden STW to have had more focus on odour as an aspect of policy at Mogden STW from at least 1999 than is evident from the documents. In this respect I consider that Thames Water did fall short of the required standard and to that extent the particular of negligence is made out.   </p>

The particular allegations are dealt with within the schedule of failings on which I have set out my findings above. The Claimants criticise Thames Water for the lack of olfactometric testing prior to 2002 and for carrying out no olfactometric testing of OCUs in 2006. They rely on Mr Peirson’s evidence that Thames Water did not retest failed plant after remedial measures were carried out and say that Thames Water’s approach to OCU monitoring and testing has contributed to long periods of inefficient or inadequate performance of OCUs which has contributed to elevated odour emissions from OCUs resulting in offsite odour.  </p>

Thames Water did carry out some ferric dosing and whilst the cost may have been more to carry out the level of ferric dosing necessary during those Summer months I do not consider that this falls within the area of issues which are nonjusticiable. Such chemical dosing was part of the proper operation of Mogden STW and the additional cost would be part of the work necessary to operate and maintain the existing plant. </p>

Rather they say that between 2001 and 2004 sludge backlogs within the PSTs on occasions rose to very high levels which resulted in very poor PST performance in terms of suspended solids and BOD removal rates. However they rely on Mr Ratcliff’s evidence in his main report at section 4.4 where he points out that in the UWWTD design chemical dosing was only to be used on the West side at flows of between 690 and 810Ml/d. He also states that during 2001 to 2004 when the sludge backlogs within the PSTs rose on occasions to very high levels this would have resulted in very poor performance in terms of suspended solids and BOD removal. He says that in these conditions the addition of chemicals would have exacerbated the problem since chemical dosing would have increased sludge production and produced a very thin sludge which would have been less amenable to gravity thickening.  </p>

Whilst chemical dosing may have had some impact on the gravity thickening of the sludge in the PFTs I do not consider that Thames Water took reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the high flows to full treatment by carrying out chemically assisted settlement.

Nuisance is an act or omission which is an interference with, disturbance of or annoyance to, a person in the exercise or enjoyment of (a) a right belonging to him as a member of the public, when it is a public nuisance, or (b) his ownership or occupation of land or of some easement, profit, or other right used or enjoyed in connection with land, when it is a private nuisance.” </span>

Thereafter a complaint of nuisance by interference with the enjoyment of life in the village would on any view have to show such a degree of interference with enjoyment as exceeded such levels of noise and impurity of air as are inevitable in a neighbourhood in which oil refinery business is to be regarded as the norm. This perhaps difficult question of fact is not the same as the question whether the refinery has been constructed and operated with due regard to the application of such mechanical and chemical devices as will minimise interference with the lives of the inhabitants of the village, i.e. the question of negligence in the special sense in which breach of the duty of care is described in this context. So if it is right to hold as a matter of construction of the Act that it was not the intention of Parliament to grant the defendants a licence to invade the common law rights of the inhabitants by subjecting them to any degree of interference with their comfort and convenience by noise, vibration, or air pollution, there will still remain the question whether the complaints of the plaintiff are such as to constitute a nuisance having regard to the changed character of the environment which Parliament has authorised.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Thirdly, the Claimants rely on management inefficiency. They refer to the definition that Ofwat gave to this term where, by way of example they said that “<span style="font-style:italic">where a company in fact failed to deliver an improvement in service or quality that Ofwat has assumed when setting price limits previously, this might be reflective of inefficient management by the company in question.</span>” The Claimants submit that if, as a result of Thames Water’s negligence, odour has caused a nuisance to the Claimants and this is a result of management inefficiency the issue is justiciable regardless of whether the work in question would require capital expenditure. They refer to Mr Day’s evidence where he said that in relation to Regulatory Capital Value (RCV) water companies would not be allowed to include expenditure on outputs which it should have been delivering in any case and that this element of “inefficiency” would not be expenditure which customers would be expected to finance on a permanent basis. The Claimants submit that if odour nuisance was caused through Thames Water’s negligence in failing to allocate expenditure to carry out work on operational or capital items to resolve a nuisance, then this work would be something which Thames Water should have been carrying out anyway and not something that customers should be expected to finance. In such circumstances the Claimants submit that nuisance caused by management inefficiency would be justiciable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Fourthly the Claimants refer to “capital efficiency”. Capital efficiency is defined by Ofwat as  “the efficiency of using capital expenditure to deliver outputs”.  In setting price limits Ofwat make assumptions that a water company will be required to incur capital expenditure over the relevant period in order to deliver a particular output such as an improvement in service. A capital efficiency occurs where that output is in fact achieved for a capital cost that is less that the amount contained in Ofwat’s assumption. The Claimants submit that once capital efficiency has been achieved by a water company, Ofwat has no role in how the monies saved by that efficiency are allocated. Such expenditure, Mr Day said, would be permanently reflected in a water company’s RCV unless it went over the overall capital expenditure envelope. The Claimants say that  in 1995 to 2000, as appears from the evidence, Thames Water had capital efficiencies of £500m some £65m of which was allocated to sewerage services. The Claimants say that, in particular, in the context of Mogden STW, the UWWTD Scheme led to savings of at least £47m and probably £70m. The Claimants submit that in an <span style="text-decoration:underline">Allen</span> case where there is reasonable evidence to show cost savings were obtained by Thames Water, it is for Thames Water to show that the capital efficiencies were not obtained, otherwise the court is entitled to infer that such savings were obtained. The Claimants contend, in particular, in relation to the UWWTD Scheme that the adoption of Option 2B was to gain capital efficiency savings and this option led to the failure of Mogden STW to be able to comply with the discharge requirements which then caused increased use of the storm tanks and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Fifthly the Claimants rely on sums available and used for the payment of dividends to the shareholders of Thames Water. The Claimants say that Ofwat has no role in these sums used by Thames Water to pay dividends to their shareholders. They rely on Dr Spillett’s evidence and submit that the question of whether profits should be paid as dividends or used for odour control works at Mogden STW is entirely a matter within the control of Thames Water. As a result the Claimants contend that if the court considers that odour nuisance has been caused to the Claimants as a result of Thames Water’s negligence that could have been dealt with by works which could have been paid for from profits prior to their allocation to dividend payments, then the claims would be justiciable by the court as being outside the statutory scheme. </p>

It intended the decision to rest with the Director, subject only to judicial review.

He explained Ofwat’s role in reviewing water and sewerage undertakers’ investment plans and setting annual price limits for each undertaker. He explained that annual price limits are set every five years as a result of undertakers’ detailed investment plans known as Asset Management Plans (“AMPs”). He said that the price limits for the AMP2 period (1995-2000) were set by Ofwat in 1994; those for AMP3 period (2000-2005) were set in 1999 and those for AMP4 (2005-2010) were set in December 2004.

He said that Thames Water were keen to persuade Ofwat to elevate odour to a DG level of service because this would mean that odour control would be based on and regulated under a specific set of standards. He said he presented to that subgroup evidence of the odour complaints that Thames Water had received to support their argument that odour was a legitimate customer concern that should be elevated to a DG level of service. In response Ofwat’s customer service manager, Mr Mike Saunders, adduced evidence of a greater level of customer complaints in relation to, amongst other things, sewer flooding and low pressure water and said that such areas should be priorities and that there was not sufficient evidence to justify elevating odour to a DG level of service.  </p>

The Frame Work and Approach to the 1994 Periodic Review</span>” and said that the paper made it clear that Ofwat would be seeking to curtail any price increases so far as possible in the AMP2 period and the funding obtained through customer charges would be prioritised towards meeting mandatory obligations such as those imposed by the UWWTD. He said that where customers wanted improvements in the levels of service such as odour control over and above the small allowance in the charges, funding would only be available if there was very clear evidence of customer support for that. Dr Spillett referred to meetings in November and December 1993 which showed that Ofwat was to issue its draft determinations in mid-May 1994 and final determinations in July 1994 in relation to the AMP2 period.  </p>

He referred to the statement that the level of additional funding that Thames Water were seeking for “Sewage odour control” under DG levels of service was 0.2% of the total funding that Thames Water were seeking. He said that in the Corporate Business Strategy appended to the Strategic Business Plan, Thames Water had included a detailed section on sewage odour control. Under the heading “costings and time scales” they had referred, in relation to odour, to a number of problem sites which had been studied in detail and stated that the AMP 2 odour control project had identified the need for a relatively small investment provision of £8.458 million in addition to the investment already allocated to odour control in the capital programme of £3.953 million. He said that although Mogden STW was not mentioned by name as one of the problem sites studied in detail, he recalled that Mogden STW was one of those sites.  </p>

Ofwat said that it expected the water industry to achieve an average cost reduction of 4% in its capital expenditure programme, together with a continuing annual reduction of 1% a year.

He prepared a document for Ofwat with the title “Main Quality Costings Submissions-May 1998” which referred to odour control so that previous expenditure could be “logged up” as part of the funding arrangements. There was reference to the fact that odour complaints might result in Abatement Notices and an estimate that about 26 sites would need attention with a current forecast cost of some £10 million. Dr Spillett said that this showed that Thames Water were pressing Ofwat to allow funding for odour. He referred to other documents prepared in 1998 which were sent to Ofwat indicating the need for funding for odour management and control work. He said that in a document in October 1998 Ofwat indicated the areas of enhanced service which did not include odour and that it appeared that only Thames Water and Anglian Water were pressing for extra funding to combat odour.  </p>

It is also clear from the evidence of Mrs Newman that there was an element of efficiency saving where funding had been applied for and obtained but had not been spent on particular projects. She confirmed that Thames Water were able to make efficiency savings which meant there were sums available. There are therefore other sources of funding which Thames Water could apply to deal with odour control.

Any decision by the court that Thames Water should have spent significant sums of money in a particular AMP period on improving odour emissions by way of providing major capital plant or carrying out major capital projects would, in my judgment, be inconsistent with and conflict with the statutory process conducted by Ofwat under the WIA. The question of investment in major plant or projects would, I consider, necessitate the use of money derived from customers’ bills and the decisions on what plant and projects a water company can invest in is evidently a matter for determination by Ofwat in any particular period balancing the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Obviously what is major plant or a major project and what is minor is a matter of fact and degree. In general minor capital plant or minor capital projects would come under capital maintenance where a water company would have to allocate funds that it has for capital maintenance by balancing the needs of a particular facility with the needs of its overall facilities. Whilst the overall sums available for capital maintenance would depend on funds made available by Ofwat through customer bills, in this case it is Thames Water’s decision whether they should spend capital maintenance funds. I do not therefore consider that decisions on items of plant or projects which amount to capital maintenance would therefore generally be within the statutory scheme. It follows that decisions of this court where there has been <span style="text-decoration:underline">Allen</span> negligence in relation to minor capital plant or minor capital projects which would generally come within capital maintenance would be justiciable because such decisions would not conflict with or be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.      </p>

As the Claimants point out in the overall scheme of things there are other sources of funding. That does not seem to me to alter the general principle that certain investment decisions have to be made with the involvement of Ofwat so that the interests of the customer paying bills which provide finance can be balanced with the investment plans of the water companies using that finance. Thus, if a water company has funds available from other sources such as sales of land, capital efficiency or sums that would otherwise be distributed to dividends, that should not avoid the need to involve Ofwat in major investment decisions.    </p>

Ofwat said that Undertakers were to fund improvements in standards of service “<span style="font-style:italic">through greater efficiency rather than higher prices ...

Thames also say that capital or capital maintenance spending which goes beyond the parameters which Ofwat allows do not count towards the RCV and hence Thames Water’s rate of return, unless Ofwat expressly approves it.

In coming to this view, Thames Water say that Ofwat was making its own assessment of the then current strength of feeling about odour from sewage treatment works. Thames Water say that in exercising its discretion by not authorising funding for new quality and environmental obligations, Ofwat determined the line which it would take when considering the adequacy or otherwise of an undertaker’s performance of its statutory duty under s.94(1)(b) at that particular time.  </p>

In relation to other enhancements, sewer flooding and low water pressure were seen as being matters where funding allowances were made, However the view was taken by Ofwat that much had been achieved in relation to other improvements over the past five years without any specific allowance in prices and that it did not consider that prices needed to be increased to allow for other improvements to customer service levels proposed by water companies. As Mr Day confirmed there was no allowance for service level improvements in relation to odour which was in accordance with the general Ofwat policy. </p>

Those investment decisions by Ofwat do engage s.2(2A)(c) under which Ofwat have to make those decisions in a manner best calculated to ensure that Thames Water are able, in particular, by securing reasonable returns on their capital, to finance the proper carrying out of the relevant functions.

In a letter dated 8 July 1985 he confirmed his preliminary opinion that the cause of the problem was the mosquito Cp Molestus which was found breeding abundantly in underground tunnels over a wide area at the Mogden Works. He said that the present situation at Mogden represented the most substantial infestation of Cp Molestus detected in the UK for many years. He said that the increasing number of public complaints was representative of a genuinely rising problem. He stated that this should be contained by immediate use of insecticide. He said that current counter measures should reduce the problem to a harmless level and he hoped that it could be totally eliminated during the next winter by means of a thorough insecticidal treatment throughout the underground system at Mogden STW.  </p>

He said that, when he had written to Dr Hawkins in June 1986, he had felt complacent that no part of the works appeared to be infested following extensive applications of insecticide by TWA’s staff and by LBH Operators since mid 1985 when many public complaints were caused by these mosquitoes spreading from the works.  </p>

He referred to a Hounslow Borough Council file which documented outbreaks of Cp Molestus at Mogden Works as far back as 1939.

Adult mosquitoes were found at two sites within the 2 km radius and at another site 5km from Mogden STW. These were thought to be Cp Molestus given the nature of their habitat at that time of year. The populations of Cp Molestus found outside Mogden STW during the winter survey were, I accept, unlikely to have originated from Mogden STW because Cp Molestus do not disperse very far from their breeding site. I accept Mr Burgess’ evidence that the human-biting mosquito populations found outside Mogden STW during the Greenhunter winter survey were therefore probably self-supporting populations which did not originate from Mogden STW. </p>

However, the commonest mosquito seen at and in the area of Mogden STW is another biotype of the Cp species, Cp Pipiens. It is indistinguishable morphologically from Cp Molestus. Cp Pipiens tends to breed in open, over-ground water bodies, whereas Cp Molestus usually breeds in enclosed areas. As a result, Cp Molestus breeding sites may survive the winter in enclosed areas, whereas Cp Pipiens and their larvae will not last the cold. Textbooks distinguish between Cp Pipiens which bite birds not humans in the UK whereas Cp Molestus bite humans. Cp Molestus lay their first batch of eggs autogenously, that is, without needing a blood meal. An effect of this is that it is not necessary for Cp Molestus to seek a blood meal if their habitat is otherwise suitable for them. Cp Molestus cannot be told apart from Cp Pipiens by visual identification but can be by observations in the field or by breeding and seeing if they need a blood meal before laying eggs. Since 2009 DNA tests have become commercially available to distinguish between them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The criticisms made by Mr Boase are, first, that the mosquito larval survey techniques used were insufficient to enable the larvicide to be applied at a time when the larvae are most susceptible. Secondly, he says that the surveys of adult mosquitoes were insufficient to enable the main breeding sites to be clearly defined and the impact of treatments determined. Thirdly, he says that prior to 2003 surveys were much less comprehensive with the result that some larval sites may not have been detected and information of use to the insecticide treatment program was not recorded. Fourthly, he said that no systematic attempt was made to identify the bio type of the mosquitoes present in the various habitats within Mogden STW. He says that as a result, the control effort is likely to have been much less targeted and the prospect for eradication less likely than would otherwise have been the case.  He says that although the detail of the survey was likely to have been decided on initially by Bioscan he criticises Thames Water for not having recognised and addressed the shortcomings over time. For instance, he says that they should have reacted to the lack of written recommendations on maintenance and preventive work provided by Bioscan to Thames Water between 1991 and 2001.  </p>

Thames Water say that in the pre-1998 period, Dr Ismay spent one day a week in Summer and one day a fortnight in Winter walking round the site, concentrating on key areas which might be potential breeding sites. Thames Water also submit that there is, in any event, no causation because there had not been any significant problem in 1998 or for the few years before. They also say that a wider survey would not have revealed anything further and so, given that the claim period only starts in early 1999, any lack of surveying pre-1998 is irrelevant. </p>

Hence, they sprayed all mosquitoes seen, whether or not they are in a habitat generally associated with Cp Pipiens or Cp Molestus. They submit that it is not clear how differentiation of the biotypes would have helped in practice to reduce the number of Cp Molestus at Mogden STW because any treatment would have to be carried out without waiting until either the breeding experiment or DNA analysis was completed, otherwise the larvae would be mosquitoes on the wing before the results were available. </p>

He says that given the size of the site he could not inspect every single actual or potential breeding site each week. He therefore drew up a list of 15 key sites to survey each week. As he moved around the site he said he also inspected any other places that he considered might be potential breeding sites, for example leaking pipes producing puddles of water. He would then advise Thames Water that these needed to be dealt with. He says that between 1992 and 2002 this remained the regime and the mosquito populations at Mogden STW were under control, with the summer months in some years suffering from outbreaks which were treated. He says that in 2002 further investment into the surveying process was made by Thames Water. Bioscan were contracted to provide two man-days per week in the summer and 1.5 mandays in the winter for the surveying and reporting process. </p>

I understand that similar information was provided prior to that date orally. Whilst since 2002 to 2003 the site has been divided up into many more sites and therefore more information is available as a result of the survey, I do not consider that it can be said that prior to 1998 Thames Water, failed to carry out adequate surveys of mosquito infestation in and around Mogden STW. As set out in the documents and having seen Dr Ismay give evidence I consider that the surveys carried out were of a high standard and were adequate to identify any infestations which existed. Dr Ismay also identified where treatment should be provided and I accept that the surveys which he produced were sufficient for others, who were employed to control mosquito infestations, to apply the necessary treatment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In relation to Mr Boase’s view that attempts should have been made to identify the biotype of the mosquitoes present in various habitats within Mogden STW, the approach taken by Dr Ismay and Mr Colvin was that when mosquito larval activity was found they spray all the mosquitoes seen, whether or not that are in a habitat generally associated with Cp Pipiens or Cp Molestus mosquitoes. Given the need to act quickly to apply the necessary treatments I accept Thames Water’s submission that no benefit would have been derived from such an analysis. The recent 2009 survey using DNA techniques would, in my view, be a wholly impracticable approach. It would also be unnecessary because treatment of mosquito habitats cannot be determined by the analysis of a number of mosquitoes from each site. Besides the time factor for carrying out the necessary breeding experiments or DNA analysis to identify bio type, the 2009 survey has shown that there is no clear line between the habitats for Cp Pipiens  and Cp Molestus and therefore the analysis would not usefully assist in the treatment program.  </p>

Mr Boase says that the level of infestation within Mogden STW fluctuates from year to year but the data shows no clear evidence of a systematic decline. He concludes that Thames Water have not been effectively managing the mosquito control work carried out by their contractors and in-house staff and, as a result, mosquito nuisance has continued at a substantially higher level than would otherwise have been the case.  </p>

There is no evidence that the current use of Bti is ineffective or that some other form of larvicide would be more effective. Equally I consider that there are good reasons, as set out by Mr Colvin in his Witness Statement, why adulticides are not generally used. I accept Mr Burgesses’ evidence that resistance monitoring, although a desirable practice under appropriate conditions would have been likely to have been inappropriate and not informative in the circumstances at Mogden STW, particularly because the majority of breeding site only harbour CPP and partly because obtaining sufficient putatively undesirable Cp Molestus would require allowing relatively large numbers of insects to survive in order to obtain enough specimens to perform an adequate evaluation. He also says, and I accept, that monitoring for resistance to the larvicide is similarly difficult as, with only a small proportion of larvae at any one time or in any one locality, it is again difficult to obtain enough and then rear to provide a reasonable population at the next generation to make any test reasonably reliable. He refers to an article showing that it is not as simple and cost effective as Mr Boase suggests.  </p>

Equally there were recommendations made by Dr Ismay on 16 September 2003 which do not appear to have been carried out.

They should be flushed regularly to prevent large mosquito populations building up. It is not possible to spray such a large area effectively, thus prevention of mosquitoes by mechanical means is the only real option for control. The new systems of draining the ‘hoppers’, which are left wet when the tanks are drained, is useful, but regular flushing is still necessary.</span>”  </p>

As Mr Burgess says in his report at paragraph 35 the construction changes which were made greatly improved the physical aspects to eliminate potential breeding sites and to minimise accumulation of standing water. Those changes were made substantially as part of the overwintering sites project in 2006. </p>

Mr Burgess’ view was that due to the structure of the Mogden STW site there are some breeding sites that cannot be completely eliminated for operational reasons or reasons of access. Mr Boase, on the other hand, considers that had thorough mosquito and surveying control work been carried out, in conjunction with a systematic program of building and associated works, then it is likely that eradication could have been achieved.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In response to Thames Water’s contention that even if eradication were achieved it would be pointless because of Cp Molestus breeding outside the works, the Claimants say that the threat of a re-invasion of Cp Molestus in this way is low. They point out that no Cp Molestus were found outside Mogden STW in the 2009 survey; Cp Molestus in Mogden STW are highly inbred; there is no evidence of clustering in the area around Mogden STW (save around the site itself); the overwintering sites found in the 2005 survey outside Mogden STW were not extensive; any Cp Molestus breeding outside Mogden STW relates to small, temporary populations that are eliminated each winter by cold weather. They refer to the evidence of Mr Burgess on day 17 where he said his opinion had changed and he agreed with Mr Boase that, very largely, the Cp Molestus populations off site were transient and although he would never say there was no risk of re-invasion, the risk was lower.  </p>

I do not consider that they can be criticised for not carrying out overwintering site works earlier than 2006 nor do I consider that the scope and the extent of the works within the overwintering sites project can be criticised as not being reasonable. Indeed no serious criticism is made of the scope and extent of those works. In the circumstances I consider that Thames Water have carried out the necessary survey, treatment  and construction works to seek to eradicate Cp Molestus at Mogden STW and I am not persuaded that there is any particular aspect which Thames Water should have carried out but failed to do so because they were not aiming to eradicate Cp Molestus.  </p>

In the form which was sent round to each of the Claimants so that they could summarise the position in relation to their complaints, she indicated that there was a severe daily problem with odour in April to September 2004 and 2005 and April to June 2006. At other times there was a moderate problem more than once a week in the period from November 2003 until June 2006. She has registered two complaints on the MRAG website and said that she initially had not had access to a computer but when she later had access to one she said she believed that nothing would be done and it was a waste of time and effort to record the complaints. In terms of odour she said it was intermittent but on occasion so severe that it put her off eating and meant that she had to re-wash her work uniform which she left drying on the balcony of her flat because she was afraid that there would be odour in the clothes.  </p>

The next day they woke up with the smell of sewage in the house and he says that it became obvious during November 1998 that there was an odour problem in the area. He contacted the London Borough of Hounslow (LBH) in December 1998 but was advised to contact Thames Water directly. Between December 1998 and June 1999 he contacted Thames Water and LBH on various occasions to complain but was advised that the works were undergoing a program to improve maters. He submitted odour logs for the period July to September 1999 at the suggestion of LBH but he said that LBH appear to have mislaid those logs. He started preparing further logs from September 1999 onwards. I have seen the logs which he prepared for September to November 1999 and in July 2000.  </p>

As a result of further meetings it was decided to submit a petition to Thames Water and on 19 September 2001 a petition with over 3,000 signatures was handed to Thames Water. Mr. Taylor was asked to and provided a witness statement in relation to the proceedings following the Abatement Notice served by LBH on 19 July 2001 upon Thames Water.

She said that she would describe the odour as one of raw sewage and on some days it was absolutely vile and made her feel physically sick. She said that the smell generally remained in the house all day and it especially seemed to linger upstairs. She said that she remembered that the odours from Mogden were particularly bad in the Summer of 2008 and 2009. She said that the problems have affected the family as they had a big garden with swings and a trampoline and a paddling pool in the summer for the children to use but when the smells are bad the children have to come in from the garden to get away from it. In her evidence she described the conditions on the day of the Site Visit by the Court. She said that there was a terrible smell at about 12:00 to 1:00pm and it was raining. In fact it was dry on that day and no odour was detected.</p>

Dispersion modelling takes account of a range of factors which affect the way in which odours mix and disperse in the atmosphere, including local topography, the nature of the odour release such as a chimney or tank and local weather conditions. These dispersion models calculate concentrations at points on a grid which then allows odour contours to be plotted to show odour concentrations (ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>) which are not exceeded for 98% of the time (98th percentile) at each point.  </p>

In his report Mr Peirson refers to the draft guidance document produced by the Environment Agency, as revised in 2009, which suggests three benchmark standards:  For the most offensive odours, which include wastewater treatment, a standard of a 98th percentile hourly mean of 1.5 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>; for medium offensive odours, such as frying/food processing, a 98th percentile hourly mean of 3.0 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> and for the least offensive odours, such as chocolate manufacture or coffee roasting, a 98th percentile hourly mean of 6.0 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>.

He says that the actual odour concentration above which annoyance and nuisance will arise will be site specific and will also be influenced by local meteorological conditions. He refers to the First OdourNet Report in 2002 which found that 98% of the odour complaints were received from locations which experienced an odour concentration greater than a 98th percentile hourly mean of 5.0 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> which he considers lends weight to this a 98th percentile hourly mean of 1.5 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3 </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I have to consider whether the odour which has been caused by particular odours has amounted to a nuisance in law and, if so, to assess damages for that nuisance. It is clear that odour concentrations below 1.5 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> would not be considered to be a nuisance but I must bear in mind the fact that, on the basis of my findings, there are a number of processes at Mogden STW which Thames Water carry out and which do not give rise to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Allen</span> negligence but clearly give rise to odour emissions. It is therefore the additional odour nuisance caused by matters for which Thames Water are liable under <span style="text-decoration:underline">Allen</span> which I must consider. Such an assessment has no precise mathematical correlation with odour concentration figures and the application of a particular figure is difficult in this case because there has been no modelling of the odour conditions for which I have held Thames Water liable. I would be reluctant to find nuisance if the odour concentration was only 1.5 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> but as the odour concentration rises to 5 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> I consider that this is the area where nuisance from Mogden STW would start and that by the time that 5 ou<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">E</span> per m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span> or above is reached nuisance will certainly be established.  </p>

Mr Donaldson considers, in summary, that the values agreed are the same with or without the impact of the nuisance form Mogden STW. Mr Dickenson considers that it is possible to assess a percentage reduction in the rental value to take account of the loss of amenity caused by the nuisance. That percentage differs for each property based on his view of the matters which were alleged by the Claimants to give rise to a nuisance. The range of reduction was 2.5% to 20%. </p>

It follows that it will be difficult by valuing properties to assess the diminution in value and this, I consider, is the effect of what Mr Donaldson says. I consider though that the general approach adopted by Mr Dickenson is a sound approach, although I consider that figures of 20% would be at the top end of the range in this case, if all of the Claimant’s allegations had been made out. As I have stated the odour matters for which Thames Water are liable are significantly less than those on which Mr Dickenson based his values and also liability in respect of mosquitoes has not been established. </p>

In the case of Thomas Bannister, who was a boy living with his parents, the Claimants had, before me, accepted that an award of damages in nuisance to his parents with a proprietary interest in the home was a matter to be taken into account for the purposes of section 8(3)(a).

We have considerable sympathy for the judge's conclusion as to Issue 9, i.e. that there should be no separate award under Article 8 to Thomas Bannister. However, in the state of the law which we have set out, we would disagree with the judge that it is possible to give an answer at this stage. If one takes the case of Thomas Bannister as the test case, it seems to us that those representing him can show that he has not, personally, had "reparation" under English law (see Article 41). But we do not think it can be regarded as irrelevant whether his parents recover damages in nuisance or what sums they recover because all the circumstances need to be taken into account in considering whether an award is necessary. Furthermore s.8(3) seems to us expressly to require to be taken into account any remedy granted "in relation to the act in question" and "the consequences of any decision … in respect of that act" without limiting the same to remedies awarded in favour of the person alleging infringement of his rights. The vital question will be whether it is </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">necessary</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to award </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">damages</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to another member of the household or whether the remedy of a declaration that Article 8 rights have been infringed suffices, alongside the award to the landowner, especially when no pecuniary loss has been suffered. If, for the reasons explained above in paragraphs 32-34, the effects of the odour and mosquitoes upon Thomas Bannister personally were in practice taken into account in determining the diminution in the amenity value of the property, and therefore in determining the amount of damages awarded to his parents in nuisance, we would regard that as a highly significant consideration when determining whether an award of damages was necessary to afford Thomas just satisfaction under Article 8. In any event the fact of an award to the parents, if made, and its amount, must be a circumstance relevant to whether an award is necessary.  </span></p>

But if estate agents are to assist in placing a value on the relevant intangibles, whether by calculating the reduction in letting value of the property for the period of the nuisance or in some other way, we would expect them in practice to take into account, for the purposes of their assessment, the actual experience of the persons in occupation of the property during the relevant period. It is difficult if not impossible to see any other way of proceeding. As Lord Hoffman observed, the measure of damages for loss of amenity will be affected by the size and commodiousness of the property. If the nature of the property is that of a family home and the property is occupied in practice by a family of the size for which it is suited, the experience of the members of that family is likely to be the best evidence available of how amenity has been affected in practical terms, upon which the financial assessment of diminution of amenity value must depend.</span>”  </p>

(b) The court has a discretion as to whether to make an award (it must be 'just and appropriate' to do so) by contrast to the position in relation to common law claims where there is a right to damages: section 8(1). (c) The award must be necessary to achieve 'just satisfaction'; language that is distinct from the approach at common law where the claimant is invariably entitled, so far as money can achieve this, to be restored to the position he would have been in if he had not suffered the injury of which complaint is made. The concept of damages being 'necessary to afford just satisfaction' provides a link with the approach to compensation of the Court of Human Rights under article 41.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:-0.01in">“<span style="font-style:italic">In the following paragraph Lord Woolf said that in considering whether to award compensation and, if so, how much, "there is a balance to be drawn between the interests of the victim and those of the public as a whole" and that the court has "a wide discretion in respect of the award of damages for breach of human rights". He described damages as "not an automatic entitlement but…a remedy of last resort." Later, at paragraph 66, in discussing the principles applied by the Strasbourg court, he said that the approach is an equitable one and that "the 'equitable basis' has been cited by the Court of Human Rights both as a reason for awarding damages and as a basis upon which to calculate them"... The Convention serves principally public law aims; the principal objective is to declare any infringement and to put a stop to it. Compensation is ancillary and discretionary. The interests of the individual are part of the equation, but so are those of the wider public. </span></p>

This broad discretionary approach to the award of compensation is no doubt the reason for what has been identified by the joint report produced in October 2000 of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission (Law Com No 266) (Scottish Law Com No 180), as the "lack of clear principles [in the Strasbourg case-law] as to when damages should be awarded and how they should be measured". (See paragraph 3.4). All one can say with any certainty is that damages have been awarded for non-pecuniary loss, i.e. for inconvenience and distress, in pollution cases. What is not at all clear is quite how Strasbourg would view claims brought by more than one person in a household and how it would react to the fact that one member of the household had recovered damages for nuisance in the courts of a Member State.</span>”  </p>

They refer to various projects: Project 59HF to cover and treat processes; Project 7H9G the East side PST/FST conversion  and Project 5X8F, the West side expansion works. Thames Water submit that it would be inappropriate to make an order which seeks to predict and regulate a state of affairs some time into the future, not least because the impact of the West side expansion works can only be properly assessed when the works are completed. They say that, in particular, the court cannot be satisfied now that MTSW in 2013 and onwards is likely to cause odour amounting to a nuisance, unless restrained by such an order which is a critical finding required before such an injunction can be granted. They refer to Mr Peirson’s acceptance that he could not give an opinion as to the position on odour emissions in 2013.

If so, they submit that this is a very strong reason why such an injunction should not be granted because Thames Water’s legal obligations under that order would then drive outputs accepted by Ofwat and such outputs drive the additional allowances made to Thames Water to comply with the requirements of such outputs.
