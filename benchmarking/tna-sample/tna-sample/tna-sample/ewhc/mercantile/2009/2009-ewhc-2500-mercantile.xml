A business current account (a/c no: 8007-9782) was set up with an overdraft of £50,000 with statements to be sent monthly to the Claimant’s address. This overdraft had a £25,000 discretionary extra facility in the hands of the Relationship Manager without his need for recourse to the Bank’s Credit Team. These potential liabilities were secured by a personal guarantee of £125,000 by the Claimant that was in turn supported by a legal charge over a development site he owned personally called the Great Rollright site. The Relationship Manager for the Bank was Martin Leech aided by his assistants Katharine Shelley and Melanie Wigley-Jones of the Cardiff Business Centre Branch. </span>

Without prejudice to that primary case, the Bank further contends that in any event the claim is excluded under the Condition 3 of the terms and conditions governing the account, and the Claimant ratified and adopted the disputed transfers by entering into the Loan Agreement.</span>

In many cases, letters or minutes written well before there was any breath of dispute between the parties may throw a very clear light on their knowledge and intentions at a particular time. In other cases, evidence of tyre marks, debris or where vehicles ended up may be crucial. To attach importance to matters such as these, which are independent of human recollection, is so obvious and standard a practice, and in some cases so inevitable, that no prolonged discussion is called for. It is nonetheless worth bearing in mind, when vexatious conflicts of oral testimony arise, that these fall to be judged against the background not only of what the parties agree to have happened but also of what plainly did happen, even though the parties do not agree.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">''Credibility' involves wider problems than mere 'demeanour' which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be. Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person telling something less than the truth on this issue, or though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over much discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part”'</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The lack of disclosure by the Bank of the phone records, the Transfer Sheets and e-mail account of Mr Leech cannot be ascribed to a lack of understanding of the duties of disclosure and how to procure retrieval of electronic “documents” by the Bank’s first class legal teams, both in and out house, and document storage managers as demonstrated by the correspondence referred to above. The explanation that the void occurred because Mr Leech had retired from the Bank’s employment is a lame excuse- an expert in information technology, either in house or a consultant, could easily have been instructed to retrieve ESI from various back up sources one would have thought but no such expert appear to have been instructed to do so. One expects a major high street Bank in this day and age of electronic records and communication with an in house litigation department to have an efficient and effective information management system in place to provide identification, preservation, collection, processing, review analysis and production of its ESI in the disclosure process in litigation and regulation.  However, even though the failure to disclose such critical information to assist the Court is surprising and to be deplored, there is no evidence that it has been done deliberately or constitutes spoliation in order to gain a tactical evidential advantage at the trial.  None of the Bank’s personnel such as in house counsel Elizabeth Freeman who undertook the bank’s disclosure have been challenged on that. Accordingly, I decline to make any adverse inferences against the Bank either. The Bank’s telephone databases and back up tapes as well as the Transfer Sheets should have been disclosed but I do not believe it has been established that these have been deliberately withheld to avoid its own case being undermined. In my judgment this was a decision made by the Bank’s legal team on the erroneous grounds of relevance and proportionality, not as part of any tactical move to gain an evidential advantage in the litigation.</span>

I found his answers in cross examination to be unfocussed, vague and evasive, even though the issues he had to deal with were simple. I found his answers that, as a former bank manager and a businessman running various large property developing projects on his own and a company’s account, he did not look at the bank statements sent to him, quite incredible.   On the other hand I found Mr Leech to be an impressive witness. Like all the Bank’s witnesses, the presentation of their witness statements was a model but that is primarily due to the drafting no doubt done with the considerable assistance of their instructed litigation solicitors. This practice of drafting of witness statements  and their substitution for evidence in chief makes evaluation of witnesses evidence on the issue of credibility more difficult. However, in oral evidence under strenuous cross examination he was clear in his recollections, well reasoned and emotionally detached – he is no longer working for the Bank. He had worked for 30 years in the Bank since he joined immediately after leaving school working his way up to a position of high standing. Whereas Mr Earles has an obvious motive to say the transactions were unauthorised on account of his undisputed indebtedness to the Bank, Mr Leech has not such motive – he is no longer employed by the Bank and he was under no pressure from the Bank or the Credit Team at any time. He was simply trying to help the Claimant manage his various customers’ accounts within the limits provided by the Credit Team. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Similarly, I found Katharine Shelley and Melanie Wigley-Jones (Suzanne Parton too) to be impressive witnesses all with lengthy experience in working in the Bank following precise routines and procedures. In particular, I find that I can place great reliance on their contemporaneous Credit Call Reports and their evidence that Mr Earles maintained close and watchful control over the operation of both his own and the Company’s accounts, telephoning most mornings to check the balances on the accounts, discuss funds that he expected to be paid into the accounts, and identify how he intended to utilise those funds once received. The undisclosed phone records of the Bank and of the Claimant’s mobile telephone would have conclusively proved this. However, in my judgment this is what would be expected of a businessman personally involved in juggling his finances upon risky property developments. As a former bank manager, I simply do not believe he would abandon that task to his Relationship Manager who had no stake in how the developments funded by Mr Earles personally turned out. His only interest was in maintaining the accounts within their various prescribed limits; he would have no interest in how the developments would profit – such was Mr Earles’ concern.</span>

However, as the Company Account statements and cheques drawn demonstrate, the Company needed to make substantial ongoing payments to its suppliers and contractors.

As one would expect, customers whose accounts appeared on the refer list therefore quickly found themselves in discussions with Mr Leech, Katharine Shelley and Melanie Wigley-Jones about when and how the customer proposed to bring the account back within the specified overdraft limit.  Mr Earles was the first point of contact on the Eden Account and finance director of the Company; given the extent to which Eden operated in excess of its agreed borrowing facilities, it is simply not credible for Mr Earles to claim that he had only ever spoken to any of the Business Centre team briefly.</span>

In that event, the Bank would of course call upon Mr Earles’ guarantee.  Two days later, Mr Earles telephoned Suzanne Parton to say that he wanted to bring something else to her attention, namely that £115,000 of his personal money had been transferred from one of his accounts to the Company Account without his authority. When asked why he had not raised the matter until now, Mr Earles then claimed that he had previously complained about these transfers (the Second, Third and Fourth Disputed Transfers) by telephone.

His explanation for not noticing this transfer when he reviewed his bank statements (which on his own case had happened well before this date) was that it had coincided with the transfer into the Account of £100,000 from the Loan Account and therefore the balance on the account was not affected.  It is simply not credible for Mr Earles to assert that he failed to notice any of the receipts set out on his account statement, let alone a receipt of such a substantial sum as £100,000, or that the balance was (on his own case, given that he does not dispute that the drawdown was authorised) £100,000 less than he would have expected; nor indeed is it credible that he did not notice the payment on the statement for the Company Account.</span>

In my Judgment such a term is entirely reasonable where a Bank is seeking to operate a commercial customer’s various business accounts within their prescribed limits. It would be unfair on a Bank to impose upon it liability for the potential losses of a highly speculative property developer juggling with funds in order to make himself substantial profits whilst being exposed to potential losses. The Bank was undertaking no similar risks for profit. It was merely providing facilities and assumed no further duties of care that would give rise to consequential losses: they did not fall within the scope of the risk. However, if such duties were established and breaches established, then, in my judgment, it was entirely reasonable for the Bank to limit the commercial consequences for any defaults in the provision of their services to commercial customers, such as the Claimant (a former Bank Manager and property developer) with an equal bargaining power in the competitive financial services market.  The Bank has discharged its duty to establish that their conditions were fair under the Unfair Contract Terms Act.</span>

The Bank’s case, on my judgment, would have been unanswerable but of course the Claimant’s attitude may have been to ignore that.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">However, in making what is a “costs transference” order, in my judgment the sum to be ordered to be transferred must objectively be a reasonable one for the unsuccessful party to bear. The overriding objective requires the court to observe “proportionality” and to “ensure that the parties are on an equal footing”. Here we have an impecunious bank customer facing the might of one of the country’s largest banks and a blue chip legal team to match when he has struggled to afford to have a highly competent but small firm from Stratford upon Avon to represent him just for the trial.  Ordinary citizens must have proper access to civil justice without the fear of exclusion by the prospect that they will face paying for the exorbitance of their adversary should they be unsuccessful in their litigation. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In my judgment, it is only fair and just that the bill of costs adopts rates similar to those and not top class City of London rates – this is not the type of case that merits those. In my judgment this halves the rates – a London partner charging £420-£425 is half that here at the maximum Birmingham rates of £217.  It is simply not acceptable to sanction rates of £235 to £250 per hour for an Assistant Solicitor admitted to the Roll in March 2008 when the Birmingham Cost Guideline rates for Inner Ring senior partners at the top firms is “only” £217. In my judgment, this case was tried in the Birmingham Mercantile Court by choice of the Claimant and the Defendant agreed with this (the Defendant normally having the right to request venue at its registered address- here London: </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">CPR 26.2 and (2) &amp; 30.3(2))</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Again comparison of Counsel’s fees shows a discrepancy between Counsel from St Phillips of Birmingham for the Claimant (2001 call) of £6,195 for three day trial and £18,400 for Counsel (2002 call) for the Defendant from Fountain Court of London. I accept that Counsel for the Defendant was briefed earlier and had more preparation time. I would like to stress that both performed to a very high and helpful standard but I do believe that the sum of £18,400 is far too high for this case and half that is reasonable in all the circumstances.</span>

However, these hours seem excessive for what is quite a simple case. 41 hours on dealing with Statements of Case and a mind boggling 223.1 hours in dealing with the Defendant’s evidence of 5 witnesses and 500 pages of documents is far too much. However, I take into account that this is leavened by the fact that these excesses have been borne by the Defendant’s solicitors thereby cutting it down to what was deemed reasonable by the Bank itself when it set its budget cap. I therefore accept the hours being charged for and sought against the unsuccessful Claimant. </span>

This would have controlled the costs before they were actually spent. The Defendant was facing a litigant in person for much of this action and that places a very onerous burden on the opposition to fairly and diligently prepare the case for trial. Not many litigants in person appreciate that when they are spending nothing on legal services themselves but only vicariously so riding everything on the result vis a vis costs as well as the outcome of the action. </span>
