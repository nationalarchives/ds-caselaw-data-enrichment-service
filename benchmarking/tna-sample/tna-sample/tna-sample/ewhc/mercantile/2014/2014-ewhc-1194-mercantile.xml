	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim and counterclaim in this case arise out of commercial negotiations which did not result in aÂ concluded agreement.  They are claims by the claimants and defendant respectively to recover professional fees and other expenses incurred in or in connection with those abortive negotiations.  The negotiations formed part of an attempt by the owners of CoventryÂ City Football Club (âthe Clubâ) to find aÂ solution to serious financial difficulties which in 2012 had brought the Club to the brink of insolvency. </p>

The Club's home ground atÂ the time was the RicohÂ Arena in Coventry.  The arena was operated by Arena Coventry Limited (âACLâ).  ACL was owned indirectly in equal shares by the claimants in this case who are the four Trustees of the AlanÂ Edward Higgs Charity (whom IÂ shall refer to as "the Trustees" or "the Charity") and CoventryÂ City Council. </p>

At the same time the Club stopped making payments of licence fees to the ACL subsidiary.  One element of the negotiations was aÂ proposal by SISU to acquire the Charity's 50 perÂ cent interest inÂ the share capital of ACL.  Discussions reached the stage where SISU and the Charity were able to agree indicative terms for such aÂ share purchase, which were recorded in aÂ document dated 18Â JuneÂ 2012, described as an indicative term sheet. </p>

The mechanism for this proposed by SISU was the allocation to the Charity of preferred equity in ACL for aÂ value of Â£4Â million, which would be paid down through annual payments over the ten-year period.

First, itÂ is alleged that the Charity Trustees acted in aÂ way which rendered compliance with the conditions precedent impossible or materially impeded their performance.  Second, itÂ is alleged that, as from 17Â AugustÂ 2012, the Trustees resolved or elected to proceed with an alternative scheme under whichÂ (a) the debt owed by ACL to YorkshireÂ Bank would be assumed by CoventryÂ City Council and not by SISU, but at the same timeÂ (b) the Trustees would keep negotiations with SISU open.  ItÂ is said that proceeding in this way without informing SISU of their "true decision(s), plan(s), objective(s) and/or motive(s)" was aÂ breach of the implied obligation to conduct negotiations with SISU in good faith. </p>

Since the influential judgment of LordÂ Hoffmann in <span style="text-decoration:underline">AttorneyÂ GeneralÂ for Belize v BelizeÂ Telecom</span> [2009] 1 WLR 1988, the process of implication of terms is generally seen as an exercise inÂ the construction of the contract as aÂ whole.  The criteria traditionally used are still relevant, namely that the proposed term must be: (1) reasonable and equitable; (2) necessary to give business efficacy to the contract; (3) so obvious that it goes without saying; (4) capable of clear expression; and (5) must not contradict any express term of the contract.</p>

The Board has already discussed the significance of 'necessary to give business efficacy' and âgoes without sayingâ.  As for the other formulations, the fact that the proposed implied term would be inequitable or unreasonable or contradict what the parties have expressly said or is incapable of clear expression are all good reasons for saying that aÂ reasonable man would not have understood that to be what the instrument meant." </p>

As many prospective house buyers or sellers know to their cost, there is no general duty currently recognised in English law to conduct contractual negotiations in good faith.  There is aÂ duty not to misrepresent facts, but there is no duty to disclose facts which itÂ would be material for the other party to negotiations to know, nor is there any constraint in law which prohibits someone from carrying on negotiations with more than one counterparty at the same time without informing them about the existence of the other or others. </p>

But in circumstances where aÂ party has undertaken to conduct negotiations in good faith for aÂ specified period against the background that inÂ the absence of such an agreement there is no legal duty of good faith in negotiation, the clear and unambiguous meaning of the agreement isÂ that the undertaking is limited to the period specified inÂ the contract and does not extend beyond it. </p>

If accepted, itÂ would mean that in return for the promise which SISU gave to reimburse certain costs, SISU would get not just the six week period of good faith negotiation which it bargained for, but aÂ longer period which went beyond, indeed potentially far beyond, what it had bargained for. </p>

That would again be inconsistent with the parties' bargain.  ItÂ is clear from the express terms of the contract that the only party which was given aÂ right to recover wasted costs in certain circumstances was the Charity.  In return for that right, the Charity gave undertakings limited in time to afford exclusivity to SISU.  The contract contains no provision which gives SISU aÂ right to recover costs from the Charity in any circumstances and SISU gave no undertaking with regard to the conduct of negotiations as aÂ quid pro quo for any such right. </p>

ItÂ would, in my view, require clear words before the contract could be construed as requiring such an unreasonable result.
