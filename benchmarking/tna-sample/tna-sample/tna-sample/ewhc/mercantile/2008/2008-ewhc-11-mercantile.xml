	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These proceedings concern a claim in respect of the loss of a consignment of Bluetooth mobile telephone adaptors in January 2003.    Matrix Europe Limited (“Matrix”) were selling the goods to Adove Trading Company, who were then called Oversea Chinese Limited and to whom I refer as “OCL”.  They were sending the consignment to Hong Kong, and, as they claim and I do not understand to be disputed, they engaged Birkart Globistics Limited (“Birkart”), a company of freight forwarders, to arrange their carriage by air.    Birkart instructed Cheadle Courier Company Stockport Limited (“Cheadle”) to have the goods collected from Matrix’s premises in Altrincham, and Cheadle in turn subcontracted that work to a driver called Trevor Lancashire.   According to Birkart, they instructed Cheadle to deliver the goods to the premises of Robins Transport Limited (“Robins”) at Manchester Airport.   In fact, Mr Lancashire delivered them on 10 January 2003 to the warehouse premises of Uniserve Northern Limited (“UNL”) at Claverton Road, Wythenshawe, which were also near the airport, and UNL received them there.  The  Claverton Road premises were UNL’s principle “hub” in the North of England.      On 11 January 2003 there was a burglary there, and the goods were stolen and have not been recovered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Matrix and OCL have brought proceedings in respect of the loss against both Birkart and UNL, although the proceedings against Birkart are presently stayed. (Proceedings were also brought against Uniserve Holdings Limited but they have been struck out.)  UNL have brought part 20 proceedings against Birkart in which they claim damages for breach of warranty of authority and an indemnity from Birkart in respect of any liability to Matrix (and the costs and expenses of the proceedings).   The basis of both these claims, as I understand it, is UNL’s contention that they dealt with Birkart upon what have been referred to as “BIFA terms”, the standard terms from time to time of the British International Freight Association, to which both they and Birkart belonged.  The  relevant  BIFA terms, the  2000 edition, provide:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am grateful to them for that prompt response.    My understanding is that Birkart accept that my findings should be binding upon them as against Matrix as well as between them and UNL.    UNL, on the other hand, were unwilling to accept that my findings were binding upon them as against Matrix.     I shall revisit this question in light of my judgment.   My present impression is that the position adopted by UNL about this is not sustainable, and it might be that in light of my judgment UNL will not seek to argue otherwise.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am concerned that the determination of the preliminary questions will do little to resolve this litigation.    It is to be observed that the first question is directed to whether the parties <span style="font-style:italic">intended</span> delivery of the goods to the premises of UNL (and not to whether the delivery was made and received by persons acting with actual or ostensible authority of the parties).   The second question is whether the delivery, if unintended by either party, <span style="font-style:italic">could </span>have been subject to the BIFA terms, not whether it was subject to the BIFA terms.     However, the parties prepared for the hearing on the basis that the trial would be of these specific issues, and it did not seem to me possible to re-formulate them at the hearing or do other than simply determine these questions, not least because Matrix agreed to be bound by my determination of those questions and no others.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Birkart also put in evidence under the Civil Evidence Act 1968 a statement of Mr Walter Marsh, who until his recent retirement was employed by Birkart as a Senior Airfreight Clerk.  Birkart served a Civil Evidence Act notice in respect of Mr Marsh’s statement on 1 November 2007.    Although, I think, no formal counter-notice was served, UNL’s representatives made it clear that they wished to cross-examine Mr Marsh and that they do not accept that his statement is accurate.    However, difficulties in Mr Marsh’s personal life prevented him from attending court, and it also proved difficult to make arrangements to cross-examine him over a video-link.  In these circumstances, I admitted Mr Marsh’s witness statement as evidence, although Mr Jeffrey Bacon, who represented UNL, made it clear that it was disputed.   In the event, my decision on the preliminary issues does not depend upon his evidence.</p>

Their landlord was Mr Liddell, UNL’s managing director, and they had moved there in mid-December 2002.  Birkart and UNL both belonged to a consortium known as Group 99, an organisation directed, as I understand it, to achieving efficient cooperation in the handling and conveying of cargoes consigned by way of sea freight.  </p>

Matrix were one of Birkart’s customers and on two occasions before the delivery of the goods with which these proceedings are concerned UNL had stored computer goods shipped by Matrix on behalf of Birkart.  It was the evidence of Ms. Kennedy, and I accept, that Birkart used UNL’s services to divide the consignment because on those occasions more than one pallet of goods was consigned and in view of the value of the goods Matrix required that consignments of that size be broken down before carriage.  On other occasions Birkart used Robins’ storage services when sending Matrix goods by air.</p>

(According to Mr Checkley’s evidence, the instructions were given by Mr Khalid Khan in a telephone conversation with him.   I observe that Matrix plead that they were given in a telephone conversation between Mr Frank Steele of Matrix and a person named “Dave” at Birkart.    This difference does not affect the questions that I have to decide, it would be unsatisfactory to explore it in the absence of Matrix, and I do not do so.)    </p>

Mr Marsh believes that the invoice that was sent was a document addressed to OCL which described the goods and stated their price, and which has written on it a manuscript note, “FAO Wally”, meaning “for the attention of Walter Marsh”.   There was nothing else on the invoice that indicated how the goods were to be handled or where they were to be kept before carriage to Hong Kong.    UNL dispute that this invoice was so sent by Matrix, and I observe that this part of Mr Marsh’s witness statement is tentative in tone.    Again, I decline to determine in the absence of Matrix an issue that has arisen in the context of the trial of these preliminary issues but that does not affect my determination of them.     </p>

He explained that the note produced by the computer system referred to delivery to Birkart’s premises because the system produced notes likes this by way of a default option if no other address which the system would accept was entered.    He said that when he was entering the information to produce that note, he tried to enter Robins’ premises as the delivery address.   The system would not accept this because the system did not hold, or did not recognise, an account number for Robins and therefore rejected them as a delivery address.     </p>

(Birkart’s pleaded case that Cheadle were engaged through the agency of Network Couriers is inconsistent with their evidence before me.)  Mr Checkley’s evidence, which I accept, was that he “expects” that that was because when he prepared the collection note he had it in mind to use Network Couriers, but when he could not contact Mr Raj Malhotra of Network Couriers, he telephoned Cheadle instead.    He also sent them a copy of the collection note by fax.   </p>

Mr Checkley believes that he first had contact with Cheadle by telephone and the collection note was then faxed at the request of Cheadle.   He explained in the telephone call that the delivery address on the collection note would need to be changed to Robins.   Mr Royan’s recollection was that the first contact was by fax and later the same day he received a telephone call asking him to amend the note to show that the cargo should be delivered to Robins.   Undoubtedly, a copy of the collection note was sent by fax from Birkart to Cheadle, and I prefer the evidence of Mr Checkley that there was telephone contact before the fax was sent: I do not think that he would have faxed the collection note to Cheadle without first telephoning them to arrange for them to do the job.    </p>

He produced a copy of the collection note on which he had struck through the address of Birkart and had written, “into Robins @ Senator, M90”: Robins, as Mr Royan explained, shared office space with another freight forwarding company called Senator and Robins’ postcode is M90.   There is a further annotation of “£18” that Mr Royan made on his faxed copy of the collection note, which reflects the charge that Cheadle were to make for the delivery.   That would have been Cheadle’s charge whether delivery was to be made to Robin’s premises or to UNL’s premises.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, it seems to me, a curiosity in the evidence presented by Birkart about this part of the case.     Mr Checkley identified a copy of the collection note sent by fax to Cheadle together with the fax confirmation note produced by the fax machine showing the transmission of one page at 17.24 hours on 9 January 2003.    That copy of the collection note is stated to be “Warehouse Copy”.     However, Mr Royan wrote on a “Haulier Copy” of the note.   Either Mr Checkley did not identify the precise version of the collection note sent by fax, or Mr Royan is wrong in thinking that he wrote on the version of the collection note that was sent by fax but made his notes on a different but similar collection note provided to Cheadle.   The former explanation seems more likely, but this point was not explored in evidence with either Mr Checkley or Mr Royan.    Whatever the explanation, I am satisfied that on 9 January 2003 or possibly on 10 January 2003 Mr Royan struck out Birkart’s address on a copy of the delivery note and wrote on it “into Robins @ Senator M90”.  Indeed, it was not suggested to Mr Royan that he had not written this or that he had written it at some materially later date.   I cannot conceive of any reason for him to do this unless it reflected instructions given to him by Birkart.</p>

Against the entry for this job Mr Royan had written, “Birks Matrix 1 pall[et] into M90 Robins”.     Although Mr Royan was asked why there were more details about this entry in the job book than some other entries, it was not suggested to him that this was other than a contemporaneous entry.    This too, it seems to me, is powerful evidence that Cheadle were instructed that delivery was to be made to Robins’ premises.</p>

On Friday 10 January 2003, he went to their offices and Mr Royan assigned to him the job of collecting and delivering Matrix’s goods.    In his witness statement Mr Royan said that, while he cannot remember exactly what he said to Mr Lancashire, he “would have told him to pick the goods up from Matrix and to deliver to Robins”.     However, according to a report (which is undated but was written in the last week of January 2003) by Lacey &amp; Co, who were apparently investigating the loss for insurers of the goods, on 24 January 2003 Mr Royan said that he could not be sure whether or not he had told Mr Lancashire where to deliver the goods, and that he had assumed that Mr Lancashire would be given instruction by Matrix.  When asked about this in cross-examination, he acknowledged that what he is recorded as saying in January 2003 is more likely to be reliable than his witness statement.</p>

He presented a delivery note referring to the delivery of one pallet from Matrix to Birkart to a Mr Anthony Churcher, an employee of UNL.  Mr Churcher or another of UNL’s warehouse staff, as I conclude from Mr Liddell’s evidence, asked Mr Lancashire who was sending the goods and was told that they were from Birkart.

When the goods were delivered to them, UNL thought that they were for carriage by sea and covered by the arrangements between Group 99 members and dealt with them on that basis.  They did not deal with them as airfreight.  Mr Liddell’s unchallenged evidence was that “the goods were accepted on the misapprehension that they were Group 99 goods and the paperwork was stapled together by Anthony Churcher and placed in the seafreight tray”.</p>

It might be that Mr Lancashire was told by Matrix to deliver the goods to UNL or at least was told something by Matrix that led him to think that they should be delivered there (for example, that they were Birkart goods).

In it Mr Lancashire said that he thought that Mr Royan mentioned “Wythenshawe” to him when he was instructed to do the job, but did not mention Robins.  (I was told, although it is not strictly in evidence, that both Robin’s premises and UNL’s and Birkart’s premises are in the area that would be described as “Wythenshawe”.)     He went to Matrix’s premises and signed for receipt of the goods and was not told where to deliver them.    He was given the invoice marked “FAO Wally” but there is no suggestion that that indicated to him that he should deliver the goods to Birkart or UNL.   Rather he assumed, because Wythenshawe had been referred to and because previously he had delivered Matrix’s goods to the UNL premises in Wythenshawe, that is where he was to take this consignment.  He obtained a signature for the delivery of the goods and handed over the invoice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are broadly two arguments that UNL advance in support of their contention that the delivery of the consignment on 10 January 2003 was governed by the BIFA terms: that they applied because of what might be called an “umbrella” agreement between Birkart and UNL that the terms would apply to goods held by UNL, and that they applied because the terms of an agreement made specifically about this delivery.   As I have observed, however, the question that I have to decide is not whether in fact the terms were contractually binding between the parties and applicable to this consignment, but whether they <span style="font-style:italic">could </span>have been.   Both parties made it clear that they did not consider that the second question was directed to whether in fact there was any agreement between UNL and Birkart (either by way of an umbrella agreement or an agreement specifically in respect of these goods).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Birkart’s contention is that if, as I have concluded on the first issue, they did not intend to deliver the goods to Birkart, the BIFA terms cannot have applied to this delivery.   They cannot have applied because of an agreement relating specifically to this agreement because there was not any contract relating to this delivery if it was unintended, and they cannot have applied because of an umbrella agreement because again that will have applied only where UNL took goods under an agreement with Birkart.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not persuaded that it <span style="font-style:italic">necessarily </span>follows that there was no contract between Birkart and UNL relating to this delivery from the fact it was unintended on the part of Birkart.    It might seem improbable that if Bikart did not intend delivery to UNL they will have authorised it, but an agreement might have been made by an agent with their ostensible authority.   Mr Nevil Phillips, who represented Birkart, submitted that they could only be party to an agreement made with their ostensible authority if in some way they held the agent out as having authority.   That is undoubtedly so, and on the face of it, there was much force in Mr Phillips’ submission that Birkart could not have held out Cheadle or drivers used by Cheadle as having any relevant authority.    However, this is another area where I must proceed cautiously given the nature of the hearing before me.    I do not find it fanciful to suppose that, given the nature of the business, it is to be implied that, when he collected the goods, Mr Lancashire should, or at least might, accept instructions about how to deal with them.   I can well see that if Mr Lancashire did have any such discretion, it might well be limited to relatively minor matters, but I am not prepared to rule out the possibility that they might include which warehouse in Wythenshawe should receive them.     I have said enough to illustrate why I am unhappy about reaching final conclusions about how the contractual arrangements between the parties might work at a trial in which I am to assume the contractual arrangements and when the questions whether and what the contractual arrangements were are reserved for a separate hearing.      </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However that might be, in order to show that the BIFA terms cannot have applied, Birkart have to establish that the umbrella arrangements that UNL allege they had with Birkart cannot have applied to an unintended delivery.   I am not persuaded of this, and I would not have been so persuaded even if I were satisfied that if Birkart did not intend a delivery, they could not have authorised it.   </p>

The terms, they point out, are directed towards the provision of services by a freight forwarder to a customer.<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>Thus, for example, the definition of “The Owner” is (emphasis added) “the Owner of the goods (including any packaging, containers or equipment) to which any <span style="font-style:italic">business</span> concluded under these Conditions relates and any other person who is or may become interested in them”, and “Customer” is defined as “any person at whose request or on whose behalf the Company undertakes any <span style="font-style:italic">business</span> or provides advice, information or <span style="font-style:italic">services</span>.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this basis, Mr Phillips argued that the terms were not designed for incorporation into a contract between freight forwarders and a company providing storage services for them or the like, that is to say into an arrangement such as had – I am to assume – been reached between UNL and Birkart.    I am not persuaded by this argument.   In this submission Birkart seek to construe the BIFA terms without taking account of the contract between Birkart and UNL into which UNL contend that they were incorporated, and then to reject the terms on the basis that they are not apt for incorporation into such a contract. This is not a proper approach to contractual interpretation, which is to construe the contract as a whole.    No doubt the BIFA terms are directed primarily to regulating contracts between freight forwarder and customer, but if it was agreed that they should apply to contractual arrangements between UNL and Birkart, then the court will make necessary adjustments in their interpretation and apply them mutatis mutandis to the contract of which they are part.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, this argument of Birkart undermines the basis upon which, as Birkart themselves submit, I should approach the second preliminary issue because, as Mr Phillips told me at the start of the hearing, I am to assume that there was an agreement between the parties that UNL would handle Birkart’s goods on BIFA terms, and decide on the basis of that assumption whether the terms could apply in a case where there was a delivery of goods that was not “intended”.   This part of Birkart’s argument assumes too much, and so does not, to my mind, assist to answer the question whether the terms could apply if a delivery was unintended.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Birkart also argue however that the BIFA terms would not apply to an unintended delivery.  They refer to clause 2(A) of the BIFA terms, which provides that, “… all and any activities of [UNL] in the course of business whether gratuitous or not are undertaken subject to these Conditions”.   They say that, in the context of the BIFA terms, this wording confines the application of the terms to business that has been undertaken consensually.    They rely upon other provisions in the terms to reinforce this argument.    It is not necessary to set them all out: the terms refer to the Company providing “services” and the “Customer” giving “instructions”, and these references, Birkart argue, are directed to a consensual relationship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Birkart also draw my attention to UNL’s pleadings, and advance another argument along similar lines.   I do not find that the pleadings crystallise the issues between the parties as clearly as might be wished, but I hope that I can state Birkart’s point fairly as follows.    UNL plead that there was an express agreement that the BIFA terms would “govern services provided by [UNL] to Birkart and other Group 99 members” (paragraph 19 of their reamended part 20 particulars of claim) and by way of further information of their case they state that the agreement was that “all dealings by which [UNL] provided services to Birkart …would be governed by BIFA” (paragraph 1e of the further information).     Birkart’s contention is that, if delivery was unintended on the part of Birkart, it cannot properly be said that there were “dealings” between the parties whereby UNL “provided services”, and so, it is said, if the goods were delivered unintentionally as far as Birkart were concerned, the goods were not governed by the express agreement pleaded by UNL.     Birkart support this argument by referring to other passages of UNL’s pleading.  For example: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I cannot accept this argument.  While accepting that the pleadings might be clearer, I do not consider that, on any reasonable reading of them, UNL’s case is confined as Birkart contend.  UNL plead that the express agreement between the partiers was that the BIFA terms should apply even if UNL received an unintentional delivery of goods.  For example, in their reply (at paragraph 4(6)(c)) they plead, that “BIFA terms apply in any event to the situation where [UNL] takes in goods in good faith that are from or under the control of another BIFA member”, and (at paragraph 35(10)) they plead that “the BIFA terms can and do apply whether or not the delivery was unintended or mistaken or unintentional”.   In the further information UNL plead this: “[UNL’s] case is that even if delivery to [UNL] or storage of the goods was “mistaken” and/or “unintended” and/or “in error” (and whatever those phrases mean and depending on the findings of fact in each respect) then the actual services provided by [UNL] to (which were handling and storage of the Goods) were either governed by the agreement between the parties or give rise to an implied agreement or contract”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If Birkart and UNL made an umbrella agreement the terms of which were that the BIFA terms should apply even if there was an unintended delivery by UNL to Birkart, the court will recognise and give effect to that agreement.    If some manipulation of the wording of the BIFA terms is needed to give effect to the parties’ bargain, that would be done.    I did not understand Mr Phillips to argue otherwise.    In the end, his argument was that UNL’s pleading did not include a contention that there was such an agreement, and so the second preliminary issue boiled down to a pleading point. I should have been reluctant to determine the issue on the basis of a rather arid pleading point, but in any event I conclude that UNL’s pleading does aver an express umbrella agreement covering unintended deliveries.</p>
