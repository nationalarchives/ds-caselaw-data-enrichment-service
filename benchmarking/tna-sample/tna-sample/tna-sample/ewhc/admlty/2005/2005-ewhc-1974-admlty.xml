	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an action for damages by the Claimant, the owner of the motor vessel CHARLOTTE C, against the Defendant, the owner and operator of Bird Port which is in Newport. The claim is brought under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 and in negligence. It is said that whilst berthed at Bird Port between 8 and 12 May 2003 the vessel sat upon a steel coil causing indentations and fractures in her bottom shell plating and buckling of her internals. The Claimant seeks to recover as damages for breach of the Defendant’s duty of care the costs of repairing the damage and loss of hire initially in the sum of £168,485. The Defendant denies liability and essentially puts the Claimant to proof of its claim. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">In essence the issue between the parties can be shortly stated. What caused the vessel to suffer damage ? Was the damage caused at Bird Port or at another port ? Was the cause of the damage a steel coil on the dock bottom at Bird Port ? In order to resolve this apparently simple dispute oral evidence was adduced from eleven factual witnesses and from two expert surveyors. At the end of 6 days of evidence the Claimant and Defendant submitted very detailed written submissions. The parties may once have sought a solution to their dispute at a cost which was proportionate to the amount at issue. But those attempts had clearly come to an end sometime before the trial.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether or not the Claimant has proved on the balance of probabilities that the damage was caused by a steel coil on the bottom of the berth at Bird Port will necessarily depend upon a consideration of the totality of the evidence though some categories of evidence may be more cogent than others. The essence of the Claimant’s case is that the evidence as to the nature of the damage, as to the behaviour of the vessel at Bird Port and as to the time when leakages were detected on board is cogent and convincing proof that on the balance of probabilities the damage was caused by a steel coil on the bottom of the berth at Bird Port. The Claimant has no direct evidence that a particular coil had fallen into the berth or that a coil had been removed from the berth after CHARLOTTE C had left the berth. However, it is said that it can safely be inferred from the above evidence that the damage must have been caused by a steel coil which had fallen onto the bottom of the berth before CHARLOTTE C arrived at Bird Port and was removed after CHARLOTTE C had left Bird Port.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">If the Court concludes, on the balance of probabilities, that the damage was caused by a steel coil on the bottom of the berth at Bird Port it is then necessary to decide whether the servants or agents of the Defendant were negligent to have permitted a steel coil to lie on the bottom of the berth. Finally, there are several issues to be resolved concerning the quantum of the Claimant’s claim.</p>

She is 94.95 metres in length overall, 13.17 metres in breadth and has a summer draft of 6.191 metres. She has a single hold forward of the accommodation and machinery space and is double skinned. Her double bottom is divided transversally into three tanks. The wing tanks are for ballast water as are the forward centre tanks. The three aft centre tanks are for fuel oil. Double bottom ballast tanks nos. 2 and 4 starboard run from frame 24 to frame 86. The transverse bulkhead between the tanks is at frame 52. Double bottom fuel oil tank no.3 centre is adjacent to those tanks running from frame 46 to frame 62. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">The berth at Bird Port is within an enclosed dock which was originally constructed as a dry dock. The dock is 225m. in length and 19.8m. wide. It has a flat reinforced concrete bottom. Photographs of the dock bottom indicated that the dock bottom sloped up from the gates inwards. However, the gradient was unknown. The dock gates, instead of being used to keep water out, are used to keep water in. However, they leak with the result that water can enter the dock during the flood tide and can escape during the ebb tide. Just inside the gates is a sill which is about 0.5m. in height above the dock bottom. On one of the gates is a depth gauge which records the depth of water above the sill. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">Vessels are berthed bow in, starboard side to. The berth is known as a NAABSA berth, that is, “not always afloat but safely aground”. Thus it is expected that vessels will or may take the ground at low water. However, the bottom of the berth is typically covered with a layer of silt or mud which comes in with the tide. The mud was described as gelatinous and not of a solid composition like compacted river beds. From time to time, and when operational considerations permitted, dredging operations were carried out in the dock. </p>

Indeed, between 7 February and 20 May 2003 14 vessels discharged coils and 22 vessels loaded coils at Bird Port. The steel coils imported in March and April 2003 varied in width from 0.72m. to over 2m., although over 99% exceeded 0.9m. in width. The width of the coil represented the height of the coil in the event that the coil lay on its side. There was no evidence of the width of coils exported.      </p>

It was therefore concluded that the mud or silt was 1.7m. deep. However, this was the depth in June 2005 rather than between 8 and 12 May 2003 when CHARLOTTE C was at Bird Port.</p>

On 12,13 and 14 May 2003 Mr.Watson visited Bird Port following the departure of CHARLOTTE C from Bird Port on 12 May 2003. In his report dated 29 May 2003 Mr.Watson described the mud or silt on 13 May  as being approximately 1 metre in depth at its shallowest point. Mr.Watson recalled in his oral evidence, which was given by video link from the United States, that the mud was a little less than half a metre or one to one and a half feet below the level of the first ledge. Given the height of that ledge (1.7m.) that would indicate that the depth of the mud or silt was about 1.2 – 1.4m. However, in his report he also noted that on 12 May mud was being grabbed and deposited in the area where CHARLOTTE C had been berthed. Thus the position observed on 13 May was not identical to that which prevailed prior to 12 May. A month later, on 13 June 2003, Mr.Williams of LGSA Marine reported that the depth of mud in way of the operational part of the dock “is expected to be within half to approximately 1 metre depth.” Mr.Gibson of Brookes Bell who attended on that day reported that the depth of silt where CHARLOTTE C had been berthed appeared to be approximately 1m. deep. </p>

On the evidence which was adduced before me I find that the depth was probably between 1 and 1.5m. It was said by Mr.Allen, the General Manager of Bird Port, that for a period of 10-11 days prior to the arrival of CHARLOTTE C there had been no dredging. This suggests that the depth was probably closer to the top end of the likely range than the bottom end. </p>

Thus, although low water was over 7m. below high water on 8 May 2003, there was still a depth of 4.3m. in the dock at low water on 8 May according to the master. For this reason the above predicted depths of water at high water cannot be an accurate assessment of the depth of water in the dock at the stated high tides (until at any rate the gates were opened so that the water level inside the dock would be at the same level as the water outside.) Further there was evidence (from ABP at Newport) that tide gauge readings indicated that the actual height of tide was not necessarily the same as the predicted height. On 12 May 2003 it was 0.1m, higher than predicted.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">(i) On the bottom shell plating in way of frame 52 and the longitudinal bulkhead between no.3 centre double bottom tank and nos.2 and 4 starboard double bottom tanks there was a circular indentation about 80mm in depth causing damage over a diameter of about 1.5-1.6m. This was about 2.760 metres to starboard of the centreline.  At the centre of the circular indent there was what has been described as a nipple or dimple. This feature, coupled with the circular shape of the indent, has caused the indented section to be described as being like a “Mexican hat” in shape.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">(ii) There were also circular marks around the nipple or dimple. They were described by Mr.Davies, a senior superintendent of the Claimant who inspected the damage at La Linea, as “concentric rings similar to the growth rings seen when you fell a tree”. He described them as being around the nipple and pushed up into the paint. There were no markings which suggested that the vessel had been underway during contact.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">(iii) The indentation was associated with buckling of the internals in way, namely, the longitudinal bulkhead and transverse floors. Mr.Davies observed that the fillet welds in way of the damaged ballast tanks and fuel tank had failed. When crawling through one of the ballast tanks he was able to put his little finger between the ballast tank and the fuel tank and two fingers between one ballast tank and the other. He observed cracks in the internals but did not notice whether they had gone right through the steel.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in">(iv) The bottom shell plating was also cracked. One crack was at the aft end of the indentation in way of a “pinnacle”. It was to port of the weld seam in the bottom shell plating and was 130mm. in length, of which about 80mm was open to a width of 9mm.  Towards the end of the trial there was some doubt, based upon a reading of the transcript of the divers’ survey, as to whether there were two additional cracks, or only one additional crack, in about the centre of the indentation. However, the divers’ survey report refers to “at least two more splits and gouges in the shell plating within the set up area.” All cracks were in the fore-aft direction.</p>

Mr.David Spence, a marine engineer with a degree in nautical studies, was called by the Claimant and Dr.Medhurst, a marine engineer with a doctorate in naval architecture, was called by the Defendant. They were agreed on some matters. The damage was consistent with the vessel settling on to an obstruction on a single occasion and then rising vertically off it. It was inconsistent with the vessel settling onto an obstruction more than once. It was also agreed that the object which damaged the vessel must have been circular, regularly shaped, flat or slightly convex and about 1.2m. in diameter. </p>

Mr.Spence was of the opinion that the cracks were caused when the vessel settled on the obstruction. Dr.Medhurst did not accept that that was necessarily so. He said there was another possibility, namely, that when the vessel settled on an obstruction, prior to arrival at Bird Port, the shell plating and internal structure was plastically deformed causing incipient cracks which opened up to cause leakage when the vessel took the ground at Bird Port.      </p>

This arose because neither Mr.Davies (the Claimant’s superintendent) nor Mr.Sacaluga (the hull underwriter’s surveyor) referred to this crack. However, there is no dispute that there was such a crack. What is suggested is that it was not mentioned because it was not leaking. It is odd that neither Mr.Davies nor Mr.Sacaluga referred to it but I do not follow why a belief that it was not leaking was a reason for not mentioning it. I therefore do not consider that it is reasonable to infer that water was not able to leak through that crack. Having regard to the severity of the tear it is very likely that water was able to leak through it.     </p>

Low water was predicted for 1805. The vessel’s deck log recorded as follows : “Water level in dock dropped to 3.8m V/L on bottom.” The master gave evidence that the basis of this entry was that the tide gauge in the dock showed about 3.8m. and that the vessel’s draft was about the same.

Loading re-commenced at 0615 and continued until about 1800. Low water was at 0630, high water was at 1247 and the second low water was at 1857. The master said in his witness statement (which had been signed on 22 March 2005 but had been taken about 18 months to two years earlier) that at high water his vessel did not rise with the tide, despite the discharge of all ballast.</p>

Soundings were taken to ensure that all ballast was out. It was at this time that fuel oil was found in the nos.2 and 4 starboard double bottom tanks.

That evidence is consistent with his statement made at Falmouth in which he referred to the “suction” being broken. However, he fairly accepted that it was possible that she did not float because there was insufficient water and that she refloated when there was sufficient water which, by coincidence, was when he gave the engines a kick astern. </p>

But when giving evidence he continuously referred to his statement. He did not appear to have any real recollection of what happened on 9 May and the fact that his statement was expressed, in this regard, in identical terms to that of the master suggests to me that he had no independent recollection of what had happened on 9 May when he made his statement. The second officer, Bryan Holmes, gave similar evidence to that of the master and chief officer as to the vessel not rising with the tide on 9 May. However, the notes of his interview, on which his statement was based, do not make reference to this happening on 9 May.

He was, however, involved in checking the discovery of traces of fuel oil in ballast tanks nos 2 and 4 starboard on 11 May and in the decision to transfer fuel oil aft. He also said in his written statement that shortly before departure from Birdport water was noted in the ballast tanks. He said that it was thought that this was the result of ballast water becoming detectable due to the vessel’s change in trim. A breach of the hull was not considered possible and so the vessel sailed but the tanks were to be monitored closely. But in cross-examination he said it was not true that water had been found in the ballast tanks before departure.  </p>

However, a water depth reading of 3.8m. from the gauge in fact represents a depth of 4.3m. in the dock when allowance is made for the height of the sill at the entrance to the dock (or a little less if allowance is made for the gradient on the dock bottom). The vessel was probably trimmed by the stern; the chief officer made a rough estimate that on completion of loading on 8 May the vessel would have been drawing about 3.75m. aft and about 2.95m. forward, giving a mean draft of 3.35m. Thus, contrary to the opinion formed by the master at the time, the vessel was probably not resting on the dock bottom on 8 May but was afloat. </p>

However, the master said that he was not alarmed by the reduction in freeboard and Dr.Medhurst’s calculation of upthrust was challenged by Mr.Spence on the grounds that it took no account of the effect that mud has on buoyancy and in particular on the correct immersion factor to use for mud or silt.

The vessels showed a draft of 2m and the mud was estimated to be 2m. in depth. It was therefore said that these vessels had sunk to the dock bottom. Perhaps they had (and Mr.Watson agreed in cross-examination that they had) but it does not follow that CHARLOTTE C would have done the same.

However, the master, in his report dated 13 May 2003, stated that when the vessel refloated at about 0310 (with a mean draft of 5.97m.) the water in the dock was 6.6m.

However, the precise extent to which the vessel sank in the mud compared with water cannot be assessed on the evidence before the court. I did not find the attempts to assess the extent to which the vessel might sink into the mud by reference to the extent to which Dr.Medhurst sank into the mud (whether with a single Wellington boot or two) at or near the gate end of the dock helpful.

(Dr.Medhust suggested that the depth would be 0.1m. less in way of the vessel’s midships point but this was only an estimate based upon photographs.) However, if the vessel was trimmed by the stern, as suggested by the chief officer’s rough estimate of the draft, then the clearance above the dock bottom in way of the damaged area will have been in excess of 0.5m. The mean draft based upon the chief officer’s rough estimate was 3.35m., which would suggest a clearance of 0.85m., or a little less if allowance is made for the inclination of the dock. It is likely, since the location of the damage was about two-thirds of the distance between stern and midships that the draft in way of the damaged area was about 3.5m., which would suggest a clearance of 0.8m., or a little less if allowance is made for the inclination of the dock. </p>

This would suggest that the clearance would have been less. However, the height of tide at low water was increasing from 8-10 May (by about 1 metre) so that there may have been more water in the dock at low water than there was on 8 May and it is clear from what Mr.Spence observed of the vessel’s bottom in La Linea that the vessel did not take the ground overall at Bird Port. Moreover, there was evidence from Mr. Boyd of Brookes Bell that the mud was denser below the uppermost layer of 6-12 inches. This is probably reflected in the experts’ agreement that the mud was softer towards the surface than the underlying part. Thus the vessel might well not sink at a uniform rate through the mud. In the result the clearance above the dock bottom on 9 and 10 May cannot be known with any accuracy, though it was probably less than on 8 May.        </p>

Rather, it was said that there was a plausible possibility of a two stage process whereby plastic deformation had caused incipient cracks (stage 1, prior to arrival at Bird Port) which opened up to cause leakage on a later occasion (stage 2, whilst at Bird Port). Much of the expert evidence was directed to considering whether there was such a plausible possibility. Dr.Medhurst said there was. Mr.Spence said there was not.   </p>

Mr. Spence said that he could not envisage any way in which a fracture of this nature could have occurred in a previously damaged plate by the application of stress to the hull form arising from the forces associated with loading aground. He firmly repeated this opinion when cross-examined. This opinion seemed to me to make sense. Moreover, under cross-examination Dr.Medhurst’s preferred cause of the crack in way of the pinnacle was not the incipient crack theory.   </p>

These diagrams illustrated the vessel arriving at Bird Port with cracks already fully opened. However, no leakage was caused by the cracks because the fillet welds between the longitudinal girder and the shell plating were intact. Leakage only occurred when the fillet welds failed by “alternating stresses”. This was a different theory from the incipient crack theory advanced in his report. When cross-examined he explained that he proposed the intact weld theory after having had access to the divers’ video.  He also mentioned in this context Mr.Davies’ description of the damage. He further explained that this theory was a possibility which applied to the crack in way of the pinnacle. He agreed that this crack could well be described as a tear in the shell plating where the shell plating had been pushed upwards and wrapped around the longitudinal. Sufficient force had been generated to tear the shell plating and to deform the welds severely but there was a possibility that the welds might remain intact. He did not accept that this was highly improbable but he said that it was unusual. When asked why he said it would be unusual he replied “because normally you would expect the welds to fail.” A little later he said that the more the shell plating bent round the longitudinal, the more likely it was that the welds would remain intact. </p>

I was not impressed by his attempts to counter the objection that longitudinal cracks would not be the result of longitudinal stresses. He accepted that he was well aware of the longitudinal direction of the cracks and yet did not put forward either of his explanations in his written reports. His intact weld theory seemed to me both surprising and deeply improbable. It seemed to me unlikely, at the very least, that the upward pressure which caused the substantial crack or tear in way of the pinnacle could leave the fillet welds in way of the longitudinal intact. This was very obviously the opinion of Mr. Spence and even Dr.Medhurst accepted that intact welds in such circumstances would be unusual “because normally you would expect the welds to fail.” His reliance on short cycle fatigue seemed to me to be ill thought out because he made no attempt to identify the substantial loads which he accepted were required for this theory. In his sketches he referred to “alternating loads” but he explained that that phrase envisaged the “loads applied during loading which will alternate as the vessel takes the ground and comes off the ground again.” In that context he referred to a “small hogging stress” which might turn into a “moderate sagging stress”. It was not explained how such small or moderate stresses might amount to the substantial loads required for short cycle fatigue.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">In considering the expert engineering evidence I reached the clear conclusion that the expert opinion of Mr.Spence was to be preferred to that of Dr.Medhurst. Mr. Spence, I thought, gave his evidence with care and was measured in his responses. He accepted many matters put to him, thought other suggestions were possible and in a few cases firmly disagreed with the suggestions put to him. Where he disagreed he explained why. The reasons he gave always appeared to me to make sense. By contrast Dr.Medhurst put forward possibilities which seemed to me, and more importantly to Mr. Spence, highly improbable and implausible. Thus the suggestion that the shell plating could have been torn in way of the pinnacle and that internals in way could have been buckled but that the fillet welds in way remained intact was, at its lowest, most improbable. Yet Dr.Medhurst was unable to accept that it was improbable even though he said it was unusual “because normally you would expect the welds to fail.” His suggestion that, the more the shell plating was bent round the longitudinal, the more likely it was that the welds would remain intact seemed to me implausible; for it meant that the more severe the indentation of the shell plating in way of the longitudinal the more likely it was that the welds would retain their integrity. Although this was said in the Defendant’s closing submissions to be the “obvious explanation” for the tear in way of the pinnacle not being the source of a leakage it was not, I think, suggested to Mr. Spence. It seemed to me that Dr.Medhurst was too enthusiastic in his suggestion of possibilities and, unwittingly, failed to give a measured and objective view unaffected by the exigencies of the litigation in which he was involved.  </p>

He also noted that paint flakes were evident both fore and aft of the damage. This also suggested to him that the damage was very recent. Internally he saw no corrosion. His observations were made, initially, when he was crawling through the damaged aft starboard ballast tank and had the use of a torch and then later, after the tanks had been cleaned and the doubler plate removed.

In the centre of the damage was the nipple or dimple indicating that whatever caused the damage did not cause pressure to be applied at its centre.

However, cross-examination on these suggestions revealed them to be unlikely contenders. The boiler or heat exchanger end plate would need a missing inspection plate in the middle to explain the nipple or dimple and the vessel, in order to contact such an object, would need to take the bottom “pretty much completely”. It is known that she did not. As to the concentric rings it was suggested that these would have to be “scuff marks of some kind”. The marks described as concentric rings did not suggest to me the irregular marks which might be generated by scuffing. Regarding the circular concrete culvert cover Dr.Medhurst said that it would have to have some kind of circular recess in the middle but said that he did not have much experience or knowledge of circular concrete culvert covers. For a vessel to contact such an object he accepted that the vessel would again have to take the bottom, which it did not. The circular rings had to be explained by abrasions, which seems unlikely given the regular nature of the rings. So far as  the top surface of a cylindrical concrete pile was concerned he accepted that it would not explain the dimple if it was a standard piece of reinforced concrete.

They base their case on the other evidence to which I have referred which, it is said, clearly indicates that it is more probable than not, that the CHARLOTTE C was damaged by coming into contact with a steel coil. For this case to succeed it is necessary for there to be, at the least, a realistic possibility that a steel coil could find its way onto the dock bottom without a record being made of the loss of that steel coil.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">It is first necessary to consider whether there exists a realistic mechanism by which a steel coil could find its way onto the bottom of the berth, a sufficient distance off the side of the berth to contact the bottom of CHARLOTTE C in the location of the damage. Two suggestions were made on behalf of the Claimant. The first was that a coil, which had been temporarily stored on the quay, might have been struck by a fork lift truck or low loader, causing it to roll to the edge and bounce down the tiered side of the dock into the dock. The second was that a coil, whilst being carried in a vehicle around the top of the dock might have been dislodged, fallen off the vehicle and rolled into the dock. Mr.Marles, the dock manager, accepted that the first suggestion was possible. He thought the second extremely improbable and pointed out that when a coil is transported it sits in a coil well on the vehicle. </p>

Mr.Marles accepted that agency labour, who might be driving the vehicle, might not report such an accident. However, he thought that Bird Port employees on site, such as the foreman or crane driver, were likely to have seen such an accident. There is force in this latter point though it remains possible that the accident might not be reported by agency labour or observed by Bird Port labour.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">It is next necessary to consider whether it is realistic to suppose that a steel coil could have been lost without a record of such loss being made. Mr.Anthony Allen, the General Manager of Bird Port, gave evidence that it was, in his view, impossible for a steel coil to be lost between ship and warehouse. Although he gave evidence of the stock control procedures in use in Bird Port his opinion was not based upon an exhaustive review of the documents produced by the stock control procedures but upon the absence of an insurance claim for the loss of a coil and the absence of a complaint from a customer that a coil which should have been delivered had not been delivered. There is obviously some force in this point because steel coils are valuable. However, the making of a complaint by a customer leading to an insurance claim assumes that the customer has accurate and reliable systems of recording the receipt of steel coils. Given the quantity of steel coils imported and exported through Bird Port it is possible that human error might cause a missing coil to be undetected. Further, there was no evidence of the records kept or checks made by those who imported and exported coils through Bird Port.  Reference was made in the oral evidence of Mr.Allen to an audit carried out in February 2004 by Corus, who exported steel through Bird Port. Mr.Allen said that the audit showed that every coil delivered to Bird Port had been loaded on board a ship or returned to Corus when the business relationship between Corus and Bird Port came to an end. However, Bird Port did not have a copy of that audit and there was no evidence as to the manner in which the audit was carried out.   </p>

On the other hand they prompt further questions as to what some of the documents generated by the Defendant’s stock control procedures are intended to represent. In circumstances where (i) the Claimant cannot point to clear evidence of a lost coil, (ii) the Defendant has not disclosed all of its stock control documents (referred to in the evidence as the “ship’s files”) and (iii) the Defendant itself has not carried out a review of those documents in order to establish that all coils can be accounted for but has instead relied upon the inference to be drawn from the absence of an insurance claim or complaint from a customer I do not consider that it is necessary for me to lengthen this already long judgment by considering in detail the documents which have been disclosed.  </p>

Of the seven vessels (including CHARLOTTE C) which called at Bird Port between 18 April and 8 May 2003 CHARLOTTE C was the largest. After CHARLOTTE C the next most deeply drafted was ANNE MARIE (with a draft of 5.3m.) but it is likely that she did not berth at the berth occupied by CHARLOTTE C. (The dock security log shows that ANNA MARIE berthed at 1820 on 28 April followed by PETERSBERG at 1835. This suggests that ANNA MARIE was berthed further inward than CHARLOTTE C.) The next most deeply drafted was LADY GRETA with a draft of about 5m. The drafts of the other vessels ranged between 3.3m. and 4.3m.   </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.60in;text-indent:0.5in">LADY GRETA loaded steel coils between 6 and 7 May 2003. Her departure draft was of the order of 5m., that is about 1m. less than the departure draft of CHARLOTTE C. Mr.Spence accepted in his very first report that there was a possibility that she contacted the same obstruction as did CHARLOTTE (if it was there) but that the contact is likely to have been slight. It was submitted on behalf of the Defendant that LADY GRETA would almost certainly have hit the coil (had it been there on 7 May). In support of this submission reliance was placed on the proposition that GRETA C would sink to within a few inches of the dock bottom or at any rate to within 0.5m. This raises the issue of “sinkage” with which I have already dealt. For the reasons I have given it cannot be assumed that a vessel would assume her “natural draft” (ie the draft she would have in water) when sitting in the mud in Bird Port. I consider that Mr.Spence put the matter fairly when he accepted that there was a possibility that she contacted the obstruction (if it was there) but that the contact is likely to have been slight. Equally, she might not have done so. I therefore reject the submission made on behalf of the Defendant that, if a coil did fall into the dock, it must have done so between 2200 on 7 May (when LADY GRETA left the berth) and 1315 on 8 May (when CHARLOTTE C arrived). </p>

Firstly, there is the extent to which the vessel could sink through the mud or silt in the dock. That is unknown. Secondly, there is the depth of water in the dock at low water. The various calculations which were presented in evidence assumed that the depth of water in the dock at low water on 9 and 10 May would have been the same as at low water on 8 May (when it was observed by the master). But since the height of low water was increasing during this period and the level of water in the dock must have been affected by the tides because the gates were leaking that assumption may not represent reality. Thirdly, there is the size of the alleged coil. There is no evidence of the size of coils which were exported through Bird Port. The imported coils ranged in size from 0.7 to in excess of 2m., though over 99% exceeded 0.9m. The Defendant invited the Court to assume that the coil was no less than 0.9m. However, a smaller coil is possible, especially having regard to the lack of any evidence as to the size of coils which were exported. </p>

It is possible that the vessel contacted the coil on 10 May and that she did not refloat at high water on 0240 on 11 May by reason of mud suction since there is evidence, which I have accepted, that she did not refloat at high water at 1534 on 11 May by reason of mud suction. Thus it is possible that the vessel contacted the coil and remained in contact with it until the mud suction was broken shortly after 0300 on 12 May. </p>

Moreover, since on the expert surveying evidence, there is no realistic possibility that the damage occurred before Bird Port and every likelihood that it occurred at Bird Port, it is unlikely that the vessel to sank within 0.5m. of the bottom. That evidence cannot be ignored when assessing the probability of the vessel sinking to within 0.5m. of the dock bottom.

However, since neither the height of the coil nor the extent to which the vessel sank in mud is known it cannot be said to be probable that there must have been a list had a coil been in the mud. No list was observed. Since on the expert surveying evidence there is no realistic possibility that the damage occurred before Bird Port and every likelihood that it occurred at Bird Port it is probable that the height of the coil and the extent to which the vessel sank were not such as to cause a noticeable list.     </p>

It could not be said that the activities of Mr.Watson on 12, 13 and 14 May rendered a search unnecessary. On 12 May Mr. Watson merely observed mud being grabbed and deposited where CHARLOTTE C had been. On 13 May he carried out only a limited search by prodding the mud from the bottom ledge. He could probe only about 1m. from the ledge. On 14 May he only made further observations. Moreover, Mr.Marles accepted that it was possible that if an item had been in the mud when Mr.Watson arrived it was still there when he left. Thus there was no reason why Mr.Marles should not have carried out a careful search and every reason why he should. Since he accepted that it was his duty to ensure that the dock was safe for the next vessel it is probable that he carried out a search. I therefore consider that it likely that he did so and I find it surprising that, given that he was dock manager, he cannot remember doing so, after an interval of just over two years.

Mr.Allen said that such action disturbed the mud and if there was an obstacle in the mud it would be visible. Although in other respects Mr.Allen’s evidence was given fairly (for example he was quite open when dealing with the suggested discrepancies in the Defendants’ disclosed documents concerning the care of cargo in the custody of the Defendant) I found this evidence surprising. Given the depth of the mud an obstacle in the mud might not show a visible contour on the surface of the mud. Reliance on observing a contour would be a most unsafe basis on which to conclude that there was no obstacle in the mud. Nor can the act of dropping mud on mud be regarded as a sure way of discovering whether there is an obstacle in the mud on which further mud is dropped.  </p>

This makes it difficult to accept Mr.Marles’ denial that a coil was found and removed from the dock. Moreover, the evidence that CHARLOTTE C suffered damage whilst in the dock and the fact that the pattern of such damage on the vessel’s shell plating is so strikingly suggestive of a contact with a steel coil is, in aggregate, cogent evidence that CHARLOTTE C must have sat on a steel coil whilst in Bird Port. This must be taken into account when deciding whether Mr.Marles’ denial that a coil was found and removed before 15 May can be accepted. But before reaching a conclusion on this question it is necessary to refer to a detailed submission made on behalf of the Defendant that there was little opportunity for this to be done between 12 and 15 May.</p>

Thus the flood tide had already commenced to flow more than 4.5 hours before high water (which was at 1649). It therefore seems likely that on the evening of 12 May the tide would have been ebbing by about 1900, and possibly before that. Flushing or sluicing the dock could therefore have commenced by 1900. Sunset was (depending upon the publication one consults) between 2038 and 2052, civil twilight between 2119 and 2133 and nautical twilight between 2213 and 2229. So there was a period of almost 2 and half hours during which silt could be removed from the dock before civil twilight. Had a steel coil been spotted a spider grab would have been necessary to remove it. There was no evidence as to precisely when it would have been possible to have used the spider grab to have removed a steel coil. Mr.Allen said in evidence that the period before low water during which a grab (presumably the clam grab used for dredging) could be used depended upon “the tide conditions each month, but you are looking at approximately two hours before and two hours after each low tide.” This was determined by the need not to submerge the electro-hydraulic motor mounted on top of the grab. It is not known whether the same restrictions applied to the spider grab. If they did then the grab could have been used at about 2130, perhaps earlier. There would therefore have been an opportunity, albeit a very limited opportunity, to use the spider grab at about or just after civil twilight before darkness fell. However, artificial light would extend the time available for the use of the grab and it is unlikely that there was no artificial light at the dock since vessels depart during the hours of darkness (as did CHARLOTTE C on 12 May and, according to the dock security log, so did LADY GRETA at 2245 on 7 May) and both sides of the dock are monitored by cameras (see for example the entry in the dock security log for 2100 on 16 May).  Indeed, it is to be noted that the dock security log records that on 19 May dredging continued until 2300, that on 25 May it continued until 2210 and that on 26 May dredging commenced at 2115 with no record as to when it was stopped. The security log for 12 May itself has never been found; though the pages for other days are also missing. </p>

Again it is not known when Mr.Watson left but obviously no dredging operations using a spider grab could have taken place whilst he was there.

Consideration of the nature of the damage shows that it is very likely that one event caused both the indentation damage and the leakages. Since the leakages were caused at Bird Port so must the indentation damage have been. There is, on the expert surveying evidence, no realistic possibility that the damage could have been caused prior to arrival at Bird Port. Further, the pattern of the damage on the vessel’s shell plating suggests contact with a circular object with a hole in its centre capable of impressing circular rings on the vessel’s bottom. A steel coil is just such an object and many steel coils are loaded, discharged and stored at Bird Port. This is a cogent body of evidence in support of the Claimant’s case. </p>

The case has to be decided upon the balance of probabilities. The evidence in support of the Claimant’s case is very strong. The Defendant denies that a steel coil was removed from the dock following the departure of CHARLOTTE C but cannot show a realistic possibility that the damage was caused prior to Bird Port. The dock manager and general manager gave evidence that no search was made after CHARLOTTE C left early on 12 May and before the next vessel arrived early on 15 May but I have rejected that evidence because it is wholly improbable. I consider it very likely that a search was made before the next vessel arrived. </p>

There was an opportunity to inspect the dock whilst the tide ebbed and the mud was removed from the dock by flushing and sluicing the dock in the evening of 12 May and an opportunity to remove a steel coil by spider grab at or about civil twilight or thereafter with the assistance of artificial light. If there was no opportunity to discover the steel coil and remove it on 12 May then the steel coil must have been discovered and removed at some later time before 13 June when it is common ground that there was no steel coil in the dock.

If this is intended as a broad statement it cannot be correct because on 13 May Mr.Watson observed the sluicing operation and noted in the entrance channel, at the outlet of the sluice valve, large boulders and brickwork, steel bars, steel plates, wire ropes and cargo securing bars all of which he said could damage a vessel using the dock. This suggests that Mr.Allen, when making this statement, cannot have given proper consideration to the dredging or sluicing operations which in fact took place after the departure of CHARLOTTE C. Had he done so he would have had to have dealt with the objects found in the mud on 13 May. It may be that his statement was based upon what others reported to him. If, however, the statement is intended to be understood more narrowly as a denial that a steel coil was removed then I must reject that evidence for the same reason that I must reject Mr.Marles’ evidence. It has been observed that whereas it was put to Mr.Marles that a coil was removed the same suggestion was not put to Mr.Allen. However, it was squarely put to Mr.Allen that he could not have been satisfied that there was no substantial obstruction in the mud and that it was incredible that he did not conduct a search before the next vessel arrived on 15 May. As I have already noted, he denied that such a search had been made, which evidence I have rejected.   </p>

It was submitted that it is fanciful to suggest that the operation could have been carried out without Mr.Allen knowing about it.

So far as covering up his role in so doing it is more likely than not that he did not wish it to become known that a steel coil had fallen into and remained in the dock of which he was the manager, charged with the duty of ensuring that the dock was safe for use by the ships which used it. </p>

However, he accepted that the only way of ensuring that the bottom of the berth at Bird Port was clear of obstructions was to dredge all the mud out of the dock. But the dock was only dredged when operational requirements permitted. Since the berth was busy from 28 April until 8 May it seems likely there was no dredging during that period. Indeed, the last date on which there is evidence of the dock being dredged was 27 April 2003, some 11 days before the arrival of CHARLOTTE C. Moreover, it was not apparent that all mud was removed when dredging took place. Mr.Allen told Mr.Williams, a surveyor attending on behalf the Defendant’s insurers on 13 June 2003, that prior to the incident involving CHARLOTTE C it had been about 6 weeks “since the dock had been dredged or cleared.”   </p>

Dredging of the dock is frequently undertaken …” He explained in his evidence that he was shown records of frequent inspections. He also said that he saw dredging records.

I agree. I reject the submission made on behalf of the Defendant that it is unreasonable to expect the Defendant to clean out the dock more than once or perhaps twice a year.

That can only be achieved by a daily system of careful inspection and regular dredging. The Defendant’s duty of reasonable care requires that the daily system of inspection is thorough.   Merely inspecting from the dock sides as described by Mr.Marles cannot be enough because it cannot ensure that objects in the mud are discovered. Mr.Watson suggested in his report that the mud could be probed from a small boat using either a physical probe or a sonar or a cage could be attached to the crane enabling two people to probe the mud. Either or both of these methods would have been more thorough and effective than the inspections carried out by Mr.Watson. Indeed he said in his evidence that on one of his visits to Bird Port he requested the use of a cage on the gantry crane to survey the bottom but did not get a reply.    </p>

However, he was only able to observe from the dock edge and prod the mud with a pole from a position on the lowest ledge. The fact that he did not discover the steel coil does not show that a careful and thorough inspection, using a boat or cage, organised by those whose duty it was to keep the dock clear of obstructions would not have discovered the steel coil. </p>

The equivalent daily charter rate on the next voyage was greater than on the voyage in which the incident occurred. The next voyage took place in the latter two weeks of June. The reason for the increase is not known. It may be that the market rate was improving (the equivalent daily charter rates increased from voyage 31 to 32 and from 32 to 33). If so then the higher rate should probably not be taken into account when assessing the loss of profit on the voyage in question. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Soya</span> [1956] 1 Lloyd’s rep. 557 the Court of Appeal approved this approach.

The actual cost may have been more. It is likely to be an estimate. Having regard to this uncertainty I consider, doing the best I can on the material available, that the daily rate for voyage 32 of £3083.30 should be reduced to £2,900 per day.  </p>

The master had in mind the risk of pollution (he had a leaking fuel tank) and wished to keep as far off land as possible. Although other mariners may have taken a different decision (and Captain Smith would have) I do not consider that his decision can be said to be unreasonable. </p>

The vessel operated on the spot market. After completion of discharge at Sagunto she had no fixture. Once it was known where the casualty was to be repaired, at La Linea, a cargo was fixed from Huelva. La Linea was en route from Sagunto to Huelva.  It seems to me that there is no cause for making a deduction from the period of loss of hire. Had it not been for the incident at Bird Port the vessel would not have had to have proceeded to La Linea. It was fortunate that a cargo was found from Huelva, otherwise the period of loss of hire might have been greater than it was. </p>

It is said that this caused 4 days’ delay. Two reasons for making such arrangements were discussed in the evidence. The first was that the crew should have opened up the tanks at Sagunto. However, Dr.Medhurst did not pursue this suggestion after hearing of the hexagon bolts on the tank tops. The second was that the crew should have sampled the contents of the tanks by means of an oil/water separator. But Dr.Medhurst accepted that for this to be done the crew would have to have had available a slop tank and no attempt was made to show that a slop tank was available for this purpose. I therefore reject the suggestion that there was a failure to mitigate. </p>

A sum of £97 10s. was claimed in respect of the wages of an employed superintendent. The Assistant Registrar thought that the superintendent only did “slight extra work” in excess of his ordinary duties. He allowed only £5 5s. Upon a motion in objection to the report of the Assistant Registrar Langton J considered that it was impossible to lay down any general principle but he thought the sum allowed very much too small. He thought the superintendent was put to a very large amount of work outside his normal duties. It seems, though it is not clear, that an argument was addressed to the judge based upon the fact that the superintendent was an employee. Langton J. is reported to have approached the matter on the footing of giving the claimants the sum they would have been entitled to if they had put forward a claim properly vouched in respect of extra outside assistance but allowed the wrongdoer some part of the “advantage from the fact that the shipowner has a marine superintendent with special expert knowledge.” He allowed £25. I am not sure that any general principle can be extracted from this decision and indeed Langton J. expressly said he could not lay down a general principle.  </p>

He held that it can be recovered where it is an expenditure which would not otherwise have been incurred eg where additional staff are employed or overtime is paid; see paragraphs 47 and 50. He further held that it can be recovered where revenue has been lost as a result of the employee being unavailable to carry out revenue producing work; see paragraphs 47 and 57. He further observed that it may be difficult to quantify any loss of revenue and that the cost of the employee time may be taken as an approximation for the loss of revenue; see paragraph 87. So far as claiming the value of the work done irrespective of any expenditure loss or loss of revenue he held that a claimant has no claim for damages in respect of salaries paid to its employees during the period when they carried out work made necessary by the defendant’s tort if those salaries would have been paid in any event; see paragraph 55.</p>

In those circumstances it seems to me appropriate, so long as there is no risk of the practice producing an unjust result, to use that practice as an approximation of the revenue loss caused by the disruption of the Claimant’s business and the expenditure of management time. In the present case, where the resultant loss is only about £1565, I am satisfied that there is no risk that the Court would be awarding a sum in excess of the loss actually caused by the disruption of business and the expenditure of management time; or, to borrow a phrase from others, “I am certainly not giving them too much.
