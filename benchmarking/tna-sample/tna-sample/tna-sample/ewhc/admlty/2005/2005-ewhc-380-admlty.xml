	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GM had hitherto been berthed port side to alongside Sidor no.3 berth on an upriver heading. In broad terms, the collision occurred in the course of her undertaking a 180<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> starboard turn to commence her downriver passage, assisted by two tugs and under the advice of a local pilot.  Another vessel, “ILLAPEL”, was anchored abeam of GM, distant some 2.5 – 3 cables off the berth, to the northern side of the navigable channel.  AC had been at anchor, most recently to her starboard anchor, with 5½ shackles in the water, about astern of “ILLAPEL”, distant some 5 cables from her.  As will be seen, AC’s position, the question of whether she had been dragging and, if so, the direction of her dragging were controversial; subject to AC’s substantial yawing, which was common ground, for the moment it suffices to say that her heading had been very broadly upriver.  There is annexed to this judgment, a copy of a chart of the relevant area, with the simulations of both parties’ experts superimposed thereon (“Annexe I”).</p>

As appears from Annexe I, there is a difference of about 50m (North/South) between the two. Given (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>) the fact that the GM did not have a course recorder or an engine data logger and the inevitable margins of error in such exercises, nothing turns on the difference between the two simulated tracks.  I accept these simulations as providing good illustrative plots of the track of GM, subject throughout to the caution expressed by David Steel J. in <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Pelopidas</span> [1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 675, esp. at p.682.  </p>

Again, no practical consequences rest on such differences. I am therefore content to conclude that the collision position was about 500m from and bearing about WNW of the South Western end of Venalum pier, shown in the annexe. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By way of broad outline only, the rival cases were these.  GM, if I may say so, somewhat boldly, contended that AC was solely to blame, alternatively should bear the preponderance of blame.  AC had been anchored in an unsafe anchorage and had failed to take any or adequate steps to control her yaw, drag and sway. In its final form, GM’s case was that there probably was some but not very great dragging in a SE direction, towards Venalum berth; the greater movement was caused by yaw and sway.  The duty to control yaw, drag and sway was acute, given that AC had anchored in a narrow channel in close proximity to busy berths.  Control could have been achieved by the adoption of an open moor (anchoring with two anchors, to an angle of about 60<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span>), together with use of helm and engines; had such measures been taken, AC would have been more to the North of the channel and a collision would probably have been avoided or its nature would have been less serious.   For her part, GM had maintained a proper lookout before unberthing; neither “ILLAPEL” nor AC presented risks to the unberthing manoeuvre and it could not reasonably be anticipated by those on board GM that AC would yaw and sway substantially and not take steps to control such movement.  The manoeuvre itself was reasonably conducted and it was AC’s intermittent movement into the middle of the narrow channel which caused or was the major cause of the collision. The notion that GM as the moving vessel should be solely to blame was in any event wrong and amounted to a resurrection of the “last opportunity rule”. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">AC’s case was that GM was solely to blame for the collision; very much as a fallback alternative, GM was preponderantly to blame. GM, underway, had struck a vessel at anchor. At anchor, AC, painted bright red, had been visible; her yawing was not unusual for a vessel at anchor in a river with a fast flowing current.  Her anchorage was not unsafe. She was not dragging or any dragging was minimal and immaterial; she had taken reasonable measures to seek to control her yaw; an open moor had been tried; so too had use of the helm; the use of engines would likely have made matters worse.  The fault here lay with the failure of those on board GM to make any appreciation prior to unberthing or to maintain a proper lookout before or after departure from the berth. There had been no adequate planning or discussion between the master and pilot.  The use of her engines at full ahead for some 3 minutes (between 08.24 and 08.27) had resulted in GM proceeding further to the North than should have been the case and accelerating out of her turn; if GM had needed half or full ahead at all, only a kick with the engines was needed.  Even after GM came onto a downriver heading, having made too wide a turn at an excessive speed, a collision could have been avoided if (now having her engines on full ahead) her engines had been kept at full ahead and she had gone to starboard; instead confusion prevailed on the bridge and a series of unjustifiable orders were given, resulting in GM failing to keep clear of AC.  GM’s manoeuvring was such that any failure on the part of AC to control her yaw and sway was not causative of the collision; there would have been a collision in any event. While not disputing that AC’s log and record keeping had been lamentable, it would be wrong to hold AC causatively to blame in order to register the court’s disapproval of the way she may have managed herself. </p>

GM called her master, third officer, pilot and helmsman, together with four tug masters, on board the two tugs (“NICOLE” and “MARIANNE D”) waiting to assist in the berthing of “ILLAPEL”, scheduled to follow GM’s departure. AC called her relatively inexperienced third officer, Mr. Cubid, but neither her master nor chief officer.  It was a feature of the case that, with the sole exception of the helmsman of GM, all this evidence must be approached with varying degrees of caution – though I should make it clear at once that there was, rightly, no suggestion that either the master or third officer of GM had been other than honest witnesses.  It is convenient to note here that prior proceedings in the United States (“the US proceedings”) had generated a volume of evidential material, which, in the event, furnished considerable pickings for cross-examination in this trial.</p>

I must of course do the best I can on the evidence before me but it is perhaps unfortunate that no steps were taken to make the master of AC available to give evidence by way of video link.

Although it had been anticipated that it might be necessary to call some expert evidence as to questions going to the simulation of a vessel at an open moor, in the event AC’s expert came to accept the views of GM’s expert.

Its effect is that any consultation between the assessors and the court should take place openly as part of the assembling of evidence. Because the judge is not bound to accept the advice he receives from the assessors ….the parties are entitled to an opportunity to contend that he should or should not follow it.

That is something of a puzzle because, according to the log, at 13.30 the engine was started and at 13.36 the log records that the port anchor was (additionally) let go to 3 shackles on deck; the master’s witness statement asserts that the AC was now lying “in what was almost an open moor”.

The log purports to record an anchorage position for 23.40; it is the 13.42 position. In his witness statement, the master admits that he wrote this position in as an “estimate” after the collision. Curiously, the third officer maintained in his evidence that he had written this position in contemporaneously. I see no reason to doubt admissions made by the master against his interest. I am unable to accept the third officer’s evidence in this regard; in my judgment, personable though he was, he was here giving an untruthful answer out of misplaced loyalty.

Shortly after the collision (some time after 09.00), the Harbour Master at Matanzas took away and copied the AC’s log and bell book entries for that day.  These show that no anchorage position is recorded for 02.48.  However, subsequently, an entry has been made in the log, inserting the same 13.42 position for 02.48.

In short, he admitted that while he did have instructions from the master to guard against dragging, involving (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>) the use of AC’s GPS anchor watch facility, he had not been given any instructions at any time to guard against or control her yaw and swing.</p>

In his witness statement, he says that he had not “intended to mislead anyone but [it was] rather an error on my part in believing the record should be made more complete rather than leaving it as it was”.  Insofar as that sentence is intended to suggest an innocent explanation, I regret that I am unable to accept it. The inference which I draw from the master’s conduct is that he and those on board AC had no more than an approximate idea of where AC had been at anchor (somewhere in the vicinity of the 13.42 position), felt embarrassed or exposed in consequence and sought to create a false record to the contrary. </p>

Additionally, the third officer suggested that where no records existed for various positions over the days in question, he had been given the vessel’s position, recorded not in the bell book or log but on pieces of paper. None of those pieces of paper have been disclosed.  For my part, in the light both of the master’s conduct and the third officer’s evidence as to the 23.40 position, I regret that I do not accept this explanation.  I think this is another instance of misplaced loyalty on the part of the third officer, leading to an untruthful answer.  If wrong on that, however, then the picture painted of the conduct of those on board AC is scarcely more attractive; a system which depended on positions being recorded on pieces of paper – none of which have survived – does nothing to encourage confidence in AC’s position fixing, lookout or record-keeping.</p>

Given the evidence as to her yawing, that is indeed hardly surprising. In the light of the downriver set of the current, I would anticipate that the direction of any dragging would primarily be downriver rather than cross-channel. That is certainly so between 08.00 on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August and the time of collision when, in my judgment, any dragging was immaterial, a matter of no more than some metres and with a negligible, if any, cross-channel component.</p>

Both times he had navigated with the aid of BA charts – but their scale was too small to be of any real use. On the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August, he in fact received a local chart for which he had asked; but, in the event, he had not yet looked at it by the time of the departure manoeuvres from Matanzas on the next morning and the collision which so shortly followed. On the occasion of the master’s previous visit, the current had not been flowing so strongly and there had been no ships anchored even approximately in the position of “ILLAPEL” and AC.  In accordance with his owners’ (or managers’) standard procedures a berth to berth passage plan had been prepared for the voyage to come (it was lost in the collision); so far, however, as unberthing manoeuvres were concerned, these had been left, understandably in my view, to be discussed between master and pilot.</p>

Subsequently, after time for consideration, the master revised this view down to the (correct) distance of some 2.5 – 3 cables.  Though there may be some doubt in the matter, I am content to accept that the master knew that AC had moved up-river (rather than remaining at her original anchorage), albeit that, to begin with, he under-estimated her distance from “ILLAPEL”.   More significantly, he said in evidence that he did not make accurate observations of AC because she appeared to be safely at anchor and did not consider her a threat to his departure manoeuvres.  His intention was to pass AC, at a distance no closer than 1 ½  cables.  He said that he had observed AC on a number of occasions but did not notice her yawing. He agreed that radar observation (using GM’s two rastascan radars) would have revealed her yawing but he had not thought it necessary to make any such observation.  Had he seen AC yawing, he would have consulted with the pilots and the harbour authorities as to what action to take.  He had not considered proceeding upriver before making his turn because he did not consider such a course to be necessary. </p>

Pilot Torres was more interested in his conversation with the river pilots than in any discussion with the master.  The master did not pursue the matter further; it does not appear that anything was said between master and pilot which went beyond that it would be “the same as last time”; but, as already observed, the conditions on this occasion were very different from “last time”.   </p>

He did not observe her swinging.  He also thought (a matter to which I shall return later) that she was anchored in a “proper position”.   As far as the pilot was concerned, this was a routine operation.  He said that the positions of “ILLAPEL” and AC gave him no particular cause for concern; hence, he did not check their positions by radar. However, as the evidence emerged, it seemed clear that he lacked any accurate grasp of their positions and their distances from GM – a necessary pre-condition for treating them, even on the basis of instinct and experience, as posing no danger to GM’s proposed manoeuvre.  Strikingly, he put “ILLAPEL” at some 700 metres distant from GM, on the edge of the deep water channel; she was in fact some 200 metres closer than that. So too, AC was correspondingly and significantly closer to GM than the pilot appreciated.  The pilot assumed, however, that provided he cleared “ILLAPEL” he would clear AC.   Only when the ships were “very near” would the pilot take a ship upriver before making her turn; but he declined to talk in terms of distances or how close was “very near”.    </p>

He explained that the purpose of his standard procedure would be to make as short a turn as possible; it would be a “dead ship” turn, with as little use of the engines as possible;  the key was for the turn to be conducted carefully and slowly in a controlled manner. In the event that the turn did not proceed satisfactorily, then a kick to half ahead might be used; but too much forward way towards the north of the channel was to be avoided.</p>

Quite apart from the simulations contained in the annexe, it seems inevitable to me that such would be the case, given the nature of the manoeuvre and the strength and direction of the current. Indeed, in his deposition for the US proceedings, the pilot himself (when describing his standard procedure) accepted that the “ship travels downstream somewhat”; the actual manoeuvre, as already described, can only have increased this tendency. It follows that GM must have been downriver of “ILLAPEL” when her turn was completed and the evidence of GM’s helmsman was plainly to this effect.  </p>

AC was on the port bow; her bearing was opening from, he estimated, 2 to 4 points, though he accepted that it was possible that it was from 1.5 to 2.5 points.   From her change of heading, the third officer deduced (wrongly in the event) that she was no longer at anchor and was manoeuvring. The third officer reported this development to the bridge.

At the hearing it was unclear who had made or participated in the VHF call but it is unnecessary to take time over that or as to the substance of the conversation (such as it may have been).  The short answer to the timing point is that the record keeping on AC was lamentable and the evidence from her master and third officer is entitled to little, if any, weight, as already described; such evidence as is furnished by AC’s VHF log (in any event written up after the collision) is simply outweighed by the overwhelming weight of evidence pointing to concern about AC developing amongst those on GM at about 08.27. </p>

According to his oral evidence and consistent with a statement made in March 2002, suddenly AC stopped swinging and then dragged rapidly in a SE direction.  When he observed AC dragging, GM was already on a downriver heading; she was not however being set downriver by the current, as, he said, the tugs were holding her in position; the stern tug was made fast. Asked to draw what he was describing, he put both “ILLAPEL” and AC well aground in the shallows to the north of the channel.  He was very surprised by the rapid movement of AC across the river.  With the sole exception of his observation that the “swinging” of AC was obvious to anyone who looked and that he did not report it, evidence which I do accept, I have no hesitation in rejecting the remainder of his oral evidence.  It is unnecessary to say more of  Captain Acosta’s sketch. He was wrong about the tugs and about GM not being set downriver; but perhaps all that is by the by. However, were he right, AC would have been dragging at speed <span style="font-style:italic">across</span> the current; that is improbable, to put it no higher.

His evidence must be treated as unreliable on that ground alone. Further, although he said in evidence that he had seen AC dragging into the channel and (in fairness to him) had made some mention of dragging when interviewed after the collision (albeit in different terms to the picture he described in evidence), in a report to his operations manager made on the day of the collision, he said this:</p>

Curiously, according to Captain Omana, Captain Lossada had prepared this sketch of his own initiative and without assistance from others, at a joint meeting attended by Captains Omana, Lossada and Rodriguez, together with US attorneys. (For completeness, Captain Rodriguez suggested that Captain Lossada undertook the sketch because of his drawing abilities). Whatever the provenance of the sketch it and a chart marked by Captain Omana’s were remarkable for the unlikely speed at which they suggested AC to be  dragging in a SE direction towards Venalum pier and the distance travelled (some 700 metres in a matter of minutes) – even making generous allowance for “guesstimates”. </p>

In the circumstances, it suffices to conclude that these were unreliable witnesses (save where their evidence was contrary to GM’s interests); it is unnecessary to go further and consider whether this unreliability was attributable to mistaken recollection, exaggeration, rationalisation after the event, or design.

As such, AC was anchored in the channel, albeit towards its Northern side. It is difficult to express the matter more precisely in terms of AC’s position within the channel as the channel’s limits were not defined with accuracy.  </p>

There was a risk that AC might sway and/or drag into the centre of the channel in circumstances where movements might be expected off those berths. The fault was serious in that it gave rise to a dangerous situation; a vessel turning off (for example) Sidor berth might not appreciate that AC was moving intermittently into or towards the centre of the channel.  Moreover, it was particularly blameworthy because the master had (re-) anchored there without reference to the local authorities and by reason of the position fixing failures (already set out).</p>

In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to enter into the controversy over whether the fine had been properly imposed. Instead, it seems relevant to me that AC re-anchored on several occasions, over a relatively extended period, in full view of a busy port;  wherever precisely she anchored, the general area cannot have been in doubt; yet no objections were raised until after the collision. Again, this is a feature difficult to reconcile with the submission that her anchorage position was unsafe.</p>

In my view there plainly was such a duty. Given AC’s anchorage position, as already described, commonsense rebels at the notion that with knowledge of her yawing and even if able to do so, AC was not required to take reasonable steps to control her yawing. As so much of good seamanship involves the application of informed commonsense in the interests of safety at sea, I am amply satisfied that the requirements of good seamanship are to like effect. In his final oral submissions, Mr. Teare said this:</p>

The fact that even with AC yawing there was sufficient sea room for another vessel to pass safely in the channel, does not mean that good seamanship did not require AC to take reasonable steps to control that yaw with a view to maximising the amount of available sea room. Furthermore, it was not or not seriously in dispute that pronounced yawing gives rise to the risk of dragging; as there can be no doubt that a vessel is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent dragging it must follow that there is a duty to take reasonable care to control her yawing. </p>

I agree with Mr. Teare that those observations are inapplicable in the circumstances of this case, involving as they do a vessel yawing and swaying unlike the anchored vessel in <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Viper</span> and, moreover, doing so close to a busy berth; further, were it otherwise, it is impossible to imagine that Willmer J. would have expressed himself in <span style="text-decoration:underline">The “Sedulity”</span> as he did.</p>

Mr. Persey submitted that going astern would be “counterintuitive” and, even if beneficial, was not reasonably to be expected from an ordinarily competent master. Mr. Hendy (the relevant AC expert) added this in his report: “Going astern may not be the obvious choice to reduce dragging.”  I agree.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position as to anchoring to an open moor is, in my judgment, very different.  For practical purposes, an open moor involves the vessel anchoring with both anchors leading ahead. GM’s case was that adopting an open moor required no more than ordinary good seamanship; its purpose was to dampen down yawing and swaying, so as to enable a vessel to lie quietly (or more quietly) at anchor, thereby reducing the risk of dragging. On the evidence, the master of GM, her third officer and the pilot were all familiar with the technique.  As I understood the expert evidence, by the conclusion of the trial it was not (or not seriously) in dispute that the adoption of an open moor, with a total angle of 60<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> between the anchors (i.e., 2 x 30<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span>) would reduce the angle of yaw to a maximum of +/- 20<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> and swaying to about 20m each side of the centre position.  Furthermore, there was agreement between the relevant experts that while, even with an open moor, there would be some dragging after about 30 minutes to an hour and that the anchors would thereafter drag closer together, reaching a 2 x 15<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> moor after about a further 4.5 hours, it would take some 9-9.5 hours in total for the anchors to drag together.  </p>

The master’s observation, that he did not want to be caught dragging with both anchors down is, with respect, not an answer or a good answer; on the occasion when he made that comment, not only was he able to raise both anchors without difficulty but <span style="font-style:italic">thereafter</span> he anchored to two anchors, albeit not to an open moor. As to the two anchors dragging together, on the evidence of the experts which I accept, he would have had ample time to reset the open moor before that happened. I therefore conclude that an open moor was a recognised technique, requiring no more than ordinary good seamanship; by latest 05.48 on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August, 2000, in the light of her pronounced yawing and the number of instances of anchor dragging, AC was at fault in not anchoring or re-anchoring in this manner.  For completeness, it may be that an open moor should have been adopted following an earlier dragging occasion but nothing turns on that and I express no final view in that regard.

As agreed by the relevant experts, the application of constant 15<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> starboard helm would, after about 30 minutes, have reduced the amount of yaw and offset the location of the yaw to starboard (i.e., away from the centre and towards the North side of the channel).   </p>

For this conclusion to be tenable, they needed an accurate understanding of the positions and hence distance of both those vessels and of their behaviour at anchorage insofar as such behaviour might impact on GM’s turn.  Were it otherwise, not only would they have failed to keep a proper lookout but they would not have available the information to negate the risk of collision. In stark terms, GM could not plan a manoeuvre with a safe passing distance from vessels to be encountered on route, unless those on board had a proper understanding of the position and behaviour of the vessels they were to pass. This is emphatically not a recipe for navigation by paperwork or chart; it is instead basic good seamanship.  It is here, that the failures of those on board GM began.</p>

It is plain that neither master nor pilot had any real appreciation of these matters. Insofar as the master discounted the significance of these vessels because he remained unaware of the details of the proposed manoeuvre, having left those to the pilot, that is of course no answer. As to the pilot, his appraisal was simply inaccurate, with the result that he effectively ignored “ILLAPEL” and AC when he should not have done. If visual observation did not suffice, then radar plotting could have been undertaken.   On the evidence, although the vessel had two rastascan radars available, no use was made of radar to plot the position of “ILLAPEL” and AC.  It could not seriously be suggested that plotting the positions of these vessels by radar would have occasioned any difficulty. </p>

The fact of the matter here is that, even on the assumptions on which the (revised) question is premised, those on GM failed to evaluate distances correctly; a correct evaluation would or should have had a material impact on the unberthing plan.  First, such an evaluation would have lent emphasis to the need for the manoeuvre to be conducted as tightly as could safely be accomplished (see the Assessors’ earlier answer); secondly, the option of proceeding upriver to turn could and, if need be, should have been considered.  The matter does not quite end there.   If the Assessors’ reasoning is to be faulted, it can only be because in daylight and with good visibility, visual observation should have sufficed.

Each said that they had observed AC but not seen her yawing. Intuitively, this is surprising.  To begin with AC’s yawing cannot be regarded as unusual or unexpected; as agreed by the relevant experts, yawing was “normal” for a laden vessel in the Orinoco, subject to a current of 4 to 4.5 or 5 knots (unless appropriate steps were taken to reduce it).  Mr. Teare, for his part, realistically accepted that yaw and sway are normal consequences of lying to a single anchor in a heavy current with a vessel of a certain trim and in a certain depth. To the extent that there was evidence to the contrary (notably from the pilot), I cannot give it credence; curiously, the pilot thought that dragging caused yawing when the converse is plainly the case.  Furthermore, AC’s yawing was noticed by others: two days earlier, GM’s helmsman had seen AC yawing “quite a lot”; additionally, as will be recollected, the tug masters (Captains Acosta and Omana) had likewise seen her yawing, in effect, obviously.  </p>

With respect, I am wholly unable to accept this submission.  Again for the moment instinctively, the object of a good lookout is to permit planning for a safe passage; it <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> therefore necessary to take into account the behaviour of the ship under observation; where yawing is to be anticipated (as here), an observer is, so to speak, on notice to look out for it. It is unsafe and imprudent to proceed on the <span style="font-style:italic">assumption</span> that appropriate measures have been taken to reduce it. In any event, others appeared to have seen AC yawing without any particular difficulty. It cannot be right that the duty under Rule 5 of the Collision Regulations is satisfied by a fleeting observation which at the moment it is made detects nothing of significance; that would be to pay lip service to the Rule and to ignore its object.  </p>

Suffice to say that in my judgment, the difficulties suggested by GM were significantly overstated.  Had it been necessary to use radar, then in gyro-stabilised (north-up) mode, no particular difficulty ought to have attached to observing AC’s behaviour by radar, before and during GM’s turn.</p>

In these circumstances, it seems inescapable on the facts of this case that there was a failure in lookout, regardless of the behaviour of AC. A good lookout entailed keeping watch on the vessels to be passed during the manoeuvre, not least so as to observe any changes in their position or behaviour. Whether this failure of lookout was attributable to the absence of a dedicated lookout on the bridge (as the master appeared to accept) or to the failure of those on the bridge to maintain a proper lookout, is neither here nor there.</p>

As already foreshadowed, with proper appreciation and lookout it is probable that the future course of events would have been very different. Two examples suffice; first, the master accepted in his evidence that if he had realised that AC was yawing, he would have consulted with the pilot and harbour authorities as to what action to take; secondly, there was always the option of going upriver before making the turn; in the event that option was not even considered. Further consideration of causation is best deferred until later both on this aspect of the failure of lookout and as to poor lookout during the manoeuvre.   For the present it is sufficient to remark that there was much force in the following criticism contained in AC’s final written submissions:</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, there was undoubtedly sufficient water for GM, differently manoeuvred, to have passed AC safely, even at the extremity of her yaw; accordingly, there can be no realistic doubt that the faults of GM, in respect of appreciation, lookout and the manner in which her unberthing manoeuvre was conducted, were at least a major contributory cause of the collision.  Provided only that it is right to conclude, as I already have, that AC’s yawing should have been observed, then it can properly be said that the collision, in broad daylight, was caused by GM simply failing to keep clear of the very visible AC.  It will be recollected that in contemporaneous statements, two of the tug masters (Captains Acosta and Rodriguez) said, effectively, just that – and, for whatever reason, neither of those two witnesses was predisposed to favour AC.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also, however, concluded that AC was at fault in failing to control her yaw in that she neither anchored to an open moor nor used her helm (adequately or at all) to dampen down her yawing and offset it to starboard. On this footing, Mr. Teare submits that AC’s fault was also a cause of the collision and, accordingly, that liability is to be apportioned.</p>

If the answer is “no”, then I must go on to consider apportionment.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For AC, Mr. Persey submitted that GM’s manoeuvre was such that whatever AC did (whether by way of open moor or use of helm), a collision would probably not have been avoided. In support of this argument he relied on a diagram produced by his expert (Mr. Hendy) which, as a matter of geometry, was agreed by GM’s expert (Mr. Byrne); a copy of that diagram forms Annexe II to this judgment.  Annexe II shows the actual degree of AC’s yaw (in green), together with the degrees of yaw on a 60<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> open moor (in red) and a 30<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> open moor (in blue).  Superimposed on Annexe II are GM and her track.  Annexe II suggests, Mr. Persey submitted, that a collision would not have been avoided on red (i.e. had AC anchored to a 60<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> open moor) and would only have been avoided had she been at the starboard or northern extremity of green (her actual yawing) or blue (the lesser 30<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> open moor). In short, the collision would probably not have been avoided. In the circumstances, GM was solely to blame for the collision. In the event, AC’s fault was not causative and she was not to be fixed with a share of the liability for the collision simply to register the Court’s disapproval as to the manner in which she had been managed.  This last submission, however unpalatable, is of course plainly right and no more need be said of it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">Accordingly, Annexe II needed to be approached with caution and with these qualifications in mind.  Secondly, had the collision been between GM and AC on (the notional) blue or red, it would have been a less serious collision;  the angle of blow would have been less so that it “might well have been something in the nature of a glancing blow”.   Thirdly, Annexe II only applied to GM’s case that AC should have anchored to an open moor; it did not apply to GM’s case that AC should have used helm to offset her yaw to starboard.  For completeness, Mr. Teare also submitted that Annexe II had no application if his case succeeded that AC’s anchorage position was unsafe; but as I have already reached an adverse conclusion to GM on that point, no more need be said of that argument.</p>

	    <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">I begin, therefore, by treating Annexe II as no more than a good illustration of the overall situation on the various assumptions there set out.  As such, fairly considered, it strongly suggests to me that even had AC adopted an open moor, while it was <span style="font-style:italic">possible</span> that a collision would be avoided (if all concerned were lucky there might have been the closest of near-misses), the <span style="font-style:italic">probability</span> was that a collision would have occurred in any event.

	    <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">A more detailed study of Annexe II (if appropriate) points to the same conclusion. In my judgment, a collision with AC on “red” was unlikely to be avoided.  I am unable to accept Mr. Byrne’s suggestion that it is <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> with AC at the “southern extremity” of her cycle of movement that a collision was likely.   So far as concerns AC on “blue”, there is force in Mr. Byrne’s qualification that for a collision to be probable, AC needed to be in the southern side of her cycle; however, as already discussed (and as was <span style="font-style:italic">GM’s</span> case), the desired open moor contemplated a total angle of 60<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> (or more) between the anchors (“red”), rather than 30<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span> (“blue”).  In any event, to my mind, it is artificial to conduct an over-refined analysis of Annexe II; it is the overall picture which matters.</p>

It is legitimate, however, to approach Annexe II, on the assumption that starboard helm was applied (<span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, to AC on “green” in Annexe II). If so, it remains <span style="font-style:italic">improbable</span> that sufficient movement would have been achieved for a collision to be avoided.

It follows further that GM must be held solely to blame and that no question of apportionment arises. In essence, this was and remained a straightforward case of a vessel under way colliding with a very visible vessel at anchor, in broad daylight, following poor appreciation and lookout and a poorly executed turn. </p>

In deference however to the arguments advanced at trial, I record that had I thought AC’s fault (in not controlling yaw and sway) to be causative, I would nonetheless have remained of the view that the preponderance of blame lay with GM.  Whatever the failings on board AC (and in terms of ship management they were real indeed), even on this assumption, the faults of those on GM gave rise to the dangerous situation which resulted in the collision or, at the very least, played the major role in converting a passing with the potential for embarrassment into a collision. Standing back from the matter and viewing it in terms of both culpability and causation, I would have apportioned liability 90% to GM and 10% to AC; necessarily, however, this observation is of academic interest only. </p>
