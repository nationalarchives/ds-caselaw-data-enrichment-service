That aspect is not in dispute but Mr. Sarll argues that the application of s.8 of the 1911 Act was considered as being applied by reference to the rule contained in RSC O.6,r.8 and that, since there has been a radical change in the rules brought about by CPR Part 7.6 combined with implementation of the overriding objective pursuant to CPR Part 1, the application of s.190 must be applied so as to accord with the new CPR. Therefore it is no longer appropriate to approach the question of extension in the manner previously adopted and the only question for the court is whether it is just that an extension should be allowed.  </p>

However in <span style="font-style:italic">The Owenbawn</span> [1973] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 56 the application of RSC O.6,r.8 was considered but that was in the context of whether it would be proper to renew an already issued claim which had not been served in time. Brandon J observed that very similar considerations applied to whether there was an application to renew a writ or for an extension of time under s.8 of the MCA 1911. However it does not appear that he went so far as to hold that O.6, r.8 actually had any higher application than by way of analogy or that the provisions of s.8 of the MCA 1911 could only be applied in accordance with O.6,r.8 of the RSC. Furthermore in <span style="font-style:italic">The Myrto No.3 </span>[1987] 1 AC 597, which was a case concerning the extension of a writ which had been issued in time and therefore required the application of RSC O.6,r.8, Lord Brandon took the view that the rule should be interpreted as requiring a good reason to allow an extension. That does not appear to be a finding that the test in RSC O.6,r.8 should be applied to applications under s.8 of the 1911 Act <span style="font-style:italic">per se </span>but rather that the approach of the Court in the earlier cases involving applications under s.8 of the 1911 Act, requiring a good reason, should be applied to the operation of RSC O.6, r.8.  In my view this is a significant distinction because it relates directly to whether s.8 applications for an extension of time to commence a claim were or were not subject to the provisions of the RSC O.6,r.8.</p>

However since then there have been two changes. Firstly s.8 of the 1911 Act has been replaced by s.190 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and secondly the RSC have been replaced by the CPR. The Act of 1995 still requires that a claim be commenced within two years of the relevant incident causing damage and that the court, in the words of s.190(5) of the 1995 Act, “<span style="font-style:italic">may, in accordance with the rules of court, extend the period allowed for bringing proceedings to such an extent and on such conditions as it thinks fit.</span>” These words are almost identical to those contained in the Act of 1911 and are sufficiently similar to refute any suggestion that the later Act has imposed a change of the statutory regime relevant to the limitation of maritime claims including those relevant to collision. </p>

The claimant applied for an order that the time for serving the second action, which had expired on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2000, should be extended under s.190 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. David Steel J. considered that the issue was whether there had been a reasonable opportunity to serve the claim form and, upon considering the decision of Rix J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Hi Hing </span>[2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 300,  he concluded that there was an unfettered discretion to extend time subject to the express limitations set out in CPR Part 7.6 not only where, as in the case in question, the application is made after the expiry of the time limit but also after the expiration of such proceedings as were brought within the time limit. Upon an analysis of the duties of a solicitor in tracking a vessel he concluded that although <span style="font-style:italic">The Flinterdam </span> did visit Fowey in August 1999 the claimant had taken all reasonable steps to serve the claim form during the period of its validity and that the application was made with reasonable promptness. It is to be noted that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">The Al Tabith</span> was not referred to in the judgment. </p>

That was equally true of RSC O.6,r.8 and although there are references to the test relating to the application of s.8 of the MCA 1911 being the same as that applied to RSC O.6, r.8, that can only have been by way of analogy because the strict wording of the order could not apply to an application for an extension of time to issue under s.8 of the 1911 Act any more than either it or CPR Part 7.6 could apply to an application under </p>

In the Hesselmoor and The Sergeant [1951] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 150 Willmer J. reviewed the authorities and summarised their effect as being that there must be “some good and substantial reason for the exercise of the Court’s discretion in favour of allowing the action to proceed”.

In my view far from being confusing Teare J’s approach clearly recognises that the nature of the application before David Steel J., to extend time where a claim form was issued in time (which is one to which CPR 7.6 applies), and an application in which the claim form was not issued in time (as in <span style="font-style:italic">The Pearl of Jebel Ali</span> and also in the present case) are different. The last sentence of the part cited indicates that if there is a good reason nonetheless the court will still need to exercise its general discretion and that the type of considerations raised in the second express limitation of CPR 7.6, namely whether an application has been made timeously, will need to be considered. In my view the same approach should be applied to the present case. </p>

In my view this approach adds support to the purposive approach expressed by Teare J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Pearl of Jebel Ali </span>and is a strong ground for considering his approach, in maintaining the traditional test, is well founded. I also agree with Mr Karia’s observation that in <span style="font-style:italic">The Al Tabith </span>the Court of Appeal ruled on the construction of s.8 of the Maritime Convention Act of 1911 not on the construction of O.6.r, 8 of the RSC.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.04in">However there is one aspect of Mr. Karia’s submissions which gives rise to further consideration.  He submitted that “<span style="font-style:italic">The proper construction of a statutory provision such as section 8 of the 1911 Act – as re-enacted in section 190(5) – cannot change with passing revisions to the rules of the court.</span>” In the present case, it needs to be borne in mind that in both the 1911 Act and in the 1995 Act the power to extend the period allowed for bringing proceedings is to be exercised “<span style="font-style:italic">in accordance with the rules of court</span>” and although I think Mr. Karia’s argument  is sound as a general proposition of principle I have reservations where the statute specifically required that the power is to be subject to any rules of court which are to be considered applicable to it. It follows that if rules are made they can also be altered and that Parliament had that in mind when enacting the provision. I have already observed that O.6,r.8 was not a rule which directly impinged upon the operation of s.8 of the MCA 1911 and, in my view, CPR 7.6 does not do so either. However it can, I think be argued that although no rules have ever been made which apply specifically to the operation of s.8 of the MCA 1911 there can be little doubt that the ‘overriding objective’ introduced by the Part 1 of the CPR is intended to apply to all aspects of litigation and it follows that a court making a decision with respect to application of s.190 of the MSA 1995 will be expected to adhere to the requirement to deal with cases justly. However the requirement to deal with cases justly is not a new one. It was inherent in 1911 just as it is now even though in 1911 it was not stated in the rules of court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.04in">The question to my mind is whether the introduction of the overriding objective should make an actual difference to the approach previously adopted by the courts with respect to s.8 of the MCA 1911 Act or s.190 of the MSA 1995. In my view it should not because there is no basis for considering that the “good reason” approach adopted in and before <span style="font-style:italic">The Al Tabith</span> operated so that cases were dealt with unjustly or in such a way as to be incompatible with CPR Part 1, had it then existed. Even before the introduction of the CPR the judges sought to come to conclusions in accordance with their judicial oath and it would be invidious to suggest that the eminent judges who decided the pre-CPR cases referred to above were not aware of the obligation to achieve a just result. I also consider that if it had been intended to bring about a change in the court procedure it would have been possible to provide a new rule dealing specifically with the application of s.190 of the 1995 Act. The fact that no such rule has been made indicates that it was not thought necessary and/or that the approach used in s8 of the 1911 Act and s.190 of the 1995 Act type applications was acceptable. Furthermore the passage quoted from Teare J’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">The Pearl of Jebel Ali </span>demonstrates that he had the introduction of the CPR well in mind when he concluded that the same approach, as adopted with respect to s.8 of the 1911 Act, should continue to be applied to s.190 of the MSA 1995.  </p>

Murat Cornwall </span>[2000] EWCA Civ. 379 Simon Brown LJ held that 30 days was too long a delay before making the application on the basis that the application could and, reasonably should have been issued well before it was. In <span style="font-style:italic">Hart Investments v. Fuller </span>[2006] EWHC 2857 it was held that a delay of 59 days was “<span style="font-style:italic">very much at the outer limit of what could possibly be acceptable</span>”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Khan v Edgbaston Holdings </span>[2007] EWHC 2444(QB) HHJ Coulson Q.C., sitting as a deputy High Court Judge, held that an applicant has not acted promptly if he has not acted “<span style="font-style:italic">with all reasonable celerity in the circumstances</span>”.   In <span style="font-style:italic">Standard Bank v. Agrinvest International Inc</span> [2009] EWHC 1692 (Comm) Field J. held that promptness is a very important factor for the consideration of the court because there is a strong public interest in the finality of litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view the delay before issuing the application for an extension of 3 months is outside what can be regarded as generally acceptable unless there are strong grounds for excusing the delay. Having considered the witness statement of Mr. Glynn-Williams dated the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 I agree with Mr. Karia’s submission that it demonstrates that the Claimant failed to act promptly and did not demonstrate the degree of urgency required. I was particularly struck by the following: (i) there is no satisfactory explanation as to why Mr. De Ruyter’s principals thought it was necessary to instruct Dutch lawyers with respect to a collision which occurred in English waters, (ii) there is no satisfactory explanation as to why it took so long to instruct English lawyers to advise and act, (iii) it took over two months before the Claim form was issued and (iv) there is no satisfactory explanation as to why the application notice was not issued until a month later.     </p>

Thus if I had held that Mr.Sarll’s approach to the nature of the test to be applied was correct, namely that the Court should exercise a wide discretion to act fairly unhindered by the two stage test provided for in <span style="font-style:italic">The Al Tabith</span>, I do not think that it can be seriously argued that the Court should entirely disregard the evidence as to why the Claimant failed to commence proceedings in time. In my view that would be a relevant part of the background necessary for the consideration of the discretion proposed by Mr. Sarll. Had that been the correct </p>
