	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 30 January 2011 the container vessel NORDLAKE narrowly avoided a collision with the container vessel SEAEAGLE in the entrance to the port of Mumbai but very shortly thereafter collided with the Indian warship VINDHYAGIRI. No casualties were reported but at some stage after the collision a fire broke out on VINDHYAGIRI and the next day she sank at her berth in the naval dockyard. Some five months later she was salved. </p>

It is the case of the Owners of NORDLAKE that the collision was caused by the negligence of those on board SEAEAGLE and by the negligence of three Indian warships, VINDHYAGIRI, GODAVARI and a vessel described by the Claimants as the “Lead Warship”. On 29 January 2013 the Owners of SEAEAGLE brought a claim against the Owners of NORDLAKE. It is the case of the Owners of SEAEAGLE that the collision was caused by the negligence of those on board NORDLAKE and by the negligence of those on board the same three Indian warships. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This court is required to decide whether any of the allegations of navigational fault made by the Owners of NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE have been substantiated and, if there was fault by two or more vessels, apportion liability in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was at fault; see section 187 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The Union of India is not party to the proceedings in this court and so the court has received no evidence from those on board the three Indian warships. Any findings of fault and any apportionment of liability will be based on the evidence adduced by the Owners of NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE and will not be binding on the Union of India. In the <span style="font-style:italic">Bovenkerk</span> [1973] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 63 leading counsel agreed (see p.70 rhc) that if three vessels were at fault and only two were party to the action liability had to be apportioned between the three vessels pursuant to section 1 of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911, the predecessor of section 187 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The trial judge, Brandon J. (as he then was), held that the non-party vessel was not at fault and said (at p.71 rhc) that if it had been necessary for him to decide the point he would have wished to have heard further argument as to whether liability had to be apportioned between all three vessels even though one was not before the court. In his extra-judicial article <span style="font-style:italic">Apportionment of Liability in British Courts under the Maritime Conventions Act 1911</span> (1977) 51 Tulane Law Review 1025 at pp.1035-1036 Sir Henry Brandon described the question as an “open question of some difficulty”. In the present case leading counsel are also agreed that if a collision is caused by two or more vessels the court is required by section 187 to apportion liability in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in fault. I shall first consider the question of fault and, if necessary, consider the question left open by Brandon J. in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bovenkerk</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is also a counterclaim by the Owners of NORDLAKE to limit its liability (if any) to the Owners of SEAEAGLE pursuant to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. That right has not been admitted by the Owners of SEAEAGLE but no positive case that the Owners of NORDLAKE are not entitled to limit their liability has been pleaded. Since the burden is on the person challenging a right to limit to allege and prove conduct barring the right to limit it must follow that the Owners of NORDLAKE are entitled to a declaration that they can limit their liability pursuant to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. It is common ground that the amount of that limit is 6,680,800 Special Drawing Rights pursuant to the 1976 Limitation Convention and the 1996 Protocol. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The place and time of collision are common ground. The collision occurred at 1636:49 local time in position Lat.18.53.75’ N Long 72.51.43’ E. It is also common ground that the weather was fine and clear and that the tide was flooding at a rate of about half a knot. The collision occurred in a dredged channel marked on Admiralty Chart No. 2624 and used by outward and inward bound vessels to enter and leave Mumbai. NORDLAKE was outward bound and SEAEAGLE was inward bound. Other merchant vessels were at anchor to either side of the dredged channel. The Indian warships were also inward bound and were making for the naval tidal basin to the west of the dredged channel. It appears that they had been part of a large fleet of naval vessels which had been out at sea on a “family day”, when families of officers and ratings were on board the naval vessels. It is unclear how many naval vessels were involved in this activity and returning to port. There was reference in the evidence to 11, 14 and even 27 naval vessels being inbound at some stage during the day. NORDLAKE passed an anchored aircraft carrier, an anchored naval tanker and four inward bound warships (the fourth being GODAVARI) before colliding with VINDHYAGIRI.  On her inward passage SEAEAGLE overtook a submarine and VINDHYAGIRI before narrowly avoiding a  collision with NORDLAKE.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is to the credit of the parties to this action that, with the assistance of experts and NORDLAKE’s voyage data recorder, ECDIS data from SEAEAGLE, a video film of the electronic radar record of the events kept by the Mumbai Port Vessel Traffic Management System and the engine movement records from SEAEAGLE, they have been able to agree the navigation of both NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE and, to a lesser extent, the navigation of both VINDHYAGIRI and GODAVARI. They have also been able to agree a transcript of the Mumbai VTS voice recording and NORDLAKE’s VDR voice recording. The facts are therefore agreed and have been displayed on a video from which snapshots have been taken so that the position of the vessels in relation to each other at intervals before the collision can be studied.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The master of NORDLAKE was not available to give oral evidence because he was no longer employed by the Owners of NORDLAKE and they were rather late in advising him of the trial date. The master of SEAEAGLE did give oral evidence. In circumstances where the facts of each vessel’s navigation were agreed there was little which oral evidence could add. However, the cross-examination of the evidence of the master of SEAEAGLE gave him the opportunity to answer the criticisms made of his navigation. Whilst he accepted much of the factual matters put to him I considered that he might not always have fully understood the question put to him and therefore care was required in assessing his evidence. Although he appeared to me to be a witness who sought to give his honest recollection and genuine opinion as to the navigation of both SEAEAGLE and NORDLAKE, his answers were sometimes difficult to follow even with the assistance of an interpreter. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">NORDLAKE, a conventional container vessel built in 1994, 179m. in length and 25.3m. in beam, 16,202 tons gross and powered by a Sulzer diesel engine of 13,300 kW, was laden with 775 containers and had just commenced a voyage from the container terminal in Mumbai to ports in the UAE. She was drawing 9.4m. forward and 9.9m. aft. Her bridge and engine room were situated aft, the bridge being some 160m. from the bow. Three cranes serving the four holds were on the centreline.  At full ahead her speed was 14 knots, at half ahead 8.1 knots, at slow ahead 6.1 knots and at dead slow ahead 5.9 knots. On the bridge the helm and radars were situated on the starboard side of the wheelhouse because the view from the centreline was obscured by the cranes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">NORDLAKE was outbound from Mumbai. On the bridge were the master, chief officer, helmsman and pilot. The pilot was using the outboard radar (set to one and half mile range) and the master was using the inboard radar (set to 3 mile range) though he was generally on the port side of the wheelhouse. The chief officer was operating the telegraph and noting events in the bell book. He has said in his statement that he was also monitoring the inboard radar keeping an anti-collision watch using the ARPA facility. The VHF sets were switched to channel 13 for JNPT Port Control, channel 12 for Mumbai VTMS and a listening watch was also kept on channel 16. </p>

At 1614:49 or C-22 her engines were increased to full ahead and by 1615:49 or C-21 her heading was 236 degrees. At this time her speed over the ground was 9.6 knots and increasing. By 1619:49 or C-17 her speed over the ground was 12 knots. She was a little to port of the centre line of the dredged channel. </p>

So how would you like to pass?” At about 1620:19 or C-16.5 the pilot, having confirmed that she was an outbound ship, repeated her question. The warship replied “green to green, sir.” The pilot replied “You would like to pass green to green. OK. Affirmative. Confirm with all warships, I will like to pass green to green with all.” The warship replied “Yes sir, we will pass on the message to all the warships, that you will be passing green to green.”</p>

However, an analysis of the evidence before the court of “ground referenced” positions taken from the video of the VTIS radar record has enabled the navigation of VINDHYAGIRI and GODAVARI to be reconstructed, as from C-8 in the case of VINDHYAGIRI and as from C-13 in the case of GODAVARI. The resulting speeds and headings purport to have great accuracy but given their source there must be a margin of error and some caution is required.  </p>

Thus, when Regulation No.1 goes on to state that vessels are to comply with Rule 9 of the Collision Regulations it must have been envisaged that the dredged channel was the narrow channel within Rule 9.

I am unable to accept that submission. The obligation imposed by Rule 9 applies when a vessel is proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway. NORDLAKE was departing from Mumbai. The dredged channel is for the use of inbound and outbound vessels. Prior to rounding the North Karanja Buoy NORDLAKE, an outbound vessel, was certainly proceeding along the course of a narrow channel. She was obliged to keep as near to the outer limit of the channel as lay on her starboard side as was safe and practicable. She chose not to do so having agreed a green to green passing with one of the warships. As a result she approached and crossed the eastern edge of the dredged channel. She continued to follow a course almost parallel to the course of the dredged channel. In my judgment a vessel cannot claim to be free of the obligation imposed by Rule 9 in those circumstances. She is still “proceeding along the course of a narrow channel”. Any other conclusion would be unseamanlike and dangerous. Instead of a safe system in which inbound and outbound vessels navigated as near to the outer limit of the channel as lay on their starboard side as was safe and practicable there would be an unsafe system in which outbound vessels proceeded <span style="font-style:italic">either</span> as near to the outer limit of the channel as lay on their starboard side as was safe and practicable <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> just to the east of the dredged channel, precisely where they would expect to meet inbound vessels. </p>

Pursuant to Rule 2 of the Collision Regulations, those on board NORDLAKE had to have due regard to the special circumstances which had developed and, as matter of good seamanship, it was appropriate in these circumstances for them to continue with the “green to green” agreement with the Naval Convoy. The Claimants deny that they improperly used VHF as an aid to navigation and that on the facts of the case that they were in breach of rule 9 of the Collision Regulations.”</p>

Thus Part 5 of the Port Users Information deals with vessels calling at the port and provides that “final coordination and programme of vessel traffic movement will be decided by VTS (O) Mumbai.” Regulation 6 of the local regulations deals with the movement of naval vessels and states that “if vessels are in formation/convoy ………….prior information to VTS is necessary for overall coordination.” I do not consider that either reference to <span style="font-style:italic">coordination</span> by the VTS extended to directing how vessels should navigate in relation to each other or to approving how vessels should navigate in relation to each other. There is an exception to this with regard to large vessels (defined as in excess of 220m.). For example, they may only overtake other large vessels if directed by VTS (see Regulations 1 and 3). But even with large vessels there is no mention of the VTS directing them as to which side of the channel they should navigate. In my judgment <span style="font-style:italic">coordination</span> extended to such matters as the time at which vessels would enter the port rather than to navigation (see the Port Users Information Parts 3, 4 and 5). That is, it seems to me, the sense in which <span style="font-style:italic">coordination</span> is used in Regulation no.6. Since the paragraph in question follows immediately upon the paragraph which states that naval vessels “are to remain on the starboard side of channel always” it is unlikely that the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">coordination</span> was intended to empower the VTS to direct the side of the channel on which naval vessels were to navigate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">VTS discussed overtaking with SEAEAGLE at C-17. SEAEAGLE was not a “large vessel” but it is possible that the regime with regard to large vessels was in practice applied to other vessels overtaking in the channel. There was, however, silence from VTS following the agreement at about C-16.5 between NORDLAKE and one of the warships that they would pass green to green. I do not consider that one can infer from silence that VTS “implicitly accepted” that the convoy was to navigate on the western side of the channel. Given the emphasis in the local Regulations on compliance with Rule 9 it is unlikely that any seaman would infer such acceptance from silence. There was no evidence from the master or pilot of NORDAKE that they so interpreted VTS’ silence. The suggestion that VTS should be regarded as having directed the convoy to navigate on the western side of the channel or as having consented to the convoy doing so in circumstances where the VTS had not communicated with any of the vessels in the convoy to inform them of such a radical change to the application of Rule 9 is so fraught with danger that it only has to be stated to be rejected. I therefore cannot accept the submission that there were special circumstances which, pursuant to Rule 2 of the Collision Regulations, made a departure from the Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger. In any event at C-16.5 there was no immediate danger. </p>

Instead, at C-7 he informed a warship (it seems one of the three which he had passed green to green) that he would be passing green to green with all ships and he asked the warship to inform “the two – three warships on my port bow” to alter to port. The warship replied that she would pass on the message once again. But the dredged channel to the starboard of NORDLAKE was free. There was no reason why NORDLAKE should not have moved to starboard given that three vessels were ahead of her in their correct water and she was in her wrong water. At C-6 it seems that the pilot appreciated that his intended course of action was impractical. He said to the pilot on SEAEAGLE in Hindi that he did not think passing green to green with the warships ahead of him was possible. Yet NORDLAKE continued to navigate in her wrong water. It was not until about C-5 that NORDLAKE reduced her engines to slow ahead. At about the same time her pilot asked GODAVARI how she would like to pass. Although GODAVARI requested to pass green to green the pilot of NORDLAKE said that she must alter to starboard and GODAVARI agreed to pass red to red. NORDLAKE maintained her course and did not alter course to starboard. She did not alter course to starboard until after GODAVARI was passing NORDLAKE red to red. </p>

Nor was his further improper use of VHF at C-7 a special circumstance which justified a departure from Rule 9.

He said SEAEAGLE was now about half a point on his port bow at a distance of between half and one mile. When GODAVARI passed down the port side of NORDLAKE at about C-2 SEAEAGLE was distant about one and half cables. This evidence suggests that the master’s lookout with regard to SEAEAGLE was not good and that he only paid attention to SEAEAGLE at about C-2. In fact it would appear that he appreciated the presence of SEAEAGLE a little earlier at about C-2.5 when, in response to the pilot on SEAEAGLE saying that he was “going more to port”, the master shouted “No.” Nevertheless I find that the master’s lookout with regard to SEAEAGLE was poor from C-14 until C-2.5.</p>

Indeed, had a careful lookout been kept visually or by radar the master would have observed that the bearing of VINDHYAGIRI from NORDLAKE remained constant from C-8 until about C-0.5, a clear sign of a risk of collision. The master never appreciated this.</p>

The standard of his lookout must therefore be inferred from what is known of the navigation of NORDLAKE. The pilot was aware of SEAEAGLE at about C-6 when he called her by VHF. At this time SEAEAGLE was distant a little more than a mile and fine on the port bow of NORDLAKE. The pilot said that he would be passing the warships green to green but added that he did not think that was “possible”. Although the question was asked by the pilot of SEAEAGLE there was no discussion as to how the two merchant ships would pass. Some 2 and half minutes at or a little before C-3.5 the pilot of SEAEAGLE suggested that the vessels pass green to green and the pilot of NORDLAKE agreed. When at C-2.5 the pilot on SEAEAGLE said that he was “going more to port” the master of NORDLAKE shouted “No” and the pilot said “Go more to starboard.” This suggests that until C-2.5 the pilot, like the master, had not appreciated that a green to green passing would require SEAEAGLE to cross ahead of NORDLAKE. He may well have been aware that caution was required because he reduced the engines of NORDLAKE to dead slow ahead at about this time but the reactions of the master and pilot clearly show that they had not appreciated the real danger of collision. Thus the pilot, like the master, cannot have been keeping a good lookout with regard to SEAEAGLE.</p>

He did not however have a conversation with her. At C-7 he informed a warship that he could see “two-three warships on my port bow”. One of those must have been VINDHYAGIRI. He requested that the warships be asked to alter to port. VINDHYAGIRI did not alter her heading to port until somewhat later. The pilot’s statement to the pilot of SEAEAGLE at C-6 that he did not think it “possible” to pass the warships green to green suggests that he appreciated that they had not moved to port to permit a green to green passing and the reduction of his vessel’s engines to slow ahead at C-5 suggests that he was aware of the need for caution. But had a good visual or radar lookout been kept the pilot would have appreciated that the bearing of VINDHYAGIRI from NORDLAKE did not appreciably alter and that there was therefore a risk of collision. There is no indication that the pilot ever appreciated this. He certainly did not alert the master to the risk because he only became aware of VINDHYAGIRI after a collision with SEAEAGLE had been narrowly avoided. I infer that the pilot had not appreciated the risk of collision with VINDHYAGIRI. If he had done so he would surely have informed the master of the risk before C-1. So I must conclude that the pilot did not keep a good lookout with regard to VINDHYAGIRI. </p>

SEAEAGLE was aware of NORDLAKE (which was about 2.75 miles distant) and that she intended to pass the naval vessels green to green. GODAVARI was making about 2 knots over the ground. It was in these circumstances that SEAEAGLE requested permission to pass her on her starboard side.</p>

To reduce her speed to the minimum at which steerage way could be maintained required SEAEAGLE to stop her engines. That is because at dead slow ahead her speed was 8.7 knots and her minimum steerage way was 4 knots. Thus the criticism of SEAEAGLE’s agreement to overtake is necessarily bound up with the criticism of her speed. As it was put in counsel’s closing submissions SEAEAGLE ought to have “waited behind” the two naval vessels.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider this suggestion unrealistic. SEAEAGLE’s engines were at slow ahead and had been so since C-21. Even with her engines at slow ahead she was making good over 8 knots over the ground whereas the naval vessels were proceeding at a much slower speed. Overtaking the naval vessels was a natural step to take in those circumstances and the VTS expressly approved such a manoeuvre. There was no cause at C-16 to stop her engines. Counsel for NORDLAKE referred to the Elder Brethren’s advice with regard to NORDLAKE that she ought to have reduced her speed at C-16 or after as there was a close quarters situation developing. It was suggested that there was a lack of consistency in their advice to the court. But the positions of the two vessels are not comparable. NORDLAKE was in her wrong water and SEAEAGLE was in her correct water.  The reason why a close quarters situation was developing was because NORDLAKE was in her wrong water. Notwithstanding that, NORDLAKE’s engines at C-16 were at full ahead causing her to make in excess of 12 knots over the ground. By contrast SEAEAGLE’s engines were already at slow ahead at C-16 causing her to make 8 knots or more over the ground. </p>

That was a candid answer and was relied upon by counsel for NORDLAKE in support of their submissions. But it does not appear that the master succumbed to commercial pressure.  At C-12, when SEAEAGLE agreed to overtake GODAVARI, NORDLAKE was distant almost 3 miles. Her engines were at slow ahead. There was no cause then to stop engines. As the master said when cross-examined “we have still a safe distance and I can control my engine………we are still running on a slow speed”. This was, in my judgment, prudent. It was not a decision of a master succumbing to commercial pressure. By contrast, at C-7 when SEAEAGLE did stop her engines, NORDLAKE was about 1.4 miles distant.  The master said in cross-examination that his engines were stopped at that time because he was worried about NORDLAKE. He wanted “slow movement on to avoid collision” and “time to alter the course to starboard or to port”. This was, it seemed to me, a prudent decision at C-7 and manifestly not that of a master succumbing to commercial pressure.  </p>

Counsel for NORDLAKE submitted in their comments on the advice of the Elder Brethren that the master had accepted that proposition. I am not sure that he did. I suspect that his answer “yes, my Lord” (before making a point about the speed of NORDLAKE) meant no more than he noted the suggestion made. At the time counsel may also have thought so because the master was said to have “carefully avoided answering the question”. In any event keeping astern of the naval vessels when they were proceeding at a slower speed than SEAEAGLE would be expected to achieve even with her engines at dead slow ahead was unrealistic. </p>

However, the suggested criticism of SEAEAGLE must take account of the circumstances in which SEAEAGLE found herself after having agreed to overtake GODAVARI on her starboard side, something which counsel’s submission failed to do. Given that SEAEAGLE was already about 2 cables beyond the dredged channel to the east and that there were vessels anchored in the anchorages to the east of the dredged channel I do not consider that SEAEAGLE can fairly be criticised for not altering her course to starboard.</p>

This criticism must take account of the circumstances in which SEAEAGLE found herself at the time, something which counsel’s submission did not do. By C-5.5 GODAVARI was about a cable to the east of the channel and was on the starboard bow of SEAEAGLE. It was in these circumstances that SEAEAGLE agreed to GODAVARI’s request to be overtaken on her port side. I do not consider that SEAEAGLE can fairly be criticised for agreeing to the suggestion in those circumstances. It was suggested in cross-examination that in circumstances where GODAVARI had not gone to port when there was an agreement to overtake her on her starboard side SEAEAGLE ought not to have relied upon her to go to starboard. The master replied that GODAVARI “is going to starboard”. The expert’s video shows that GODAVARI had indeed moved further to starboard away from the dredged channel. It is true that shortly afterwards GODAVARI altered her heading to port but, as the master emphasised in his evidence, the engines of SEAEAGLE were stopped so that he could monitor the position and decide what to do. I therefore do not consider that SEAEAGLE can be blamed for agreeing to overtake her on her port side. </p>

Given the respective speeds of the vessels overtaking was the natural step to take for SEAEAGLE. The conversation in which VINDHYAGIRI told SEAEAGLE that she could overtake on her starboard side took place about half a minute after NORDLAKE had informed another warship that she wished to pass all warships green to green. If that conversation was heard by VINDHYAGIRI it may well explain her request to be overtaken on her starboard side. But even if that wish had not been expressed (or heard by VINDHYAGIRI) the request to be overtaken on her starboard side would not have been a fault. It is more likely than not that at C-16 SEAEAGLE was approaching from the starboard quarter of VINDHYAGIRI and so a request to be overtaken on her starboard side was the natural choice. </p>

It is unsurprising that in those circumstances the Elder Brethren advised that NORDLAKE ought to have reduced her speed. By contrast VINDHYAGIRI was in her correct water and was probably proceeding at a slow speed (6 knots was suggested by the master of SEAEAGLE for the convoy but VINDHYAGIRI’s speed may well have been less).

If the warship which agreed a green to green passing with NORDLAKE and said that it would pass on the message to the warships in the convoy did so it is likely that VINDHYAGIRI, if she had been keeping a good aural lookout, would have heard such message. However, at C-16.5 NORDLAKE was probably 4 miles or more ahead of VINDHYAGIRI. Moreover, being a naval vessel. VINDHYAGIRI was obliged by Local Regulation No.6 “to remain on the starboard side of channel always.” I do not consider that hearing the green to green message at C-16.5 required VINDHYAGIRI to navigate on the western side of the channel. Even if VINDHYAGIRI heard the later message from the warship at C-7 to alter to port I do not consider that she was obliged to alter course to port to navigate on the western side of the channel. To do so would be a breach of Rule 9 of the Collision Regulations and Regulation 6 of the local regulations. For the same reason I do not think that observation of the three warships ahead passing green to green with NORDLAKE required her also to navigate on the western side of the channel.  Such an observation would have been an unsure foundation on which to decide not to comply with the narrow channel rule.

(I deal below with the suggestion that she ought to have heard and acted upon the conversation between SEAEAGLE and VINDHYAGIRI at C-2.5). Finally the regulation provides that such vessels must communicate effectively with merchant vessels by identifying themselves. VINDHYAGIRI did so at C-16 when speaking to SEAEAGLE and at C-1 when speaking to NORDLAKE. On both occasions she identified herself as “Warship Foxtrot 42”. It may be that this form of identification may not always be sufficient but it does not appear that there was in fact any doubt as to who was speaking to whom.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient to take both of these allegations together. Had a good visual or radar lookout been kept by VINDHYAGIRI from C-8 those on board her would have concluded that there was a risk of collision with NORDLAKE. She was already proceeding at a slow speed (though she may have increased speed between C-5 and C-3) and could not alter course significantly to starboard whilst SEAEAGLE was overtaking her. It is said that had a good aural lookout been kept on VHF VINDHYAGIRI would have learnt at C-2.5 that NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE were passing red to red. The conversation at that time was confusing. When asked by SEAEAGLE whether NORDLAKE wanted to pass port to port NORDLAKE responded “No, green to green”. After the VTIS had intervened to clarify matters NORDLAKE replied: “Yeah, yeah, port to port” (though the transcript added that that was not clear). I am not persuaded that this conversation, to which VINDHYAGIRI was not party, was one on which that vessel could safely base its navigation. Between C-1.5 and C-1 she altered course significantly to port and increased her speed. Such action was designed to take her across to the western side of the channel and was therefore a fault. If the presence of SEAEAGLE on her starboard bow prevented her from altering course to starboard she ought to have put her engines astern and taken all way off. The fact that she did not do so and instead ported and attempted to cross ahead of NORDLAKE suggests that she had not been keeping a good lookout.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was alleged that another warship, described by counsel for NORDLAKE as the “Lead Warship,” was also at fault. The “Lead Warship” was the warship with whom NORDLAKE communicated and agreed a green to green passing at C-16. In addition that warship agreed to inform the other warships of the NORDLAKE’s wish to pass them green to green. It is said that the Lead Warship failed to inform the other warships of that wish and failed to instruct them prior to C-11 to move to the western side of the dredged channel. The agreement by this warship to pass NORDLAKE green to green was in breach of the narrow channel rule and was a fault. However, good seamanship cannot require one naval vessel to advise other naval vessels that NORDLAKE wished to pass them green to green in breach Rule 9 of the Collision Regulations and Regulation 6 of the local rules. </p>

The causative faults all occurred at and after C-8. Thus the causative breach of Rule 9 was at C-8 when NORDLAKE had vessels ahead of her fine on her port bow, including VINDHYAGIRI at a distance of about 1.5 miles, and none to starboard. She then failed to stop her engines and to proceed with caution. Her causative breach of poor lookout was from at least C-8 when she failed to appreciate a clear risk of collision. It may be that her failure to navigate at a safe speed was the result of her poor lookout. All three faults were causative in that the breach of Rule 9 brought about a close quarters situation and her unsafe speed and poor lookout exacerbated the damage at collision. </p>

At C-16.5 VINDHYAGIRI was of the order of 4 miles distant. At C-8, when VINDHYAGIRI was about 1.5 miles distant, NORDLAKE’s clear duty pursuant to Rule 9 of the Collision Regulations was to go to the starboard side of the dredged channel.

In their action the Owners of SEAEAGLE  seek a judgment pursuant to which they seek to hold the Owners of NORDLAKE liable for the damage to NORDLAKE and VINDHYAGIRI. In those actions both NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE are entitled to require, pursuant to section 187, that their liability for such damage “shall be in proportion to the degree in which each ship was at fault.” Unless account is taken by the court of the degree in which VINDHYAGIRI and GODAVARI were at fault the proportions in which NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE are held liable for the damage will exceed the degree in which NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE were at fault. That would be contrary to section 187. My understanding of that section therefore, in circumstances where the damage to NORDLAKE and VINDHYAGIRI has been caused by the fault of  NORDLAKE, SEAEAGLE, VINDHYAGIRI and GODAVARI, is that, when giving judgment in the two actions which have been commenced in this court, the court must take into account the degree to which VINDHYAGIRI and GODAVRI were at fault in addition to the degree in which NORDLAKE and SEAEAGLE were at fault. Of course the court cannot give judgment against VINDHYAGIRI and GODAVARI to make good the damage in proportion to the degree in which those vessels were at fault because those vessels were not party to either action before the court. </p>

It will assist all who have to consider such matters. His understanding and knowledge of how liability for damages in collision cases was in practice assessed was gained at a time when almost every week there was a collision action in the Admiralty Court, unlike the present time when, perhaps because voyage data recorders and other electronic devices have almost eliminated the need for a trial, there are few such trials. In his article Sir Henry Brandon described the proposition that both culpability and causative potency must be taken into account as “the true principle of law applicable” (see pp.1031-2). Whilst there were no universal rules with regard to the assessment of culpability or causative potency he identified (“on the basis of practical experience of apportionment in numerous cases over many years”) certain broad lines of approach which can be used when apportioning liability (see pp.1037-1041).

Sir Henry Brandon said that it may be helpful (as indeed subsequent Admiralty judges have found, see the extract from <span style="font-style:italic">The Samco Europe and MSC Prestige</span>) to consider, in cases where a clear preponderance of fault has been established, whether the degree of fault of the ship more to blame is one and half times as great, or three, four, five or even more times as great as the degree of the fault of the ship less to blame. “There is however no single correct approach to the problem.”</p>

But GODAVARI was aware that VINDHYAGIRI was on her port quarter and SEAEAGLE was aware that VINDHYAGIRI was abaft her beam to port. Each knew that NORDLAKE was approaching VINDHYAGIRI. In those circumstances the faults of GODAVARI and SEAEAGLE which distracted NORDLAKE’s attention from VINDHYAGIRI were culpable but to a very much lesser degree than those of NORDLAKE and to a significantly lesser degree than those of VINDHYAGRI.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the degree of NORDLAKE’s fault was at least three times as great as that of VINDHYAGIRI and the degree of VINDHYAGIRI’s fault was significantly greater that that of each of GODAVARI and SEAEAGLE. Apportionment of blame between four vessels is unusual and perhaps unprecedented. No other example of it was brought to my attention. I have sought to weigh the faults of each vessel separately and to apportion liability for the damage caused by the collision between NORDLAKE and VINDHYAGIRI in proportion to the degree in which each of the four vessels was in fault. I have also borne in mind that apportionment of liability must necessarily be done “somewhat broadly”.  Indeed, this must inevitably be so when apportioning liability between four vessels; such an exercise is difficult when each share of liability must be relative to each of the other three and tends to produce unusually precise percentages suggesting that the exercise has a precision which it cannot in reality possess. My apportionment of liability is as follows: 60% to NORDLAKE, 20% to VINDHYAGIRI, 10% to GODAVARI and 10% to SEAEAGLE. </p>
