	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A TURTLE was a semi-submersible drilling platform or rig which had been laid up at Macae, about 150 nautical miles north of Rio de Janeiro, for a number of years. MIGHTY DELIVERER was a “pusher” tug which had also been laid up for a long period. She was brought out of apparent retirement in 2006 to tow A TURTLE to Singapore via Cape Town pursuant to the terms (as amended) of the standard form of towage contract known as TOWCON. Unfortunately for all concerned the tug ran out of fuel in the South Atlantic. The towage connection was released and A TURTLE drifted away from the tug. She was later found on the shores of Tristan da Cunha. Salvage attempts failed and the wreck of A TURTLE was later removed from Tristan da Cunha and dumped at sea.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this action the owners of A TURTLE claim damages from the owners of MIGHTY DELIVERER for the loss of the rig and associated wreck removal expenses. The damages are estimated to be in the region of US$20m. The owners of the tug deny that they are liable for the loss of the rig and, if they are liable, seek to limit their liability to a sum estimated to be about US$1.6m. pursuant to the 1976 Limitation. They also have a counterclaim for 95% of the agreed freight in the sum of US$1,871,500 (5% having been earned on signing TOWCON and paid). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The rig, which had been built in England in 1967 for use in the North Sea, was supported on 20 vertical columns of about 25m. in height which stood below water on four 75 metre long cylindrical pontoons. By reason of having been laid up the underwater structure of the rig had acquired substantial marine growth. </p>

In February 2006 Arusha sold the rig to A Turtle Offshore Inc. of Panama for a total price of US$5m. “as is, where is” in Macae, Brazil. Clause 18 of the MOA provided as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The tug was built in Savannah in 1981 as a pusher tug, that is, she was designed for use in tug-barge combination units. Her length overall was 50.91m with a moulded beam of 16.16m. Her summer draft was 8.69m. She was powered by B&amp;W diesel engines of 15,200 brake horse power. She required heavy fuel oil and gasoil (or diesel oil). The latter was required for use in a boiler to pre-heat the heavy fuel oil. As a pusher tug she had a high superstructure (to permit visibility over a long barge) and lacked a flared bow. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">She was previously known as UNBELIEVABLE and had been purchased in or about February 2005 by Superior Trading Inc. (“Superior”) of the Marshall Islands. She was directed to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic for “reactivation” but as there was no dry dock there she could only be temporarily classed with the Panama Classification Society. She then towed a floating dry dock from the USA to Brazil and proceeded to Rio de Janeiro to undertake a complete reclassification process with the Russian Register towards the end of 2005. That process was completed in February 2006.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no evidence that the bollard pull was tested as part of the reclassification process. The TOWCON Part 1 Box 18 stated that the certificated bollard pull of the tug was 180 tons. A bollard pull certificate issued by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping dated 31 March 2006 stated that the pull of the towing winch was 1770 kn which, I was told, equated to a bollard pull of 180.5 tonnes. There is common ground that that was probably the maximum bollard pull. The tug’s continuous bollard pull was stated by Noble Denton in their survey of the tug dated 18 February 2006 as 152 tonnes. It was common ground that that was probably arrived at by a “rule of thumb” calculation of dividing the continuous 15,200 bhp of the engine by 100. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The same survey report stated that the speed of the engines was 180 rpm. However, at trial it was common ground that this was mistaken and that the engine speed is likely to have been in the region of 100-120 rpm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The length of the tow line was stated in the survey report to be 870 m. In the Bollard Pull Certificate it was stated to be 900m. However, the entry in TOWCON made by Mr. Bush said that it was 700m. During the towage no more than 720m. was paid out and there is no evidence of any complaint from the master that he was unable to use the full length of the tow line. It is therefore unclear what the length of the towline was. What seems clear however is that there was no more than 720m. of available towline. If more had been available it would have been used.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The commercial managers of the tug are Bush Shipping Services Limited (“Bush Shipping”) whose chief executive is Mr. Philip Bush. He describes himself as a tug operator. In addition to MIGHTY DELIVERER he appears to manage or operate other tugs, including RUBY DELIVERER (owned by Bluebottle Navigation Inc.) and CHAMP (owned by Rushmore Marine). Bush Shipping have an office in London but there is a small staff, namely, Mr. Bush and his two daughters. Bush Shipping were also the agent for Arusha Shipping Ltd.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The technical managers of MIGHTY DELIVERER were a Greek company Seawave Maritime Inc. (“Seawave”). However, Seawave ceased to be the technical managers in about July 2007 as a result of a dispute with Bush Shipping. This dispute led to a number of tugs operated by Bush Shipping, including MIGHTY DELIVERER and RUBY DELIVERER, being arrested and sold in South Africa.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Apart from a towage procedures document and some e-mails there was no evidence from Seawave. It is likely that this was because of the disputes which later developed between Bush Shipping and Seawave. Thus there was little evidence from the technical managers of the tug. There was also no evidence from the master of MIGHTY DELIVERER, Captain Sarafanov. It is not clear why the tug owners were unable to adduce even a statement from him. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The only factual witness tendered by the tug owners was Mr. Philip Bush. He had some factual evidence to give but not much. That was because he was in London (save for a routine visit to Brazil). No doubt because there was no evidence from Seawave Mr. Bush sought to give an account of the preparation for the towage and of the towage itself notwithstanding that he had little personal knowledge of the material events. Such evidence as he did give was not reliable. For instance, with regard to the preparation for the tow he referred to Seawave’s calculations as to speed and passage time to Cape Town and asserted that Noble Denton was satisfied, on the basis of such calculations, that the tug’s bunker capacity was sufficient to enable the tug to arrive at Cape Town at the speed range assumed. Yet there were no such calculations of Seawave in evidence and Mr. Bush did not profess to have seen any such calculations. He was also prepared to make statements which documents he had received from Seawave did not support. For example, although Seawave had informed him on 23 May 2006 that the last visual contact with the rig had been on 10 May 2006 he was prepared to say without explanation that visual contact was lost on 16 May 2006. With regard to the notification to the authorities that the towage connection to the rig had been released he was prepared to state that “all relevant information was conveyed to the maritime authorities at Cape Town and the Tristan da Cunha administration”. But he did not explain why the authorities were only informed on 23 May 2006 when the rig had been released on 30 April 2006.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Counsel suggested that there was no need to give prompt information because the rig was in a remote area. I do not accept this explanation. Mr. Bush did not suggest that he need not give immediate notice of the release because the rig was in a remote area. An unmanned rig adrift in the South Atlantic was a clear danger to shipping even if the area was remote. In any event, the relative proximity of Tristan Da Cunha demanded that notice be given to the Tristan da Cunha authorities. </p>
	      </authorialNote> Further, Mr. Bush said that all relevant information had been conveyed when in fact Bush Shipping had given an untrue account of the circumstances in which the rig had been released. When asked about this in cross-examination, and about his failure to advise the rig owner promptly of the disconnection, he had no explanation. The probable explanation, in the absence of any other explanation, is that he did not wish to reveal to the rig owner that the tug had run out of fuel, fearing that this would bring criticism upon the tug owners. Finally, there are two e-mails dated 22 February 2006 and 29 March 2006 sent by Bush Shipping which, as will become apparent, are important in understanding what happened in the preparation for the voyage and during the voyage. Mr. Bush referred to neither in his statement. Having regard to all these matters I am forced to conclude that Mr. Bush’s evidence was unreliable and that I could not accept it unless it was corroborated by contemporaneous documents or was inherently probable. </p>

Various explanations were canvassed in evidence. An engine problem was suggested, but no such problem was reported by the master. It may have been because the tug was pitching heavily, a consequence of the lack of a flared bow. Mr. Bush gave evidence that the tow wire tended to come out of the water causing the master to proceed at reduced revolutions. However, Mr. Bush’s source of information was not stated and was not apparent. The master did not say this in his daily reports. Both parties’ experts agreed that it was difficult to envisage snatch loads or the towline coming out of the water at 78 rpm. I therefore do not accept Mr. Bush’s evidence on this matter.</p>

However, the ETA of 6 May was 54 days away. This information, just one week into the towage to Cape Town, therefore indicated  that further bunkers would need to be taken on board somewhere in the South Atlantic. </p>

However, the average speed over the voyage, as recorded in the log on 22 March 2006, was just 2.02 knots. The ETA at Cape Town remained 6 May 2006 at an average speed of 2.2 knots.

However, it appears from the terms of that e-mail that RUBY DELIVERER was engaged on a service involving a platform called VINAR and arrangements had to be made for CHAMP, another tug managed by Bush Shipping which was then off Oman, to take over RUBY DELIVERER’s role in the VINAR service. Mr. Bush made clear in that e-mail that the viability of RUBY DELIVERER being able to render effective assistance depended upon RUBY DELIVERER being released quickly from the service involving VINAR.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By 10 April 2006 A TURTLE and MIGHTY DELIVERER were in serious difficulties. The speed of the tug’s main engine had been reduced to 42 rpm. There is no direct evidence as to the reason for this. It is probable that the master of the tug decided that he must conserve such fuel as he had since he had insufficient fuel to reach Cape Town. As a result the tug was unable to make headway. Although she was seeking to steer a course she was in fact being towed by A TURTLE in other directions. Thus between 10 and 17 April 2006 the course steered was recorded in the daily reports as 105 degrees but the way made good was variously described as 145, 355, 325, 300, 160, 175 and 170 degrees. On some days the flotilla was going backwards; 25 nautical miles on 13 April, 68 nautical miles on 15 April 2006 and 49 nautical miles on 16 April 2006. The master ceased to give an ETA for Cape Town. On 19 April 2006 the main engine had been stopped for the cleaning of a filter. It appears that during that time, although the towline was out to 680 metres, the distance between tug and tow was only 250 metres, suggesting a very deep catenary. When the engine was restarted only 35 rpm were achieved. On 28 April 2006 the master recorded that for the last 24 hours the way made good had been 120 degrees and he observed that Tristan da Cunha was 148 miles distant, bearing 157 degrees. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is a remarkable feature of this saga that neither Bush Shipping nor Seawave informed the rig owner that the towage connection had been released. On 3 May 2006 Bush Shipping advised the rig owner that “the rig and tug are basically drifting in order to ensure that the tug does not run out of fuel oil.” They further advised that RUBY DELIVERER was expected to arrive on about 9 May 2006 to take over the tow and allow MIGHTY DELIVERER to return to Cape Town for bunkers and cleaning of her turbo charges. On about 12 May 2006 Mr. Bush’s daughter sent an e-mail to the rig owner advising that RUBY DELIVERER was to meet up with MIGHTY DELIVERER and that a full report of the “hook up and onward journey” would follow. Mr. Bush suggested that this was a reference to a connection with the rig being re-established. I doubt that that was intended. If it was intended there had in any event been no clear statement by Mr. Bush to the rig owner that the connection to the rig had been released. On 20 May 2006 Mr. Bush sent an e-mail saying that after the arrival of RUBY DELIVERER and completion of bunkering operations on 17 May 2006 “the tugs went towards the position of the rig and since that time there has been no sign of the rig on the radars of either tug.” This e-mail did not state that the towage connection had been released almost three weeks earlier. Indeed, as is apparent from an e-mail dated 23 May 2006 from the rig’s underwriters, they were left with the impression that the disconnection had occurred as part of the bunkering operations. </p>

She left on 15 April to rendezvous with CHAMP and to deliver stores to her. Having done so, and having stood off Durban in view of bad weather RUBY DELIVERER re-entered Durban on 19 April. It is not clear why. Mr. Bush suggests it was to take on board gas oil but no mention of that is made in the tug’s log. She left on 21 April.  By 23 April her ETA at MIGHTY DELIVERER was said to be 7 May. Her log recorded that she was proceeding to High Sea. But she met heavy weather and suffered storm damage to her deck causing sea water to enter her fuel tanks. She was then instructed by Seawave to proceed towards Cape Town. She arrived in Cape Town on 27 April. It would seem that repairs were carried out (though no repairs are mentioned in the tug’s log) and she left for MIGHTY DELIVERER on 1 May.</p>

In his oral evidence he said the refinery in Cape Town had been “down for repairs”. However, this had not been mentioned in his written statement. It is surprising that there were difficulties in obtaining diesel oil in a port such as Cape Town. Mr. Bush said that he had stemmed or ordered bunkers in Cape Town but that they proved not to be available. Remarkably there were no documents disclosed evidencing such stemming. Had they been stemmed there would surely have been some documentary record. It is also to be noted that Mr. Bush made no mention in his statement of the heavy weather damage sustained by RUBY DELIVERER and the need to have repairs carried out in Cape Town. I therefore do not accept that bunkers were stemmed in Cape Town. If there had been a difficulty in obtaining bunkers because of problems with the refinery in Cape Town this would surely have been mentioned in Mr. Bush’s statement but it was not.

The rig owners called Captain Holloway and the tug owners called Captain Hammond.

Captain Holloway said that he would avoid bunkering in the southern seas in winter. He said that if it were proposed, and he were a warranty surveyor, he would throw it out. The activity of bringing two vessels alongside in such seas would be fraught with danger and he would never accept it. Captain Hammond agreed that he would not plan to take fuel en route. </p>

The latter expressed the opinion, based upon what Mr.Wells had said as to the likely horse power to be utilised when pulling the rig with a “deep” draft, that the tug was likely to achieve 72 rpm. Mr. Bush said he would like this to be rechecked “as the consumption will be critical.” Mr. Wells is also recorded as saying that the “tow should proceed at 2.5/2.75 knots less weather and current.” Thus, far from corroborating the evidence of Mr. Bush, this e-mail, sent at about the time the tug was being bunkered, suggests that Noble Denton, and possibly Seawave, considered that a speed of less than 3 knots was likely to be achieved, before taking weather and current into account. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When cross-examined Mr. Bush said that Mr. Theophanatos, a surveyor at Noble Denton, had mentioned a speed of 3-4 knots in 2005 when Noble Denton had considered trim and stability calculations with regard to the rig. He said that he did not go back to Noble Denton in 2006 to ask if their estimate of speed remained good. With regard to the e-mail dated 22 February 2006 (which he had not mentioned in his written statement) he said that, having sent the e-mail to “George” at Seaway, George told him that the comments of Noble Denton in that e-mail were based upon a towing draft of the rig of over 17m. whereas the towing draft was in fact 14.2m. It was therefore of no concern to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an improbable account. Firstly, Noble Denton stated in their Report on the proposed towage that when they had checked the stability and motions of the rig in 2005 it was agreed to tow the rig at a draft of about 14m. Secondly, the ballast condition for the towage prepared by Noble Denton and dated 10 February 2006 stated that the draft was 14.2m. Thirdly, the question of consumption was “critical” and therefore one would have expected that, had Mr. Bush been informed that Noble Denton had assumed an incorrect draft, he would have gone back to Mr. Wells and required a revised speed estimate. Mr. Bush did not say that he did and there is no documentary evidence that he did. Fourthly, it is difficult to see how or why “George” would have known that Mr. Wells had a draft of 17m. in his mind when speaking to Mr. Wells.  Fifthly, if this was known to “George” one would have expected that it would have been known to Mr. Tsihlakis as well. Yet instead of making that point Mr. Tsihlakis expressed the opinion that the likely rpm would be 72. </p>

The e-mail shows that at about the time that the tug was being bunkered for the towage Noble Denton had advised Mr. Bush that the speed of the towage “should” be 2.5/2.75 knots without allowing for weather and current. I am persuaded that I must reject Mr. Bush’s evidence that Noble Denton estimated the fair weather speed for the towage at about 3-4 knots.</p>

There is evidence from the log that 180 tonnes of diesel oil were taken on board. It is likely that there was some on board before bunkering began. The daily report for 4 March recorded that 195.6 tonnes of diesel oil were on board. It is unclear how much fuel oil was taken on board. No figure is stated in the log. Mr. Bush states that 1,140 tonnes were taken on board. That figure cannot be verified because the invoice on which it is likely to have been based is illegible. But he was correct in saying that 180 tonnes of diesel oil were taken on board. The daily report for 4 March states that 1203 tonnes were on board. Ordinarily there would be no reason to doubt this figure. However, the daily reports for 20 and 21 March 2006 evidence a reduction in fuel oil from 950 tonnes to 740 tonnes. That reduction is unexplained because the daily consumption was about 20 tonnes. The reduction suggests the possibility that less than 1203 tonnes were taken on board. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are other indications that the tug did not bunker to her full capacity. Firstly, the mean or amidships draft on 26 February 2006 after completion of bunkering was 8.57m., which was less than the tug’s summer draft. Secondly, Noble Denton’s survey report dated 18 February 2006 states that the tug’s bunker capacity was 1600 tonnes of fuel oil and 200 tonnes of diesel oil which would suggest that more fuel oil could have been taken on board. (The same report suggests figures for quantities on board on 18 February. However, these are difficult to accept. It is stated that she had 1068 tonnes of fuel oil and 212 tonnes of diesel oil on board <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> bunkering.) An e-mail from Mr. Bush dated 10 February 2006 states that the fuel oil capacity was 950 tonnes and the diesel oil capacity 250 tonnes which would suggest that more diesel oil could have been taken on board. Thirdly, Mr. Bush stated in his oral evidence that instructions from the local authorities based upon environmental restrictions prevented the tug from loading to full capacity. But this was not mentioned in his statement and is not corroborated. I do not accept that there was an environmental restriction though of course the tug could not load beyond her load line marks; but the amidships draft does not suggest that she had reached her marks. However, Mr. Bush’s evidence suggests that the tug’s bunker tanks were not filled to capacity.  </p>

With 196 tonnes of diesel on board the tug had, at a rate of 3 tonnes per day as stated in the TOWCON, sufficient diesel oil for 65 days. The actual consumption during the voyage was about 3.5 tonnes per day. At that rate the  bunkers were only sufficient for 51 days, allowing for the 5 days reserve.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Basic calculations of this type suggest that Bush Shipping or Seawave, one or both of whom decided to proceed with the tow, must have done so in the expectation, however such expectation was formed, that the towage would achieve a speed of 3-4 knots. (At a speed of about 3 knots the towage to Cape Town would have taken about 45 days.) That is because it is improbable that they permitted the towage to commence without an expectation that the tug and tow would reach Cape Town and any such expectation required the towage to make 3-4 knots. Moreover, later events are consistent with that having been their expectation. Thus on 7 March 2006 Bush Shipping informed the rig owner that the towage would commence at low main engine revolutions and then, at the manager’s direction, power would be increased until “the optimum speed” was achieved. On 9 March 2006 Seawave gave instructions that rpm be increased to 80.  It seems likely that Bush Shipping and/or Seawave expected that a greater engine speed than the 72 rpm mentioned in the e-mail dated 22 February 2006 could be achieved, sufficient to enable the towage to proceed at 3-4 knots. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, if Bush Shipping and Seawave expected a speed of 3-4 knots it does not appear that such expectation was based upon any reasonable grounds. There is no evidence that Seawave or Bush Shipping carried out the sort of careful analysis which both experts agreed should have been done. Had this been done both Captain Holloway and Captain Hammond agreed that the required towing power to pull the rig ought to have been assessed (including the “resistance” of the rig) and such required power ought then to have been compared with the tug’s bollard pull. The required calculation is described in Noble Denton’s guidelines at section 12.2 and is referred to in paragraph 9.4 of the IMO Guidelines for Safe Ocean Towing. It was common ground at the trial that if that had been done the likely “towline pull required” (having regard to the rig’s resistance which does not appear to have been calculated) would have been of the order of 180 tonnes and that the likely bollard pull of the tug (it was not measured when the tug was reclassed) was, at most, 130 tonnes. There was a dispute as to whether the likely bollard pull was as low as 97 tonnes. But that dispute was not material because the disparity between a required pull of 180 tonnes and a bollard pull of 130 tonnes was sufficient to indicate a lack of power on board the tug. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In those circumstances, and having regard to the importance of ensuring that the tug and tow would reach Cape Town without refuelling, there ought to have been a very careful assessment of the likely speed and duration of the voyage to Cape Town in order to see whether Noble Denton’s fair weather estimate of 2.5-2.75 knots could realistically be improved upon. Consideration would then have to be given to the likely weather and appropriate weather routing. Yet, as agreed between the experts, the tow procedures issued by Seawave on 2 March 2006 provide no reference to fuel capacity, fuel consumption or fuel range. There is no reference to the likely speed of the tow, the likely duration of the towage to Cape Town, or the sufficiency of bunkers. At paragraph 5.5 it merely notes the towage distance to Singapore (9250 nautical miles) and the likely passage time based upon speeds varying from 2.5 – 5 knots. There is no suggestion in the towage procedures that any proper attempt had been made to assess the likely speed.  If there had been such an attempt it is likely that some reference to it would be found there. But there is none and I must therefore conclude that no proper attempt to assess the likely speed was made. </p>

Moreover, it was contrary to views expressed by Mr. Wells of Noble Denton as recorded by Mr. Bush in his e-mail dated 22 February 2006.  It follows, subject to a point to be discussed in the following paragraphs, that the tug owners failed to exercise due diligence to ensure that the tug carried sufficient bunkers and was therefore seaworthy and fit for the towage in breach of Part II clause 13 of the TOWCON.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Captain Hammond expressed the opinion that Noble Denton had failed to investigate with sufficient care the adequacy of the tug’s fuel supplies. On the evidence available in this action (which did not include any statements from Noble Denton) there is support for that criticism. Whilst the e-mail dated 22 February 2006 shows that Mr. Wells of Noble Denton addressed the question of speed and consumption on or before that date there was no evidence of what if any further investigations or checks were made between then and 5 March when Noble Denton approved Seawave’s towing procedures. It appears that Noble Denton approved the towage procedures without drawing attention to the omission in Seawave’s towing procedures of any consideration of the likely speed and duration of the towage and the sufficiency of the tug’s fuel supplies. Neither the certificate approving the towing procedures dated 5 March 2006 nor Noble Denton’s report dated 23 March 2006 suggested that consideration had been given to the likely speed of the tow, the likely duration of the voyage or the sufficiency of bunkers. It was not suggested that the representations made by the tug owners and recorded in the certificate as to bollard pull and the fitness of the tug to undertake the tow could explain this omission.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

By the time the TOWCON had been agreed on 27 February Noble Denton had certified that the tug was suitable for the proposed towage. That approval having been granted it appears that the rig owner was content to agree to the TOWCON. However, one of the agreed terms was clause 13 which obliged the tug owners to exercise due diligence to tender the tug in a seaworthy condition and in all respects ready to perform the towage.

It is true that Arusha (for whom Bush Shipping acted) as seller of the rig was obliged, pursuant to clause 18 of the MOA, to prepare the rig for tow “in all respects as per their discussions with the Rio de Janeiro office of Noble Denton” and that Superior (for whom Bush Shipping also acted) as owner of the tug was obliged, pursuant to clause 44 of the TOWCON, to prepare and trim the tow and make the connection to the tug to the standards required to obtain from Noble Denton the towing approval certificate. But neither obligation can, in my judgment, detract from the obligation of Superior, pursuant to Part II clause 13 of the TOWCON, to exercise due diligence to ensure that the tug had sufficient bunkers for the towage to Cape Town and was therefore seaworthy and fit for the towage. </p>

There is nothing in those circumstances which enables Superior to say that its own analysis of the bunker question was approved by Noble Denton, an acknowledged expert on the subject of towage procedures, and that therefore it had exercised due diligence to ensure that the tug had sufficient bunkers. That is because the evidence in this case does not reveal that Seawave or Bush Shipping made any proper analysis of the bunker question. In any event the obligation under Part II clause 13 is personal to the tug owners and cannot be delegated to another. If the tug owners had considered themselves to be unable to assess such matters as the tow’s resistance, the required towing power, the available bollard pull and the likely achievable speed and in consequence instructed an expert in towage procedures to advise them, they would still be in breach of their duty under Part II clause 13 if that expert failed to carry out a proper analysis. They cannot be in better position if, instead of instructing their own expert, they chose to rely upon the approval by Noble Denton of the tug and of Seawave’s towage procedures, which themselves contained no proper analysis of the bunker question. </p>

It was said that this must have been apparent at an early stage, by about 13 March, and that the tug owners’ duty of best endeavours required it either to return to South America or, if it was certain that additional bunkers could be supplied by another vessel en route, to carry on to rendezvous with that vessel. It was said that in breach of its duty of best endeavours the tug owner made arrangements for RUBY DELIVERER to supply bunkers in circumstances where it was uncertain whether RUBY DELIVERER could do so before MIGHTY DELIVERER ran out of bunkers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that a time came when it must have been apparent to the tug owners that the tug would run out of bunkers before reaching Cape Town and that action was accordingly required. That time can have been no later than 29 March 2006 when it is known that Mr. Bush was actively considering the diversion of RUBY DELIVERER. Indeed, Mr. Bush’s oral evidence would suggest that it must have been earlier because he said that he had given instructions to RUBY DELIVERER on 26, 27 or 28 March. By that time the master’s efforts to increase speed had been made. Whilst the daily speed had reached 2.6 knots on 22 March the average speed on that day was still only 2.02 knots. The daily speed fell thereafter. I do not consider that the tug owners’ duty of best endeavours required it to take action on 13 March. The tug master was still seeking to increase speed and he succeeded in doing so to some extent. But by a day or so after 22 March, when the average speed remained at just over 2 knots despite the increase in daily speed, it must have been apparent that the desired speed of 3-4 knots was not going to be achieved and that alternative action was required.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Bush states that he sought to obtain the services of a tug in South Africa but none was available. In his statement he said that he spoke to Godfrey Needham (a tug broker based in South Africa) who advised him that there were no tugs in the area available to undertake the task of supplying bunkers to MIGHTY DELIVERER. In his oral evidence he elaborated on this account by saying that he had been in discussions with Marint and London Offshore, two firms of tug brokers. He said that they referred him to Geoffrey Needham. He also said that he checked on available tonnage in Brazil and West Africa. It is remarkable that no document was disclosed evidencing such enquiries. Counsel said that this was not surprising given that the result of the enquiries was that no tug was available. However, the situation in which Mr. Bush found himself was very serious indeed. If Mr. Bush made enquiries of Marint, London Offshore or Geoffrey Needham I would expect there to be some documentary record of them and their results. I accept that there would be telephone discussions as well but I have real difficulty in accepting that Mr. Bush would confine himself to telephone enquiries and not send out enquiries of tug brokers by e-mail as well. He would have wanted to be certain that all possible tug brokers responded to his enquiries. Equally, I have real difficulty in accepting that no tug broker replied by e-mail to Mr. Bush’ enquiries. Even if they had no tug available to fit whatever time-scale Mr. Bush had in mind a tug broker is likely, by reason of the nature of his trade, to send to Mr. Bush a list of tugs which might be available, albeit later than requested. The absence of a single e-mail or telephone note evidencing enquiries by Mr. Bush of tug brokers suggests that no such enquiries were made.</p>

At the time she was engaged on a service to another rig, VINAR, in northern Madagascar. She had to be released from that and the tug chosen to take over, CHAMP, had to come from off Oman. There can have been no certainty that RUBY DELIVERER would be released in time. In the event she did not arrive until 15 May.

By 29 March 2006 the tug and tow were, as indicated by the marked chart put in evidence, about one third of the way across the South Atlantic. There was no dispute that she had sufficient bunkers to return to Brazil. Mr. Bush said in his oral evidence that he considered sending the tug and tow back to Brazil but rejected it because he said he had been told that the rig could not go back. This was a reference to a statement by the port captain at Macae before the rig left, reported to Mr. Bush by his agent in Rio De Janeiro, that the rig would not be permitted to return. However, Mr. Bush accepted that there was no discussion at that time as to whether the rig would be permitted to return in an emergency and he did not suggest that he had any further discussions on the subject when the problems with the towage developed. Both experts agreed that it was unlikely that the tug and tow would have been denied entry in an emergency. </p>

The tug’s bunkers could then be replenished. In commercial terms this would be very costly for the tug owners but they had a duty to exercise their best endeavours to perform the towage. The tug owners are entitled to take into account the cost of returning to South America in deciding what action to take pursuant to their duty of best endeavours. But they must also take into account whether there is any viable alternative course of action. If there was no tug available in Cape Town to proceed to MIGHTY DELIVERER with bunkers the only other alternative method of assisting MIGHTY DELIVERER was to despatch RUBY DELIVERER from Madagascar but in circumstances where it was not known whether and if so when she could be released from her existing commitment. In my judgment, in those circumstances the tug owners’ duty of best endeavours required that the expense of returning to South America be borne by the tug owners. That is because the alternative course of action risked the tug running out of bunkers and having to release the connection to the rig in the South Atlantic as winter approached.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Captain Holloway expressed the opinion that the tug master ought to have prepared for the need to release the towage connection by boarding the rig when the swell conditions permitted and switching on the rig’s EPIRB (an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) which Mr. Bush believed to have been on board the rig and the rig’s deck lights. It was suggested by counsel (though not by Captain Hammond) that this was no more than hindsight. In my judgment, such was the danger facing the rig that I consider that the boarding of the rig to switch on the EPIRB (if there was one and the tug master knew of its existence) was a step which the tug master ought to have taken. I am not confident that switching on the deck lights falls into the same category because it would be necessary to reboard the rig from time to time to ensure that the rig’s generator was supplied with fuel. However, whilst the position of the rig might have been capable of being tracked by means of the EPIRB it seems to me to be no more than speculation to suggest that the grounding would have been prevented. It is known that the rig was aground on 7 June 2006 but it is not known when she first took the ground. The location of the grounding was one of Tristan da Cunha’s most inaccessible stretches of coastline. It would be necessary to show that at some stage after 17 May 2006, when RUBY DELIVERER had met up with MIGHTY DELIVERER and supplied her with diesel oil, the tugs would have located the rig and taken her in tow before she grounded. No attempt was made to prove this.</p>

What is known is that RUBY DELIVERER towed MIGHTY DELIVERER towards Cape Town and then to Dakar, a considerably greater distance than Cape Town. That would suggest that RUBY DELIVERER had the capacity to search for longer and then return to Cape Town. MIGHTY DELIVERER had 40 tonnes of diesel oil and 215 tonnes of fuel oil on 17 May, having received diesel oil from RUBY DELIVERER. Diesel oil and fuel oil would have been consumed in the search. Some diesel oil would have been left, perhaps over 20 tonnes. However, this would not have been much. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that by calling off the search when they did the tug masters can be criticised.

Although the tug owners knew, prior to the completion of bunkering, that Noble Denton considered that the likely speed was between 2.5-2.75 knots in fair weather, they assumed that the towage could and would take place at an average speed of 3-4 knots. However, they had no proper basis for so assuming. In those circumstances there was a risk that the tug might not in fact have sufficient bunkers for the towage to Cape Town. The tug owners must have thought that they could avoid that risk by increasing the speed of the tug’s main engines from the 72 rpm discussed on 22 February to a speed which was sufficient to enable tug and tow to make good a speed of 3-4 knots.  </p>

Clause 18 was intended by the parties to identify which of them was to bear the risk of the various types of loss, damage and liabilities set out in the clause. That is apparent from the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">The following shall be for the sole account of</span>…<span style="font-style:italic">without any recourse to…</span>”. Further, the allocation of risk was on a no fault basis. That is apparent from the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">whether or not the same is due to breach of contract, negligence or any fault</span>” and from the words “<span style="font-style:italic">howsoever caused</span>”. The provisions of clause 18 in the TOWCON are very similar to the provisions of clause 18 of the TOWHIRE form of contract. In <span style="font-style:italic">Alexander Tsavliris &amp; Sons v OSA Marine Limited</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">The Herdentor)</span>, an unreported decision dated 19 January 1996, Clarke J. described clause 18 of TOWHIRE as containing a “code apportioning liabilities between the parties.” In <span style="font-style:italic">Smit International v Josef Mobius</span> [2001] CLC 1545 Morison J. described clause 18 of TOWHIRE as a “crude but workable allocation of risk and responsibility.” I consider that the commercial purpose of clause 18 is to make clear to the parties which one of them is to bear the risk of the loss, damage and liabilities which might arise during the towage and enable each to insure against them.  </p>

It is said that consideration of such a case shows that there is a limit on the apparently wide words of clause 18. Although those are not the facts of the present case this question has to be addressed because it is contended that if there is such a limit the events of the present case are sufficiently extreme to fall within it. It is therefore necessary to consider whether there is a limit to the wide words of clause 18 and if so whether the facts of the present case fall within that limit. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The words used in clause 18 are of such wide ambit that, construed literally, the owner of the tow must take for his sole account any damage whatsoever suffered by the tow. Thus if the tug owner chose to disconnect the tow and to abandon it at sea in order to perform a more lucrative towage contract and in consequence thereof the tow was lost, that loss would appear to be for the sole account of the owner of the tow and the tug owner would be exempted from liability for his failure to exercise his best endeavours to perform the towage. However, contracts are not construed literally but, as it has been put in the past, with regard to the main purpose of the contract or, as it is now frequently put, in the context of the contract as a whole. Thus, however wide the literal meaning of an exemption clause, consideration of the main purpose of the contract or of the context of the contract as a whole may result in the apparently wide words of an exemption clause being construed in a manner which does not defeat that main purpose or which reflects the contractual context; see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Mitsubishi v Eastwind Transport (The Irbenskiy Proliv)</span> [2005] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. at paragraphs 28-34 per Ian Glick QC and, for a recent summary of the general principles of contractual construction, see <span style="font-style:italic">Pratt v Aigaion Insurance</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 1314 at paragraphs 9-12 per Sir Anthony Clarke MR. </p>

One may safely say that the parties cannot, in a contract, have contemplated that the clause should have so wide an ambit as in effect to deprive one party’s stipulations of all contractual force; to do so would be to reduce the contract to a mere declaration of intent.  To this extent it may be correct to say that there is a rule of law against the application of an exceptions clause to a particular type of breach. But short of this it must be a question of contractual intention whether a particular breach is covered or not and the courts are entitled to insist, as they do, that the more radical the breach the clearer must the language be if it is to be covered. ………………No formula will solve this type of question and one must look individually at the nature of the contract, the character of the breach and its effect upon future performance and expectation and make a judicial estimation of the final result.”</p>

As a result of the tugs’ negligence the tow, a schooner, had been taken into a bay at night, the tugs had gone aground and the towage connection parted.  The tugs subsequently refloated and left the bay. The schooner drifted onto rocks and became a constructive total loss. The tug owner had sent another tug to assist but cancelled the order believing, erroneously, that the Salvage Assistance had sent tugs to the assistance of the schooner. The towage contract exempted the tug owner from “the acts, neglect, or default of the masters, pilots or crews of the steam tugs………..or any damage or loss that may arise to any vessel or craft being towed, or about to be towed, or having been towed………..whether such damage arise from or be occasioned by any accident or by any omission, breach of duty, mismanagement, negligence, or default of the steam tug owner, or any of his servants or employees.” At first instance it was held that the clause was as wide as possible and protected the tug owner from his failure to continue to carry out his contract by sending assistance to the schooner. On appeal it was held that the clause did not protect the tug owner from liability for that failure. Lord Sterndale said at p.468:</p>

In other words, I think the exception extends to cover a default during the actual performance of the duties of the contract, and not to an unjustified handing over of those obligations to some one else for performance.”</p>

Whilst the wide words of clause 18 are literally capable of applying to such a radical breach I do not consider that clause 18, if it is to be construed in the context of the TOWCON as a whole and to give effect to the main purpose of the TOWCON, is fairly susceptible of only one meaning, namely, that it applies however radical the breach. The words, when read in the context of the TOWCON as a whole, are also susceptible of applying so long as the tug owners are actually performing their obligations under the TOWCON, albeit not to the required standard. That ensures that the obligations of the tug owners are more than a mere declaration of intent. My approach to the construction of clause 18 therefore reflects the approach of Lord Sterndale in <span style="font-style:italic">The Cap Palos</span> notwithstanding that the clause in that case was differently worded and was not a mutual allocation of risk clause.</p>

But they had not ceased to do anything at all in the performance of their obligations.

However, they did not seek to perform that obligation. The tugs simply left the scene and the tug owners made no attempt to send another tug. Mr. Bush later said, by e-mails dated 5 and 12 June 2006, that as far as the tug owners were concerned they were relieved of all further obligations after 22 May 2006. That was wrong. The tug owners’ obligations had not come to an end on 22 May 2006. Had the tug owners’ failure to perform their obligations after 22 May been an effective cause of the grounding and subsequent loss of the rig the tug owners would not in my judgment have been protected by clause 18. But it was accepted that that could not be established. At most it was said that a chance of finding and recovering the rig had been lost. But that, as I have said, was no more than speculation.

It was said that if the freight provisions were construed in the manner which I have indicated Part 1 clause 40 will have added nothing to Part II clause 2. I agree that on my construction of the freight clauses that is so and that one would perhaps expect an additional clause to the standard form to add something to it. However, repetition or surplusage is not unknown in commercial contracts and in any event the words used in clause 40 are not capable of meaning that the freight, notwithstanding the provisions of Box 32, will be due and payable on the loss of the rig or tug.  It was suggested that there was a conflict between Box 32 and clause 40 and that Box 32 must yield to clause 40. But I do not consider that there is any such conflict. It was also suggested that there should be implied a term to the effect that the freight was due and payable on the loss of the rig or tug. But such a term would be contrary to the expressly agreed Box 32 and so cannot be implied.  </p>

In that way he would not take the risk of not earning the freight by reason of the loss of the rig or tug before arrival. He made this intention tolerably clear in his e-mail dated 20 February. When Kennedy Marr passed the-email on that was made very clear. However, the rig owners did not reply in the terms which had been sought. Instead they offered a term to the effect that the freight was deemed earned tug lost or not lost and they offered to add the freight to the rig’s insurance. This reply did not state that the freight would be earned on shipment and payable on arrival. Nevertheless it was acceptable to Mr. Bush so long as the clause also referred to the loss of the rig and the tug owners were named as “joint insured in respect of the amount due under the towcon”. The rig owners accepted the reference to the loss of the rig and confirmed that “insurance policy will bear the name of tug owners up to usd1.97 mill”. That figure was the total lump sum freight. </p>

On 23 February the rig owner proposed a loss payable clause in respect of 95% of the lump sum freight. That was acceptable to Mr. Bush. But he returned to his request that the freight be earned on sailing though payable on arrival; “we must clarify that the freight is deemed earned on sailing and payable as agreed on arrival at Singapore.” This need for clarification confirms that such terms had not yet been agreed and further that it had not been agreed that the terms which had been agreed bore the meaning now suggested by the tug owners. There was no response to the request for clarification. It follows that there was no agreement as to the meaning of the words used in clause 40.</p>

I have read the correspondence relied upon. It evidences an offer to pay US$500,000 in settlement. It does not evidence the suggested admission. Mr. Bush considers that Mr. Robert Tsai, on behalf of the owner of the rig, agreed to pay $500,000 on account at a meeting. It seems that there was a discussion about making such a payment but I am not satisfied that Mr. Tsai made an admission of liability in respect of the balance of the freight such that the rig owner is now to be prevented from defending the claim. Indeed, the suggested “admission” was not developed in this manner either in written or oral argument. </p>

If it was lost after such termination then, even on the tug owners’ construction of clause 40 the balance was never earned. </p>

The tug owners’ case was that the rig was lost on 22 May 2006 when the tugs called off the search and proceeded back to Africa; alternatively it was lost on 7 June 2006 when it was found ashore on Tristan da Cunha; and in the further alternative it was lost by 1 July 2006 when it should be assumed that the rig owner had formed the view that the rig was a constructive total loss. The rig owner’s case as presented in argument was that the rig was lost when it became apparent that she was a constructive total loss. That was at some stage between 25 July and 15 August 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The rig was actually lost in February 2007 when she was dumped at sea. However, by 15 August 2006 the underwriters had accepted that the rig was a constructive total loss. By this time salvage efforts had failed and the rig was ballasted down for the winter. The rig doubtless sustained damage not only on  grounding but also over the subsequent days and weeks as she lay aground. But quite when the rig had suffered so much damage as a result of grounding and/or of lying aground that the costs of refloating her and bringing her to a safe place exceeded her value is not known. The rig owners have not disclosed any documents which enable this question to be answered. It is possible that the rig was a constructive total loss immediately after grounding, notwithstanding that attempts were made to salve her. Indeed the rig owners have pleaded that the damage suffered by the rig as a result of grounding meant that the rig was a constructive total loss. In the absence of documents from the rig owners concerning the assessment of the damage suffered by the rig and in the light of the rig owners’ own pleading the only finding which I can make on the meagre material before me is that the rig became a constructive total loss on or about the date on which she grounded, which must have been on or before 7 June 2006. That is to be distinguished from the date on which it was possible to form a judgment that she was a constructive total loss which was no doubt later, probably in late July or early August 2006. </p>

By their e-mails dated 5 June and 12 June the tug owners had renounced their obligations under the towage contract. On 13 June the rig owner said that the tug owners were not entitled to “walk away” from the rig. The rig owner advised that it was negotiating with a salvage company for the recovery of the rig. It was said that that amounted to an acceptance of the tug owners’ renunciation of the towage contract. I agree. Although the earlier part of the e-mail reserved the rig owner’s position as to the right of the tug owners to walk away from the rig and to rely upon clause 18 it seems to me that the rig owner’s conduct in engaging salvage assistance was only consistent with a recognition that the contract was at an end. If it were not at an end they would be relying upon the tug owners to engage salvage assistance pursuant to their obligation to exercise best endeavours to perform the towage contract.</p>

But, by Part II clause 18 of TOWCON, the losses caused by that grounding are for the sole account of the rig owner and the tug owners are exempted from liability for such losses. </p>
