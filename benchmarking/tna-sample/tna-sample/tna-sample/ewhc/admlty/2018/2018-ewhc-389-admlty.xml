	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties appear before the Court on the hearing of the Defendants’ application (i) to set aside an antisuit injunction granted by Knowles J on 25 April 2017, and (ii) to stay the Claimants’ claim in this action (the “Claim”) on <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens </span>grounds.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claim arises from a collision (or allision) on 23 February 2017, in which the Defendants’ VLCC “JAG LAADKI”, collided with the Claimants’ LNG carrier “AL KHATTIYA” at high speed, in a designated anchorage off Fujairah, while the “AL KHATTIYA” was lying stationary at anchor taking on supplies.  The collision caused substantial damage to the “AL KHATIYYA”. She proceeded to the N-Kom repair yard in Ras Laffan, Qatar where that damage was repaired. Those repairs have now been completed and the “AL KHATIYYA” is back in service.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As will appear, the Defendants now accept that they are 100% to blame for the collision (as would appear to have been inevitable at all times given the facts identified above).  In consequence this considerably limits the issues that can arise in relation to this dispute, specifically the only matters that can arise in relation to the Claim are matters of quantum, a point of significance in the context of the application for a stay on <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens </span>grounds. In the light of the admission of liability, and should I dismiss the Defendants’ application for a stay, I am invited to direct that judgment be entered against the Defendants, with damages to be assessed by the Admiralty Registrar in the usual way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants are a Marshall Islands company operated in Qatar and wholly owned by Qatari interests. The Defendants are an Indian company with a large fleet of tankers trading worldwide, and in consequence they are, in that sense, present in almost all countries in the world. The Claimants founded jurisdiction for their claim against the Defendants in England <span style="text-decoration:underline">as of right</span> by serving the <span style="font-style:italic">in rem </span>Claim Form on the “JAG POOJA”, a sister ship of the “JAG LAADKI”, at Milford Haven on 22 March 2017. The right to found jurisdiction in this manner by serving on a vessel is a well-known and important feature of maritime law, which is applied around the world and is embodied in Article 1 of the 1952 Collision Jurisdiction Convention. As will appear, the fact that the Claimants have founded jurisdiction in this Court as of right has important consequences in the context of the application of the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] AC 476 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada”</span>), and the burden of proof in the context of the question of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants’ claim is for around US$ 30 million. It is apparent that the Defendants will seek to contest the quantum of the damages recoverable from them (which in large part consist of the costs of the repair and loss associated with the loss of use of the “AL KHATTIYA” during the time the repairs were being carried out).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Part of the backdrop to the action, and the proceedings that the Defendants have commenced in Fujairah (as addressed below), is the respective tonnage limitation regimes in the UK and the UAE. The UK is a party to the 1976 Limitation Convention as amended by the 1996 Protocol.  Based on the tonnage of the “JAG LAADKI”, the applicable limit in the UK at the present time is around US$ 53.5 million, well in excess of the Claimants’ claim. The UAE is a party to the unamended 1976 Limitation Convention.  Under that Convention, the applicable limit is around US$ 14.7 million. The UAE also applies a domestic limitation regime, in Article 141 of UAE Federal Maritime Law No. 26 of 1981, under which the applicable limit is around US$ 5.4 million.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is accordingly self-evident that the tonnage limitation regime in the UK is more favourable to the Claimant, whereas that in the U.A.E. is more favourable to the Defendants. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this regard on or about 4 April 2017 the Defendants issued two petitions (effectively urgent applications) before the Fujairah Court (the “UAE Petitions”), seeking to constitute a limitation fund under the 1976 Convention. After a number of hearings the Fujairah Court ultimately held that it could not determine the issues concerning the establishment of the limitation fund by way of a petition. The Defendants then commenced two sets of substantive proceedings:-</p>

If the Defendants were to be successful, they could then attempt to use the machinery in Article 13 of the 1976 Convention to prevent the Claimants from enforcing any judgment they obtained in this action in any 1976 State Party, otherwise than against that limitation fund.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">In case number 370/2017 (the “UAE Limitation Action”), commenced on 11 May 2017, the Defendants sought to limit their liability in respect of the collision to the amount provided for by the 1976 Convention and to determine the amount of their liability, if any, up to those limits. If they were to succeed, they could then attempt to rely upon the Fujairan judgment by way of <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> in this action or in any other proceedings which the Claimants brought to enforce an English judgment elsewhere.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Judgment at first instance was given in both cases on 11 December 2017. The Fujairah Court rejected both cases on the basis that the provisions of UAE law which give effect to the 1976 Convention do not apply to claims arising out of collisions. In the UAE Fund Action, the Court also held that a limitation fund could not be established because of the lack of any formal rules or regulations to govern the establishment of such a fund in the UAE. The Defendants’ claims were accordingly dismissed in each of these cases. Accordingly, subject to any successful appeal, there will be no extant proceedings in the UAE going forward.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant is, however, appealing against the judgments in both claims. The Defendants submit that the first instance judgments are wrong asserting that collision damage falls within the category of “damage to property” which is expressly covered in the 1976 Convention and the enacting provisions of UAE law, and asserting the absence of regulations does not prevent the establishment of a fund. The evidence before me is that the appeals are expected to be finally determined by the end of September 2018. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants do not dispute that the Defendants are entitled to attempt to establish a limitation fund in Fujairah. However on 4 April 2017, shortly after the Claimants had founded jurisdiction in England as of right, the Defendants commenced an action in Fujairah claiming damages from the Claimants and their commercial managers (and beneficial owners) QGTC, and a declaration of non-liability, arising from the collision (“the UAE Liability Action”).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants submit that that claim was hopeless, and that it was not properly arguable that the Defendants were entitled to the relief which they claimed in the UAE Liability Action and submit that the Defendants must have been aware of that at the time. Put simply it must have been obvious from the start, and before the UAE Liability Action was commenced, that the Defendants as owners of the “JAG LAADKI” were 100% to blame for the collision on the facts as I have already identified – with the “JAG LAADKI” colliding with a stationary vessel at a designated anchorage. As Andrew Baker J put it in his judgment on an earlier disclosure application, the “JAG LAADKI” “crashed into” the “AL KHATTIYA” that was, as it were, minding its own business, lying stationary at a designated anchorage, taking on supplies. I consider the Claimants to be right in these submissions.</p>

The grounds for that application were that the UAE Liability Action was vexatious and oppressive, and that the English court had sufficient interest in or connection with that action to justify granting the injunction.

It is however of importance to remember that each party will seek to establish the existence of certain matters which will assist him in persuading the court to exercise its discretion in his favour, and that in respect of any such matter the evidential burden will rest on the party who asserts its existence. Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in this country (see (f), below).</span>

Furthermore, there are cases where no particular forum can be described as the natural forum for the trial of the action. Such cases are particularly likely to occur in commercial disputes, where there can be pointers to a number of different jurisdictions (see, e.g., </span>

I can see no reason why the English court should not refuse to grant a stay in such a case, where jurisdiction has been founded as of right. It is significant that, in all the leading English cases where a stay has been granted, there has been another clearly more appropriate forum - in </span>

	      <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">In my opinion, the burden resting on the defendant is not just to show that England is not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum.

I may add that if, in any case, the connection of the defendant with the English forum is a fragile one (for example, if he is served with proceedings during a short visit to this country), it should be all the easier for him to prove that there is another clearly more appropriate forum for the trial overseas. </span>

This being so, it must usually be difficult in any particular case to resist the conclusion that a Court which has jurisdiction on that basis must also be the natural forum for the trial of the action.

These are familiar arguments that any court is well able to deal with.  The “AL KHATTIYA” was not repaired in Fujairah, and Fujairah has no connection with the repairs (which were carried out at a yard in Qatar). There is also an issue as to whether the “AL KHATTIYA” was suffering a pre-existing design defect – the factual (and expert) aspect of that issue also has nothing to do with Fujairah either.</p>

The majority of the former would have to be translated into Arabic (at considerable expense) and there would be the obvious risk of a loss of nuance in such translations. In contrast, as the Claimant point out, there would be no such need for everything to be translated into Arabic, and all relevant witnesses could attend in London to give evidence if damages are assessed in England. I bear such points in mind, but equally, take care not to regard the features of any one legal system as preferable to those of another.

Secondly, if any question of foreseeability or remoteness did arise (which seems inherently unlikely given that the claim is one for costs of repair and loss of use of a vessel), the court would have to apply a test which was materially identical to that which English law applied to negligence claims before <span style="font-style:italic">The Wagon Mound (No.2)</span> [1967] 1 AC 617, and which it continues to apply to other types of tort claim.</p>

In any event what MEH states in the final sentence of paragraph 11 of his report seems identical to the position under English law. Secondly, the Defendants rely on evidence that where damage has been caused by a claimant’s own fault the quantum of damages is reduced at the discretion of the judge, and a similar principle may apply where the loss is caused or contributed to by a third party. Such principles would appear to be similar, if not materially identical, in their effect to familiar principles of English law in relation to apportionment of liability / contributory negligence, mitigation of damage and causation. However even were that not so, and there was any point of difference, it would no doubt be a straightforward task for the experts to identify any relevant difference, and for an English court to apply the same.</p>

However the Claimants accept, for present purposes, that UAE law is as described on behalf of the Defendants by MEH and Mr Dwyer. As so described UAE law is not materially different to English law.  One issue is whether the Claimants have caused or contributed to the losses by unnecessarily increasing the cost and duration of the repairs. This is denied by the Claimants. Such question is likely to turn on the factual and expert evidence. Even if there is found to be any substance in this allegation, as stated above, there would not appear to be any material difference between UAE law and recognised English law principles such as apportionment of liability / contributory negligence, mitigation of damage and causation.

This point arises from a provisional view of the Defendants’ expert, M <span style="color:#000000">Brosseau</span>, based on the inspection he conducted of the “AL KHATTIYA” at the N-KOM repair yard, and on his experience, that the vessel probably had a pre-existing defect in the bonding of a drainage channel within the tanks, which exacerbated the water damage which she suffered as a result of the collision.  The Defendants contend that, under English law, this alleged pre-existing defect would not affect the Claimants’ recovery, because of the rule that a tortfeasor takes his victim as he finds him.  They contend that, under UAE law, the position <span style="text-decoration:underline">might</span> be different, and that a local judge <span style="text-decoration:underline">might</span>, in his discretion, decide to disallow some part of the Claimants’ recovery.</p>

It would be neither possible nor appropriate for me to determine whether a defect exists on a jurisdiction challenge. It is likely to turn on factual and expert evidence. However if I assume that the defect did exist, there would remain the question of how likely it would be that it would have made any difference.  As the Claimants point out, the factual premise underlying this allegation is that but for the alleged bonding defects, the drainage channels which ran around the bottom edges of the affected cargo tank (and which are just a few inches high and open at the top) would have successfully diverted a flood of water of some 1,000 litres, which rushed into the tank under pressure of a 10 metre head. They submit that this is inherently unlikely. In contrast, M Brosseau maintains that absent a defect such waterflow would have been contained. I cannot determine that dispute. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am also satisfied that in commencing the UAE Liability Action the Defendants were acting vexatiously and oppressively. In that action the Defendants claimed damages from the Claimants and their commercial managers (and beneficial owners) QGTC, and a declaration of non-liability, arising from the collision.  It was not properly arguable that the Defendants were entitled to the relief sought. From the time of the collision itself it would have been obvious to anyone, including the Defendants, that they were 100% to blame for the collision and that the Claimants were under no liability to them.  They must have known that they were not entitled to the relief sought. At no stage have they advanced any legitimate justification for seeking the relief sought, and justice did not require that those proceedings be allowed to continue.  I do not need to rule on motives for the Defendants’ conduct that have been suggested by the Claimants. The fact is that the UAE Liability Action proceedings were self-evidently hopeless (as would any other such proceedings commenced then or now), and served no legitimate purpose. They were also separate from any attempt to limit which was the subject of a separate petition and subsequent separate proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also submitted that there was a failure, on the Claimants’ part, to draw the attention of Knowles J to the <span style="font-style:italic">Albaforth</span>, or those collision cases that had referred to it in the context of collisions in territorial waters or more generally, on what was effectively an <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte </span>application (albeit that the Defendants were on notice, and did put a letter before the Court). I consider that there is nothing in this point in the circumstances of this case. First, Mr Dodds in his first statement had made clear that the tort was committed in Fujairan waters, and he addressed why Fujairah was nevertheless not the appropriate forum, and so the learned judge was alerted to any significance of the location of the tort. Secondly, as a Commercial Court judge, Knowles J would have been well aware of the potential significance of this factor. Thirdly, I do not consider that any failure to make specific reference to <span style="font-style:italic">The Albaforth </span>justifies criticism. Very many of the collision cases relied upon by the Defendants do not do so either – it is the location of the tort that is relevant. Fourthly, even had it been considered preferable to have referred to <span style="font-style:italic">The Albaforth, </span>I do not consider that the failure to do so amounted to a failure to make full and frank disclosure, or that in all the circumstances it would be appropriate to discharge the injunction on such basis.</p>
