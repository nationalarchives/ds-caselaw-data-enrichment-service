In that respect the Defendant relied upon correspondence between themselves and one Mr Dennis Tuijnman of Akzo Noble in the Netherlands which I understand to be a part of the group which includes International Paint. This correspondence was included in the evidence placed before me.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">In June 2010 the Claimant was considering purchasing the vessel and asked Mr Godding to provide a pre-purchase survey. The vessel is a Freeman 32 motor cruiser, built in 1972 of GRP. She is powered by twin Thorneycroft diesel engines. From the photograph of the vessel supplied to the court it can be seen that she is fully decked with accommodation forward and aft of a centre cockpit. She thus appears to be a vessel which is suitable for seagoing, coastal, estuarial or inland cruising, subject to being fitted with an appropriate anchor, navigation and lifesaving equipment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">On about the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2010 the Claimant contacted the Defendant by email and asked whether the Defendant would provide a rough price for carrying out “<span style="font-style:italic">full osmosis treatment</span>” to the vessel. The Defendant, probably acting by Ms Harman at that stage, responded that they could provide such a quotation after an inspection of the vessel. At that stage I do not think there is any doubt that the Defendant was a company which held itself out as performing work to repair osmotic damage to a vessel and that the Claimant understood that to be the case. In fact by her email dated the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2010 Ms Harman referred to osmosis treatment and stated that:”<span style="font-style:italic">We are skilled in this treatment . . . we will try and give you an indication of the cost involved in treatment; - To remove </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> previous coatings by sand blasting, grinding out blisters, filling with an epoxy filler and applying 3 to 4 coats of gelcoat.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Mr Godding prepared and provided to the Claimant a pre-purchase survey on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2010. The relevant findings in that report state: “<span style="font-style:italic">On the exterior of the hull below the waterline I removed random areas of anti-fouling paint, I inspected the surface and metered for moisture absorption.

There are now blisters in the paint and in the gelcoat under the paint, in many cases the filler is cracked or missing. High levels of moisture register on each of the fourteen areas checked.

Thereafter the vessel was delivered to the Defendant and on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010 Ms Harman sent an email to the Claimant providing a quotation for the osmosis treatment in the sum of £4,465.77 plus VAT.  There is a dispute as to whether  the survey report was shown to the Defendant and as to what work the Defendant was engaged to perform. The vessel remained in the Defendant’s yard over the winter of 2010-2011 during which the Defendant performed work on the vessel. As will appear below problems with the vessel’s below water paintwork and/or osmosis treatment developed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The vessel was redelivered to the Claimant and he was invoiced for the work in April 2011. The Claimant paid £5,973.59 for the work during the period which was £1,507.82 more than the original quotation. The additional sum is, in the Defendant’s covering letter of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011, stated to have arisen from additional work to the cutlass bearings which were found to be necessary. The Claimant thereafter had the use of the vessel during the summer seasons of 2011 and 2012. In October 2012 the Claimant had the vessel lifted from the water and noticed that the stern area and four other areas on the hull had turned green. He informed the Defendant on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012 and was informed by the Defendant that the colour differences were normal. The Claimant was reassured by this advice and took no further action at that time.  In February 2013 the Claimant observed that osmosis blisters had reappeared on the vessel’s transom below the waterline. He informed the Defendant which, after inspecting the vessel, offered to perform remedial work at no cost to the Claimant.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">I understand that the Claimant had the use of the vessel during the summer season of 2013 and the vessel was returned to the Defendant in September 2013 for the remedial work to be carried out. The Claimant expected that the work would be completed in time for her to be used during the summer season of 2014 and, in January 2014, he applied for a renewal of his Avon Navigation Trust annual licence (for £237) and also paid for his annual membership of the Canal Rescue Service. However it transpired that the vessel was not lifted by the Defendant until December 2013 and, in February 2014, the Claimant was informed by the Defendant that the remedial treatment needed to be applied to the whole of the hull. The Claimant was given a completion date in May 2014. However by May 2014 the work had not been completed whereupon the Claimant requested that the work to the vessel should be completed in June 2014 but was told by the Defendant that it would not be possible to complete the work by then. A further request that the vessel be completed by July 2014 also received the response that it would not be possible.  As a result the Claimant did not have the use of the vessel during the summer season of 2014.   </p>

The Claimant then commenced using the vessel. However in May 2015 damage occurred to the propellers and the vessel was lifted to perform repairs. At that time the Claimant noticed that paint was coming away from the hull. The Claimant informed the Defendant of this by email on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015. The Claimant did not receive an answer from the Defendant and sent a letter to the Defendant dated the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015. In that letter the Claimant has stated that “ . . .<span style="font-style:italic">it has been confirmed to me that the final layers of paint have not been applied correctly and therefore did not adhered (sic) to the initial coats . . . I am entitled to expect the work you carried out for me to be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. . . .this has not been the case because the final layers of paint that Sirius applied to the underside of my boat is falling off after only 8 weeks from completion.</span>” The Claimant also stated that Sirius are in breach of contract and he requested a repayment of he has paid to Sirius amounting to £5,973.59.  He also stated in the letter: “<span style="font-style:italic">As you have not to date replied to my email regarding this issue I can only assume that you are not interested in correcting this problem.</span>” It is to be noted that photographs taken of the vessel at the time indicate that the paint in the areas around where the chocks were placed was ridged which might indicate a lack of adhesion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The Claimant sent samples of the detached paint to International Paint Ltd, the manufacturer’s paint system used, and to the Defendant who also sought an analysis from the manufacturers. On the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2015 the Claimant received a letter from the Defendant stating that they were awaiting their own analysis from International Yacht Paints but thereafter he received nothing further and sent a chasing letter on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2015 which led to an email exchange on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2015. In the message to the Claimant Mr Saich asked for a larger piece of the paint to send to International Paint. The Claimant responded stating: “<span style="font-style:italic">As you can see from the photos I forwarded, sheets of paint are now falling off the hull and it is obvious its not the chocking up of Rhapsody at Marine Performances Yard that has caused this problem as you suggested in your recent letter. Other marine engineers have commented on the state of my hull and two have suggested the cause of the paint failure is possible amine sweating??? Whatever the cause of the paint failure is, I can only hold Sirius responsible, after all they applied the paint and its now important I act to protect the hull as soon as possible.</span>” Mr Greatbatch stated that he would try to get a further sample. In his witness statement Mr Greatbatch has said that he did send a further sample of the paint to the Defendant and although he sent a chasing email on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2015 he heard nothing further from the Defendant. In October 2015 Mr Greatbatch instructed Cardiff Marine to carry out the remedial work to the vessel. That commenced in October and the vessel was returned to him in December 2015. That work involved the entire removal of the existing gelcoat and paint to ensure the new coating bonded properly. The cost of that work was £5,920 plus VAT.  Since that work there has been no recurrence of the osmosis problem or problems with the paint.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Mr Godding gave evidence as to his findings in 2010 and 2014. The reports are in evidence. He said it was unusual for it to take until January 2015 to dry the boat out. Usually such work would be performed over the lay-up period between October and Spring. The report of the survey in August 2014 indicates that the work done by the Defendant had failed, that it was apparent that not all the original gelcoat had been removed and at least 70% of the hull still had gelcoat or filler remaining on it. He noted that not all the gelcoat had been taken off in January 2015 and that it was removed at his recommendation. The usual process for dealing with osmosis is to remove all the gelcoat, clean a boat to remove any chemicals which can cause the problem, dry the hull out and apply solvent free epoxy paints. The treatment, if properly applied, can last indefinitely and a recurrence of osmosis is not to be expected. In re-examination he was asked about the work commenced in December 2013 and said that he would expect the sequence to be that:  the boat to be taken out of the water, the gel coat would be planed off, the hull would be shotblasted, the hulls should be washed to remove chemicals, that it should not take more than 6 months to dry the vessel out. That would be less if the vessel was moved indoors and heaters were used which should reduce the process to 4-5 months. Such a process would be usual. He said not taking the boat out of the water until December would delay the whole process.  He said that the whole of the gelcoat should have been taken off but in January 2015 15-20% had still not been removed which surprised him as it should have been done months before. </p>

In multiple areas the vessel’s paint had debonded from the first coat next to the GRP (ie. the glass reinforced plastic or fibreglass). He has stated that he sent a sample of the paint from the vessel to paint supplier, International Yacht Paints and received the exhibited email from Kate Moss dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 which says that the sample had developed “amine blush” and therefore had not chemically or mechanically adhered to the previous layer.

His evidence was provided in a statement dated the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2018. He refers to the first work as having been a “patch” treatment which had not provided a cure and that the rectification work would be carried out under warranty.  After that the boat was returned to the Defendant in September 2013.  His written evidence indicates that although no time frame was agreed with the Claimant he would have expected the work to have been done by the following spring. He has said that the transom was blasted to expose the blistering and “<span style="font-style:italic">noted that much of the hull had new blistering. We advised the client and proceeded to abrasively blast the whole hull with Aluminium Silicate</span>”. He then says “<span style="font-style:italic">Having fully blasted the hull we left her to dry out in the yard before placing her into our paint shop . . . to dry out over the next few months</span>”. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>He does recall there being some pressure to get the work done but this arose following a meeting at which Mr Godding was present. With respect to osmosis treatment he has said: “<span style="font-style:italic">The generally agreed route to osmosis treatment nowadays is fully dependent on the areas affected. If widespread and deep enough to reach the matting; A full strip of Gelcoat, rinsing, drying, application of biaxial matting and then rebuilding the protection layers to antifoul is recommended </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">throughout the hull</span><span style="font-style:italic">. If only small areas or not yet deep into the matting, then smaller patches can be treated as above. This is a recent change in industry thinking.</span>” (emphasis added).<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Mr Harman has referred to what happened after Mr Godding became involved which refers to the paint being applied after Mr Godding had accepted the moisture readings and stated that an employee applied the wrong paint which had to be rectified. The work then proceeded. After the vessel had been redelivered he refers to visiting the boat at Upton and agrees that paint was coming off although he states “<span style="font-style:italic">it appeared that this was due to chocking procedure and the way that it had been placed on the blocks</span>”. He does not make any reference to meeting the Claimant or making any offer to provide rectifying work at that time but says that he took photos and a paint sample and returned to the office where he advised Terry Saich “<span style="font-style:italic">that it appeared to be a chocking incident but that would need to send the sample away to international and might need to carry out some patch repairs to the top most coats, where it had been damaged.</span>”  </p>

He agreed that the Defendant could have used heaters and he was not sure and had no explanation as to why heaters were not used earlier than they were. He agreed that the drying out process could possibly have been completed earlier. A dryer was used from January to February 2015 when they were given the “go-ahead” to complete the work.

The difference in prices was £5,000-£10,000. The Claimant chose the cheaper partial treatment. This was cheaper and was what was set out in the 2010 estimate. She stated that at the time the estimate was given she had still not seen the boat. She said that she was told that a surveyor had indicated that the vessel suffered from osmosis but did not recall being shown the surveyor’s report. She said that, when she did see the vessel, the osmosis appeared to be in the stern and it was not until they sand blasted the boat that they realised there was a problem. She stated that the Claimant was informed when the rest of the boat was blasted. She has stated that she did not know that the transom of the vessel had been treated on an earlier occasion and that the Claimant should have informed her. As to the later paint problem in 2015 she stated that Mr Harman had said that it looked as though it had been caused by the “chocking”. Although paint samples were sent to International Yacht Paints the Defendant could not get an answer from them. As nothing was heard from the Claimant it was assumed that the problem with the paint had been dealt with at Upton. She denied that the yard had breached a duty of care and did not accept that the yard had been negligent.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Mr Barrow provided a report apparently dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018. In it he has stated that a typical scheme recommended by international paints would be for the application of three layers of Gelshield Plus with one layer of Gelshield 200, which is an antifouling tie coat to which two coats of anti foul should be added. That is 6 layers of paint in all. Mr Barrow had commissioned an analysis of the flakes of paint, by Materials Technology. The results showed that there were three layers of paint made up of one layer of Gelshield Plus, one layer of Gelshield 200 and one layer of anti-foul. The thickness of the layers varied but, in general, were less than the thickness recommended by International Yacht Paints. Mr Barrow stated<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“<span style="font-style:italic"> . . . the failure is likely to be between two layers of gelsheild  </span>[sic] <span style="font-style:italic">plus, the most common cause of the failure is amine blush. Amines are a curing mechanism of an epoxy coating and with solvent free systems such as gelsheild plus this curing mechanism can be quite sensitive. If cold temperatures or moisture in the form of dew, high humidity’s etc are present during the application the amine does [not] completely bind with the epoxy resins and raised to the surface creating a sticky layer. If subsequent coatings are applied onto amine blush they will not adhere and detach. Unfortunately due to the age of the paint flakes provided this could not be tested for but is a high probable cause for the detachment and CCC have seen this failure many times.</span>”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.00in">“overcoat window of the products” which is allowing a coat to be left too long before the next coat is applied so that the first hardens and will not bind with the second, or (b) a failure of the paint itself or where it is past its use-by date. With respect to these possibilities Mr Barrow stated “<span style="font-style:italic">CCC cannot establish 100% which of the above failures is to blame but by experience it is most likely by having amine blush present throughout the application.</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>  With respect to the work done by Cardiff Marine Mr Barrow accepted that it would be proper to “start afresh”. He has also stated that the industry standard  approach to quoting for osmosis rectification, including the removal of suspect materials and applying a full gelshield system is normally between £160-£200 per foot ex VAT.

In his response Mr Barrow has stated that he cannot provide an answer because he does not know what thickness of paint remained on the vessel when she was returned to the water on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2015. However he has expressed the opinion that “<span style="font-style:italic">by leaving the patches unrepaired it is likely that the adjacent coatings to the unrepaired area may peel at a faster rate and expose more underlying coatings.</span>” The parties agreed that a further question should be put to Mr Barrow which asked whether, if returning the vessel to the water unrepaired on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2015 had the potential to effect the paint on the hull, he considered this would have had an impact on the works carried out by Cardiff Marine.

In the light of that report is it is highly improbable that Mr Greatbatch would have been satisfied with a lesser service without at least discussing with Mr Godding whether it would be satisfactory. From the way in which the report itself is couched I have no doubt that if Mr Godding had been asked whether a partial treatment been proposed he would have advised against it in the strongest terms. Further on this aspect it is very strange that, if the Defendant really considered that a less than full procedure was proper, no mention of this is referred to in the email of the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2010 or in the later estimate of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. </p>

However Mr and Mrs Greatbatch both gave evidence that the Defendant was shown a copy of Mr Godding’s survey report which made it clear that there had been a previous patch repair done to the vessel which was inadequate. Mr Greatbatch was not cross examined on his evidence and I can see no sensible reason to disregard it. It is, in my view, highly probable that Mr Greatbatch showed Mrs Harman the report as it would be a sensible thing to do.

It follows that the estimate of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010 should have been made upon the basis of such an inspection.

The present facts demonstrate that the eventual repairers, Cardiff Marine, performed the relevant work of a full stripping down and repainting the hull for £5,920, ex VAT which is more but not dissimilar to the figures put forward by the Defendant in June 2010 and November 2010. Moreover, on this topic Mr Barrow has given evidence that the industry standard approach to quoting for osmosis rectification, including the removal of suspect materials and applying a full gelshield system is normally between £160-£200 per foot ex VAT. On a 32 foot vessel that means that the costs of full osmosis treatment should have been between £5,120 and £6,400. It follows that Mrs Harman’s assertion that the cost of a full treatment as being £10,000 is not only an exaggeration it is also misleading. </p>

Mr Godding also stated that the removal of old gelcoat is necessary to allow this to occur. I accept that evidence. This operation may also be accelerated by placing the vessel inside and/or by the use of heaters. Mr Godding stated that he would expect that the full osmosis treatment, including the drying out aspect, should normally be capable of being completed within 6 months. Mr Barrow stated that once vessel is dried out the work of repainting can be completed over a short period of time. In my judgment it follows that if proper steps were taken to dry out the hull promptly in 2013 then the work ought to have been completed by the spring of 2014. That view is supported by the actual time taken by Cardiff Marine to carry out the necessary work in the winter of 2015. </p>

The Defendant failed at the time, and has continued to fail, to provide any sensible or acceptable explanation as to why the repairs were not completed by the beginning of the 2014 season. It has been stated that this was because the vessel had not properly dried out but there is no acceptable explanation as to why that was so. It is apparent that the vessel was left in the water for a considerable period at the end of 2013 when one might reasonably expect that a competent boat yard would have removed her from the water so that she could start to dry out.  It is to be noted that some work had commenced by February 2014 because it was at that stage that the Defendant recognised that it would be necessary to strip off the hull completely. What happened with respect to the vessel between February 2014 and Mr Godding’s re-involvement later that year is obscure. It appears that this work was not done or if it was it was not done adequately because Mr Godding has given evidence that there were significant remains of the old gelcoat still on the hull in January 2015. That is of additional significance because, as he told the court, it is necessary to remove the earlier gelcoat so that the drying process can take place.  </p>

She has stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">I have actually just seen a copy of the report by Mike Godding. Should you now wish to instruct us to carry out further gelcoat removal in order to speed up the drying time then we are happy to do this.  . . . The costs of this is  . . . so could range from £468 to £780  . . . [the vessel] is now under the covered blasting canopy at the rear of the yard awaiting your further instructions.</span>” From that it is clear that although the Defendant had, in February 2014, recognised the need to fully remove the vessel’s gelcoat that still had not been done by August 2014. In the circumstances any endeavours to dry the boat out over the summer of 2014 would probably be ineffective. In this respect it is to be noted that once Mr Godding had required that the whole of the gelcoat be removed in January 2015 the drying out process proceeded at a reasonable speed allowing the vessel to dry out sufficiently for the Defendant to apply the paint in March 2015.  </p>

From the evidence put before the court I consider that the exercise of such duties required the Defendant, during and after September 2013, to remove the vessel from the water, to remove the gelcoat and to take such steps as were reasonably necessary, including placing the vessel inside and using heaters, to ensure that the vessel was dried out and the repainting work completed before the beginning of the 2014 “season”. In my view the evidence available demonstrates a woeful failure on the part of the Defendant to comply with its obligations to the Claimant. </p>

The Defendant has sought to argue that it did the work in accordance with the directions of and overseen by Mr Godding. However Mr Godding gave evidence that he did not oversee the painting work and that the work was the sole responsibility of the Defendant. In oral evidence Mr Saich accepted that it was indeed the responsibility of the Defendant to perform the work properly. Insofar as the Defendant has sought to argue that its responsibility for the work has been extinguished or reduced by reason of the appointment of Mr Godding to assist Mr Greatbatch this cannot be accepted. </p>

It was also noted that the paint work had suffered particular damage in way of where the vessel’s chocks were placed when the vessel was lifted.

These are: (i) Amine blush; (ii) the use of out of date material; (iii) the application of the paint at the wrong temperature and (iv) hydroscopic action. His argument is that sanding discs were issued out of the stores and were used to remove the amine blush; (ii) out of date paint is unlikely to be the cause because they had been purchased just prior to its use and (iii) a chart was kept indicating that the application process was undertaken at the correct temperatures. He has argued that the paint became disturbed by chocking when the vessel was lifted to look at the propellers and not that disturbance was not properly repaired before the vessel was returned to the water so that hydroscopic action was probably the main or only cause of the failure of the paint work. </p>

However even if either of the two alternatives Mr Barrow mentions were causative they would indicate an operational failure by the Defendant in the supply of the paint or its application. In fact Mr Barrow opines that of the three alternatives the most probable cause of the paint failure was the presence of the amine blush which was found to be present.  Mr Barrow made no mention of hydroscopic action in his original report. Although he has subsequently accepted that hydroscopic action might increase the loss of paint from the vessel once it had started to fail it is not suggested and there is no evidence which supports the proposition that hydroscopic action could be a cause of the initial paint failure. Mr Saich sought to argue that the hydroscopic action worked on the areas which had been damaged when the vessel was lifted to inspect the propeller damage. However boats are chocked every time they are lifted without the type of damage which occurred in the present case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the presence of the amine blush found by Ms Moss indicates that the paint system on the vessel was bound to fail and the “rucking” to the paint in way of the chocks is a clear indication that the failure had begun to occur when the vessel was lifted and chocked. The expert evidence indicates that there was amine blush present in the paint applied by the Defendant and that was the probable cause of the failure of the paint system. Mr Barrow has accepted that hydroscopic action could accelerate the rate at which the paint came away from the hull however his answers to the supplementary questions clearly demonstrate that once it is established that the paint system applied by the Defendant had failed the proper and reasonable course of action was to remove the whole system and re-apply paint to the whole vessel as was, in fact, performed by Cardiff Marine. That remedy would have been necessary whether or not there had been hydroscopic action and the argument raised by the Defendant that the repair carried out by Cardiff Marina could have been avoided by repairing the paint damaged in way of the chocking would not have remedied the underlying problem and would, in any event, have been an inadequate remedy. For these reasons I reject Mr Saich’s argument that hydroscopic action was what necessitated the repair carried out by Cardiff Marine.  </p>

However Mr Harman gave no such evidence in his witness statement or in his oral evidence. In her witness statement Mrs Harman has stated that she informed Mr Greatbatch that if he brought the boat back to them they would look at it again. However Mr Greatbatch’s evidence was that he received little or no communication from the Defendant after the vessel left Upton and in cross examination Mrs Harman was very vague as to when or how such an offer was made. There is no documentary evidence supporting such an offer and the contents of Mr Saich’s letter to Mr Greatbatch of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2015 are not consistent with such an offer having been made.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.30in">In some cases it may be possible for a Claimant to put forward a figure based upon the hire of an alternative vessel but where that is not the case the court may assess such damage upon the basis that the Claimant has been deprived of the use of a valued chattel for a period of time. That is best calculated upon the basis of a percentage (based upon reasonable interest rates) of the actual value of the vessel at the material time.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.30in">With respect to the appropriate rate I consider that a rate based solely upon the bank rate plus some small allowance, usually 1-2% in The Admiralty Court, would not be sufficient to recompense a party who has been kept out of the use of his pleasure vessel in the circumstances of this case which includes the conduct of the Defendant in failing to complete the work in the Spring of 2014, failing to provide any acceptable reason or excuse and failing to carry out the work required in a proper manner.  In such circumstances I consider that a fair rate would be to take 8%, which is the judgment rate, and apply it to the value of the vessel over an appropriate period.</p>

In this case it is probable that the best evidence of the value of the vessel to the present Claimant would be the price he paid for her purchase in 2010.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-style:italic">Mooring fees. </span>The claim for lost mooring fees of £1,980 is put on the basis of the loss of 18 months. However annual mooring fees are usually paid for a 12 month period which include the winter lay-up period and the spring to autumn season when most vessels are in use. For the reasons given above I consider that the Claimant was deprived on the use of his vessel over the 2014 season. In my judgment it is therefore appropriate to allow loss of mooring fees for the year 2014. That is £1,320.</p>
