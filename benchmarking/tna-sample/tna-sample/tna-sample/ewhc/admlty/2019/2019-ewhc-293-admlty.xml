	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.00in">Defendant was in the same bay. The RIB was the tender to the motor yacht “ENIGMA BLUE” (“Enigma”) which was lying in a Bay to the south of Lindos Bay, apparently known as Navarone Bay. The First Defendant was employed as skipper of the “Enigma” which is registered in the Isle of Man and owned by a company, the Second Defendant. It is probable that the Second Defendant was owned or controlled by members of the ‘King family’ who are resident in England. Mr and Mrs King were separated by the material time and Mrs King, her son, guests and the crew of the yacht were onboard the  “Enigma”. However as the proceedings against Mrs King, originally the first defendant, have been discontinued the identity of those controlling the owning company is no longer material to the present claim.  </p>

I heard oral evidence for the Claimant from the Claimant herself, and from Helen Jane Smith, Louise Howard and Joanne Elizabeth Wakeman. Miss Wakeman gave evidence from New South Wales by video link. In addition the Claimant relied upon the record of the interview of Mr Melis by Coast Guard officers. Mr Melis is an Italian national who apparently works and resides in Belgium. Although he was questioned by the Coast Guard he has refused to provide further assistance by giving a witness statement or attending to give oral evidence. His witness statement has been tendered by the Claimant on the basis that he is beyond the seas and cannot be compelled to attend to give his evidence. I also heard oral evidence on behalf of the Defendants from Mr Gultepe, the First Defendant, Mrs King and Mr David Magner. </p>

They are a well organised, professional and uniformed service. It is not surprising that they have been referred to as ‘police’ but I have taken it that references to ‘police’ in this case should properly be considered as being references to the Coast Guard.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no dispute between the parties that at about 1830 on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 the Claimant was in Lindos Bay, that she suffered serious injuries and that she was taken from the water by the First Defendant in the tender. There is a dispute as to where she was when she was taken from the water, how she came to be in the water, how she came to be injured and whether the injuries were caused by the tender. The nature of the pleaded injuries suffered by the Claimant are a haematoma to the brain, a large widening of the mediastinum, fracture to the sternum, left lung contusion with fractions of the ninth, eleventh and twelth ribs on the left, left haemothorax which required drainage, a fracture of the left transverse process of the L5 vertebra, multiple fracture of the left ilium, a large haematoma of the left iliopsoas, an aortic injury, ischemia of the distal phalanx of the left index finger. She has been left with significant scarring, Cholecystits and Phlebitus. After she was taken from the water she was taken to the shore, transferred to an ambulance and taken to hospital in Rhodes. Thereafter she was placed in an induced coma, transferred to a hospital in Athens and then repatriated to the Brighton and Sussex University  Hospital. She subsequently went to another hospital in Sussex to further her recovery.  The medical evidence is that the medical assistance she received was timely and well performed. I gained the clear impression that her injuries were very serious, that she was well looked after and that if she had not been she probably would not have survived her injuries. As it is the Claimant has made a good recovery. The fact that she was seriously injured is not in dispute although there is a dispute as to how her injuries were caused.   </p>

Yet further into the bay there is a stone jetty which extends northward into the bay. At the outer end is a wooden jetty and, so it appears, a wooden pontoon. The jetty and the pontoon are used as a mooring place for, inter alia, boats including glass bottom tourist excursion boats. From that jetty a beach runs round the head of bay to the South West. There is a Coast Guard office about half way along the beach and another concrete jetty at the far, or Northern, end of that beach. To the North West there is a smaller bay in which yachts apparently moor stern to the shore. Vessels also anchor in the bay and, from the photographs, there appear to be a few permanent boat moorings in the bay. It was common ground that it is an attractive place which is well frequented by visiting vessels and that waters of the bay are quite busy. </p>

She also gave oral evidence under cross examination. The material effect of her evidence was as follows. At the material time she was residing and working in Lindos. Most evenings she would go to the Bay to swim. She stated that she had previously swum across the bay but only in company and never alone. She stated that it was her usual practice to swim from the area known as the ‘hot rocks’ and that she had never jumped from the higher rocks on the South side of the entrance to Bay.  Her last clear recollection prior to the accident was on the evening before it occurred. Initially she had no recollection of the incident in which she was injured itself but when she was in hospital in England in the Royal Sussex Hospital some memories returned to her. The memories came back to her as one continuous episode. She then remembered the pain and terror of the accident, the sensation of being hit and “<span style="font-style:italic">seeing an open air dinghy type vessel with a man with his back to her appearing oblivious to what had happened</span>”. At that point she called out. She remembers being dragged from the water and recalls seeing Jo (that is Joanne Wakeman) on the boat. She has said that these memories came back to her in one session and not over a period of time although she additionally refers to reading an article which triggered a memory of the noise she had been making whilst in the tender. Miss Schofield gave her evidence in a clear and straightforward manner and I was impressed by her as a witness of truth. I have no doubt that she believes her memories are genuine and that they were not consciously reconstructed by her in order to improve her case. Miss Prager did not submit otherwise but she questions the extent to which reliance can be placed upon those memories, if any. I shall consider that aspect below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Joanne Wakeman.</span> She has provided a witness statement dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2017. She gave oral evidence by video link from New South Wales. There were some technical difficulties with the link as contact was lost on a number of occasions. However they were not such as to detract materially from her evidence and I was able to obtain a clear appreciation of her evidence and her demeanour. I consider that she was an honest and reliable witness with a good recollection of the events. The effect of her evidence was that she was working in Lindos on a glass bottomed tourist boat, was a friend of the Claimant and had seen her walking in the direction of the hot rocks to go swimming. She herself was walking some dogs for another friend and was in the area of the beach close to the place where the stone jetty joins the land to the West of the ‘hot rocks’. She did not see the incident in which the Claimant was injured but her attention was drawn to it by an Italian lady asking for help. That lady came from the direction of the hot rocks and said that someone had been hit by a boat. She then saw what was, in fact, the tender approaching the jetty with the Claimant lying over it. The driver of the tender was asking what he should do. There was a young boy in the boat. At that time someone onboard the glassboat was calling the ‘police’ by vhf radio. Miss Wakeman says that she swam about 20 metres to the tender, pulled herself onboard and sought to comfort the Claimant who was in a state of shock. She said that she also tried to calm the driver who was in shock and said “I did not see her, I did not see her” and was asking where he should go. At that time the Claimant was in forward part of the tender in front of the driver. Although it was put to her that she did not get into the tender it was Miss Wakeman’s evidence that she did and remained in it whilst the driver of the tender went to the beach at the head of the South West part of the bay. The captain of the glass bottom boat had told the tender to go to the beach at Lindos. That was done and there was a police officer on the beach ‘who told us to go to the jetty on the main beach’. That was the concrete jetty at the northern end of the beach. Once there people assisted in taking the Claimant to an ambulance but she, Miss Wakeman, was not allowed to go in the ambulance with the Claimant. She believes that the Claimant’s beach bag was put into the ambulance with her. She said that the following day she sought out the Italian, Mr Melis, who spoke very good English. The Italian did not want to be involved but she escorted him to the police station and remained whilst he gave a statement which she was asked by the policeman to sign and did so. It is to be noted that the Defendant challenges whether Miss Wakeman got into the tender at all and Mrs King who gave evidence for the Defendant expressed doubt about whether Miss Wakeman could have pulled herself from the water into the tender because she herself had never managed it without help. In my view that was not a satisfactory reason for disbelieving Miss Wakeman’s evidence. She gave her evidence in a frank and clear way and I accept the truth of her evidence that she entered the tender and remained in it until the tender reached the stone jetty where the Claimant was taken to the ambulance. </p>

He was warned of his rights under the Greek Code of Criminal Procedure which included the right to appear with an attorney “<span style="font-style:italic">to wholly or partly refuse to provide explanations, to take up to 48 hours to provide such  . . .</span>”. The warning appears to be very similar to the caution which a person under suspicion of having committed an offence in England and Wales might be expected to receive before being questioned. Mr Gultepe stated that he did not wish to invoke the rights explained to him. There are two translations of the original Greek version. Although there are some differences in the wording these only relate to slightly different uses of words in the translation. In my judgment any differences are immaterial and the language used in both translations carries the same meaning and effect. For the present purposes I have relied upon the translation provided by the Claimant. The effect of Mr Gultepe’s replies conveys the following. He was the captain of the British flagged yacht Enigma. She had come to Rhodes from Marmaris in Turkey on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 with her crew of 4 hands all told where she took onboard 4 members of the ‘owner’s family’. On the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 the Enigma was in the area of Psaltos where she was anchored and at about 1800 to 1830 he took the tender, with the owner’s 8 year old son onboard, to Lindos Bay to find a safe anchorage for the night. The tender entered and toured around the bay at Lindos keeping a safe distance from the shore. As they were exiting the bay he heard a shout “<span style="font-style:italic">Oh God</span>” in English. He immediately looked back and saw a woman lying on her back of the surface of the sea. She came to the side of the tender and he helped her climb onto the tender in order to take her ashore. He moved towards another boat, moored nearby, and asked them to call an ambulance and the Port authority. “<span style="font-style:italic">At this place, there was also a friend of the injured person who came on the tender too.</span>” Then he moved to the “<span style="font-style:italic">other beach of </span></p>

He stated that the woman was talking normally to her friend and the only injury visible was a bruise on her buttocks. She was only wearing the lower part of her swimwear and had no blood or abrasions on her body. She was disembarked on the beach and an ambulance which arrived a few minutes later arrived. He stated that the tender was travelling at 6-7 knots and “<span style="font-style:italic">very carefully as I was inside the bay and had a child on the tender. Our distance from the shore was approximately sixty (60) meters and above. We were travelling at the centre of the bay</span>”. Before hearing the voice he saw “<span style="font-style:italic">absolutely nothing</span>”. He was standing in the boat and had full visibility. He stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">I am sure that, if the woman was at the surface of the sea, I would have seen her; the sea and the bay were completely calm. However, I didn’t hear, nor did I understand touching/hitting anything. If I hadn’t heard the voice, I wouldn’t have realised that something had happened </span>”. He stated that he was experienced having been working at sea for 25 years and for 17 as a skipper. He had been working on this boat for 7 years, he had not consumed alcohol which was proved by a blood test. In answer to the question: <span style="font-style:italic">Is there anything else you would like to add? </span>He answered: “<span style="font-style:italic">I would like to insist on the fact that I am deeply sorry for what happened to the woman, but I honestly did everything possible to avoid such an event. My speed was very low, I was travelling in the centre of the bay, far away from the shore and had full visibility of the sea. Moreover, as soon as I heard the voice, I turned back immediately to find out what had happened and help. I have nothing more to add and sign.</span>”   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Mr Gultepe also provided a witness statement dated the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2017. In essence the contents accorded with the examination referred to above but there are some material differences or additions which were: The Enigma was anchored in Navarone Bay prior to Mr Gultepe leaving her in the tender to go to Lindos Bay to look for a safe place to anchor for the night. The tender was travelling at 4-5 knots because he had a child onboard and he was aware of the speed limits that apply. When he reached Lindos Bay he took a loop around the bay keeping outside the buoys which indicate swimming areas. There were 15-20 yachts in the area including a 40 metre yacht. Having been in the Bay for about 10 minutes they were just starting their return to Navarone Bay. As he was leaving and almost out of the Bay he heard words shouted in English, “<span style="font-style:italic">Help</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">Oh My God</span>”. He then states: “<span style="font-style:italic">I turned the RIB around and went towards the sound. I saw ahead of me about 50 metres away that there was a lady in the water. It took me 30 seconds to reach her. The lady was in the middle of the bay. She was not in the swimmers area at all. She was a long way outside that area. She was out in the middle of the Bay towards open sea. She was lying on her back. I went over to her because of her shout. She was not swimming. . . When I went to help her she was saying she wanted to go home. I was not sure if she had fallen from a boat or nearby rocks or whether she had been swimming</span>”. He has also stated that she was wearing a two piece bikini, he pulled her onboard the RIB, he didn’t allow the owners’ son to help because Mr Gultepe was afraid he might be hurt. He further states: “<span style="font-style:italic">There were no swimmers near to where I found the lady. We were travelling outside the buoys marking the swimmers area.

He says: “<span style="font-style:italic">I recall a lady who appeared to be a friend of the Claimant (I do not know her name)</span>”. The Claimant was put into the ambulance and left.  He also refers to the Port Police wanting to see the Engima’s documentation. He and they went back to Enigma and the documentation was shown to them. Thereafter he went to the police station in Lindos Bay for questioning. Then he went to Hospital and gave a blood test. He was interviewed until around 3pm. He was not given a copy of the statement or the alcohol tests. He says that most of the officers were kind and friendly and reassuring save for one who became angry and shouted that he must have hit the lady. Mr Gultepe insisted that he had saved her from the water.  He says that later in the evening the Port Police looked at some television screens in the office which showed images from Lindos Bay. He states that after the officers had looked at those images: “<span style="font-style:italic">the officer was satisfied that I had nothing to do with the Claimant’s injuries and that I had only been the rescuer as I had told them. His attitude towards me immediately changed and I was told I was free to go back to the yacht. I cannot remember how long it took for the tests in the hospital but I was finally allowed to go back to the Yacht at about 3 am.</span>” He says that Port Police visited the yacht the following day and told him that they were happy that I had nothing to do with the incident.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>With respect to the translation of the statement to the Port Authorities he says that he does not agree with that statement and that there are matters which are incorrect, namely: (i) that no one else got into the boat before it got to the shore where ambulance was; (ii) that he did not stop at another yacht and pick up the Claimant’s friend. “<span style="font-style:italic">She never travelled with Us in the RIB to the shore</span>”; (iii) that when he said “<span style="font-style:italic">I am sorry about what happened to the lady</span>” he just meant that he felt sorry for her. He did not tell the police that he had injured her but repeatedly stated that he had rescued her. He complains that the Port Police have made no reference to his statements that he had rescued her and make it look as though it was his fault; (iv) he does not understand why the Port Police have made no reference to the camera evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">In cross examination by Mr Doherty Mr Gultepe stated that he weighed about  88 or 89 kilos in 2013, that he knew Lindos Bay very well, that he does not agree with what he stated in paragraph 23 about his knowledge of the bay, that when he turned around his was the closest boat to the lady, that when he heard the shout he did not turn round but just turned to the voice, that other boats were not too close, the nearest was about 200 metres away, it was Ramadan and he had had nothing to eat. He denied that Miss Wakeman got into the tender and said that her evidence on that was wrong and that the statement to the Port Police on that aspect is wrong. He stated that where the Enigma was anchored was Navarone Bay and Psaltos is another name for the same place. He said that he showed the police on his mobile phone. He says that the Claimant was topless when he took her from the water and that paragraph 16 of his signed statement is wrong on that aspect. Mr Doherty asked Mr Gultepe what he knew about the fact that he had been charged with a criminal offence by the Greek authorities arising from this incident. Mr Gultepe claimed that he is not being prosecuted in Greece and knew nothing about it. However he agreed that an attorney had been appointed to act for him in Greece. He stated that he had been asked to do that by the Defendants’ solicitors and that he had been sent the relevant power of attorney by them. With respect to whether his boat had been in contact with the Claimant he said she would have been struck by the propeller. He stated that he had never hit anyone before but that if the boat ‘bucks’ he can feel it but he would not know the feeling of touching a swimmer. With respect to the Claimant he said: “<span style="font-style:italic">Her eyes were turning. Of course I was upset to see someone so injured</span>”.  Further with respect to where he picked up the Claimant he stated that it was about 200 metres from the rocks to the south, it was outside the swimming area but he agreed that it was not up to him where people might swim, he denied that the distance was only about 50-60 metres from shore as stated by Mr Melis and suggested that if it had been he would have expected him to come to help. He did not explain how Mr Melis was to do that. He did not deny that about 7 hours after the incident he said it was 60 metres or more but said that he checked the next day. He agreed that there were people jumping from the rocks on the South side of the bay. He confirmed that he was probably travelling at about 6-7 knots before he turned but stated that he then increased speed to pick up the Claimant. He stated that the top speed of the tender was 29-30 knots but that he had to go slow because he had a child onboard. He agreed that in open water he would go to 10 because of the boy being onboard as he would go slower for his safety. He stated that he was almost out of the bay. When asked whether he would expect to find swimmers when almost out of the bay he responded: “<span style="font-style:italic">I did not think of anything like that</span>”.   With respect to the speed of the boat he denied that he was going fast and stated the he would not have heard the shout from the Claimant if he had been going fast. </p>

If he went fast Engima could make 20 knots but her usual cruising speed was 10-12 knots. Sunset was predicted for 8.40 pm (2040). He did not think that would be a problem. The engine speed of the tender when leaving Lindos Bay was 500 rpm. To make 30 knots the rpm would be 2,000 rpm. The tender would go onto a plane at 1,000 rpm.     </p>

These included a satellite photograph which indicates the position of a line of buoys which are marked as defining the ‘swim/non swim areas’. These appear to be the same orange buoys shown in later photographs. There was a photograph of the area described as ‘The Rocks’ which appear to show that place from which people jump into the sea. He has also taken photographs of the ‘Port police station’ and the camera mounted on the ‘Police station’. He has stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">It was presently indeterminate whether the system was designed for detection, recognition or identification of objects</span>”. He has further referred to the “<span style="font-style:italic">Application of the observed characteristics of the station mounted PCC camera to a plan of Lindos </span>Bay” and expressed the opinion that “<span style="font-style:italic">it is likely that the camera would only have been able to: (i) Detect an individual in the water up to a maximum range within the field of view of an expected 350m of the camera in clear daylight conditions. This would essentially cover the bathing zone which lies between the shoreline at Megali and Mikro Beaches and the line of buoys. (ii) Recognise or identify an individual within an estimated 100m of the camera in clear daylight conditions</span>”. Also attached to the statement are photographs of the Enigma and the tender or RIB. In cross examination he stated that there are no signs prohibiting bathing and there are no bye-laws about swimming areas. With respect to the cameras he said that there were no recordings and that recordings are only kept for 48 hours. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">Pathology. </span>The Claimant called Dr Cooper a forensic pathologist of the Royal Victorian Infirmary at Newcastle upon Tyne and the Defendants called Dr. Carey, a forensic pathologist of Forensic Pathology Services based in Oxfordshire. In addition to their initial reports they provided a joint report to the Court dated the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018. The following matters were agreed: (i) it is likely that the Claimant’s injuries were suffered soon before and no more than 30 minutes before she was recovered from the water; (ii) One explanation was that she was struck by a boat or launch; (iii) Although there were no propeller related injuries that does not mean that the boat did not have an exposed propeller; (iv) The pattern of injuries could be sustained as a result of a fall from height into water; (v) the injuries were not sustained from a fall from height landing on rocks; (vi) to cause the injuries suffered by the Claimant a fall into water would have had to be from a considerable height. The essential area of difference between these experts is over whether the injuries to the Claimant could have been caused by a boat travelling at about 6-7 knots. Dr Cooper considers that the most likely cause of the injuries is that she was struck by a boat whilst swimming and that they could have been suffered by the tender making about 6-7 knots although the faster the boat is travelling the more serious the injuries would be and, as I understood his evidence, the more likely that it was that the injuries were caused by the boat in question. Dr. Carey considers that it is unlikely that the injuries were caused by a boat making 6-7 knots but they could have been caused by a boat making a greater speed. Dr Carey reached his conclusion by comparing the type of damages inflicted in automobile accidents. Furthermore he considers that the effect of being in water would have a cushioning effect on the body hit which would reduce the effect of the blow. Dr. Cooper considered that this incorrect because water cannot be compressed and acts similarly to a solid object thus having a crushing effect on the body caught between the water and the boat. As he put it water will produce more resistance to a body being pushed away from the force colliding with it than air. Dr Carey further contended that Dr Cooper was incorrect because he had taken no account of the effect of gravity pinning the victim to the ground. In addition he considered that the injuries suffered by the Claimant could have been caused by a fall from height and put that forward as a real alternative to the Claimant having been hit by a boat. In oral examination it was put to Dr Carey that, given the possibility of the Claimant drowning, it was likely that the Claimant was picked up very quickly after the collision. Dr Carey agreed that she was probably picked up within minutes, at the most, of being struck and it was very unlikely that the Claimant could have been in the water without drowning for any length of time.  </p>

This, the Defendants submit, is more likely than that Mr Gultepe, who was a very experienced skipper, struck her without realising it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in"><span style="font-style:italic">The Claimant’s recollection. </span>A considerable amount of time has been taken considering whether the Claimant’s recollections were genuine or whether it was a confabulation arising from what she had been told after the event, mostly it is suggested, by her sister. Expert evidence on these matters was provided. My impression of the Claimant is that she is an honest witness who genuinely believes that her recollections are true and Miss Prager does not suggest that she is acting so as to deliberately mislead the court. After the incident the Claimant was placed in a medically induced coma. The Claimant has given evidence that she began to come out of the coma on about the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2013. She was repatriated to the Royal Sussex County Hospital (the “Royal Sussex”) by a flight commencing on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.  Her evidence is that it was only when she was in the Royal Sussex that memories of the incident came back to her. She is not able to put a precise date on when that occurred but was sure that it was not before the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> September 2013 on which date she received occupational therapy. She thinks it was after the catheter was removed which was about 7 weeks after the incident. That places the recall occurring around the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013.  An attempt has been made to throw doubt about whether the recall occurred at that time by reference to the contemporary medical records at the Royal Sussex. However, it is to be noted that the ‘OT entry’ which was on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013, referred to by Professor Baker, was 6 weeks after the incident and therefore before the most probable date of recall and before the occupational therapy referred to above.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Furthermore, although it has been submitted that the draft statement made in about 2015 undermines the Claimant’s evidence. I disagree. Paragraph 8 of that document states: “<span style="font-style:italic">I have very limited recollection of the accident itself. Some memories have returned to me over time but I do not have a complete recollection. I can remember calling out after I had been hit and I can also remember being pulled out of the water and lifted into the boat</span>.” In my view that is consistent with her present evidence of having had a limited recall at some point. Further, since it is Miss Louise Howard’s evidence that she prepared that draft from information given to her it is also clear that the Claimant must have drawn this aspect to the attention of her solicitor before that draft was made. During his oral evidence Professor Worthington told the court that being placed in an induced coma has the effect of placing the mental processes of recollection ‘on hold’ and that process would not re-commence until she came out of the coma. It seems to me to follow that the relevant period during which the process of the recollection took place is not 7 weeks but rather 4 weeks. The evidence of both the experts was that recall over a period of 7-8 weeks was not unknown and I understood it to be agreed that the shorter the period between the commencement of the mental recall process and the recollection itself the more likely it is that the recollection is genuine.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Although Professor Baker has expressed his opinion that her present memories have been triggered by information given to her by her sister that appears to be in the context of a memory which has come back to her after 3-4 years. However, that is not what we are concerned with in the present case because, in my view, the actual recall took place about 7 weeks after the incident and about 4 weeks after the Claimant had come out of the coma. In addition, I consider that it is relevant to take account of the nature of the recollections. It is difficult to see how information provided by the Claimant’s sister could generate memories about the Claimant shouting at the departing boat or of the actual pain involved in being pulled out of the water. So far as I am aware the only other information about the shout emanates from Mr Melis. Nobody else has spoken about it. The report from the Lindos Port Authority was not, according to Miss Howard’s evidence, received until October 2015 which makes it highly unlikely that either the Claimant or her sister had the details of Mr Melis’ account in September 2013. It is also significant that because Miss Howard’s evidence is that the draft witness statement was made following discussions between her and the Claimant which took place in 2014, those discussions predate receiving notice of Mr Melis’ evidence to the Coast Guard. In these circumstances I accept Professor Worthington’s opinion that it is plausible for the Claimant to have recovered a limited recollection whilst she was in the Royal Sussex and that is the most likely explanation in this case. It follows that I do not accept Professor </p>

In doing so I note Professor Worthington’s criticism of Professor Baker’s approach of comparing the statistical likelihood of an event occurring in the general population to a specific individual. I consider that criticism is well made for the reasons he has given and it further undermines the reliance I can place on Professor’s Baker’s evidence.      </p>

This evidence, of itself, does not rule out the Defendant’s explanation that the Claimant was already injured by a fall or being hit by another vessel and that she was only rescued by the First Defendant. However, Mr Melis’ answers in examination by the Coast Guard officers provides more information which, if accepted, is very strong support for the Claimant’s case that she was hit by the tender driven by Mr Gultepe.

In these circumstances the court should give careful consideration to the weight to be given to his evidence. On this aspect it is to be noted that there is no suggestion that he is connected with either party or has any reason to be biased. Further the evidence was given under oath to Coast Guard Officers who have the relevant jurisdiction over the Port. It was made the day after the incident and, aside from the record of the examination of the First Defendant, is the most contemporaneous evidence before the court. I do not consider that the fact Miss Wakeman was present during the interview detracts from the weight to be accorded to that evidence. The questions and the answers given are straightforward and, in my judgment, there is no reason not to give due weight to the evidence supplied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Mr Melis’ evidence is that: (a) he was in a position to look over the bay and he could see a person swimming; (b) he saw a boat which ‘crossed’ that person; (c) he heard a dull sound and heard voices and realised that the person needed help; (d) the boat, which had a child onboard, went back to the person and tried to pull the person from the water; (e) when the incident took place the boat was about 50-60 metres from the shore.  The person who was pulled from the water was, on any view of the evidence, the Claimant. When asked if he believed the boat hit the woman he answered: “<span style="font-style:italic">What I can say is that, when the boat came next to the woman, I heard the sound, but I cannot be absolutely sure because of the distance</span>”. It is significant that the Claimant was visible before the boat closed her position, there was a dull sound, there was a voice calling for help and the boat which had been close to her position was the one which picked the Claimant up was the tender with the child in it. That account is corroborated by two pieces of evidence. The first is the recollection of the Claimant, which I accept as being a true memory, of shouting to a boat which was going away from her. The second is the account of the Mr Gultepe himself that after he heard the voice he looked right round, ie. behind the tender, saw the Claimant and then turned the tender back to her. His evidence was that he had been on an Easterly heading when he heard the shout and was on a Westerly heading when he came back to the Claimant. In other words, he returned over his outward track. It follows that he must, at the very least, have passed very close to the position of the Claimant. The facts are that there was a shout and the boat which closed the position of the Claimant was the Defendants’ tender. That accords with the account given by Mr </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">The fall or jump from the rocks. </span>A considerable amount of the experts’ time was spent on this aspect. However in examination Dr Cooper, who has practical experience of these matters with respect to people jumping from the bridges in Newcastle, gave his opinion that unless the fall was from at least 80-100 feet the type of injuries sustained would be unlikely and De Carey accepted that a fall of at least 100 feet would be necessary and from 40-60 feet there would be much less likelihood of injury if any at all. The original proposition had been made on the basis that the Claimant had been injured in a jump or fall from the higher point of the Rocks area. There has been no attempt to measure the height of these rocks but the photographs provided suggest that they are considerably less than 100 feet and they are an area from which people jump on a regular basis which strongly suggests that they are not sufficiently high to cause serious injury if any at all.  In my view the suggestion that the Claimant might have been injured by a fall from the rocks onto water was, without the relevant information as to whether there was a relevant place where height of the rocks was sufficient to cause the relevant injuries, entirely speculative. In any event I accept the Claimant’s evidence that she had never jumped from the rocks in the past. In the circumstances it is beyond the bounds of reasonable probability that she would have suddenly changed her habits and done so on the day of the incident. For these reasons I reject any suggestion that the Claimant’s injuries were caused by a fall or by jumping from the rocks on the South side of the bay.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Whether the injuries could be caused by the tender. </span>It is not in dispute between Dr. Cooper and Dr Carey that a person could be hit and injured by a propeller driven boat without receiving injuries from the propeller nor that the injuries could be caused by a boat.  It was also accepted by Dr. Carey that the type of injuries could be caused by an impact from either the inflated rubber parts or the grp (glass reinforced plastic or fibreglass) parts of a boat. It was also common ground that there are no publications about bodies being struck whilst in water. With respect to the disagreement between them, as to whether the Claimant’s actual injuries could have occurred as a result of being struck by a vessel making 6-7 knots, this is related to their difference in approach to the effect of water acting on the struck object. Having heard both experts I am persuaded that Dr Cooper’s approach is correct. It was agreed that water cannot be compressed. It follows as a matter of simple physics that water must create a much greater resistance than air. I was not persuaded by Dr Carey’s apparent attempt to support his own theory by referring </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.00in">to the effect of gravity holding the person struck to the ground. Whilst I accept that it may have some initial momentary effect as the body is struck thereafter the effect of being struck is to push the body away from the force exerted upon it which is, as I understand it, the basis upon which the analysis of injuries to persons being struck by automobiles has been made. In my view the effect of an impact of a vessel against a body in water is much more likely to be akin to the body being pushed against a fixed object than where no such object is present. In fact it appears to me that this is most clearly demonstrated by Dr Carey’s own evidence of injuries caused by falling or jumping into water from height. A body may free fall through air without suffering impact damage. It is only on hitting the water that injuries occur. What is interesting is that it is the height of the fall and therefore the speed of the impact which is critical. Dr. Carey also accepted that the type of injuries could be suffered if the boat was making a greater speed than 6-7 knots and it was Dr Cooper’s view that, although he considered that the injuries could be caused by a boat making 6-7 knots, a higher speed of the boat would enhance the likelihood that injuries of the nature suffered by the Claimant would occur. I accept Dr Cooper’s evidence that a boat making 6-7 knots could have caused the injuries and that if the tender was exceeding that speed it strengthens the probability that it caused these injuries. Insofar as the Defendants seek to argue that the nature of the injuries can be taken as a reason why the tender driven by the First Defendant could not have collided with the Claimant that approach should be rejected unless the evidence demonstrates that the tender’s speed was substantially less than 6 knots.  </p>

The answer is not a clear response to the question asked but that is, I think, understandable in the context that it was given by an observer from the shore. It does not convey the impression that the tender was proceeding at speed which would have been obvious if Mr Gultepe had opened the throttle wide and taken the tender up to her full speed approaching 30 knots but nor does it convey the impression that the tender was proceeding slowly. However, I consider that it does convey the impression that the tender was making way with some speed greater than what could be considered to be moving slowly.

The most significant of these were: (a) That he gave the speed at which he was travelling in response to questions by the Coastguard as being 6-7 knots but this was reduced to 4-5 knots in his witness statement and subsequent oral evidence; (b) In response to questions by the Coastguard he stated that he picked up Miss Schofield 60 plus metres from shore but changed that to 100-150 metres from shore in his subsequent witness statement. In his oral evidence he sought to give the impression that the position was about halfway across the bay which would have been about 200 metres from the shore; (c) As to what Miss Schofield was wearing there was an inconsistency as whether it was a two-piece bikini or only the bottom part; (d) With respect to the question of whether anyone, such as Miss Wakeman, boarded the tender when it was near the wooden jetty to which the glass tourist boat was moored and stayed in the tender until the Claimant was put ashore. In his answers to the Coastguard he stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">I helped her </span>[the Claimant] <span style="font-style:italic">climb aboard </span>[the tender] <span style="font-style:italic"> . . . and aimed towards another vessel . . asking them to call . . . for an ambulance. . .

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">It is to be noted that the answers given to the Coastguard were made within hours of the incident. They were given voluntarily and there is no sensible reason why they should have been wrongly recorded by the Coastguard. I do not consider the apparent fact that Mrs King was unable to board the tender from the water without assistance as of any relevance as to whether Miss Wakeman did board the tender. Photographs of the tender are available and there were, in my view, sufficient handholds to allow a person of reasonable fitness and ability to climb onboard the tender without assistance. In my judgment Miss Wakeman was clearly a truthful witness and I accept her evidence as to boarding the tender. That evidence was consistent with Mr Gultepe’s version of events given to the Coastguard and I consider that it is the correct version. I do not consider that the dichotomy as to how the Claimant was reunited with her beach bag throws any doubt about the truthfulness of Miss Wakeman.  </p>

Whilst I have some doubt about whether Mr Magner can be regarded as a witness who has the expertise to express an opinion as to the efficacy, or otherwise, of any CCTV footage which might have been recorded at the Coast Guard office it was evidence tendered by the Defendants and is inconsistent with the proposition that the Coast Guard could have concluded that the tender was not involved in the incident by that means. Mr Magner also gave evidence that no recording of the incident has apparently been retained by the Coastguard which strongly suggests that the CCTV did not provide assistance with regard to the incident. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Further on this aspect Mr Doherty submitted that Mr Gultepe’s refusal to accept that he was being prosecuted for causing injury to Miss Schofield was extraordinary. I agree that it was, at least, very strange. There is no doubt that a prosecution has been commenced and is ongoing.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to accept that Mr Gultepe is not aware of that. In this respect it is apparent that a lawyer on Rhodes has been appointed to act for him and he could give no explanation of what that might be for if not to represent his interests in the prosecution.  Whether his denial is disingenuous or just a failure of memory is unclear. It may be that the alterations of his evidence are as a direct consequence of the prosecution and an attempt to reduce the impact of his examination before the Coast Guard in the criminal proceedings, for example with respect to his speed, the distance from the shore and the possible effect of Miss Wakeman’s evidence. Whatever his reasons for altering his stance it is apparent that Mr Gultepe is now doggedly sticking to a version of events which is contradicted by his own contemporaneous account and the evidence of others.  </p>

He told me that sunset was at 2040 hours which is, I consider probably correct at that time of the year. Although he told me that he had no concerns about the timing I consider that a sensible charter skipper would be expected to move to a new anchorage in daylight if possible.  In the circ</span>umstances, having decided that there was no space available in Lindos Bay, it is probable that Mr Gultepe wished to return to the Enigma as soon as possible to start the operation of moving her and would be intent upon making a speed commensurate with that bearing in mind his protective concerns about Denis, Mrs King’s son, who was with him.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, Mr Gultepe told the court that when he heard the shout and turned the tender he was about 50 metres past her position. It is to be noted that if the tender had been making 5-6 knots that would mean the ‘advance’ would, at 5.5 knots (with 1852 metres to the nautical mile), be 2.829 metres per second. So, 50 metres would have taken 17.67 seconds. At 7 knots the advance would be 3.6 metres per second so that 50 metres would have taken 13.88 seconds. Although it is not possible to precisely calculate the time it would take for the Claimant to have been hit, called out and for Mr Gultepe to have looked round and seen the Claimant in the water I consider that either of these periods are overlong for that to have happened. At 9 knots the relevant period is 10.799 seconds and at 10 knots is 9.7 seconds. On the assumption that Mr Gultepe’s estimate of 50 metres is correct it is very probable that the tender was making in excess of 6-7 knots and probably something of the order of 9-10 knots. If, however, Mr Gultepe’s 50 metres was an overestimate this would reduce the time between the collision and hearing the shout accordingly but even if the distance is halved this has the effect of reducing the time between the collision and the shout to about 5 seconds which I consider is more consistent with the circumstances of this incident. Taking these factors into consideration I judge that the tender was making at least 6-7 knots and probably 12 knots more.  </p>

He indicated that it was happening within his line of sight and to his right. I take this to be evidence that he had not passed the area where jumping was taking place and I consider that this accords with the Claimant swimming in a position off the rocks where she indicated that she left her beach bag and where she probably entered the water. The photographs indicate a row of yellow buoys to the East of the wooden jetty which probably mark an exclusive swimming area. From the evidence available I consider that they were probably in place at the relevant time but in any event, they appear to be considerably less than 50 metres from the shore line, and I consider that the collision took place outside the line of those buoys in a position about 60 metres from the shore. The Claimant suffered injuries which included those in the area of her left buttock. It is therefore probable that she was swimming in a direction, which was substantially away from the direction from which the tender was approaching. Miss Prager submitted that it was significant that the Claimant had no recollection of the tender approaching but this is not surprising if she was hit by a boat coming from behind her.  </p>

To reach his conclusion the judge considered the meaning of the words of a ‘vessel or boat used in navigation’. The learned Judge referred to the International Collision Regulations and said: “<span style="font-style:italic">These regulations apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> He also stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">Even though I hold that a jet ski is not a boat or other description of vessel used in navigation, the Collision Regulations contain a standard to care to which the driver of a jet ski should conform. Any failure to conform to that standard of care would amount to negligence</span>”, however there can be no doubt that if he had found that the jet ski was ‘<span style="font-style:italic">a boat or other description of vessel used in navigation</span>’ he would have held that the jet ski ought to comply with the Collision Regulations themselves. Although a jet ski did not conform to that description I have no doubt that a RIB such as the tender does and therefore, in English law, the Collision Regulations do apply to the navigation of vessels in waters navigable by seagoing ships, which Lindos bay clearly was. </p>

That being so if there are local rules relating to the relevant waters which set a standard of navigational behaviour these will be relevant. Against that background it is interesting to consider whether the Collision Regulations apply in Greece. It is common ground that in 1974 Greece ratified the Collision Regulations which have been incorporated into Greek law. Although Mr Gerassimou contends that they only apply in cases where there has been an actual collision between vessels it is clear on their actual wording that they are intended to regulate the general conduct and navigation of vessels on the high seas and waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels. It is difficult to accept that Greek law does not expect the navigation of vessels to comply with rules 5 and 6 at all times.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">In their Joint Report it is stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">if the UK Court finds that the RIB was sailing in a bathing facilities area and within a distance less than on hundred (100)meters from the buoys, it falls within the scope of Art.20(4)a</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and “<span style="font-style:italic">Art 20(4)c clearly refers to areas which do not fall  into the definition of a “bathing zone”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Thus it appears that they agree to the application of Art. 20(4)(a) if the court to decides that the area is a ‘bathing facilities area’. However, as I have already set out above I do not consider that sufficient information has been provided for that purpose.  Further the experts did not agree as to whether Art.20(4)(b) applies because it is uncertain whether the area was equipped with buoys in July 2013.  However it does appear that they both accept that Art. 20(4)(c) restricts speed to 5 knots within 200 meters of the shore even where the area is not considered to be a ‘<span style="font-style:italic">bathing zone</span>’ and whether there are swimmers in the area or not. The experts have also referred to Art.20(5) which restricts the speed of motorboats departing from or returning to the shore to 5 knots. The experts are unable to agree whether this would apply in this case because although the tender closed the shore whilst looking for a mooring place for the Enigma it did not actually ‘<span style="font-style:italic">depart from or return to</span>’ the shore. As they both agree that 20(4)c applies to all vessels within 200 metres of the shore I do not consider that this dispute needs to be resolved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">The experts also referred to Article 31 which deals with the passage of boats to and from their mooring places, including ports, marinas, shelters and slipways, which appear to indicate that vessels may move for this purpose providing they use the channels designated and move at a speed of less than 3 knots if there are no bathers within a distance of 100 meters or if there are bathers they move at a safe speed not exceeding one (1) knot whilst keeping a course directly to or from the open sea. Again there is a difference between the experts as to whether this article is applicable based upon the argument as to whether the tender was approaching or leaving a mooring place.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Whilst it has not been possible to ascertain whether the individual regulations apply to the particular circumstances of Lindos Bay it is clear that the general purpose of these regulations is to preserve the safety of swimmers. The experts are in agreement that Art.20(4)(c) is of general application to vessels within a distance of 200 meters from the shore and sets a speed limit of 5 knots.  Clearly any vessel within that area which exceeds that speed is not operating a safe speed as contemplated by the regulations.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in">Whilst I consider that there may be room for doubt as to whether Article 31 rule is strictly applicable to the movements of the tender in this case the Article is of considerable interest because it indicates what the makers of the regulations consider are safe speeds when navigating in the vicinity of swimmers. In that case 1 knot is considered to be the safe speed unless the swimmers are in excess of 100 metres from the boat in which case upto 3 knots is considered safe. I consider that these are sensible standards to be adopted whenever swimmers are in the water near to a vessel whether or not in areas which have been specifically designated as a <span style="font-style:italic">bathing facilities area.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">I find that, at the material time, the tender driven by the First Defendant was leaving the bay on an Easterly heading at a distance of about 60 metres from the shore. When the First Defendant heard the shout, the tender had passed the position where the Claimant was in the water. On Mr Gultepe’s own evidence, as to how he turned his vessel and returned to the Claimant, the tender must have passed very close to if not over the position in which the Claimant then was.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">That conclusion conforms with the evidence of Mr Melis, which I accept, that he saw the Claimant in the water and that he saw a vessel cross her position. That was the same vessel which returned and picked up the Claimant which, it is common ground, was the tender driven by Mr Gultepe. I also accept that Mr Melis heard a “dull sound”. In my view that was caused by the tender colliding with the Claimant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">With respect to the relevance of whether Mr Gultepe was aware of having struck anything. Mr Melis’ evidence is that he heard a “dull sound”. Noise travels across water and it is not uncommon for those outside a boat under power to hear noises emanating from it even though the same sounds may be less audible or even inaudible to those within it. As to whether the driver of a RIB would actually feel a movement caused by a collision with a body depends upon the nature of the collision itself.   In my view it is possible for a RIB making 6-7 knots or more to strike a person and for the driver to be unaware of the collision or, if the driver did feel something, for him to be unaware of the reason for such sensation.  Mr Gultepe did not see the Claimant and was not paying attention to the presence of swimmers. Therefore, he would have no reason to immediately associate a noise or similar sensation with striking a person. In any event I did not consider that Mr Gultepe was a reliable witness and I do not consider his assertion that he was not aware of something unusual before he heard the Claimant shout as a good basis for rejecting the evidence of Mr Melis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept Miss Prager’s argument that the Claimant had been injured at an earlier stage, either by jumping or falling off the rocks at the entrance to the bay or by being hit by another vessel. The Claimant’s evidence was that she had never jumped from the rocks in the past and the evidence of the pathologists makes it clear that the Claimant’s injuries could not have occurred as a result of jumping or falling from the rocks as they were not of a sufficient height. However, I find that the evidence of the pathologists is to the effect that the Claimant’s injuries were consistent with being struck by a vessel making 6-7 knots or more.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant’s expert also stated that it was improbable for the Claimant to have been in the water in an injured state for a matter of more than a few minutes without drowning. The evidence as to how busy the bay was at the material time was contradictory, but the evidence was that the tender was the only vessel actually in the vicinity of the Claimant at the material time. There is no evidence of any other vessel being sufficiently close to the Claimant to have inflicted her injuries within the time span of a few minutes of her being picked up by the First Defendant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that the First Defendant did not see the Claimant before he heard the shout but, in my judgment, whilst heading on an exit route from the bay about 60 meters offshore he should have seen her if he had been keeping a proper lookout whether or not it was his vessel which was involved in the collision. He admitted that he did not have the possible presence of swimmers in mind. However, he was operating in an area where he could see that there were swimmers, and, in my judgment, he certainly should have had the presence of swimmers very much in mind. In my view, having found that there was no mooring place for Enigma in the bay, he was probably concerned to get back to the yacht and get under way for an alternative mooring place for the night. He had Dennis in the tender and it highly probable that the attention of both Dennis and Mr Gultepe were distracted by the presence and antics of the young people jumping from the rock nearer the entrance of the bay. In my view these may have been, and probably were factors, as to why Mr Gultepe failed to see the Claimant in the water before he heard the shout. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.76in;text-indent:0.5in">It is noteworthy that the Claimant was seen by Mr Melis prior to the collision but she was not seen by the First Defendant. That is consistent with my view that he was not keeping a proper lookout as he should have been. He was in an area where there were known to be swimmers, it was high summer, there would have been persons swimming from boats moored in the bay and he could see the persons jumping from the higher rocks. He should, in my judgment, have been particularly vigilant for people swimming but it was his own evidence that he was not thinking about swimmers. In my view he should have been keeping a good lookout for swimmers and if he had been he should have seen the Claimant. Aside from the evidence of Mr Melis it is a striking feature of this case that, on his own evidence, Mr Gultepe must have passed very close to her and did not see her. Even if she had been injured by another vessel and was simply floating in the water as he approached it is not explained why he did not see her at that time.  </p>

As I have said that finding as to speed is consistent with the pathologists’ evidence as to the cause of the Claimant’s injuries. I therefore reject Miss Prager’s submissions that it was not possible for the tender/RIB to have caused the Claimant’s injuries. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">With respect to whether the injuries were caused by the negligence or fault of Mr Gultepe I have no doubt that they were. For reasons already set out I  consider that Mr Gultepe failed to keep a good lookout and consider that if he had he should have seen the Claimant, reduced speed and taken care to avoid the Claimant. It has often been observed that good seamanship is a matter of common sense and I also consider that the speed at which the tender was being navigated was excessive in the conditions and place where the tender was being operated. In my judgment a proper speed whilst operating in an area where swimmers are known to be is 3 knots or less. If swimmers are known to be in close proximity then a lower speed should be used or the vessel should be stopped until the safety of the swimmers is assured. This view is supported by the terms of the local regulations. It is also to be noted that for a speed boat, which includes this tender, to make in excess of 5 knots within 200 metres of a shoreline is prohibited by the regulations. Making as it was at least 6-7 knots and most probably 1-2 knots more the tender was being navigated at an improper speed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Further it is significant in the present case that the speed of the vessel materially contributed to the extent of the injuries suffered by the Claimant. If the tender had been making 1-3 knots, as I find it should have been, not only would Mr Gultepe have been more likely to see the Claimant, but it is probable that her injuries would have been significantly reduced. </p>
