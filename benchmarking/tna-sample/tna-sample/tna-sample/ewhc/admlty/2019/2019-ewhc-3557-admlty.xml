      <p style="margin-right:0.04in">1.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In this matter three Claimants, hereafter “KML”, “SSL” and “FDEC” respectively, seek remuneration for salvage services performed to the Defendant’s vessel “KUZMA MININ” (“the Vessel”)  on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2018. This present hearing arises from the Claimant’s application for judgment in default of acknowledgment of service, pursuant to CPR 61.9. The claimants submit that they are entitled to an award of salvage remuneration at common law in accordance with the Salvage Convention 1989, as enacted by the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Alternatively the Claimants contend that they are entitled to remuneration by way of restitution assessed on a <span style="font-style:italic">quantum meruit </span>basis. Unusually, Mr Kemp, of HFW, has gone so far as to propose that the appropriate level for the quantification of an award is £550,000. </p>

By an Order dated the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019, in claim No AD 2019 000001 brought by Glander International Bunkering DMCC, the court gave judgment and ordered that the Vessel should be appraised and sold by the Admiralty Marshal. The Vessel has since been duly appraised and sold by the Admiralty Marshal. The appraisal is confidential to the Admiralty Marshal but the sale price is known as the proceeds of sale have been paid into Court. That sum is $1,003,000. In addition to Glander International Bunkering DMCC there are two other cautioners, namely the MCA, represented by Stephenson Harwood, and Redwater NV, represented by Hill Dickinson.  </p>

The Application Notice was supported by a witness statement of Mr Duncan Hedar dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2019 which also sought a stay of the Claimant’s application for default judgment. I informed Mr Phillips of this development on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2019 by email and indicated that the application should be heard before judgment was given and added “<span style="font-style:italic">if some agreement can be reached as to an exchange of documents and possibly written submissions and as to a time for that it may be possible to avoid a hearing and for me to reconsider my present draft in the light of any new submissions.

FDEC also worked to procure the charter of "CANNIS" from Fowey Harbour Commissioners on an emergency basis, for additional towage.

"ST PIRAN" grounded briefly during the operation but the Master was able to free her without damage to the tug and thereafter she continued to participate in the salvage operation.

Once the messenger lines were attached to the casualty, Mr Rogers manoeuvred the RIB to pass through the breaking surf at speed whilst paying out the messenger lines, then passed the messenger lines to the tugs waiting beyond the surf. The RIB made a number of these trips across the surf. It was necessary for Mr Rogers to exercise care to prevent the messenger lines being fouled in the RIB's propellers which also involved Mr Ben Rowe and Mr Johns in tending and paying out the messenger lines so as to connect them to the tugs. The RIB was swamped on more than one occasion whilst passing the lines to the tugs.

"ST PIRAN" was the first tug to be connected to the stern of the Vessel at around 1045 followed by "ANKORVA" to the stern at around 1055 and "PERCUIL" to the port bow at around 1115. Once connected, the tugs took the strain to hold the casualty in its position and prevent her being pushed further ashore upon the rising tide. The tow lines from the “ANKORVA” and the “PERCUIL” parted on more than one occasion and had to be replaced using the RIB. These tugs were, however, not able to free the casualty which was pounding on the reef.  At about this time Mr Rogers smelt heavy fuel oil and could see traces of fuel in the water. There was concern that one of the double bottom bunker oil tanks had breached on the reef. High tide was at 1315 and Captain Rowe and Mr Rogers were concerned that if the casualty could not be freed before the tide turned then she was very likely to become more heavily aground and would incur significant structural damage resulting in the salvage operation becoming more difficult. On board the casualty Captain Rowe and Captain Gurd had attempted to assist the tug’s efforts by heaving on the casualty’s port bow anchor but this failed because the anchor dragged and was finally hove in.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.03in;margin-right:0.04in">KML's tug "SARAH GREY" arrived on the scene at about 1149. It was considered too hazardous to deploy "SARAH GREY"'s heavy anchors and instead she was ordered to push on the casualty’s starboard side which was attempted at about 1220. However, this also proved to be dangerous and she was subsequently ordered to pull ahead using her long emergency rope towline. “SARAH GREY”, using the RIB to pass the line, was made fast and was pulling ahead by about 1300. With the “SARAH GREY” pulling ahead, the heading of the casualty was altered away from the reef which reduced her pounding. The “ANKORVA” was then reconnected at the port bow, again assisted by the RIB, and with both tugs pulling at full speed some forward movement was observed. At that time the Pilot ordered the casualty’s engine to be used and the heading was turned to just East of South.  </p>

At the same time the "PERCUIL" assisted by pulling on the starboard bow and the "ST PIRAN" assisted by controlling the stern, respectively. At about 1430 the casualty was afloat and was towed to seaward. By this time the wind had reduced to South Westerly a moderate breeze and the swell was reducing.  </p>

His first general submissions are to the effect that it is apparent that the intervention is to minimise the quantum of any award to reserve the Interveners’ own prospects of recovery under the mortgage on the vessel, the submissions made by the Interveners in seeking to minimise the efforts of the salvors are unjustified and that the further evidence has been provided to meet the charges of exaggeration raised.

He has also pointed out that PJSC has not provided evidence, or even contended for a particular salved value, and that the deductions put forward are derived by FDEC for the relevant repair work following an inspection after the salvage operations and reflect an estimate grounded in commercial reality. Although Mr Phillips has referred to the submission made by PJSC, relating to the submission that the valuation put forward is based on a demolition value, it is unclear whether Mr Phillips has accepted that is a correct assertion.

The Claimant submits that it is inadmissible citing <span style="font-style:italic">Rogers v Hoyle, Sec. of State for Transport intervening </span>[2014] EWHC Civ 257 and, further, if admitted it is brief and superficial and should be treated with the utmost caution. The reports of the HFO onboard the Vessel differ from the other evidence. The MAIB report refers to there being 105 tonnes but there was a bunker survey on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2019 made for the Admiralty Marshal which indicates that there was 129.581 tonnes of HFO and 29.514 tonnes of MDO onboard and the Master of the Vessel informed Captain Rowe that there was about 129 tonnes of HFO onboard. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-style:italic">Risk of oil pollution. </span> Mr Phillips has submitted that although the MAIB report, upon which PJSC relies,  reports a single breached fuel oil tank it does not identify the tank. However the bunker survey report states that HFO tank 6 was holed to the sea or to an adjacent ballast tank, HFO tank 7 was holed to the sea, HFO tank 9 was holed to an adjacent ballast tank and MGO tank 13 was holed to an adjacent ballast tank. That is consistent with a vessel in very poor condition. The diving survey and survey undertaken for the Admiralty Marshal has indicated about 7 fractures in way of tanks 5, 7 and 9a, that there is considerable damage to fuel tanks to sea and to ballast tanks and no. 6 tank was showing a level close to that of No.7 which was known to be holed. The Vessel was therefore in poor condition, was unable to ballast down and pounding on the reef. Captain Gurd’s concerns, expressed in his witness statement, as to the future of the Vessel if she remained aground were justified. Gyllyngvase Beach is an important local asset. There was a real risk of catastrophic pollution. Further the MAIB report recognises that the response to the casualty was timely and prevented a more prolonged operation and pollution. Although PJSC contends that no anti-pollution equipment was deployed the evidence of Mr Rogers and Captain Gurd contradicts this, KML mobilised its floating oil boom and the Harbour Master deployed counter pollution and control contractors. </p>

The Judge at first instance, Leggatt J, after careful consideration concluded that, notwithstanding the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hollington v Hewthorn </span>[1943] KB 587 (CA), it was permissible to admit such a report both with respect to the factual matters recorded and with respect to the expressions of opinion made by the authors of the report although the weight to be placed upon such information was a matter for the judge. In the Court of Appeal Christopher Clarke LJ, with whom both Arden and Treacey LJJ agreed, gave a judgment which affirmed Leggatt J’s decision and distinguished the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hollington v Hewthorn</span>. Both of the judgments considered the position of marine accident inquiries (or ‘wreck inquiries’ as the procedure used to be known) and drew attention to the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Waddle v Wallsend Shipping Co Ltd </span>[1952] and <span style="font-style:italic">The European Gateway </span>[1987] QB 206 . The first was concerned with fatal accident claims arising from the loss of the ship and the second with a collision between ships both of which required the court to evaluate the fault of owners of the ships. In both cases there had been reports made following the relevant wreck inquiry. The report was not put in evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">Waddle</span> but was referred to before the judge, Devlin J, who expressed the view that it was inadmissible but went on to express the further view that it would be helpful if ‘the relevant authorities’ should consider whether it would be sensible if such reports were made available to the court. In <span style="font-style:italic">The European Gateway </span>the question which arose before Steyn J, as he then was, was whether the findings of the court of formal investigation gave rise to an issue estoppel. Steyn J held that it did not because the court of investigation was not a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the issue of the owners’ civil liability. However Steyn J repeated the recommendation made by Devlin J referred to above. As Leggatt J observed those recommendations have still not been implemented. In <span style="font-style:italic">Rogers v Hoyle </span>Christopher Clarke J also considered the question of MAIB reports and noted that until 2005 they were regarded as admissible in civil proceedings, as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Margolle v Delta Maritime Co. Ltd </span>[2003] 1 All ER, when regulations were introduced making the reports inadmissible. Since then the Regulations contained in the Merchant Shipping (Accident and Investigation) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1743) have been implemented. Regulation 14(14) provides that if any part of an MAIB report, or any analysis it contains, is based on information obtained pursuant to an inspector’s powers under ss.259 and 267(8) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 that part of the report is “<span style="font-style:italic">inadmissible in any judicial proceedings </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">whose purpose is to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">attribute or apportion liability or blame</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unless a Court, having regard to the factors mentioned in regulation 13(5)(b) or (c), determines otherwise</span>” (emphasis added).  As Christopher Clarke LJ observed “<span style="font-style:italic">This appears to contemplate that such a report is or may be prima facie admissible</span>”.  Upon that basis it appears to me that the Court has a discretion as to whether or not to admit it and applying the same process of reasoning to MAIB reports as was set out with respect to the AAIB reports in <span style="font-style:italic">Rogers v Hoyle </span>it would appear sensible to admit the MAIB report in the present case. </p>

As the present proceedings are solely dealing with issues of salvage and not the apportionment of fault or blame it appears to me that the 2012 Regulation does not prevent the MAIB report from being admitted in evidence.

It follows that this is a case in which it is proper to make an award of salvage assessed upon the principles set out in Art.13 of the Convention. It is to be noted that Mr Turner QC, counsel for PJSC, has not advanced any argument that the services performed were not salvage but expressly accepts that an award of salvage remuneration would be proper. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">However in the absence of salvage, by agreement or otherwise, a claimant may be able to recover on the basis of quantum meruit but, in my view, only where he can establish that there is in existence an express or implied contract for the provision of some services other than salvage, for example towage.  Thus I do not accept that it is open to a claimant to simply assert a right to a recovery based upon quantum meruit as an alternative claim if he fails to establish that the circumstances are such as to render the case one of salvage. In my view this is made clear by the dictum of Bowen LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co. </span>(1886) 34 Ch D. 234 at 248 where it was said: “<span style="font-style:italic">The general principle is, beyond all question, that work and labour done or money expended by one man to preserve or benefit the property of another do not according to English law create any lien upon the property saved or benefited, nor, even if standing alone, create any obligation to repay the expenditure. Liabilities are not to be forced upon people behind their backs any more than you can confer a benefit upon a man against his will. There is an exception to this proposition in the maritime law. I mention it because the word “salvage” has been used from time to time throughout the argument, and some analogy is sought to be established between salvage and the right claimed by the Respondents. With regard to salvage, general average, and contribution, the maritime law differs from the common law. That has been so from the time of the Roman law downwards. The maritime law, for the purposes of public policy and for the advantage of trade, imposes in these cases a liability upon the thing saved, a liability which is a special consequence arising out of the character of mercantile enterprises, the nature of sea perils, and the fact that the thing saved was saved under great stress and exceptional circumstances. No similar doctrine applies to things lost upon land, nor to anything except ships or goods in peril at sea.</span>”  </p>

I agree with him. Mr Phillips has drawn the Court’s attention to the fact that under the rules there is no requirement for service of the application notice or the supporting evidence on the defendant to the <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> claim. CPR Part 61 contains no such requirement and, aside from the position in relation to cautioners who must be served in accordance with CPR Part 61.9(4), CPR 61.9(3) only requires that the application notice and evidence are to be filed. Further CPR Part 12.11(2) provides in terms that “<span style="font-style:italic">Any evidence relied on by the claimant in support of his application need not be served on a party who has failed to file an acknowledgment of service.</span>”. Mr Phillips has therefore submitted that it is not necessary to serve the Defendants and that this is consistent with the policy in respect of a default judgment which is only sought in circumstances where the defendant has already failed to engage in the proceedings. I consider that Mr Phillips’ approach is correct and hold that all procedural requirements for the present application have been satisfied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">The majority of salvage awards are made by arbitrators appointed by the Committee of Lloyds to consider the awards arising from arbitrations heard arising under the Lloyds Forms of Salvage agreement, referred to for these purposes as the Lloyds Open Form (“LOF”), although more recent editions have come to be known as the Lloyds Standard Form. The Lloyds Open Form was developed from 1890 onwards and the first standard edition came into existence on January 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> 1908. According to an Article by Mr Michael Buckley of Waltons &amp; Morse, Mr William Walton, later Sir William Walton, was appointed as the original arbitrator but subsequently senior members of the Admiralty Bar were appointed. Since 1908 there have been many editions of the LOF culminating in the most recent, promulgated in 2011. In general, it can be said that the changes have mirrored the tensions between the salvors and the insurance underwriters, the former seeking as large an award as possible and the latter seeking to ensure that payments for salvage were not excessive. The earliest LOF forms contained a space into which the amount of the award could be added. It appears that, originally that would be completed with a figure and that the purpose of the arbitration was to consider whether that was or was not a fair sum. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">After a period the practice developed that the form would be left blank leaving the consideration of a fair award entirely to the arbitrator. Later editions of the form omitted the space referring to the sum to be awarded and it has not, for very many years, been the practice for parties to submit an actual figure for the services. In fact it has been the convention that Admiralty practitioners would refrain from mentioning a specific figure to the tribunal considering the quantum of a fair salvage remuneration and have been discouraged from doing so. However in certain specific circumstances, usually where the services have been particularly meritorious and/or the salved fund has been modest, it has been accepted practice for the advocate to urge the arbitrator towards making as generous award as possible by making submissions, such as, that it would be appropriate to award “<span style="font-style:italic">a moiety</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">something greater than a moiety</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic"> a very substantial proportion</span>” of the salved fund.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">Nonetheless the principles to be applied in assessing an award are the same in Court and the procedure adopted has been virtually identical so that Admiralty practitioners have adopted the same practice in salvage claims coming before the courts. The precise reason for the convention referred to is obscure but I think it probably arose because the arbitrators and the Admiralty judges considered that to actually suggest a figure for the award may be considered to be usurping the tribunal’s function. There is some force in this observation where, as in the present case, Mr Kemp has made it known that the figure put forward has been arrived at by reason of an “inter office round robin”. This has the appearance of an overt attempt to influence the tribunal by the introduction of the views of persons who are not part of the decision making process. In my view such a process is to be discouraged. In any event the convention referred to above is of long standing and I can see no reason why it should be altered now.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">In fairness to Mr Kemp it is possible that he mentioned a precise figure in the present case in an attempt to avoid a hearing by bringing the application for judgment in line with the procedure set out in CPR Part 12.4(1), ie. with respect to claims for a specified sum of money. On this it is to be observed that CPR Part 61.9(3)(b) does indicate that an application other than in a collision case may be made in accordance with CPR Part 12 “<span style="font-style:italic">with any necessary modifications</span>”. However I consider that the attempt to have the matter decided ‘on paper’ and without a hearing in the present case was procedurally incorrect. That is because the procedure in CPR Part 12.4(1)(b) provides, in cases where a liquidated sum is not claimed, that the court may give judgment but make an order for the ‘damages to be assessed’ which means that there is bound to be a hearing at least with respect to the quantum of the claim. Further, in the Admiralty Court, it has always been the practice that the court should, when making an order for default judgment, be satisfied that the quantum claimed is proper upon a hearing in open court. This is particularly relevant where there are other potentially interested parties such as cautioners as the Admiralty Judge has already indicated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">The awards in previous claims put forward by the Claimants. </span>It is to be noted that Mr Kemp has exhibited two awards made by arbitrators in previous cases. They are: (i) the <span style="font-style:italic">The Rea</span> made by Mr Geoffrey Brice QC in 1979 and (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">The Skopelos</span> made by Mr Lionel Persey QC in 2018. The propriety of doing so was considered by Peter Gross QC, as he then was, sitting as a Deputy Admiralty Judge in <span style="font-style:italic">The St John </span>[1999] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 883<span style="font-style:italic">. </span> He considered that it was helpful to be provided with recent comparators of salvage awards given but, as he recognised, each case depends upon its own facts. Insofar as Mr Kemp appears to rely upon the decisions provided it is, I think, to demonstrate that even where services are of short duration nonetheless the fact that they were performed “in the nick of time” is an important feature when considering the overall award. With respect to Mr Kemp that is not a principle for which he required the support of earlier decisions. Aside from that so far as <span style="font-style:italic">The Skopelos</span> is concerned the circumstances, service and salved values are so different from the present that I do not consider that it affords me any real assistance. With respect to <span style="font-style:italic">The Rea</span> it is by no means a recent award and it is a fact that perception of the dangers arising from pollution are taken more seriously today than was the case 40 years ago. Further it is to be noted that there are major differences in the present case because the casualty in the present case was already aground and required the use of 5 tugs and other equipment to salve her whereas in <span style="font-style:italic">The Rea</span> the casualty had not grounded and therefore whether she would or the manner in which she would ground were still matters for argument. My impression is that the dangers and services in the present case are of such a nature as to distinguish them from the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">The Rea. </span>Insofar as Mr Kemp relies upon <span style="font-style:italic">The Rea</span> to support a suggestion of a figure of about 20% of the salved fund and therefore his proposed figure of £550,000, using a percentage comparison has the drawback of depending upon what is found to be the proper salved value. In my view neither of the awards mentioned provided me with more than minimal assistance. Bearing those matters in mind I turn to the criteria set out in Art.13. </p>

Also mentioned in <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy</span> are the decisions of Clarke J, as he then was, in<span style="font-style:italic"> The Yolaine </span>[1995] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 7 and Gross J, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Crown </span>[2009] EWHC 3040 (Admlty); [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 468. In the first Clarke J. reiterated the principle referred to above. As he said “<span style="font-style:italic">One method of arriving at that value is to ascertain the sound value of the vessel and to deduct the reasonable cost of repairs</span>”. He then proceeded to assess the value of the vessel on the evidence available to him. For present purposes the relevance of <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Crown </span>is Gross J’s consideration of the effect of the size of an award and the importance of the salved fund in establishing that award.

Rep 507</span>” [para 3-100]. That was an American case but the same practice is well established in England. In many cases, where at least the salvage award is contested, the parties may each put forward their own valuations and the tribunal will decide the salved values as an exercise of discretion on a balance of the evidence provided.  </p>

In this case Mr Phillips has submitted that the fund is to be evaluated as at the termination and place of the services and that the valuation certificate should be taken as the only evidence of the casualty’s sound value at that time. In the absence of any other information that is probably the only course available to a tribunal. However CPR Part 61.9(3)(a)(iii) requires that the evidence filed must be to the satisfaction of the court. The general importance of this is to ensure that the decision does not compromise the rights of any other claimant which is of particular importance where the vessel has been sold and the fund paid into court is known and is somewhat limited. In my view the court should endeavour to ensure its decision is based upon evidence which it considers satisfactory.  </p>

In the present case no expert has actually expressed an opinion and all the certificate provides is apparently an answer provided by a computer.

The certificate provided states the valuation date was 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2018 which is the date of the termination of the services and the value given is $3.57 million. It sets out the particulars of the casualty. These are that she was a Handy Bulk Carrier, flagged in Russia, of 23,200 DWT, length overall 180.5m and powered by a MAN engine. She was built in Germany in 1980 and at the material time it appears that her class was suspended. The certificate does not state that the Vessel was inspected by the valuers but states “<span style="font-style:italic">The model is calibrated using confirmed sales prior to the date of valuation. Sales in circumstances which make them unreflective of fair market value (e.g. with charter) are excluded. Calibration is performed by computational algorithms which automatically adjust the parameters of the mathematical functions to best fit the sales data using, nonlinear, constrained and weighted regression analysis. The software is run daily to ensure valuations reflect the latest sales and earnings information</span>”. The disclaimer also states that the “<span style="font-style:italic">Market Value is provided is an estimate of fair price, … and is based on the Vessels Value estimates as its opinion in good faith</span>”. The certificate has very limited information as to how the calculation is achieved but states that the valuation of the Vessel’s market value is estimated using five factors: (i) type, (ii) features recorded in the vessels database, (iii) age, (iv) cargo capacity and (v) freight earnings.  </p>

It is to be noted that there are no comparables provided after the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2018 which I find surprising as a sale soon after the relevant date ought to be considered relevant. It certainly would be if the exercise was to consider charter rates for a vessel in a loss of use claim. Further it is to be noted that all the comparables have a larger carrying capacity than the casualty and they are all of more recent build by at least 14 years. The nearest of the comparables in terms of age are (i) <span style="font-style:italic">Amsel</span>, 27,300 DWT, built 1994, sale price $2.2 million, (ii)<span style="font-style:italic"> Hai Xing</span>, 29,500 DWT, built 1998, sale price $3.6 million and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">Mount Travers</span>,28,500 DWT, built 2002, sale price $6 million. There is no apparent reason why the value of $3.57 million is almost the same as that in the case of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hai Xing</span> which was larger and younger by about 18 years. On the face of the data apparently used there is no rational explanation as to why the <span style="font-style:italic">Amsel</span> has not been highlighted as the only real comparable and even then she is larger by some 4,000 DWT and younger by some 14 years. Logically it is highly improbable that the value of the present casualty exceeded that of the <span style="font-style:italic">Amsel</span> and given the differences in carrying capacity and age it appears to me that a true sound value of the present casualty should be less than the value of the $2.2 million comparable.

In the first Mr Adrian Economakis has provided an explanation as to the data which lies behind vessel valuations and “<span style="font-style:italic">how it is collected, validated and managed</span>”.  Part of that includes a collection of information leading to the “sales database”. The second is composed by Dr Alex Adamou in which he describes “<span style="font-style:italic">the mathematical models and computational algorithms behind VesselsValue automated online valuations.</span>” In this, inter alia, he acknowledges the difficulties in co-relating the various data basis derived from information which, as I understand it, is fed into the system. From his description I understand that one of the most reliable indicators is the actual age of the vessel. For these purposes it is to be noted that the paper accepts that there is room for error which, tested against 2,069 “<span style="font-style:italic">backvaluations</span>” has indicated an accuracy range which is impressively small in a large number of cases but rises to plus or minus 30% when taken overall. As the document states: “<span style="font-style:italic">Although it would be hubris to claim that our valuations were entirely error free, there are many reasons why a valuation might differ from the actual sale price. For example, the vessel may have a particularly good or bad survey position.</span>”  In general I accept that this type of system is a valid tool in seeking to value a vessel which may provide a helpful addition to the traditional valuation exercises undertaken by shipbrokers and, so it would appear, may form a basis for many future ship valuations. However, being computerised, it is only as reliable as the information upon which it relies. Thus it is as much open to scrutiny as the ship brokers who traditionally performed this exercise.  </p>

That document was provided by A&amp;P Group Limited however it is only an ‘initial indication of price’ which is subject to inspection of the damage on arrival in dock. Given the extensive nature of the bottom damage to the Vessel as indicated by the diving and tank surveys it is, at least, possible that if repairs had actually been carried out the work needed would have been more extensive and thus more expensive. In my view this estimate can only be taken as providing some guidance as to what the repair costs might have been.  </p>

However the eighth edition of <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy &amp; Rose </span> at paragraph 15-018,  to which Mr Phillips has properly drawn my attention on the question of the effect to be given in respect of the actual sale, acknowledges that sales made after the termination of the salvage services may constitute evidence of the salved value, depending upon the nature of the sale and whether there have been fluctuations in the market after the services have terminated. It is also suggested at paragraph 15-019 that sales by the courts are generally to be regarded as “<span style="font-style:italic">forced sales which do not necessarily give a true reflection of the market value of the property.</span>” These views clearly do not exclude sales by the court from being taken into account although there may be questions as to the weight which should be given to that information. Moreover a submission that the court sale price is irrelevant does not lie easily with earlier judicial decisions as to the regard which should be paid to the effect of a sale by the Admiralty Marshal. Paragraph 15-017 of the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition of <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy &amp; Rose</span> notes: “<span style="font-style:italic">Where salved values have been appraised by the Admiralty Marshal, the general rule is that the appraisement is conclusive – The Duc Checchi (1872) L.R.4 A&amp;E 35n</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">. </span> Further the statement made in <span style="font-style:italic">The Gaupen</span>, above, indicates that the price to be taken is that which would be achieved if the “<span style="font-style:italic">Marshal had to sell the ship and cargo at </span>[the time when the services were terminated]”. It has frequently been stated that a sale by the Admiralty Marshal may have an element of being a “<span style="font-style:italic">forced sale</span>” in the sense that the owner is not a party to it and the Marshal is acting under the direction of the court nonetheless no one is forcing the purchaser to buy<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and it does provide some indication of what the vessel is worth on the open market.

As indicated above I consider that the sound value put forward is suspect. The salved value put forward for the Vessel is also suspect because the information to support the estimate of the deductions is, in my view unsatisfactory. In these circumstances I do not think that it would be correct to ignore the actual sale price, as Mr Phillips urges me to do. As a matter of fact, there is nothing to suggest that the state of the casualty had materially deteriorated over a period of only 3 months or that there was a fluctuation of the market or that either of those factors singly or jointly could have resulted in the loss of so large a proportion of the casualty’s apparent value. In my view the reality must be that, at the time of termination, the sound value of the casualty was considerably lower than the figure put forward by the Claimants. </p>

I consider that it is appropriate to take as the starting point the value of the nearest comparable at $2.2 million. In my view the other comparables provided were so different in size and age as to be of little material assistance. That vessel was younger and larger than the casualty which was, therefore, probably of a lesser value. I consider that should be taken as being $2,000,000.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">As to deductions there is no doubt that the casualty suffered significant physical damage whilst aground. The evidence provided is that the damage was extensive and significant. There is uncertainty as to whether repair costs would have been greater than that estimated by the Claimants. Such uncertainty would, at least in part, account for the lower court appraisement and sale price. I have also taken into account the fact that the court sale took place 3 months after termination and that there might have been a reducing market in operation although there is no actual evidence of that. It is also proper to make an allowance for the possibility of some continuing deterioration although I do not expect that would have been of great significance over a relatively short period with a vessel which was already of advanced years. Bearing those matters in mind I have therefore come the conclusion that a proper salved value should be taken as being $1,500,000. Using Mr Kemp’s exchange rate as at the time of the services the figure amounts to £1,186,328.78.  </p>

However as the Vessel had been under arrest for some time it indicates that there must have been a quantity of bunkers onboard at the time of termination of the services. The original estimate put forward by the Claimants was £40,119. Initially the Claimants did not provide the basis for their estimate and Mr Turner has submitted that the figure of 105 tonnes of HFO referred to in the MAIB report should be accepted.

There might have been some consumption between the end of the services and February 2019 but there is no evidence to suggest that further bunkers were taken onboard during that period. Thus the figure provided by R Pearce is probably reasonably accurate as to what was onboard at the relevant time which was also confirmed to Captain Rowe by the Master of the Vessel. In these circumstances I consider that the more accurate figure is 129.581 tonnes rather than the 105 tonnes referred to in the MAIB report. Mr Turner did not take issue as to the relevant price per unit and I therefore consider that the figure put forward by the Claimants is sufficiently accurate for present purposes to be accepted.

On the night of the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>to 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2018 the Vessel was lying to anchor off the Gyllyngvase beach, Falmouth. She had received a weather forecast of high southerly winds and at 2100 on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December the main engine was apparently ordered to immediate readiness. At 0400 (UTC) on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December the wind was southerly gusting in excess of 52 knots. The Vessel began to yaw and at about 0425 she began to drag her anchor towards the North at a rate of about 1.4 knots. Attempts to use the main engine and rudder to check the leeway were unsuccessful. The Master ordered the anchor to be hove in which was completed with difficulty whereupon it was found that the anchor had fouled a length of chain whereupon the main engine was stopped. A further attempt to clear the anchor was unsuccessful and the Vessel continued to drift toward the shore.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">At about 0510 the Vessel was about 6 cables off the beach, heading 274 degrees and making leeway to the North at about 2 knots. At that stage the Master apparently used full port rudder and full ahead on the main engine to attempt to turn the Vessel to the South into the wind.  However at 0515 the Master considered that the Vessel could not clear Pennance Point which lay about half a mile to the West. He therefore stopped his engine. At 0519 the Vessel was within 2 cables of the shallows and the Master ordered that the port anchor be let go.  </p>

As the tide ebbed it is said that the Vessel settled with a 5 degree port list. The tidal information for Falmouth shows that the height at low water was 1.8 metres. The following high water was predicted at 1315 with a height of 4.4 metres. The tidal range was therefore 2.6 metres. The next low water was at 2004 with a height of 1.5 metres which indicates that the range was increasing towards the next spring tide. The wind built up after midnight on the 17th December and remained strong until after 1000 on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December when the wind speed began to abate. The data, taken from Lizzard Point, shows that there were gusts of 61 knots at 0422, 43 knots at 0552, 52 knots at 0737, 35 knots at 0938 and 26 knots at 0953. The wind direction was largely southerly backing and veering from South East to South West.  The shoreline in Falmouth Bay where the Vessel grounded was very exposed to the effect of high winds from the southerly quadrant and in these circumstances it was obvious that sea and swell would be running high. Wave heights of 4.5 metres have been referred to in the evidence. It needs to be remembered that wave height and swell will not drop simultaneously with a drop in the wind force and that it may take a considerable time for them to drop significantly.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">On the evidence available I consider that the Vessel was grounded in a position of considerable danger. Her bow thruster was not working and her port anchor had not held and was eventually hove in. Although she had the use of her main engine her master considered that, even before grounding, she would be unable to clear Pennance Point by using her engine. That demonstrates that the Vessel could not possibly extricate herself from her predicament once she had grounded. Where a vessel has grounded a usual method of holding her in position, of reducing movement and therefore ongoing damage is by ‘ballasting down’. However that was not a realistic option available to this vessel. There was therefore no means available to this vessel to reduce the dangers which she faced. The pre-stranding drafts were reported by the Vessel’s Master, to Captain Rowe when he  boarded which was shortly after 0745, as being 6.8 metre aft and 6 metres amidships. From visual inspection at that time Captain Rowe observed that the Vessel was about 1.5 metres out of draft aft, 1 metre amidships and 1 metre forward although he acknowledges that it was difficult to read the draft cuts and the Vessel had a port list at the time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In her grounded position the Vessel was subjected to high seas and a not inconsiderable tidal range. Although she was built to ice strengthened specifications she was a vessel of considerable age. The Pilot, Captain Gurd, has stated that the Vessel appeared to him to be in very poor condition, that she was pounding heavily and that he was concerned as to whether the Vessel’s bottom and tanks would be breached and whether she might suffer serious structural failure. There is evidence that she did suffer considerable bottom damage in a comparatively short period of time. She was pinned against a rocky shoreline and as long as she was subjected to swell and sea conditions there is reason to expect that the damage to her bottom would worsen. In my view it is proper to accept Captain Gurd’s evidence that he had the concerns which he mentions. He is an experienced mariner who has, so I am informed, no personal interest in the outcome of this case. In my judgment in the sea, swell and tidal  conditions prevailing there was  a considerable risk that the Vessel  would continue to suffer damage and probably be driven further onto the shore. If that occurred then she would also face the danger of being strained and suffering yet further bottom or structural damage. She had grounded at a time of year when bad weather is to be expected. If she was not assisted I consider that further damage to the Vessel over a period of time was inevitable. In my judgment it was only a matter of time before she became a constructive total loss or actual total loss in the sense that she would cease to be worth salving. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows, in my judgment, that the risk of oil pollution was also high. There was already damage in way of the Vessel’s fuel tanks. She was not heavily loaded with fuel but there was sufficient to cause a significant amount of pollution should it escape.  The area is said to be one of particular interest from a tourist and ecological point of view. The risk of any oil pollution is therefore to be taken seriously even in winter and, at the very least, that would involve expense in clean up costs. It is to the credit of the Claimants that, although it did not need to be used, they were equipped with an oil boom and had put it on stand-by. </p>

PJSC disputes this. However it seems to me that there is a danger of losing sight of the underlying purpose of considering the status of a claimant. It needs to be borne in mind that this is merely one aspect to be taken into account when considering the amount of an award. One purpose of an award is to encourage an entity to make itself readily available to perform services and to have the equipment necessary to do so. Thus a salvor which maintains salvage equipment or keeps tugs on salvage station, rather than using them for commercial activities, may reasonably expect to be treated as having a higher salvage status and be rewarded more for so doing than a commercial entity which is prepared to perform salvage when the need for it arises. Similarly the claimant which has the commercial capability to perform services and provides such services when necessary may expect to be treated as having a higher salvage status and receive a more encouraging award than a single vessel company which is not a dedicated salvor in any sense. It is not simply a matter of being ‘dubbed’ a ‘professional salvor’ or not and the status of each claimant needs to be regarded on its own merits in order to assess the level of encouragement for that organisation.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants are a consortium of three organisations which co-operated in performing the salvage services in the present case.  Mr Phillips has made it clear that they seek a single award and therefore I do not consider that it is necessary to treat them separately but will consider them as a single entity which combines the attributes of all three. In my judgment these Claimants are clearly not, individually or collectively, in the highest echelon of salvage organisations. The tugs are  not maintained on salvage station. They are commercial harbour tugs. Nonetheless there is a commitment of capital to some equipment, such as ground tackle, which may be used commercially or for salvage purposes. However there appears to be a willingness to co-operate to perform salvage services when the need arises and this is worthy of encouragement. That is particularly true today when there are far fewer tugs maintained on salvage station and the United Kingdom Government has, since 2011, reduced the number of Emergency Towing Vessels so that there is no longer such an entity standing by in the Western approaches. As a result, it is arguably important to provide encouragement to organisations, such as the present Claimants, to co-operate in performing salvage services in order to maintain sufficient cover to the waters around the shores of the United Kingdom. </p>

In this respect it is said that a briefing took place at 1000 attended by the Harbour Master and representatives of the MCA and the Environment Agency. However it is the evidence of Mr Rogers, Managing Director of the First Claimant, that he and Captain Rowe, Managing Director of the Second Defendant, were the first on shore personnel to be aware of the grounding. It was Captain Rowe who alerted the Falmouth Coastguard and the UK Emergency services. Captain Rowe and Mr Rogers went to the coast and Mr Rogers gave instructions for the KML personnel and equipment to be mobilised. He also liaised with Captain Sansom, the Harbour Master, who stated that the Third Defendant had been informed and was due to indicate the availability of its tugs. At that stage the Harbour Master indicated that he was in contact with the SOSREP who he expected to take over direction of the salvage.

Mr Rogers has said that there was considerable confusion with no shore authority in full command and control of the situation. Whatever the reasoning behind the SOSREP’s decision not to become involved at the outset it does appear to me that he did not and this left a situation where there was no proper overall command of the operation from the shore.</p>

Had it not been for this collaboration it is difficult to see how the salvage operation could have been successful in which case the Vessel would have been left in a dangerous position. It is possible that had Captain Gurd not taken part Captain Rowe would have continued to command the onsite operations but he would have been hampered by not having a person in charge on the deck which would have made the operation considerably more difficult.</p>

It is to be borne in mind that, at this early stage, the use of ground tackle was still being contemplated and that, if the towage attempts before the first high water had been unsuccessful, a later deployment of ground tackle might have become both sensible and possibly decisive. </p>

At 1340 “CANNIS” arrived on the scene and backed her stern to the starboard bow of the casualty, the change of the Vessel’s heading and a moderation of the wind and sea conditions allowing her to do so. She then made fast a towage connection with the assistance of the crew co-ordinated by Captain Rowe on the Vessel’s foredeck. </p>

I do not accept the suggestion that the part played by the Claimants has been exaggerated. Without their personnel and the expertise and courage shown by the crew of the instruments which they provided the operation could not have been successful. Although some allowance must be made because of the organisational part played by the Harbour Master and the more significant part played by Captain Gurd on site and although this operation has been, in my view correctly, described as a most effective and successful co-operative effort it cannot be ignored that the vast majority of the physical work provided and risks run were undertaken by the Claimants. The reality is that without the skill and equipment provided by the Claimants the Vessel would not have been salved when she was.</p>

This suggests that Mulciber Ltd was the owner of the RIB and that the RIB was chartered in for the service. That is surprising because Mr Rogers’ first witness statement does not state that the RIB was chartered in for this service but gives the impression that the RIB was available on a more permanent basis as in paragraph 37 he states: “<span style="font-style:italic">KML maintains access to a high specification offshore RIB available at short notice . . . from its Falmouth Wharves base. . . . I am responsible for this RIB personally and am one of the main designated coxswains</span>”.  There is no evidence which explains who the owner was of the RIB or what the basis of the arrangement was for the use of the RIB by Mr Rogers or KML. I do not consider that this aspect is sufficiently evidenced to allow acceptance of the invoice from Mulciber to be put forward as an expense of the service. However the provision of the RIB was a very useful part of the equipment provided by the Claimants. It is obvious that she needed to be crewed and fuelled. The additional crew members of the RIB appear to have been SSL employees. In my view the provision of the RIB is a matter to be taken into account in assessing the award rather than as a specific expense of the services.</p>

By way of summary I consider that the Vessel was in a dangerous predicament. If unassisted she would most probably have been pushed further aground over the high tide period. The Vessel had already suffered significant damage, she was elderly and apparently not well maintained, and, in my judgment, she would have suffered further damage over the successive tides which were ‘making’. In these circumstances she would probably be subject to hogging stresses, particularly as her after portion appears to have been in deeper water and therefore less likely to be supported at low tide. Over a period of time she would most probably become a constructive total loss or even uneconomic to salve. If further bad weather struck that would be likely to occur within the near future.

Actual damage was suffered by one of the tugs and the Claimants are to be applauded for their services in the face of really testing conditions. The services were successful and, of particular importance in the present case, they were timely. The response was timely and the Vessel was refloated on the high water following her grounding. The successful outcome was brought about by the cooperation of the three Claimants and others, most significantly Captain Gurd, which was very commendable.

However it appears to me that they are both to be regarded as essentially commercial maritime organisations with a willingness to perform salvage if the opportunity should present itself. The Third Claimant is clearly a commercial tug company and its investment in equipment is for that purpose. However it is also prepared to put its equipment at risk in order to provide services when necessary. The input of the Third Claimant is significant because it provided the most powerful instruments used in the services. I do not regard the status of the Claimants, individually or jointly, as being such that they should be rewarded for maintaining a stance as professional salvors. However the fact that they were prepared to co-operate with each other, with Captain Gurd and with Captain Sansom is, in my view, highly meritorious and deserves encouragement. This is particularly true as it appears that there is a lack of emergency towing vessels on station in the area and there was no evidence of any professional salvor offering to take part in these services.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, on the evidence before the court, these salvors deserve an encouraging award which, given the dangers and the nature of the services rendered, may represent a substantial proportion of the salved fund without being unjust to the salved interests. However it is to be recognised that the Pilot also rendered personal services as did the helicopter flight which put him onboard. Captain Sansom also cooperated and contributed to success albeit to a lesser extent. In considering the proper award to these Claimants it is proper to take account of, and make an allowance for, all those who contributed towards success.</p>

Unless further submissions are made about this aspect I consider that is the correct figure for interest to run from the termination of the services. Judgment interest at the rate of 8% from the date the judgment is handed down is also appropriate. </p>

Mr Phillips has submitted that the intervention of PJSC has increased the costs by a significant amount and that PJSC should pay the Claimants’ costs occasioned by the intervention.  Mr Phillips further submits in the alternative that PJSC should bear its own costs of the intervention and that the Claimants should recover their costs from the fund in court. As a further alternative Mr Phillips has submitted that PJSC’s intervention costs should form part of its recovery in its own judgment already obtained against the Vessel. Mr. Turner has made no specific submissions on this aspect but the Application Notice of PJSC dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2019, seeking permission to intervene, is accompanied by a draft Order which seeks costs from the Claimants for the costs of the application.  </p>

In these circumstances the Claimants have sought an order for judgment in default with the quantum of the award to be assessed. PJSC has also obtained a judgment in default with respect to its interest as a mortgagee of the Vessel but has sought to intervene for the purpose of making submissions with respect to the quantum of the salvage award. Mr Phillips has, in my view correctly, submitted that this is done for the purpose of maintaining as large a fund as possible against which the mortgage claim may be enforced. In principle I can see no reason why there should not be such an intervention but where such an intervention takes place it is bound to increase the Claimants’ costs.  </p>

The Claimants’ costs of having the salvage award assessed have certainly been increased by the fact of the intervention in much the same way that they would have been if the Owners of the Vessel had taken part. In these circumstances there is no logical reason why the Claimants should not be entitled to recover those costs against the fund which represents the <span style="font-style:italic">res. </span>In the absence of an effective offer the respondents to an assessment of the salvage award would usually bear their own costs.

Part of that service may include taking a view of the likely salvage award particularly where it is necessary to obtain security for the claim or where the defendant has made an offer to settle the claim. It is less necessary where, as in the present case the Defendants have taken no part in the claim so that the essential job facing the Claimants’ solicitors is a matter of obtaining the necessary evidence and placing that evidence before the court for a decision on the appropriate award.  </p>

In the present case the need for assessing the probable award was not directly necessary for the purposes of furthering the claim and, in my view, the opinions of those directly involved with the claim should have been sufficient and if that team wishes to discuss the matter within the firm of solicitors that is, in my view, a matter for the team acting for the Claimants. Put simply the reasonable costs to be attributed to the conduct of a claim should amount to the cost of the team directly necessary for that purpose and it is not reasonable to expect the parties to provide for an extra 9 members of the firm over and above the team directly engaged.  </p>
