	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On 17 May 2011 the CMA CGM LIBRA, a modern (and laden) container vessel, grounded whilst leaving the port of Xiamen in China. The cost of her salvage was some US $9.5 million and the total claim in General Average by her Owners against Cargo Interests was some US $13 million. 92% of the Cargo Interests paid their contribution to GA but some 8% have refused to do so. The sum payable by those interests is approximately US $800,000 and it is claimed in these proceedings. The claim has given rise to questions of unseaworthiness, due diligence, negligent navigation and causation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In broad terms the Owners say that the cause of the casualty was an uncharted shoal on which the vessel grounded. The Cargo Interests say that the cause of the casualty was the unseaworthiness of the vessel which led to the master’s negligent navigation of the vessel. In particular it was said that the vessel was unseaworthy by reason of the fact that she had an inadequate passage plan, that that inadequacy was a cause of the casualty and that due diligence was not exercised to make the vessel seaworthy. The casualty was thus caused by the Owners’ actionable fault (a breach of Article III rule 1 of the Hague Rules) and so the Cargo Interests are not liable to contribute in GA pursuant to the York Antwerp Rules.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Established principles with regard to seaworthiness and the duty of due diligence pursuant to Article III r.1 of the Hague Rules fall to be applied in the context of two (relatively) recent developments designed to improve the safety of navigation. The first is the recognition by IMO in 1999 that voyage or passage planning should apply to all ships engaged on international voyages. The practice of passage planning was therefore well-established by 2011. The second is the use by ships of electronic charts displayed on an ECDIS, that is, an Electronic Chart Display and Information System. It is right to observe, however, that in 2011 when this casualty occurred, the shipping industry was in the course of changing from paper to electronic charts. In 2011 a ship could satisfy the charts requirement of SOLAS by carrying either paper charts (SNCs or Standard Nautical Charts), as this vessel did, or by electronic charts (ENCs or Electronic Navigational Charts). As from July 2016 ships were required to use ENCs. This casualty therefore occurred at a time of transition in the shipping industry from paper to electronic charts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The master of the vessel, Captain Culusi, gave oral evidence. He did so some 7-8 years after the events in question. It is to be expected that he will have given considerable thought to the causes of the casualty over the intervening years. It is also to be expected that he will have carefully considered the criticisms made of his navigation of the vessel. In those circumstances it is likely that it is difficult for him now to disentangle in his mind his actual recollection of the events leading up to the casualty with his reconstruction, based in particular upon the Voyage Data Recorder (VDR), of what happened. Of course in circumstances where the vessel carried a VDR there can be little if any dispute as to the course and speed of the vessel and of her likely track to the grounding position. There are, however, disputes as to matters not recorded by the VDR, for example, whether the master was aware of the contents of a particular Notice to Mariners during the navigation and as to the relative reliance placed by the master on the paper chart, the electronic chart and the radar.

Thus, whilst in his witness statement he had said that the preparation of the vessel’s passage plan had been in accordance with the relevant procedures and nautical instructions, in his oral evidence he accepted that the master had not followed proper procedures. He thus appeared to be frank and candid with the court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The court was assisted by the expert opinion of two master mariners called by the parties, Captain Whyte for the Owners and Captain Hart for the Cargo Interests. Both studied the circumstances leading up to the casualty in immense and well researched detail. Each was accused by counsel of having done his best to assist the side which instructed him. I accept that both experts sought to give the court their honest opinion. However, there were limitations to the benefit which the court could derive from their opinions. Whilst Captain Whyte was well qualified and had been at sea until 2012 (serving with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary) with experience of ENCs, he had difficulty, it seemed to me, in standing back from the detail of the case and assessing the matter from the point of view of the ordinarily prudent mariner. This may have been because of his very detailed research into certain aspects of the case. It may also have been because in his first report he made no mention of a Notice to Mariners which he accepted in his oral evidence was critical and paramount. Having formed his views as to the conduct of the master without regard to that Notice to Mariners he may have found it difficult to reconsider his views as to how matters might have appeared to the prudent mariner in the light of that Notice. In addition, his answers tended to be lengthy so that it was sometimes difficult to discern his answer to the question put to him. Captain Hart had the merit of answering questions directly and with reasons concisely expressed. However, in the context of the present case he was handicapped by not having sailed as master with the benefit of electronic charts. He had been at sea until 1987 serving on merchant vessels deep sea and offshore. Thus his experience was not as recent as Captain Whyte’s and not as relevant (with regard to the use of ENCs). Nevertheless, the opinions of both experts on the questions of passage planning and navigation were both interesting and helpful to the court.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"><span> </span>The Admiralty Court has much experience of dealing with issues of passage planning and navigation in collision cases, assisted by advice from nautical assessors from Trinity House. There does not seem to be any reason why the court could not deal with such issues in the same way when they arise in a general average case resulting from the grounding of a vessel. I mention that so that parties may consider that possibility in any future general average arising from a grounding. Such a course may be particularly appropriate where, as here, the amount in dispute is, in relative terms, modest.   </p>

The local advice to masters is that it is 300 metres. in width. On the water it is marked, as the chart shows and as the Admiralty Sailing Directions state, by buoys. In the particular part of the fairway with which this case is concerned the fairway is marked on the east side by buoys 15 and 11 (there is no buoy 13) and on the west side by buoys 16, 14-1, 14 and 12. Leaving aside buoy 16 which is positioned (for reasons the experts could not explain) over 2 cables to the west of the marked fairway, buoys are positioned about half a cable beyond the marked fairway so that the width of the buoyed fairway is over 2 cables. Although the chart notes depths in this part of the fairway of between 19 and 31 metres, Notice to Mariners NM 6274(P)/10 issued in December 2010 advised mariners at paragraph 11 that the fairway had a least depth of 14 metres. There is marked around buoy 14.1 a danger area, which extends into the fairway, with a charted depth of 14.9 metres in the fairway. There is also marked west of buoy 15 on the western edge of the fairway a danger area which extends into the fairway with a charted depth of 15.9 metres.     </p>

To the west of the fairway in the region of buoy 14-1 the limit of such areas is under 3 cables distant from the fairway. The chart notes, as do the Admiralty Sailing Directions, that such areas are not considered hazardous to surface navigation but the Admiralty Sailing Directions add that the existence of the minefields has inhibited hydrographic surveying and therefore “outside the swept routes there may be many uncharted wrecks and isolated shoals especially dangerous to deep-draught vessels”. Both experts agreed that the swept routes referred to the fairway (which would be “swept” by means of a line swept across the length of the fairway and/or sounded to identify the least depth). </p>

The conventional way of doing so is by marking such areas by means of a hatched line. The master accepted that this was the “more usual” way, the “correct” way, and the “generally known” way of doing so.  One such area was marked on chart 1767 for the passage from the seaward end of the fairway. It was around a sounding of 2 metres and a wreck. No such areas were marked on chart 3449 to either side of the fairway. However, to the west of buoy 14-1 there was a line on the chart within the former mined area. It was suggested that this marked a “no go” area but neither the master nor the second officer made mention of it in their contemporaneous statements. The second officer in his second witness statement in 2018, seven years after the event, said that the line was the boundary line of a “no go” area which he “probably” marked though he had no specific recollection of doing so. I consider it unlikely that this was intended to mark a “no go” area. Had it been intended as such I would have expected to find a hatched line in accordance with the conventional way of marking such areas. It is difficult to say why it was placed on the chart or when but I am not persuaded that it was intended to mark a “no-go” area. </p>

The vessel was a little further to the west than intended, as the chart extract shows. By 0221 the helm was steering 135 degrees. At 0222 the master said “now we will have to move on the left side of the channel…..because of these wrecks [rocks probably] which are ahead of us”. The helm was ordered to 133 degrees and then, at about 0224, to 131 degrees. The master must have been intending to cross onto the portside of the fairway. </p>

The aim of this somewhat striking change of helm, through almost 40 degrees, was to pass buoy 14-1, and the danger area around it, to port. Not only did this take the vessel out of the fairway marked by the magenta pecked lines on the channel but it also took the vessel out of the buoyed fairway.  </p>

Just after 0230 the master ordered hard to starboard and said: “We don’t have time to enter the fairway.” It appears that his aim was now to pass the rocks and shallow water at Jiujie Jiao to port. The master said: “Yes, we are leaving the shallow water portside, and then we enter the fairway.”  At about 0231:30 the master ordered the helm amidships, followed by several port helm movements.  </p>

Captain Whyte expressed the opinion in his first report that it was prudent for the master to seek to avoid the shallows near buoy 14-1. He said “the vessel had plenty of sea room on the starboard side and sufficient depth of water within the 20 metre contour defined on both the paper and electronic charts. It was more prudent for a deep-draught vessel to navigate in safe water outside the fairway/channel than it was to unnecessarily traverse areas where the charted depth substantially reduced the UKC.” In the joint memorandum he said that the master was “entitled to leave the Fairway for any navigational reason within the available safe water.” In his supplementary report he said that “if there was sufficient water, which there was, then the master was perfectly entitled to increase the passing distance of the charted shallows around buoy 14-1.” By contrast Captain </p>

I noticed that the vessel is not responding fast enough to come back to port and in order to avoid the awash rocks ahead I tried to go ahead and remain west of the Jiujia rocks, to follow a route outside the channel as the chart was showing depths of 40-35 metres ahead, with the intention to rejoin the channel after that. </p>

This suggests that, having begun to alter course to port to follow the passage plan marked on the chart (by altering course to port from 141 to 131 degrees) to pass buoy 14-1 to starboard, the master then changed his mind. Yet the master’s report does not reveal any appreciation by him that he was departing from the passage plan which he had approved with knowledge of what the VTS had warned him on his inbound passage.

His concern during the passage reflects a poor assessment of the position because there was a least depth of water in the fairway of 14 metres plus the tide which, it was common ground, was sufficient for the vessel.

The chart indeed shows depths of 29.9 and 33 metres to the west of buoy 14-1. But the crucial question, as it seems to me, is whether it was prudent for the master to rely upon such charted depths being reliable. There is a formidable case that it was not prudent to rely upon them. First, Notice to Mariners NM 6274(P)/10, issued in December 2010, advised mariners at paragraph 2 that “numerous depths less than the charted exist within, and in the approaches to Xiamen Gang”.  It is true that the “most significant” which were listed were not in his location but the warning was nevertheless clear that in the approaches to Xiamen there were “numerous depths” less than the charted depths. Second, Notice to Mariners NM 1691/11 issued in April 2011 identified two soundings which were to be marked on the chart. One, 4.8 metres, was to the west of buoy 14-1. The other, 1.2 metres, was further to the south east but on the 30 metre contour, a striking confirmation that the charted depths were not accurate. Third, the master’s revised track (after leaving a sounding of 14.8 metres to starboard) would cause the vessel to head towards the new sounding of 4.8 metres, though he intended to alter back towards the fairway before reaching that sounding. </p>

The master accepted when cross-examined that NM 6274(P)/10 contained “a clear warning…that if you leave the dredged fairway you may encounter uncharted shoal areas.”  Captain Whyte’s opinion was not so clear cut. In his opinion a prudent mariner would give “due weight” to the “warning” in the notice to mariners but would consider that warning in conjunction with the information on the chart that the survey on which it was based was carried out in 2003, which meant that “they shouldn’t be that unreliable”. But he accepted that “faced with those two bits of information, the modern survey, this warning, [the prudent mariner] would probably feel a little bit apprehensive about the depths available....” Despite that comment counsel for the Owners submitted that a reasonably prudent master would not discount all charted depths outside of the fairway but rather “would take charted depths in waters adjacent to the fairway and the fairway buoys as being generally reliable”. Counsel relied upon evidence from the master and Captain Hart that the survey and dredging work would be in waters adjacent to the fairway.   </p>

When read together by an ordinarily prudent mariner they advise that it is safe to navigate within the fairway having regard to there being a least depth of 14 metres but not outside the fairway where no information is given as to the least depth and where there are “numerous” depths less than those charted. Indeed, the existence of such depths was confirmed by NM 1691/11 which required corrections to the chart showing a depth of 4.8 metres a little over 3 cables to the south west of buoy 14-1 and a depth of 1.2 metres on a 30 metre contour over 5 cables to the south west of buoy </p>

Captain Whyte’s approach (and counsel’s submission) appears to me to be one which invites the ordinary mariner to discount the warning in NM 6274(P)/10. It runs counter to the clear warning in NM 6274(P)/10 not to rely upon the charted depths. Captain Whyte accepted that NM 6274)P)/10 was “a crucial” and a “paramount” document. If so it is very difficult to understand why he had such difficulty in accepting that the prudent mariner would understand it as a warning not to rely upon the charted depths in the Admiralty chart. The answer may well be that, having formed and expressed his opinion without regard to NM 6274(P)/10 he found it difficult to re-assess the matter in the light of that notice. </p>

I do not accept that submission. <span style="font-style:italic">Volcafe</span> was concerned with Article III r.2. The Supreme Court held that, because the carrier was a bailee, the carrier bore the legal burden of proving that there had been no breach of Article III r.2 or that the damage in question had been caused by one of the exceptions in Article IV r.2(a). However, the present case is concerned with Article III r.1. Lord Sumption noted at paragraph 15 that Article IV r.1 was an article which dealt with the burden of proof for a specific purpose. Article IV r.1 provides that where loss or damage results from unseaworthiness the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier. Thus it deals with the burden of proof for the purposes of Article III r.1.  It is implicit in Article IV r.1 that the burden of proving causative unseaworthiness must lie upon the cargo owner. For the article assumes that such unseaworthiness has been established.  In my judgment the conventional view as to the burden of proof remains good law.    </p>

First, the formal document recording the passage plan had the wrong position for the way point off buoy 15. Second, and as a result, the formal document did not record the course to be steered to buoys 15 and 14-1. Third, the working chart stated courses which were not those required. However, such defects were not likely to have been causative of the grounding because the intended way point off buoy 15 and the required courses were, as I understood the evidence, on the radar and ECDIS. Thus the master would know which course he was to steer to buoys 15 and 14-1.  </p>

It was not so manifest from their written reports because Captain Hart did not in terms articulate in his report the precise form in which the no go area should have been identified on the chart. But he did highlight NM 6274(P)/10 as being “of direct relevance” to the matter (at paragraph 2.5.8) and noted paragraphs 2 and 11 in particular. He also noted (at paragraph 2.6.4) the need for a passage plan to mark on the chart relatively shallow waters, “known colloquially as “no go” areas”. He observed (at paragraph 4.1.4) that it was not clear to him that the contents of NM 6274(P)/10 had been noted and applied to the chart. He concluded (at paragraph 4.4.17) under the heading of “Passage Plan” that the working chart was not “systematically marked up to show …. ‘no go’ areas”. Captain Whyte in his supplementary report considered that the vessel had a passage plan of “sufficient standard” and that “any deficiency in making all of the pencil amendments regarding Preliminary NM 6274)P)/10 to Admiralty Chart 3449 did not contribute to the grounding”. </p>

The presence of numerous depths less than the charted depths in the approaches to Xiamen must be, it seems to me, a source of danger. For mariners would ordinarily regard the charted depths as being accurate.  It was therefore necessary to ensure that when the navigator of a vessel leaving Xiamen was faced with a decision whether to remain within the buoyed fairway or to navigate outside the buoyed fairway he had in mind the warning that charted depths outside the buoyed fairway may be unreliable. </p>

That note was placed on the chart within the fairway between buoys 15 and 18. However, that note does not in terms remind the mariner of the warning contained within it. In the present case the master said in his witness statement taken three days after the grounding that there was about 30 metres of water to the west of buoy 14-1. That suggests that he was relying upon the charted depths. His statement made no reference to NM 6274(P)/10 or to the warning which it contained. Thus it appears that the note on the chart did not serve to remind him of the warning within it. It is also to be noted that Captain Whyte prepared his first report without noting NM 6274(P)/10 or the warning which it contained. He also expressed the view that there was sufficient water where the vessel wished to navigate. I find it difficult to accept that he would have expressed that view had he had NM 6274(P)/10 in mind. The evidence in this case therefore shows that there ought to be placed on the working chart something which ensures that the navigator is aware of the danger created by the numerous depths in the approaches to Xiamen which are less than the charted depths. </p>

The Owners’ own guidance to their masters emphasised that the information noted on the passage plan should include “the areas to be avoided” and “navigation dangers such as ….shallow waters”. Captain Whyte accepted that an important goal of passage planning was to identify areas where it was unsafe for the vessel to go and to prevent “bad real time decisions from being made.” As Captain Hart put it, “a proper passage plan operates to prevent bad ad hoc decision making during the course of a passage.” He said that “the absence of the identification of “no go areas” on the working chart meant that there was no pre-assessed visualisation of “safe” and “unsafe” waters on the working chart.” Captain Hart noted that the ICS Bridge Procedures Guide advised that the marking on the chart of relatively shallow waters “is one technique which will assist the OOW when having to decide quickly to what extent to deviate without jeopardising safety and the marine environment.” </p>

This appears to me to ignore the fact that on the water navigation is conducted by reference to the buoyed fairway. The Admiralty Sailing Directions refer to the “fairway marked by light buoys”. The master said in his witness statement that visibility was about 5-6 miles and that he could see “the flashing lights of the buoys marking the channel clearly enough”. He also monitored the vessel’s progress “by reference to the ECDIS keeping to the buoyed channel.” Indeed, Captain Hart himself refers to the “buoyed channel” in paragraph 2.4.5 of his first report. Further, the AIS evidence for large vessels using the fairway in 2010-2012 which was collated by Captain Whyte showed many vessels outside the magenta lines but within the buoyed channel (though some may also have been beyond the buoyed channel on the east side, where there is a further fairway coming in from the east). Marking the “no go” areas as those outside the pecked magenta lines would, it seems to me, be a particularly cautious approach. I do not consider that all prudent mariners would judge such an approach to be necessary.  It appears to me to be unnecessarily restrictive.   </p>

The conventional means of reminding the navigator of areas of danger is by marking them as “no go areas” on the working chart by the means of a hatched pencil line. If that means were adopted with regard to Xiamen in 2011 that would involve marking a hatched line on both sides of the buoyed fairway and for the length of the buoyed fairway. That would render the chart “busy” which both experts agreed should, if possible, be avoided. Indeed Captain Hart also had in mind that there would be annotated on the chart a line at the side of the fairway which noted the least depth as stated in NM 6274(P)/10.   </p>

Such a note, in the terms suggested by Captain Hart, would immediately remind the officer navigating the vessel that it was unsafe to navigate outside the fairway. Such a note would do that which the IMO guidance on passage planning requires, namely, it would give a clear indication of the danger in navigating outside the fairway. In this regard it is to be noted that Captain Gansinhounde accepted that there was a particular warning at Xiamen that there was a risk of uncharted shallows outside the fairway and that such warning ought to be placed on the passage plan or on the chart.  It is also to be noted that when cross-examined on this matter Captain Whyte said that he would have been content with the warning “being part of the passage plan, so recorded in the plan”. As to writing it on the chart he thought this was a matter of “preference”. My conclusion, having considered the expert and other evidence, is that whilst it would of course be prudent to note the warning in the passage plan it would also be necessary (and prudent) to mark the warning on the chart since that is the primary document to which the officer navigating the vessel would refer when making navigational decisions in the course of the outward passage.     </p>

This is particularly so where the defect in question is an absence from the passage plan and chart of a warning that numerous depths outside the fairway are less than those charted and where the Owners had advised their masters of the difficulty of navigating in Xiamen waters because of, amongst other matters, “shallow waters” and urged “utmost care and diligent caution”.

Seaworthiness extends to having on board the appropriate documentation, including the appropriate chart; see <span style="font-style:italic">Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading</span> 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>.ed. at paragraph 7-028 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bills of Lading</span> by Aikens and others 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>.ed. at paragraph 10.127. The presence on board a vessel of the appropriate chart is another aspect of the “preparation” for safe navigation. But the presence on board of the appropriate chart is also an aspect of seaworthiness. Further, where the Admiralty gives notice of a correction to the appropriate chart a vessel will not be seaworthy unless the chart has been corrected. If the vessel’s navigating officer fails, before the commencement of the voyage, to correct the chart the vessel is thereby rendered unseaworthy. The correction of the chart is part of the “preparation” for safe navigation. A corrected chart does not cease to be an aspect of seaworthiness merely because its purpose is to assist in ensuring safe navigation. This can be illustrated by the facts of the present case. If the second officer had failed to correct the chart by noting the new soundings of 4.8 metres and 1.2 metres on the chart before the beginning of the voyage (as required by the April 2011 notice to mariners) such failure could have rendered the vessel unseaworthy at the beginning of the voyage.   </p>

Article III r.1 places a seaworthiness obligation upon the carrier “before and at the beginning of the voyage”. In this context the timing of the master’s negligence therefore matters. Counsel referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Whistler International v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, The Hill Harmony</span> [2001] 1 AC 638 where, at p.657, Lord Hobhouse said that the character of a decision cannot be determined by where the decision is made.  Thus a decision of a master, whilst his vessel was still at the berth, to leave on a certain state of the tide is a decision within the navigation and management exception of a charterparty. But Lord Hobhouse was not considering Article III r.1 of the Hague Rules. He was considering whether a decision not to pursue a certain route was a breach of the utmost despatch obligation in a time charter. Counsel relied upon this decision “in relation to the nature and definition of an act of navigation.”  But since the decision did not concern Article III r.1 or the concept of unseaworthiness the analysis in that case cannot, I think, assist in determining the issue which arises in the present case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Article III r.2 is subject to Article IV r.2 (a) which provides that the carrier will not be responsible for loss caused by neglect in the “navigation or in the management of the ship”. Article III r.1 is not so subject. If there is a causative breach of Article III r.1 the fact that a cause of the subsequent casualty is also negligent navigation will not protect the carrier from liability. Passage planning by the master before the beginning of the voyage is necessary for safe navigation. The document or documents in which it is recorded are for the benefit of the officers in fact navigating the vessel during the voyage. That circumstance does not remove passage planning from the scope of seaworthiness. Similarly, the ordering of sufficient engine room spares by the chief engineer is necessary for the safe management of the vessel during the voyage. But that circumstance does not remove the adequacy of engine room stores from the scope of seaworthiness. An adequate passage plan is now a required document at the beginning of the voyage to ensure that the vessel is reasonably fit to carry her cargo safely to its destination.    </p>

David Steel J. held that the passage plan in that case (which had been brought on board by pilots after the voyage had commenced) was not defective. If it had been he noted that it had not been contended that the owners had not put in place a proper system for ensuring that the master received appropriate guidance and instruction with regard to passage planning (see paragraphs 98-100). Counsel on behalf of the Owners submitted that counsel in that case (Mr. Brenton QC, whose contributions to maritime law by his able, clear and knowledgeable advocacy were sadly interrupted by illness) had submitted that defective planning was an aspect of incompetence rather than what counsel described as “standalone unseaworthiness” (see paragraph 101) and that that approach to the case by Mr. Brenton QC supported the submission made on behalf of the Owners in this case.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The facts of <span style="font-style:italic">The Torepo</span> appear to have been materially different from those of the present case. The voyage from La Plata, Argentina to Esmeraldas, Ecuador began on 2 July; see paragraphs 13-16. On the same day it was decided that the route would be via the Magellan Straits; see paragraph 17. On 7 July two pilots boarded at Possession Bay off Punta Dungeness with their own Chilean charts which included charts for a passage through the Patagonian Channels; see paragraph 18. On 8 July the vessel had reached a position near the western end of the Magellan Straits when she diverted into the Patagonian Channels; see paragraph 22. On 9 July the vessel grounded; see paragraph 25. The judge found that the master was unaware of the possibility that his vessel might be required to negotiate the Patagonian Channels until the pilots advised him of that on 7 July; see paragraphs 60-62. The judge also accepted the master’s evidence that he called a meeting of the navigating officers prior to entry into the Patagonian Channels to discuss how to deal with the unusual situation of being entirely dependent on the pilot’s charts; see paragraph 64. The criticism advanced of the passage plan was of “the passage plan contained on the pilot’s large-scale charts on which the master and officers of Torepo were relying”; see paragraph 97. Those criticisms were not accepted; see paragraphs 98-99. Thus on the facts of the case, where the charts in question were only brought on board by the pilots after the voyage had been commenced, there was no scope for arguing that any failure by the master prior to the commencement of the voyage amounted to a breach of the owners’ duty to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy before the beginning of the voyage. Further, all criticisms of the master’s conduct with regard to passage planning (both at the commencement of the voyage and when the pilots boarded) were rejected by the judge; see paragraphs 101-111. So on the facts found by the judge there was no lack of care by the master. It is true that Mr. Brenton QC does not appear to have argued that any defects in the passage plan brought on board by the pilots caused the vessel to be unseaworthy. The contract of carriage in that case contained a continuing obligation of due diligence to render the vessel seaworthy; see paragraph 123. Precisely how the classic test of unseaworthiness would operate in such a case where the vessel was seaworthy at the beginning of the voyage but pilots later boarded with a defective passage plan is not clear. What is clear is that David Steel J. did not have to deal with the submission which has been made in this case in connection with </p>

In that case there had been a collision which had given rise to general average expenditure. The cargo insurer who had given a general average guarantee defended the claim against it on the ground that the “vessel had no or no adequate passage planning, bridge management and/or safety management systems in operation to deal with the ordinary incidents of the voyage” and that “had such systems been in place, the collision would not have occurred”; see paragraph 5. The claimant sought and obtained summary judgment. It is apparent from the judgment that the insurer’s defence was wholly unparticularised. Knowles J. observed in paragraph 13 that the insurer could “perhaps show that systems were breached on this occasion, but it cannot show inadequate systems or inadequate arrangements for implementation of those systems.” Whether the judge had in mind a breach with regard to passage planning as opposed to bridge management or safety management systems is not stated. Further, it may be that, as suggested by counsel for the Cargo Interests, the “breach of the systems” which the judge had in mind was an error in navigation during the voyage which led to the collision. I do not consider therefore that it can safely be said that the approach of the judge shows that a defective passage plan<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>does not<span style="font-style:italic"> ipso facto</span> render a vessel unseaworthy.   </p>

A proper passage plan is now, like an up to date and properly corrected chart, a document which is required at the beginning of the voyage. If a vessel carries a chart which the second officer has failed to correct to ensure that it is up to date or carries a passage plan which is defective because it lacks a required warning of “no go” areas then those are two aspects of the vessel’s documentation which are capable of rendering the vessel unseaworthy at the beginning of the voyage. </p>

He further submitted that “in relation to matters like passage planning” a carrier’s duty under Article III r.1 was discharged by putting in place proper systems and ensuring that the requisite materials were on board to ensure that the master and navigating officer were able to prepare an adequate passage plan before the beginning of the voyage. But the same could be said about chart corrections. Yet, if the officer charged with correcting the chart fails to do so in a material respect before the beginning of the voyage, then his “one-off failure” is capable of rendering the vessel unseaworthy. The test in <span style="font-style:italic">McFadden v Blue Star Line </span>can properly be applied when deciding whether such a failure makes the vessel unseaworthy.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>I am therefore unable to accept the submission that a one-off defective passage plan cannot amount to unseaworthiness or that the test in <span style="font-style:italic">McFadden v Blue Star Line </span>should not be applied to it.  Furthermore, whilst the lack of proper systems can render a vessel unseaworthy, counsel’s submission, by concentrating upon the carrier’s own actions to the exclusion of those of his servants or agents, confuses the issue of seaworthiness with the issue of due diligence, which (see below) is a non-delegable duty. In any event, the defective passage plan in this case was probably not “one-off”. The same defect was probably present in the March 2011 voyage; see paragraph 74 above.       </p>

It was submitted on behalf of the Cargo Interests that it was because had the master or the second officer appreciated that charted depths outside the fairway could not be relied upon the master would not have attempted to pass buoy 14-1 to port, outside the buoyed fairway. It was submitted on behalf of the Owners that it was not causative for several reasons which, I think, can be summarised as follows. First, the master had reviewed NM 6274(P)/10 prior to sailing and so had cognisance of its contents. Second, a note on the chart reminding the officer navigating the vessel of the warning in NM 6274(P)/10 would not have stopped the master from “choosing in real time to go south of buoy 14-1”.  Third, the grounding was caused by the poor execution of the manoeuvre to pass buoy 14-1 to port; it was started too late. Fourth, the cause of the grounding was the failure of the hydrographic authorities properly to promulgate information about the shoal upon which the vessel grounded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have already concluded that the master’s decision to leave the buoyed fairway and navigate to the west of buoy 14-1 was negligent. Whether the defective passage plan was causative of that negligence depends upon whether or not the master was in fact cognisant of the notice and of its contents. If he was then the material defect in the passage plan may not have been causative. It was submitted that the master had read NM 6274(P)/10 because the master said that he read it before the voyage to Xiamen. However, he did not state that in terms when making a statement three days after the grounding, though he did make a general reference to considering the “customary nautical publications” and to “active warnings for the area generally concern(ing) reported depths than what is charted.” There are indications in his witness statement that he did not have its contents in mind when leaving Xiamen. First, he referred to being concerned about soundings of 12.9 and 13.3 metres in the vicinity of buoys 3 and 2 at the seaward end of the fairway. If he had had NM 6274(P)/10 in mind he would have known that there was a least depth of 14 metres in the channel. Second, when deciding to leave buoy 14-1 to port he said he had in mind that there was about 30 metres of water. If he had had NM 6274(P)/10 in mind he could not have been confident that there was about 30 metres of water. Third, the chart correction log maintained on the vessel made no reference to NM 6274(P)/10 which suggests that it was not noted by those on board the vessel. The second officer suggested in his supplementary witness statement that this may have been an oversight. But in circumstances where the chart had not been corrected to show a radar beacon on buoy 19 (see paragraph 3 of NM 6274(P)/10) it is more likely than not that the notice to mariners itself had been overlooked. My conclusion is that, whether or not the master had read the notice to mariners before the voyage to Xiamen, its contents were not in his mind when navigating away from Xiamen. Thus it is more likely than not that the defect in the passage plan was causative of the master’s decision to leave buoy 14-1 to port.  </p>

I am unable to accept this submission. Had there been a warning on the chart about charted depths being unreliable the master would have been, as it seems to me, most unlikely to have decided to navigate beyond the buoyed fairway to the west of buoy 14-1. The master accepted, when cross-examined, that if the area west of buoy 14-1 had been marked as a “no go” area he would not have attempted the manoeuvre that he did. Faced with the decision whether to make a small alteration of helm to port in order to steer to the east side of the fairway and pass buoy 14-1 to starboard (as planned) or to make a substantial alteration of course to starboard to pass buoy 14-1 to port outside of the fairway (as had not been planned) there can, in my judgment, be no doubt that the master would have decided to remain in the fairway. Reliance was placed on the fact that the vessel had been set a little further to the west than intended when passing buoy 15. But even if this was part of the master’s thinking at the time (he makes no mention of it in his witness statement) the position remained that a modest alteration of helm to port was required to continue on the vessel’s intended track within the fairway. Captain Whyte accepted that a change of no more than 5 degrees was required to bring the vessel back onto the course line. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The next point taken on causation was that it was not the decision to leave the fairway which caused the grounding but the manner in which it was executed. It was said to have been executed too late; the 14.8 metre shoal north west of buoy 14-1 ought to have been passed to port. Had that been done the substantial starboard helm action after passing that shoal to starboard would not have been necessary. Further, the starboard helm order was given too late and “without the required positive and deliberate control of turn”. Had the master executed his revised plan in either of those ways it was said that it was likely that he would have returned to the fairway by passing the rocks of Jiujie Jiao to starboard and so would not have grounded on the shoal to the west of those rocks. The difficulty with this submission is that the decision to leave the fairway cannot be divorced from the manner in which the master intended to leave the fairway. They were part of the same navigational decision. His </p>

I do not consider that the chain of causation from the initial decision to leave the fairway to the grounding of the vessel was broken. His initial decision gave rise to the risk that, whilst navigating out of the fairway, the vessel might ground on an uncharted shoal and that is what happened.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, reliance was placed on the failure of the hydrographic authorities to advise mariners of the existence of the shoal on which the vessel had grounded. It is true that the hydrographic authorities knew of the shoal (it appeared on the electronic chart as from 13 January 2011) but did not advise users of the paper chart of the shoal until a date after the grounding.  Although Captain Hart made enquiries about this and was told that there were restrictions under the Bilateral Agreement between the UK and China as to the information which could be placed on Admiralty charts from Chinese charts and that the information from the Chinese charts was conflicting I am unable to make any findings as to why earlier notice of the shoal was not given. But whilst the fact that the shoal was not marked on the paper chart may well have been a cause of the grounding it does not follow that the defective passage plan and the master’s resulting negligence in deciding to navigate outside the buoyed fairway was not also a real and effective cause of the grounding.  </p>

The vessel was unseaworthy by reason of a lack of fuel or a lack of the right quality of fuel. It was conceded (by Mr. Staughton QC) that to take insufficient bunkers involves a failure to use diligence. It is clear from the discussion by Donaldson J. at pp.718-720 of unseaworthiness, due diligence and the conduct of the master and chief engineer that negligence by the master or chief engineer in ordering the correct quantity or quality of bunkers before the voyage amounts to a failure by the carrier to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy.

The question arises whether by the exercise of due diligence the master and second officer could reasonably have prepared an appropriate passage plan. It must follow from my finding that they could have done so. NM 6274(P)/10 was, on the Owners case, on board the vessel. (There was no documentary proof of that, as counsel for the Cargo Interests submitted, but it is unlikely that the Owners system for ensuring that notices to mariners were provided promptly to the vessel broke down on this occasion.) NM 6274(P)/10 contained, as the master accepted, “a clear warning…that if you leave the dredged fairway you may encounter uncharted shoal areas.” The purpose of a passage plan was, as the master must have known, to identify areas or sources of danger. It was therefore prudent, for the reasons I have endeavoured to explain earlier in this judgment, that the passage plan, and in particular the chart, should include a warning about the unreliability of charted depths out of the fairway in order to minimise the risk that the officer navigating the vessel might decide, for whatever reason, to navigate outside the buoyed fairway.  This was something which the master ought reasonably to have appreciated. He accepted when cross-examined that if he had “given proper thought to the passage planning process he would have ruled out going west of the stony patch as a sensible course.” That is a reference to the stony patch west of buoy 14-1. It must follow that the master and second officer could, by the exercise of reasonable care or due diligence, have prepared a passage plan which prudently marked on the chart the required warning.  </p>

The safe navigation of the vessel is necessary to enable the carrier to carry the cargo safely from the loading port to the discharge port.

He submitted that, assuming that the vessel had all the correct nautical publications and proper instructions for passage planning, the ship was seaworthy and the shipowner had used all reasonable care to ensure that the vessel was seaworthy. Hypothetical examples are often dangerous because the assumed facts are not clear. But if the passage plan, by reason of the master’s mistake, contained an inaccurate assessment of the under keel clearance then the plan would be defective, no prudent owner would have permitted the vessel to set out to sea without the defect being corrected and due diligence would not have been exercised in making the vessel seaworthy.   </p>

The use which counsel seeks to make of <span style="font-style:italic">The England</span> is unjustified. The issue in <span style="font-style:italic">The England</span> was whether the owner could establish that a collision had occurred without his actual fault or privity for the purposes of section 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. That issue raised for decision the question whether an owner could leave all questions of navigation, including the question of what charts and regulations were on board, to the master, or whether the owner himself had a duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the master had at his disposal all necessary publications. Sir Gordon Willmer said that what the owner did in that case “might have passed muster 20 years ago” but that it was no longer permissible for owners to leave everything to the unassisted discretion of the master. <span style="font-style:italic">The England</span> established, as was noted in by Cresswell J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Eurasian Dream</span> at paragraph 133, that an owner has his own duty which must be discharged if he wishes to have the benefit of the right of limitation under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Failure to discharge that duty will naturally prevent the owner from being able to prove due diligence pursuant to Article III r.1 of the Hague Rules. But discharge of that duty will not enable the owner to prove due diligence under Article III r.1 if the servants or agents upon whom he relies to make the vessel seaworthy fail to act with reasonable care or due diligence.

It is true that there is no documentary or contemporary evidence that it was on board but the issue was initially not pleaded and was raised for the first time by Captain Hart in his report in September 2018. That is relevant when considering what inferences can be drawn from the absence of any documentary reference to it being on board. I have also noted that account does not appear to have been taken of its terms. However, this allegation (in terms of causative fault) adds nothing to the allegation that there was an inadequate passage plan. </p>

They were marked on the chart when it was photocopied and photographed on the day of the grounding. The Cargo Interests have suggested they were only added after the grounding. The court is invited to draw that inference on the grounds that if they had been marked on the chart the master would not have attempted to pass buoy 14-1 to port and would have kept away from the newly marked shoal of 1.2 metres. There is some force in this submission but I am not persuaded that it would be appropriate to draw the suggested inference. On the contrary it is more likely than not the photocopies and photographs show the condition of the chart at the time of grounding. There was no unseaworthiness in this regard. </p>

She complied with SOLAS by carrying Admiralty paper charts. The argument advanced by the Cargo Interests, on the basis of the expert evidence of Captain Hart, was that the bridge lay out, with the ECDIS visible to the navigator, was so seductive that the navigator would inevitably navigate by reference to the electronic chart. That being so the electronic chart installed on the ECDIS ought to have been the official and updated Admiralty electronic chart. If the Owners had provided such chart the master would have known of the existence of the shoal on which the vessel grounded and the grounding would not have occurred.  </p>

In this context Captain Hart’s opinion is not supported by practical experience. He never sailed as master with electronic charts. In circumstances where there was no regulatory requirement in 2011 for the vessel to carry official electronic charts, where the coverage provided by them in 2011 was limited and where masters and navigating officers were instructed as to the attributes and limitations of the electronic charting system I am unable to accept that in 2011 the vessel, before departing Xiamen, was unseaworthy because she did not carry the appropriate electronic chart.  </p>

It was suggested that this was lacking on the bridge of the vessel because the master did not explain to the second officer why he was departing from the charted course and the second officer did not question the master as to why he was doing so. However, whilst it is clear that the master did not explain what he was doing and that the second officer not only did not ask him but also thought, mistakenly, that it was because of vessels ahead, there is evidence of communication between them. The second officer told him that the pilot was off and that there were one or more vessels coming. There was a discussion about their speed and other discussions were inaudible. When the vessel was navigating outside the buoyed fairway the second officer was informing Xiamen VTS what the vessel was doing.  I therefore do not consider that it can properly be inferred that the master and second officer suffered from a disabling lack of appreciation of the need to communicate and act as a team. </p>

I am not satisfied that this would be a proper inference to draw. Indeed there is much evidence that he was a competent master. He had 30 years’ experience at sea, including 16 years with the Owners and 8 years in command of containerships. He had been selected by the Owners to take command of a newly built containership.

It is well-recognised that fatigue can have that effect and  that, for that reason, hours of rest must be properly recorded and arrangements made to ensure that the master and crew are properly rested. There was evidence that there were problems with the Owners’ system of recording hours of rest and that the Owners were aware that that the nature of a master’s work meant that there would be very busy periods when the master would not get the required numbers of hours’ rest. However, I was not satisfied that this master was, at the commencement of the voyage from Xiamen, fatigued so as to impair his decision making. In the seven days up to 16 May 2011 the master had had about 80 hours of rest, though it is to be noted that on 15 May a feeder vessel collided with the vessel at Yangshan and on 16 May the vessel had to alter course to avoid another vessel within the channel.  On 17 May, after arriving at Xiamen at 0340 and dealing with formalities for a further two hours he slept from about 0600 to 1030. He then dealt with correspondence and other matters. In the afternoon he went ashore with the chief engineer, did some shopping and had a meal and beer. He returned on board at about 1900 and rested in bed. He went to the bridge at about midnight. The vessel left the berth at 0133 on 18 May. </p>

His decision to navigate outside the fairway south of buoy 14-1 was a poor (and negligent) decision but, on the balance of probabilities, it was caused by the poor (and negligent) passage plan which failed to alert him during the voyage to the danger of relying upon the charted soundings outside the buoyed fairway. Had the vessel carried a proper passage plan which alerted him to that danger it is unlikely that he would have thought that he had a safe depth of some 30 metres in which to navigate outside the buoyed fairway. </p>
