	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">This claim arises out of work performed by the Claimant to the vessel “NOVEMBER” at its yard in Chatham.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">The “NOVEMBER” (“the  vessel”) is a swim end barge built during the 1940s which was, as is not disputed, initially acquired and owned by Mr Fitzsimons. Mr Otero acquired a half share from Mr Fitzsimons in 2017. The evidence before the court is that those two gentlemen were and still are the owners of the barge. However Mr Otero, who has entered an acknowledgment of service as owner and has been added as the Third Defendant in these proceedings, has questioned whether that is the true situation and it will need to be considered further below.  </p>

At the material times, Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons were directors and shareholders of that company although it became apparent that Mr Otero is no longer a director as there was a change of the control of the company in 2019. The evidence as to whether Mr Fitzsimons is still a shareholder or officer of the company is not clear. A third director of CML was apparently Purpose Venture Capital Ltd, a company registered in Jersey. As will appear below other persons, including a Mr Page and a Mr Tempest appear to have taken over control of either CML or the “November Project”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons are supporters of projects which support environmental awareness and sustainability. In particular they proposed or created the “November Project” through which they planned to moor a vessel on the River Thames near to Westminster together with a hydroelectric wheel. This was intended to be used as an educational conference centre to promote environmental awareness amongst those at Westminster. It was intended that CML would be the vehicle through which funds from investors in the November Project would be channelled and it appears that Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons intended that CML would manage the project. They decided that the barge “NOVEMBER” would be converted and utilised as the relevant vessel to be moored in the Thames. As such she would become a ‘Floating Establishment’ and would need to comply with the terms of the Port of London Authority which apparently indicated that the vessel would need to comply with the certification rules for a Floating Establishment laid down by the Classification Society, Bureau Veritas (“BV”).  </p>

This was completed in September 2017 whereupon it became clear that a considerable amount of work needed to be done in order to satisfy the certificating society, BV, that the barge was safe for the purpose intended. Mr Mark Beck, of Houlder, provided a specification for the work and has stated that the owners of the barge, Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Otero instructed Turks Shipyard to undertake the works detailed in the conversion specification that Houlder had prepared. On the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2018 Houlder were instructed by Mr Otero to oversee the work being performed by Turks Shipyard and to liaise with BV.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">In December 2017 an agreement was made between the Claimant and CML by which the Claimant undertook to drydock the barge and thereafter complete work to the barge at specified and agreed rates. What was agreed in writing was a weekly rate for drydocking of £1,500, welding rates at £32 per hour and shot blasting at £25 per square meter. The documents included a booking form, the Claimant’s terms and conditions together with a list of the Claimant’s charges. There was an exchange of emails which, with the booking form, formed the basis of the contract for the Claimant to do the proposed work. However no fixed price was agreed for work to be performed because, at the initial stage, it was uncertain as to the totality of the work required until the barge was dry-docked and further inspected. In these circumstances the vessel was drydocked so that preparation </p>

This work was set out in invoice number 604 which was paid in full. However further work was carried out by the Claimant after the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018 which is at the heart of this dispute.

It is the Claimant’s case that at the meeting it was instructed to perform the following work to the vessel: (i) welding up rivets; (ii) cutting out and replacing new sections which had been inserted at Isleworth shipyard (as it was apparent that such work had not been adequately performed at Isleworth); (iii) cutting out and replacing the bow swim end of the vessel; (iv) cutting out and replacing the stern swim end of the vessel; (v) cutting out and replacing the heavily pitted port side section of the vessel; (vi) cropping out and replacing bottom transverse sections which were cracked; (vii) removing doublers fitted.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">It is to be noted that this work, which is identified in the minutes of the meeting disclosed, is consistent with the conversion specification provided by Houlder. According to the evidence of Mr Beck: “<span style="font-style:italic">The vessel NOVEMBER was inspected and the extent of the hull renewals (particularly the renewal of the swim ends, side shell inserts and welding of the rivet heads) was agreed by all the parties at the ‘Kick off’ meeting on 1 March 2018, namely Houlder Limited, Agamemnon Otero, Jay Fitzsimons, Turks Shipyard and Bureau Verita</span>s”. Further he has stated that that work was carried out by the Claimant to a professional standard and to the satisfaction of BV. According to Mr Beck an issue arose with respect to the vessel’s superstructure and main deck which needed to be replaced. That is recorded in the Minutes of the meeting. Apparently Houlder were instructed by Mr Otero to prepare drawings for this work and Turks provided a cost estimate. Mr Turk has stated that he sent to Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons a quotation for the complete works including superstructure, decks and interior welding on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2018. Mr Beck has stated that, due to lack of funding, the yard was not instructed to perform the further work. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">According to Mr Otero also on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2018, following a conversation with Mr Turk, a further reduced estimate was provided, ‘The option B costings’, which essentially dealt with completing the work already started and doing other associated work. It is to be noted that these costs were provided for “<span style="font-style:italic">getting the boat to float out in order to sell in the most economical way</span>”. The steel work was quoted as being £59,400, the paintwork of £10,225 in epoxy or £3,948 in bitumen. The work was estimated to take 6 weeks with dock fees of £1,500 per week (ie.£9,000). Mr Turk’s email finishes with the sentence “<span style="font-style:italic">Look forward to hearing from you on whether to continue as planned or whether its minimum repair and remove from the yard quick</span>”. The work referred to at the Kick off meeting commenced on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018. Mr Turk has stated that the work continued through March 2018. On the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018 Mr Turk sent a more detailed breakdown of the cost including the work to be performed on the deck and superstructure which was sent to all interested parties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">There is some confusion as to precisely what occurred thereafter. According to Mr Otero, on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018, he telephoned Mr Turk and requested him to stop all work on the vessel to which, according to Mr Otero, Mr Turk agreed. Mr Turk’s witness statement refers to receiving an email from Mr Otero on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018. That email is in evidence and  requests “<span style="font-style:italic">please postpone all </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">new</span><span style="font-style:italic"> works until we have agreed formally</span>”(emphasis added). In his witness statement  Mr Turk says that he telephoned Mr Otero on the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2018 and they discussed the situation. Mr Turk told Mr Otero that various works had been commenced and they had to be completed in order to make the vessel watertight so as to be floated out. According to Mr Turk it was explained that this was necessary to allow his business to continue. Mr Turk states that Mr Otero accepted that and agreed that works had to be completed and that Mr Otero would cover the cost of this and that, during the conversation, Mr Otero stated that he would try to get his investors to support the project once again.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">This situation apparently arose because the participants in the November Project were concerned about the increasing costs of the work, and Mr Otero needed to have written confirmation as to the works to be carried out so as to obtain further finance. That is apparent from the emails between, inter alia, Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons sent on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March which indicate that there had been an investors meeting on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March </p>

As a result, Mr Turk put forward a “<span style="font-style:italic">heavily reduced cost</span>” on the steelwork of £205,000 if the project proceeds.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">From Mr Turk’s evidence and the emails in evidence it is clear that the Claimant and Mr Otero and other investors continued to communicate and, on occasions, meet until July 2018. During that period Mr Otero expressed his satisfaction with the work which had been carried out to the vessel and informed Mr Turk that he was continuing his efforts to obtain investment in the project. On the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2018 BV informed Mr Turk and Houlder that the society would not approve Mr Turk’s more economic version of the works. Mr Turk informed Mr Otero. Also on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2018 a Mr Richard Page, who was an investor in the project, emailed Mr Turk congratulating him on the work performed. On the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2018 Mr Otero emailed Mr Turk requesting the latest invoice and stating that there was an intention to continue the work later in that month. On the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2018 Mr Otero sent an email to Mr Turk acknowledging the receipt of the invoices. It is noteworthy in these communications there is no suggestion that the work performed by the Claimant was not authorised, was exaggerated or should not be paid. On the contrary, </p>

Mr Fitzsimons’ email dated the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018 also indicates his clear agreement with Mr Page’s views. Further there is an email from Mr Otero dated the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018 in which he informs Mr Turk of their intention that he should be paid. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in">17.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>It is to be noted that CML have not appeared at the trial. This absence was explained in a letter addressed to the Court by CML’s solicitors dated the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 which stated that CML does not have the finances to take part in the proceedings. That letter also explains that CML has been under different directorial management since February 2019, that Mr Otero was previously a director of CML but has been removed from that office and that, although he is still a director, Mr Fitzsimons will be removed as a director. It is also apparent from the letter that Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons are now in dispute as to the matters arising from the November Project. In addition a witness statement made by Mr Brannan Tempest dated the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 has been filed with the Court. In that Mr Tempest states that he has been a director of CML since February 2019. He states that he is the current CEO of CML. He states that the true ownership of the vessel is as set out in CML’s Defence and that the ownership remained with Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Otero at all material times. Mr Tempest also asserts that there has been a breakdown of relations between CML and Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Otero and the exhibits to his witness statement clearly support this conclusion. In addition Mr Tempest asserts that, insofar as the contract with or instructions given to the Claimant are concerned, Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Otero were acting in their capacities as owners of the vessel rather than as officers of CML. The thrust of Mr Tempest’s case is that CML are not liable for the outstanding sums claimed.  </p>

With respect to the painting work it was clearly necessary before the vessel was re-floated as was accepted by Mr Page and Mr Fitzsimons (emails of the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018).

Mr Otero also gave oral evidence during the course of which I consider that he was evasive, disingenuous and argumentative.  I consider that Mr Otero was a most unsatisfactory witness whose primary purpose was to deflect liability away from the owners of the vessel, particularly himself as a part owner of the vessel, and to seek to reduce the quantum of any such liability by any argument which he perceived was available to him. As such I consider that his evidence was largely self serving and, insofar as there was factual dispute, is not to be relied upon as being reliable or true. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">He has suggested that it was the parties’ expectation that an overall fixed price would eventually be agreed. In my view that submission is misplaced because Mr Turk had set out the Claimant’s rates for steel works, blasting, marine engineering and painting in his email of the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2017 and requesting a deposit. On the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2017 Mr Fitzsimons had responded stating that the deposit had been paid and providing a completed booking form. No questions were raised as to the rates and the Claimant’s rates were clearly agreed at that time. In fact no issue as to the propriety of those rates has ever been raised. In these circumstances all that needed to be done was to identify the steel works to be completed which were to be carried out at the relevant rate. That was what was done at the meeting on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2018 and it concluded the agreement for that work to be done without any need for further consideration of prices to be agreed. The Yard did not take a risk, it simply started work in accordance with its instructions at the prices already agreed. </p>

Whilst the minutes of the meeting do provide that there would need to be further consideration of certain items such as the replacement of the deck structure there is nothing to support Mr Du’s contention that there was any further need for approval of the costings of the agreed work. The subsequent request for a breakdown made by Mr Otero cannot avoid the fact that there was already an agreement for the Claimant to do the work specified at the rates referred to in December 2017. </p>

The best evidence of what occurred is to be found in Mr Fitzsimons’ email dated the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018. The meeting took place in the morning. A significant proportion of the discussion relates to the fact that the outstanding invoice for the preparatory work was still unpaid and that the Claimant was threatening to stop work until it was. The decision was made to pay that invoice. With respect to <span style="font-style:italic">moving forward</span> Mr Fitzsimons has said “<span style="font-style:italic">Work in dock on ice until estimates are agreed and in writing. I strongly suggest that when Aga speaks to Richard Turk this is made clear to avoid additional issues</span>” (emphasis added). That merely indicates a proposal by Mr Fitzsimons but does not evidence an agreement made with Mr Turk. </p>

However the wording of Mr Fitzsimons’ email and Mr Otero’s response, with comments contained in his email to Mr Fitzsimons on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, indicate that Mr Otero spoke to Mr Turk after the meeting not before it. With respect to that Mr Otero states: “<span style="font-style:italic">I spoke with Richard Turk. He is organising a meeting with Houlder will try to come within the original budget and proceed when everything is within contract</span>”. In his witness statement (para. 55) Mr Otero appears to suggest that this referred to the agreement to stop work  made on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March but, put in context, it is a response to Mr Fitzsimons reference to Mr Turk’s threat to stop work because the first invoice, for the preparatory work, had not been paid.

As I have already found the Claimant had been authorised to carry out those works and was, contractually entitled to perform its side of the existing bargain. What Mr Otero does not seem able to understand is that if, as he asserts, he had given instructions to cease that work the instruction would have been a breach of the contractual terms at that time in existence. Mr Turk was not contractually obliged to obey an instruction to cease work on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March and could not be bound to do so unless he agreed. He was perfectly entitled to refuse such agreement except on terms. In practical terms that is what occurred. Mr Otero requested that work cease and Mr Turk explained that he needed to complete the works already being undertaken but would agree not to undertake further work. Mr Otero agreed to that as is demonstrated by the wording of his email of the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018. In legal terminology there was a novation of what had been agreed in December 2017 and on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For the above reasons I conclude that the Claimant was authorised to undertake the  work commenced after the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2018 and completed after the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018. That was the work set out in invoice no.736. Mr Otero sought to argue that the sums put forward were not reasonable and that there was no requirement to replace so many rivets. However Mr Beck has expressed the view that the work was necessary and the costs reasonable. Further the evidence given by Mr Crispin was that the work was properly performed and the price was  reasonable and, although the vessel was surveyed on behalf of CML in May 2019 no evidence to the contrary was put before the court. It is also to be noted that others interested in the November Project, namely Mr Page and Mr Fitzsimons, exchanged emails on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July in which they expressed the view that the Claimant should be paid.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is invoiced in the sum of £11,670 inclusive of  VAT in the invoice no 778. It was envisaged as long ago as 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>December 2017 that the vessel would need to be painted and that the price would depend upon the paint specification used. This was also referred to at the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March meeting and appears in the minutes. A quotation was provided by the Claimant in the email dated the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2018 amounting to £10,225 for epoxy or £3,948 for bitumen. I understand that these are excluding VAT. It is interesting to note that the email was written in the context of an enquiry as to whether it would be possible to reduce the scope of the work and re-float the vessel in the most economic way. This it was always intended that the vessel would be painted once the Claimant’s work had been completed and before the vessel would be re-floated. In late August 2018 Mr Crispin recognised that painting was necessary and on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2019 he saw that the hull had been applied with epoxy before it was re-floated. He has stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">This was necessary as, if the hull had not been coated before refloating it would not have been protected and corrosion would develop.</span>” On the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018 Mr Page stated what needed to be done which included paying the Claimant outstanding sums “<span style="font-style:italic">plus money to paint . . .  so she can be refloated</span>”. Mr Fitzsimons agreed in his email dated the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018. The evidence is therefore that the majority of persons involved recognised what is, in any event, quite obvious that it was essential to paint the vessel before she was returned to the water. Failure to do so would have resulted in corrosion and the undoing of the work already performed. In my view it was not only reasonable but essential that the painting was performed and further that the cost invoiced is reasonable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">The principles relating to statutory rights of action in rem. </span>In Chapter 3 of  <span style="font-style:italic">Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice </span>5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Ed. the learned authors have engaged in a very interesting consideration of the distinctions between actions <span style="font-style:italic">in rem </span>where a maritime lien is involved, which they refer to as true <span style="font-style:italic">in rem </span>claims, and where there is a statutory right of action <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> which they refer to as ‘<span style="font-style:italic">quasi in rem</span> claims’ (apparently adapting  the terminology used in American Admiralty Law according to Dr Frank Wiswall). For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the main difference is that a true in rem claim is brought against the res although the owner of the property is indirectly impleaded, see <span style="font-style:italic">The Parlement Belge </span>(1880) LR 5PD 197 (CA) <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Brett LJ. Where owners enter an appearance (now acknowledge service) the claim becomes <span style="font-style:italic">in personam </span>(save that if the owners, such as a foreign state, wish to challenge the procedure they may ‘appear under protest’). However in the case of a <span style="font-style:italic">quasi in rem </span> claim the learned authors consider it is not a claim against the ship itself, although it takes that form, but is in truth a claim against the owner of the ship at the time when it is commenced but one which requires the <span style="font-style:italic">in personam </span>defendant to be the owner of the ship when the claim form is issued. “<span style="font-style:italic">The defendant is sued, but he is sued through service on the ship</span>”. As the editors observe the advantages of this procedure are that (i) it allows security for the claim to be obtained and (ii) it establishes jurisdiction. However there are other procedural peculiarities which arise: the judgment has to be obtained by proving it in court, summary judgment is not available, persons other than the defendant who may have an interest in the res may defend the claim. However these characteristics are only significant whilst the claim remains <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> because once the defendant has acknowledged service the claim will also proceed <span style="font-style:italic">in personam. </span>In <span style="font-style:italic">The Tatry </span> [1992] 2 Lloyds Rep 552 it was held that once an acknowledgment of service has been filed the claim does not lose its <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> character but proceeds as being both <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">in personam.</span> In <span style="font-style:italic">The Gemma</span> [1899] it was held that the owners who had entered an appearance became personally liable and that payment of the unsatisfied balance of the judgment could be recovered by a writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fieri facias</span>, also <span style="font-style:italic">The August 8 </span>[1983] 2 AC 450. </p>

That is conferred by s.20(1)(a) and 20(2)(n) of the Senior Courts Act 1981. Section 21 is concerned with the “mode of exercise” of that jurisdiction. In the present case the claim form was issued, served and the vessel arrested. The Admiralty Court clearly has jurisdiction in the present claim arising under s. 20 of the 1981 Act. As is usual in a claim in rem the claim was brought against the owners and it was exercised pursuant to section 21(4) of the Act.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The case raised by Mr Otero challenges the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the claim. CPR Part 11 provides that a party who wishes to dispute the jurisdiction of the court or argue that the court should not exercise its discretion may apply to the court for an order declaring that it has no such jurisdiction. An application under this rule must be made within 14 days after filing the acknowledgment of service and be supported by evidence. If the defendant who files an acknowledgment of service does not within 14 days make an application with respect to jurisdiction then he is to be treated as having accepted that the court has jurisdiction to try the claim. In the present case Mr Otero acknowledged service but although the form has a tick box to indicate if he wished to dispute jurisdiction that has not been ticked and the form only states that he intends to defend the claim.  </p>

In these circumstances there is nothing improper in the Claimant seeking to invoke the procedure under s. 21(4) of the Senior Court Act and if no person acknowledges service then the claimant may apply to the Court for a judgment in default and proceed to request the court to make an order for appraisement and sale so that, if sufficient funds are available the Claimant may recover the sums claimed. The authorities referred to make it clear that if a person files an acknowledgment of service as owner of the vessel then although the claim continues <span style="font-style:italic">in rem </span>it also allows the claim to continue <span style="font-style:italic">in rem </span>against that person or entity who may therefore become subject to liability <span style="font-style:italic">in personam. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that the situation is analogous to a position where sovereign immunity arises such as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">The Cristina </span>[1938] AC 485 (HL). In that case Lord Wright said: “<span style="font-style:italic">The writ by its express terms commands the defendants to appear or let judgment go by default. They are given a clear alternative of either submitting to the jurisdiction or losing possession. In the words of Brett LJ the independent sovereign is thus called upon to sacrifice either its property or its independence. It is, I think, clear that no such writ can be upheld against the sovereign state unless it consents. It is therefore given the right, if it desires neither to appear nor to submit to judgment, to appear under protest and apply to set aside the writ or take other appropriate procedure with the same object. It may be said that it is indirectly impleaded, but I incline to think that it is more direct to say that it is directly impleaded. The defendants cited ‘all persons claiming an interest in the Cristina, a description which precisely covers on the facts of the case the Spanish Government  . . . under the modern and statutory form of a writ in rem, a defendant who appears becomes subject to liability in personam. Thus the writ in rem becomes in effect also a writ in personam.</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span> Thus a party who seeks to contest a claimant’s right to recover may invoke the procedure set out in CPR Part 11 to challenge the court’s jurisdiction but if it does not then it ought not to be able to invoke arguments based upon jurisdiction to challenge the claimant’s claim. </p>

Out of deference to the diligence of both counsel and, in case I am wrong upon the procedural point referred to above, I consider that I should consider the parties’ arguments and come to a conclusion based upon them. The argument made by Mr Du is based upon the premise that the ownership of the vessel remained throughout with Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Otero notwithstanding Mr Otero’s evidence that both he and Mr Fitzsimons intended to transfer the ownership to CML and that this was evidenced by Mr Otero’s email dated the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2017 which was sent to his fellow investors in CML.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is an essential ingredient of Mr Du’s argument that CML were acting wholly on their own behalf and that Mr Otero and Mr Fitzsimons were acting solely for CML when the negotiations were entered into with Mr Turk, when the agreement was reached about the yard’s rates and when the meeting of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2018 took place and, as I have found, there was agreement as to work to be performed by the Claimant. Mr Du submitted that the construction of the agreement is an exercise in contractual interpretation and that the legal test is what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have agreed upon the basis of the written documents and the communications which passed to and from the yard. I agree but would add that the principles referred to by Lord Hoffman in <span style="font-style:italic">Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v West Bromwich Building Society</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/28.html">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that the written element of the agreement only mentions CML. It is further Mr Otero’s evidence that, insofar as he and Mr Fitzsimons involvement is concerned, they were only ever acting as directors of CML and not as owners of the vessel. The underlying issue is whether CML was acting with the authority of the owners. Mr Du’s case is that is not what occurred and therefore CML could not have entered into the agreements for the work on behalf of the owners nor could it be said that a term should be implied into the agreements to the effect that they had such authority as referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Tappenden v Artus. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Du has submitted that there is no absolute legal rule that contracts for repairs must be with the shipowners and that there will be cases where it is appropriate for a yard to contract personally with someone other than the owners, for example a bareboat charterer. However in such cases there will be a contract between the owners and the charterers which provides that the charterers either may or should carry out repairs to a vessel although in such cases s.21(4) specifically provides that the claimant’s right to bring an action <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> is maintained. In the present case there is no evidence that there was any agreement with the owners of the vessel which effectively provided that a third party might enter into such an agreement without the authority of the owners. The background of this case is that those involved in the November Project which included Mr Otero, Mr Fitzsimons and CML were well aware that the type of work to be performed by the yard involved rebuilding large portions of the hull and superstructure and I find it incredible that they could, if they had given the matter thought, have considered that it was proper for them to contract with the yard to perform these works without the authority of the actual owners of the vessel. In my view that conclusion is supported by Mr Otero’s statement to the court in evidence that: “<span style="font-style:italic">CM entered into contract with yard on behalf of the barge owners whoever the barge owners were</span>.”</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact I do not believe that anyone involved did consider this issue at the appropriate time. That is why it is appropriate to consider the question upon the basis of what a reasonable person would have understood had he been asked at the relevant time or times. In my judgment the answer is obvious. Such a person would have responded to the effect that: ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Of course such works could not be performed to the vessel without the authority of its owners</span>’. Therefore either CML were acting as agents for an undisclosed principal or, as an alternative, it was an implied term of the agreement that the contractors had the authority of the owners to enter into such an agreement. In this respect it is interesting to note that in his witness statement Mr Beck stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">The owners of the barge Jay Fitzsimons and Agamemnon Otero, instructed Turks Shipyard to undertake the works detailed in the conversion specification that Houlder Limited had repaired</span>”.  He is a project director of a company which is an independent design and engineering consultancy serving the marine, offshore and defence markets. It was clearly his understanding that whatever may have been the contractual nuances nonetheless the final responsibility and liability for the works would remain with the owners. If that were not the case it would allow owners of vessels to escape the effects of s.21(4) of the Senior Courts Act which is clearly intended to give builders and repairers of vessels protection against the non payment of invoices. In my view, Mr Otero’s statement to the court referred to in the preceding paragraph was a belated recognition by him of the true situation, namely that both the agreement made with the yard and the instructions given to the yard with respect to the work to be performed were made on behalf of the owners of the vessel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition the Court is entitled to look behind the registered ownership to determine the beneficial ownership, see <span style="font-style:italic">The Aventicum </span>[1978] 1 Lloyds Rep 184. Therefore the Court may have regard to the declaration made by Mr Otero in his email dated the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2017 to the effect that CML had become owners of the vessel. As, in fact, no formal transfer of the legal title took place this can only operate as a declaration that the legal owners held the vessel in trust for CML who would therefore hold the beneficial interest in her, see <span style="font-style:italic">I Congresso del Partido </span>[1978] QB 500. Thus if, as Mr Otero argues, CML was contracting in its own name it did so as beneficial owners of the vessel and, if that was so then s.21(4) operates to allow the <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> claim to proceed. </p>

Mr Du submitted that this was a matter of remedy which he did not address in his written submissions. The importance of the argument is that if Mr Du was correct with respect to his submissions as to the operation of s21(4) of the 1981 Act in this case the common law right to a possessory lien arises independently and the Court can make a declaration even if the requirements of s.21(4) are not satisfied.

That possessory lien remains in place after the arrest of the vessel, see <span style="font-style:italic">The Arantazu Mendi </span>[1939] AC 256, even where the arrest is at the instigation of the repairer, see <span style="font-style:italic">The Acacia</span> (1880) 4 Asp 254 unless there has been a waiver  of the possessory lien, see Kay J in <span style="font-style:italic">Angus v McLachlan </span>(1883) LR 23 ChD 330. There is nothing on the facts of the present case to suggest that has been the case. In cases of possessory lien the Court may make an order for sale, see <span style="font-style:italic">Larner v Fawcett </span>[1950] 2 All ER 727 and where a vessel is under arrest the Court may make an order for sale under CPR Part 61.10.
