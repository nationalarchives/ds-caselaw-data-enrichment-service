	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in">On or about 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2011, in the course of his said duties as a saturation diver, the Claimant was working at or about the Barge and was instructed to dive to a depth of around 20 – 30 metres. His task was to disconnect two chains holding two vertical piles together (one pile rested on top of the other pile). It is believed that there had been at least one (aborted) earlier attempt at the task allocated to the Claimant; the earlier attempt had been aborted as a result of poor visibility and a strong tide. The supervisor of the dive was a man known to the Claimant as Tuli and it is believed that he was employed by the First Defendant. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in">The top pile was used to drive down the second pile into the seabed (acting like a hammer on a nail). The second, bottom, pile – when embedded in the seabed – was then deployed like an anchor for a single buoy mooring used for tanker vessels while loading or unloading at the Barge. The chains connecting the piles were at a height of approximately 1.5 – 2 metres from the seabed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in">The Claimant left the surface in the dive basket. He exited the basket just below the keel of the Barge and then followed a swim line until he reached the seabed (eventually walking along the seabed holding the swim line). Visibility was poor (around one metre). As the Claimant approached the piles he began to leave the seabed (the swim line was higher at this location than it ought to have been). On reaching the piles the Claimant was swimming in mid-water while still holding the swim line in the strong tide. The swim line was attached to the top of the chain and not to the bottom shackle which the Claimant would have to remove. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in">The Claimant tried to secure his umbilical to give him more room to work (the strong tide was pulling him away from his task and was causing the umbilical to move around).  While the Claimant was securing his umbilical the top pile parted from the bottom pile. They parted because they were insecurely attached; there was too much “<span style="font-style:italic">slack</span>” in the chains holding them together. In addition, the swell and movement of the water caused the Barge to roll which also affected the movement of the piles. The Claimant’s right foot was sucked in between the parted piles before the top pile fell back on top of the bottom pile and, in doing so, crushed the Claimant’s foot. The Claimant’s foot was stuck for a few seconds before the piles moved again and the Claimant was able to remove his foot. The Claimant detached his umbilical and hopped/dragged himself back to the dive basket after informing the dive supervisor of the accident/injury (the basket had been removed to the surface and so the Claimant had to await its return). Following the Claimant’s accident, he learned that additional weight had been added to the tidal gauge in order to make the tide appear calmer than, in fact, it was at the material time.</p>

In that case the Claimant, a British national domiciled in England, worked as a security consultant in Iraq. He was employed by one or other of two corporate Defendants. One of the Defendant companies was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The other Defendant was incorporated in Iraq. The Claimant was injured in a road traffic accident in Iraq. He brought proceedings against both Defendants (expressing his claim in the alternative against each of them). He obtained permission to serve outside the jurisdiction by means of a without notice application to the Queen’s Bench Master. There was no appeal against that decision. In many respects the factual background was similar to the present case. As a general point the majority of first instance judges have been prepared to accept that even though the initial injury was suffered outside the jurisdiction the gateway condition is satisfied if the damage has continued within it. </p>

By a majority of 3 (Baroness Hale, Lords Clarke and Wilson) to 2 (Lords Sumption and Hughes) the Court expressed the view that the wider interpretation of PD6B para, 3.1(9)(a) should apply at least insofar as the rule refers to personal injuries although the majority did not deal specifically with consequential loss outside of the personal injury context. Lady Hale, at para 54, accepted the danger of a Claimant being able to ‘pick and choose’ her jurisdiction but considered that issue could be dealt with by a “<span style="font-style:italic">robust</span>” application of the <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span> discretion at the third stage of the test.

In the circumstances I consider that the fact that the Claimant has continued to suffer damage within the jurisdiction satisfies one of the limbs of the jurisdictional gateways in paragraph 3.1 of CPR 6BPD. </p>

It is the concept which the phrase reflects on which it is important to concentrate, i.e. of the court being satisfied or as satisfied as it can be having regard to the limitations which an interlocutory process imposes that factors exist which allow the court to take jurisdiction.’ When the case reached the House of Lords, Waller LJ's analysis was approved in general terms by Lord Steyn, with whom Lord Cooke of Thorndon and Lord Hope of Craighead agreed, but without full argument [2002] 1 AC 1, 13. The passage quoted has, however, been specifically approved twice by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council: </span><a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=8&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=ID0D88CB05D9311DBBA18BE18D2B47C2A">

The reference to “a much better argument on the material available” is not a reversion to the civil burden of proof which the House of Lords had rejected in Vitkovice. What is meant is (i) that the claimant must supply a plausible evidential basis for the application of a relevant jurisdictional gateway; (ii) that if there is an issue of fact about it, or some other reason for doubting whether it applies, the court must take a view on the material available if it can reliably do so; but (iii) the nature of the issue and the limitations of the material available at the interlocutory stage may be such that no reliable assessment can be made, in which case there is a good arguable case for the application of the gateway if there is a plausible (albeit contested) evidential basis for it.

	      </authorialNote> In <span style="font-style:italic">VTB Capital Plc</span> Lord Neuberger PSC provided the following additional guidance as to CPR Part 11 Applications of the present kind (at pp 375 – 376): “<span style="font-style:italic">When a court is called upon to decide whether an action should proceed in this, as opposed to another, jurisdiction, it is being asked to decide a procedural issue at a very early stage. Where, as is now the position in this case, it is common ground that the parties would have a fair trial in the competing jurisdiction, the exercise will normally involve the court weighing up a number of different factors, and deciding where the balance lies. Whilst the same considerations will not always apply to applications for permission to serve out and applications for stays of proceedings, the argument on this appeal has highlighted three general points in relation to each type of exercise. The first point is that hearings concerning the issue of appropriate forum should not involve masses of documents, long witness statements, detailed analysis of the issues, and long argument. It is self-defeating if, in order to determine whether an action should proceed to trial in this jurisdiction, the parties prepare for and conduct a hearing which approaches the putative trial itself, in terms of effort, time and cost. There is also a real danger that, if the hearing is an expensive and time-consuming exercise, it will be used by a richer party to wear down a poorer party, or by a party with a weak case to prevent, or at least to discourage, a party with a strong case from enforcing its rights. Quite apart from this, it is simply disproportionate for parties to incur costs, often running to hundreds of thousands of pounds each, and to spend many days in court, on such a hearing. The essentially relevant factors should, in the main at any rate, be capable of being identified relatively simply and, in many respects, uncontroversially. There is little point in going into much detail: when determining such applications, the court can only form preliminary views on most of the relevant legal issues and cannot be anything like certain about which issues and what evidence will eventuate if the matter proceeds to trial</span>.” Mr Chapman submitted that such considerations have additional force in a case like the present where there is recent authority (pursued through appeal to the highest level) which, if applied, would be conclusive on the tort gateway issue. I agree with him. </p>

Fifthly, if the court concludes at that stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the court will ordinarily refuse a stay. Sixthly, if, however, the court concludes that there is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should not be granted. In that enquiry, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including circumstances which go beyond those taken into account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions.

The principles which the court must apply, in exercising this power, are to be found in Spiliada ... . These may be briefly summarised. The legal burden rests on the Defendant to persuade the court to grant a stay. If the Defendant is able to satisfy the court that another jurisdiction is, prima facie, more appropriate, the burden moves to the Claimant to show why justice requires that the case should, nevertheless, be tried in England and Wales. Furthermore, the Defendant must not only demonstrate that England is not the appropriate (or convenient) forum, but also establish that another identified jurisdiction is clearly and distinctly more appropriate. The court must consider what factors point to the alternative forum being the natural forum and must determine the forum with which the action has the most substantial and real connection. Only if there is a forum which is more clearly more appropriate will a stay be granted. Even if a more convenient forum is identified, a stay should be refused if the court considers that, in all the circumstances, justice requires that the action should be heard in England. However, a stay will not be refused simply because a Claimant would thereby be deprived of a legitimate ‘personal or juridical’ advantage provided that the court can be satisfied that substantial justice will be done in the alternative forum. It should be regarded as immaterial that the alternative jurisdiction may reach a different result or that damages may be lower; the English court should be slow to assume that other judicial systems, different though they may be, are inferior, or cannot achieve substantial justice</span>.”</p>

It is preferable that an Indian court apply Indian law; (f) Witnesses with local knowledge of the site, weather and sea conditions are in India; (g) The piles on which the Claimant worked are still in place off the coast of India; (h) The factors connecting the claim to India are overwhelming. The only connection to the jurisdiction is that the Claimant returned to England after the accident and has suffered some of the consequences of his injury here; (i) The fact that, if the claim proceeds in the English court, the medico-legal and quantum experts instructed will be located in England is not relevant; it pre-supposes that the trial will proceed in England; (j) Unsurprisingly, the assessment of quantum is conducted differently in India and if necessary, evidence in the Indian court can be given by video link. On this aspect she relies upon the disputed witness statement of David McKie; (j) There is no risk of irreconcilable judgments, default judgment having been entered against Seatek, effectively drawing those proceedings to a close. In any event, India is an available forum for the trial of a claim against both Defendants; (k) In the circumstances, the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that England is clearly the more appropriate forum for the trial of this action. India is clearly the appropriate forum. Accordingly, for this separate reason, permission to serve out of the jurisdiction should be set aside. In the alternative, even if permission was rightly granted, the action against the Second Defendant, HHI, is more appropriately heard in India and by reason of default judgment being entered against Seatek no risk of parallel proceedings arises.

Evidence of foreign law is a matter of expert opinion and it is not acceptable to put forward unsubstantiated statements with respect to it. Moreover it is important that proper notice is given that such evidence is to be adduced. In my view the nature and timing of this evidence is not acceptable. It has not been provided in the form of a report made by a person who can be identified as being an expert in Indian Law. It was provided too late. It could and should have been provided much earlier and the delay is wholly unexplained. There has been a failure to provide notice of it as required by the rules of court, in particular CPR 33.7. For these reasons I consider that the evidence as to Indian Law contained in Mr. McKie’s witness statement should not be admitted in evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Two of the liability witnesses, with respect to the claim against the Second Defendant, namely the Claimant and his brother, are in England, On the other hand the only known witness for the Second Defendant on the issue of liability, namely Mr Kelly, is no longer in India and is, on the evidence, understood to be in Korea. The vessel in use at the time of the incident is no longer in India but in the Middle East. The incident took place off the coast of India and there is nothing to suggest that there are any relevant factual witnesses who are resident in India. On the contrary the injury was caused during a diving operation and at the centre of the liability trial there is certainly going to be expert evidence as to diving practice. Mr Chapman has submitted, and I accept, that such expertise is more likely to be available in England. I do not consider that the fact that the piles upon which the Claimant was working at the time of his injury are still in India is likely to be material nor do I consider that the local weather or tidal conditions, which may be relevant to the expert evidence, militate towards holding the trial in India. Such information should be readily available to a diving expert wherever he is. Such evidence will be ascertained from weather reports and from the tidal data available. Aside from official reports or predictions on those matters such evidence may also be available from those onboard the relevant vessel but she is no longer in India. Insofar as witnesses need to be called as to the practice onboard the relevant vessel, if they do, it is apparent that they are likely to be connected to the vessel itself rather than India. The reality is that the incident occurred in an offshore operation which appears to have little direct connection with India except that the Claimant’s immediate employers were Indian. The injury arises out of the sort of extra territorial marine incident which the Admiralty Court is frequently used to considering.  </p>

Although I was told by Ms Kinsler that it would submit to the Indian jurisdiction it was not stated that the Second Defendant would not seek to rely upon the Indian law relating to limitation if proceedings were now commenced in India.  No explanation was provided as to why the Second Defendant was prepared to submit to the jurisdiction of the Indian court rather than the English court and there is, in those circumstances, an inference that the Second Defendant is seeking to gain a juridical advantage by opposing jurisdiction in the present proceedings.  </p>

In line with the overriding objective, the court should adopt a calibrated approach that assessed the quality of the reason advanced. Accordingly, where a very good reason was supplied then an extension of time would usually be granted, where a weaker reason is provided then a Court will be more likely to refuse to grant an extension. </p>

It is enough for a defendant to show that he might be deprived of a defence of limitation if time for service of a claim form is extended; if he can show that, an extension should not be granted or, if granted without notice, such extension should be set aside, see Hashtroodi v Hancock [2004] 1 WLR 3206 (paragraph 18) and Hoddinott v Persimmon Homes (Wessex) Ltd [2008] 1 WLR 806 (paragraph </span>

The key assertion made by Mr McKie is that the Claimant should, in the context of Applications to extend time for service overseas, have alerted the Court to some aspect of the Indian law of limitation.

This claim was commenced by the issue of a CPR Part 7 Claim Form in time pursuant to English law and, if Mr McKie is correct, pursuant to Indian law as well. It is not clear whether Mr McKie is suggesting that a failure to serve (validly) within the limitation period will result in the operation of a time bar? Alternatively, it is not clear whether he is suggesting that defective service means that a limitation defence will be available? Mr McKie has not described the Indian limitation point that the Claimant has allegedly failed to disclose.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in">Furthermore, the Skeleton Argument filed on the Second Defendant’s behalf on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 takes a further new point as to defective service: namely, that the Claimant should – in the context of without notice Applications to extend time for service – have alerted the Court to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie</span> which, if the Supreme Court majority is correct, is now bad law (at least as to the proper approach to the tort gateway). This further new point clearly did not occur to Mr McKie (on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June) or to his predecessors. It was raised for the first time on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 (nearly 4 years after the Court of Appeal delivered judgment on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2015). The delay is all the more inexplicable in circumstances where – as long ago as March 2016 – the Second Defendant prosecuted this CPR Part 11 Application at a Hearing at which <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie</span> (in the Court of Appeal) was the sole and express reason for the adjournment.</p>

In this regard, a discretion will be exercised: see, <span style="font-style:italic">DDM v Al-Zahra</span> [2018] EWHC 346 (QB). It is submitted that the extraordinary and wholly unexplained delay by the Second Defendant in this matter is relevant to the exercise of such discretion (in respect of both points – as to Indian limitation and as to <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie</span> in the Court of Appeal – now raised by the Second Defendant). It is also relevant to consider in this context (and from the Claimant’s perspective): (i) the delays inherent in seeking the assistance of the FPS for service overseas; and, (ii) the consistent failure of the Second Defendant in this case to provide disclosure or to respond to requests to nominate solicitors for service within the jurisdiction (see again, <span style="font-style:italic">DDM v Al-Zahra</span> [2018] EWHC 346 (QB) in which, among other matters, doubt is expressed about reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">Foran v Secret Surgery</span> [2016] EWHC 1029 (QB))<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">. </span>My attention was also drawn to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">DDM v AlZahra </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 1103 in which the decision of Foskett J at first instant was reversed in part although it may be noted that his observations as to <span style="font-style:italic">Foran v Secret Surgery </span>were approved, see para.77 <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Haddon-Cave LJ.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">It is trite that the court has to exercise its discretion in relation to applications of this nature. In this respect the overriding objective and the requirement not to come to a decision which would be disproportionate are highly relevant. In the present case the proceedings were issued within the limitation period. Nonetheless, given that the claim is for damages arising from personal injury and the date of the issue of the claim form appears on its face the fact that limitation issues would arise if it were not served in time (within 6 months in the present case, see CPR Part 7.5(2)) must always have been obvious. The applications for permission to extend time fell within 7.6(2) and were prospective rather than retrospective. In <span style="font-style:italic">Collier v Williams </span>[2006] EWCA Civ 20 the Court of Appeal held that the court could allow an application to extend time prospectively under 7.6(2) without being satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken albeit, following <span style="font-style:italic">Hashtroodi v Hancock </span>[2004] EWCA Civ. 652, a valid reason for the application must be advanced. In the present case reasons were given, although Ms Kinsler disputes their validity, and the Court allowed an extension on three occasions. Although she submits that the reason given on the first cannot be valid it nonetheless passed muster before the judge. That is also true of the applications made on the second and third occasions. To say that endeavours to make contact with the defendant and seek to persuade them to appoint solicitors within the jurisdiction must be disregarded is putting the matter too high. Admiralty matters frequently involve defendants who are outside the jurisdiction and such processes frequently bear fruit and obviate a great deal of procedural difficulty and expense. Given also the overriding principle, which indicates that litigation and unnecessary expense should be avoided where possible, it seems to me to be unduly harsh to criticise solicitors for acting as the present solicitors did. Further with respect to foreign service the difficulties are well known to the judges who considered the applications and they would in my view be entitled to take judicial knowledge of them and require a lesser degree of evidence in line with <span style="font-style:italic">Collier v Williams </span>(supra).</p>

That submission relied upon the evidence of Mr McKie as to Indian Law which I have already ruled to be inadmissible. It follows that the criticism is not made good because, absent evidence to the contrary, the parties and the court, were entitled to assume that foreign law is the same as English law at the time when the application was made and considered. It follows that there was no material failure of disclosure by the Claimant at the relevant  time.</p>

In fact the time at which the tort gateway was to be considered was the time when the permission to serve out was given which is now the subject of this application under CPR Part 11. It seems to me that it would be invidious to expect each judge considering an application for an extension for time to serve to have to reconsider in every case whether permission to serve out was properly given. Even if that decision had been brought to the attention of the Court at the time of the applications to extend it must also have been drawn to the court’s attention that it was under appeal to the Supreme Court which must, almost inevitably, have led to a decision allowing the extension so that the CPR Part 11 point would be raised, as it has in the present case, at the appropriate time, namely, with the agreement of the parties, after the decision of the Supreme Court had been made. To have refused an extension of time, at the time when the applications were made, when the law with respect to the jurisdictional gateway was under specific consideration by the senior court, would in my view have been oppressive. </p>
