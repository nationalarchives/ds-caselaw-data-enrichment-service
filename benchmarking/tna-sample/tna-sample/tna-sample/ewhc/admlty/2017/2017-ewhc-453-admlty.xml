	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">On 11 February 2015 a collision occurred between a laden VLCC, ALEXANDRA 1, owned by Nautical Challenge Ltd., a company registered in the Marshall Islands, and a laden container vessel, EVER SMART, owned by Evergreen Marine (UK) Ltd., a company registered in the UK. The collision between these two large vessels occurred just outside the dredged channel by which vessels enter and exit the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. The collision was at night but there were clear skies and good visibility. The damage suffered by ALEXANDRA 1 (in way of her bows) is said to amount to over US$32 million. The lesser damage suffered by EVER SMART (to her port bow) is said to amount to almost US$4 million.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">Both vessels carried a Voyage Data Recorder (devices which record navigational data of use in accident investigations, see <span style="font-style:italic">Marsden and Gault, Collisions at Sea</span> 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>ed. Appendix 18). Accordingly the parties were required at the Case Management Conference to exercise their best endeavours to agree the track of each vessel. The parties were able to do so. In consequence the parties have also been able to agree a schedule showing the course, heading and speed of the vessels from C-26 until collision. The schedule also shows the engine orders (taken from the engine loggers of each vessel) and the helm orders issued on each vessel (taken from the audio record of what was said on the bridge of each vessel). In the result, save for one disputed helm order, there is little factual dispute concerning the navigation of either vessel (apart from issues relating to the perception of those on the bridge of one vessel of what the other vessel was doing). This is now common in collision actions; see <span style="font-style:italic">Samco Europe</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">MSC Prestige</span> [2011] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 579 at paragraph 2 and <span style="font-style:italic">Nordlake </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Seaeagle</span> [2016] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 656 at paragraph 7. The prevalence of electronic data which records the navigation of each vessel has led the court, with the assistance of the Admiralty Bar and the Admiralty Solicitors Group, to propose (i) the early disclosure and inspection of such data so that the navigation of vessels in collision can be agreed at an early stage and (ii) in the event of there still being a dispute as to liability, the adoption of trial procedures designed to achieve a speedy and cost effective resolution of that dispute. The required changes to CPR 61 and PD 61 came into force on 28 February 2017; see the Civil Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2017 SI 95 of 2017 and the 88<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> update to the Practice Directions. The effect of those changes are summarised on the court’s web site and will be included in Section N of the Admiralty and Commercial Courts Guide.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">In this case, notwithstanding the agreed track of each vessel, there was a substantial dispute as to liability and in particular as to the relevance and applicability of the "crossing rule", rule 15 of the Collision Regulations. At trial there were short openings and no oral evidence was called. Counsel made oral submissions as to liability over 2 days. The trial was, however, disrupted by the need for the parties to agree a transcript and, where necessary, a translation of the audio record of what was said or heard on the bridge of each vessel. This ought to have been agreed long before the start of the trial. It is important for parties to inform the court at the case management conference of what electronic records there are so that appropriate orders can be made so as to ensure that there is an agreed interpretation of all relevant records before the commencement of the trial.  Audio records from the bridge of a vessel are obviously relevant and important records.  In the present case some translations were not agreed and so I was given two translations. However, it was not suggested that the sense or tenor of the two translations differed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">In the light of the electronic data recording the vessel’s navigation it is unnecessary to dwell upon the failure of the owners of ALEXANDRA 1 to retain her original working chart, course record trace, log or engine logger print out or upon the reasons why the owners of EVER SMART produced as their original working chart a different working chart from that which they had supplied to the MAIB. It is also unnecessary to dwell upon the account given by the master of ALEXANDRA 1 of his vessels’ navigation in his Letter of Protest which was in some respects untrue (as shown by the electronic data) or upon the account given by the master of EVER SMART in his log and statements of fact which was also in some respects untrue (as shown by the electronic data). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">The navigation of both vessels has been helpfully illustrated by the parties. A copy of the agreed track of each vessel is annexed to this judgment. In addition the ALEXANDRA 1 interests prepared a video of radar screen shots taken from the VDR of EVER SMART and the EVER SMART interests prepared a number of videos using the data from the VDR of each vessel showing a bird’s eye view of the collision and also the view from the bridge of each vessel. Those videos, whilst interesting to view, did not contain any more information regarding the navigation of the vessels than was apparent from the agreed track and schedule of navigation.    </p>

At about 1600 she raised her anchor and was instructed by Port Control to wait 2.5 miles from buoy no.1.  At about 2118 Port Control told ALEXANDRA 1 that no pilot would be available before midnight. Her master decided to return to the anchorage rather than continue drifting. ALEXANDRA 1 anchored at about 2200 but at about the same time was instructed by Port Control that a pilot would be boarding at 2315 and that ALEXANDRA 1 should be “at buoy no.1” at that time.  The master replied that at 2314 he would be “at buoy no.1”. By 2247 ALEXANDRA 1 was underway. At 2254 Port Control informed ALEXANDRA 1 that the pilot was on the outbound EVER SMART passing buoy no.12 and that EVER SMART would continue “up to buoy no.1”. Port Control advised that “once EVER SMART was clear then you can enter the channel.” The master replied that he was “coming close 1 nautical mile close to buoy No.1; will wait until another the vessel leave the channel, thank you.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">The audio record on the bridge of ALEXANDRA 1 suggests that at about 2318 or C24 the master of ALEXANDRA 1 was irritated that he had been told that the pilot would board at 2315 when in fact EVER SMART was still proceeding along the channel in the vicinity of the no.6 buoys. At this time the engines of ALEXANDRA 1 were stopped and her helm was amidships. Her speed over the ground was 2.3 knots and her course made good was 126 degrees but her heading was 110 degrees. It is possible that at such a low speed and with an easterly wind her heading was falling off to port. At 2320 or C-22 the audio record on ALEXANDRA 1 records the words “Hard starboard” (in English), followed by “right full rudder" (in Russian). It was submitted on behalf of ALEXANDRA 1 that at this time her helm was put hard starboard and remained so until collision. This was not accepted by counsel on behalf of EVER SMART who pointed out that the words were spoken in a conversational tone and were followed by whistling. It was suggested that it was not a command. However, the heading was falling off to port and so it would make sense to put the helm hard starboard. It is difficult to identify a meaning for the recorded words apart from a helm order. I therefore accept that it is likely that there was a hard starboard helm order, notwithstanding that the heading of ALEXANDRA 1 in fact continued to fall off to port. However, the master makes no reference in his statement (or in any other document) to the helm of his vessel being at hard starboard for some 20 minutes before the collision which suggests that the helm change was no more than temporary. There is no audio record of a helm “amidships” order but I consider that there must have been one sometime after C-22. The helmsman, in a statement dated 19 September 2016, gives no evidence of helm orders until 2334 or C-8 when he says he was instructed to put the rudder amidships. Quite how he recalled in September 2016 that that order was given at 2334 I do not know. I therefore do not find his evidence as to the time of the order persuasive though his evidence that there was an amidships order is consistent with the probabilities. It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from the heading and course made good data of ALEXANDRA 1 as to when the amidships order might have been in circumstances where she was proceeding at less than 2 knots.  </p>

She was now about 1 mile west north west of buoys no.1. At 2328 or C-14 the master overheard a conversation between Port Control and the tugboat ZAKHEER BRAVO. The tug was towing a barge and requested permission to pass the pilot station from west to east en route to Jumeirah. She was asked if she could see a waiting tanker and she replied that it was on her starboard bow. Port Control advised her to proceed at least one mile astern of the tanker. The master of ALEXANDRA 1 mistakenly thought that Port Control was speaking to EVER SMART. This caused him concern because he did not understand how EVER SMART could pass one mile astern of ALEXANDRA 1. He feared that if ALEXANDRA 1 went around buoy no.1 there would be a “fucking crunch” at the entrance to the channel. At 2331 or C-11 ALEXANDRA 1 stopped her engines but then put them to dead slow ahead again at 2332 or C-10. By this time she was about 9 cables west north west of buoys no.1. Her speed over the ground was 1.8 knots, her course made good was 101 degrees and her heading was 97 degrees.  </p>

The audio record has the master saying “it is time for us to make a turn.” He must have had in mind a turn to starboard for the channel. The plots provided by the parties showing the progress of ALEXANDRA 1 do indeed show her at C-5 as approaching the point at which one would expect her to turn to starboard so as to line up on the starboard side of the approaches to the channel. But the course made good and heading changes between C-5 and C-4 do not suggest that there was any starboard helm action.  </p>

The audio record again suggests that the master was concerned that it was about time to turn into the channel between buoys no.1. “And now student [or “grasshopper”] we need to move between these two buoys, red on the left, green on the right …………Don’t even think of smashing into it” [or “and not to slam into something”]. Counsel for EVER SMART submitted that this was an instruction to the helmsman to steer into the channel but the third officer is more likely to be the “student” than the helmsman. The audio record does not contain a starboard helm order, none of those on the bridge of ALEXANDRA 1 refer in their statements to a starboard helm order and no such helm order is pleaded by ALEXANDRA 1. The heading of ALEXANDRA 1 did not appreciably change.   I therefore do not consider that there was a helm order. The master did however consider that it was time to turn to starboard so as to turn into the channel. The effect of not turning to starboard was that ALEXANDRA 1 continued heading so as to cross the approaches to the channel.    </p>

ALEXANDRA 1 had EVER SMART on her starboard bow and so, it was submitted, was under a duty to keep out of the way of EVER SMART pursuant to rule 15 of the Collision Regulations. On behalf of ALEXANDRA 1 Miss Selvaratnam QC submitted that authority establishes that the crossing rules have very limited, if any, application to questions of navigation in and around a narrow channel and in particular do not apply to a vessel in a narrow channel and a vessel navigating towards that channel in preparation for entering it. Further, she submitted that the “crossing” situation had only come about by reason of EVER SMART’s failure to navigate on the starboard side of the channel after the pilot had disembarked and in such circumstances EVER SMART was not entitled to invoke the crossing rule. She also submitted that the crossing rule did not apply because EVER SMART was not on a sufficiently defined course. Finally, she submitted that if the crossing rule otherwise applied it was ousted by rule 18(a)(ii) which requires a power driven vessel underway to keep out of the way of a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre. ALEXANDRA 1 was, she submitted, restricted in her ability to manoeuvre because she was waiting to embark the pilot. </p>

Those are not the circumstances of the present case. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse</span> [1907] P.36 and 259  the court had to determine whether the crossing rule applied as between a vessel exiting a port between two breakwaters and a vessel preparing to enter the port through the same breakwaters. Sir Gorrell Barnes, President, in a judgment given a little more than three weeks after the collision had occurred, thought, “having regard to the locality and the difficulties there are in applying [the crossing rule] the probability is that [the crossing rule] is not applicable” (see p.44). The Court of Appeal agreed. Lord Alverstone CJ said that he had “very little doubt” that the crossing rule did not apply. He considered that the narrow channel applied to the entrance into the port through the breakwaters (see p.263). I am not persuaded that it would be safe to apply that decision, which involved a narrow channel through breakwaters, to the present case which involves a long dredged channel. <span style="font-style:italic">The Treherbert</span> [1933] 47 Ll.

This was an appeal in a criminal case arising out of a serious collision off Hong Kong as a result of which there was much loss of life. The masters of both vessels had been convicted of a criminal offence and each appealed. One of the questions certified for hearing on the appeal was whether the crossing rules apply when a vessel is approaching a channel on a crossing course involving risk of collision with another vessel navigating in the channel; see paragraph 142. There was however another question, which Lord Clarke described as “the most important issue” in the case namely, whether the buoyed channel was a narrow channel within rule 9 of the Collision Regulations; see paragraph 150. It was held that it was; see paragraph 198. Lord Clarke further held that the vessel (N67) which was navigating in the narrow channel was bound by the narrow channel rule and not by the crossing rule. He said that the observations of Willmer J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Empire Brent</span> were “plainly correct”; see paragraph 201.  He also said that the observations of Hewson J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Canberra Star</span> seemed “good sense”; see paragraph 217-8.

Thus YH, like ALEXANDRA 1, had a vessel on her starboard bow proceeding along the narrow channel which she wished to enter.

Similarly, where one vessel is within a narrow channel and has a vessel on her port bow on a crossing course outside the channel but proceeding towards it in preparation for entering it, the vessel in the narrow channel cannot be under a duty (pursuant to the crossing rules) to maintain her course and speed and at the same time under a duty (pursuant to the narrow channel rule) to keep to the starboard side of the channel since the two duties may, depending upon the circumstances, require different action.

The change of heading to starboard is more likely to have been the result of the engines of ALEXANDRA 1 being put full astern at C-2.  But the circumstances before that were that ALEXANDRA 1 had been proceeding very slowly towards the channel entrance whilst waiting to embark her pilot in order to proceed down the channel. It does not appear to me that that is a material distinction from the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Kulemesin v HKSAR</span> such as to render the crossing rules applicable at the same time as the narrow channel rule was applicable to EVER SMART.  That would be unsafe for the reasons indicated by Lord Clarke and Willmer J. and so would not be consistent with the principles underlying the Collision Regulations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">First, it was said that when the pilot had disembarked from EVER SMART the only reason that the vessels were crossing so as to involve risk of collision was that EVER SMART had allowed herself to navigate on the portside of the channel. Had she navigated on the starboard side of the channel there would have been no collision (as shown by a "counterfactual" plot). The authorities show that a vessel cannot claim the benefit of rule 15 of the Collision Regulations when the vessel brings about the crossing situation by her own fault; see <span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Spyros</span> [1953] 1 Lloyd’s Rep.501 at p.509 and <span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Forest Pioneer </span> [2007] EWHC 84 (Comm) at paragraph 39.  However, rule 15 applies when vessels are crossing so to involve a risk of collision. Rule 7(d)(i) provides that risk of collision shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change. The agreed schedule shows that the bearing of ALEXANDRA 1 from EVER SMART did not appreciably change. Although EVER SMART was not on the starboard side of the channel it is unlikely that the bearing would have appreciably changed had she been on the starboard side throughout her transit of the channel. The counterfactual plot (showing that there would have been no collision had EVER SMART navigated on the starboard side of the channel) shows a passing distance of only three quarters of a cable, about 450 feet. Thus the risk of collision was not brought about by the fault of EVER SMART. It was brought about by her proceeding out of the channel on a course of 314 degrees. That course was, in the language of Steel J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Forest Pioneer</span> “necessitated by external circumstances", namely, the direction and width of the channel.    </p>

The agreed schedule of the vessels’ navigation shows that her course made good from C-26 was between 312 and 315 degrees (and that her heading varied between 315 and 319). It was or ought to have been clear to ALEXANDRA 1 that she was on a course which took her along the line of the dredged channel. That surely was a sufficiently constant direction for the purposes of the crossing rule. </p>

The term “restricted in her ability to manoeuvre” is defined in rule 3(g) of the Collision Regulations as meaning a vessel "which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel".  The term expressly includes (see rule 3(g)(iii)) a vessel engaged in transferring persons. But had the crossing rule applied and ALEXANDRA 1 had been obliged to keep out of the way of EVER SMART she could have done so, for example at C-6, by putting her engines astern and so permitting EVER SMART to cross ahead in safety or by turning to starboard. She was not restricted in her ability to take such action by reason of embarking the pilot because that work had not commenced (and never did commence). Her turning circle data shows that she could have turned 180 degrees within half a mile.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">In her oral submissions Miss Selvaratnam also submitted that the vessels were not crossing because “everybody knew that ALEXANDRA 1 was about to board the pilot to enter the channel and so would not be expected to cross ahead of EVER SMART”. Mr. Turner responded by saying that it was sufficient, as explained in the <span style="font-style:italic">Albano,</span> if the vessels would, if they continued doing what each of them was respectively doing, arrive at the same spot so as to involve risk of collision. However, I am very doubtful that ALEXANDRA 1 was on a sufficiently constant heading to be on a course. The agreed schedule shows that from C-26 until C-23 her course over the ground varied from 119 to 127 degrees (altering to starboard), from C-23 until C-12 her course over the ground varied from 127 to 81 degrees (altering to port), from C-12 until C-7 her course over the ground varied from 81 to 115 degrees (altering to starboard) and from C-7 until C-1.5 her course over the ground varied from 115 to 91 degrees (altering to port). During that same period her heading also varied; from C-26 until C-14 her heading varied from 112 to 84 degrees (altering to port), from C-14 until C-8 her heading altered from 84 to 100 degrees (altering to starboard) and from C-8 until C-3 her heading altered from 100 to 90 degrees (altering to port). This variation of course made good and of heading was no doubt caused by the circumstance that ALEXANDRA 1 was proceeding very slowly (about 1-2 knots over the ground). At such a slow speed ALEXANDRA 1 was not very manoeuvrable. Nevertheless she made progress in a broadly east south easterly direction towards the entrance of the channel as she waited to embark the pilot. Was she on a sufficiently constant direction or heading to be on a course? I do not consider that she was. Her "course made good" varied between 81 and 127 degrees (and her heading varied between 84 and 112 degrees). It is difficult to describe that as "a course" (though her preliminary act describes her as being on an east south easterly course).  I would describe her as maintaining a broadly east or east south easterly heading as she waited for the pilot vessel to approach. That required her to have some, but not very much, way on. I would describe ALEXANDRA 1 as waiting for the pilot vessel to arrive rather than being on a course. Had a good lookout been kept on board EVER SMART from C-21 until collision it would have been apparent that ALEXANDRA 1 had moved less than a mile. It would or ought to have been obvious that she was waiting to embark a pilot.  </p>

EVER SMART was 42 metres in breadth. The channel was a little under 2 cables in width. It was therefore safe and practicable for EVER SMART to navigate well to starboard of mid channel.

I am unable to accept that submission. EVER SMART was or ought to have been aware that ALEXANDRA 1 was proceeding towards the channel intending to embark the pilot and then proceed down the channel. Certainly the pilot was aware of that when on board EVER SMART. In those circumstances it was incumbent upon EVER SMART to comply with rule 9 so as to ensure that if the vessels met in the channel they would pass safely port to port. No particular submissions were made in this regard with respect to the instruction by Port Control to ALEXANDRA 1 that she should proceed down the channel after EVER SMART was clear. But even if this had been overheard by EVER SMART the two vessels might still meet in the approaches to the channel beyond buoys no.1 and so it remained necessary for EVER SMART to navigate on the starboard side of the channel so that if they met in the approaches they would pass safely port to port. It was further submitted that the breach of rule 9 was not causative. I am unable to accept that submission. The effect of the breach was that it created a risk that the vessels might not pass safely port to port. That is sufficient to be a material cause of the collision. The master’s order to steer 319 degrees was likely to have been ordered with a view to bringing EVER SMART back towards the starboard side. But she never returned to the starboard side. When she passed buoys no.1 she was still on the port side of the channel. She passed the green buoy on her portside at a distance of just over half a cable, whereas the red buoy on her starboard side was passed at a distance of almost a cable.</p>

Rule 7(b) of the Collision Regulations provides that “proper use shall be made of radar equipment……and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.” It was submitted on behalf of EVER SMART that there was insufficient time at C-6 (after the pilot had disembarked) to capture the echo of ALEXANDRA 1 as an ARPA target. Reliance was placed on the master’s note of his interview with the MAIB in which he said that it would take 2-3 minutes to acquire the echo as an ARPA target and reliance was also placed on the explanation by the court (Geoffrey Brice QC) in <span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Contship Success</span> [1998] 2 Lloyd’s Reports 488 at p.494 that international standards require that within one minute a relative target motion trend shall be provided and that within 3 minutes the true motion of the target with 95% probability shall be provided.

This would have been at least 5 miles before the departure position of the pilot.  Furthermore, the use and monitoring of ARPA (either manually acquired or automatically acquired) should have been assigned to a single officer as part of the Bridge Team.

(That is my understanding of the phrase “a minimum of 3 minutes should have been sufficient”.) The pilot departed EVER SMART as she was approaching the no.2 buoys. 5 miles before that EVER SMART would have been approaching buoys no. 8. Thus the advice given by the Elder Brethren suggests that in their opinion ALEXANDRA 1 ought to have been detected when EVER SMART was approaching buoys no.8. (In this regard it is to be noted that the master of ALEXANDRA 1 observed EVER SMART by radar when that vessel was at buoys no.8.) However, Mr. Turner in his comments upon the advice of the Elder Brethren has said that it was apparent from the radar images that ALEXANDRA 1 was only detected by radar at about 2322 or C-20 when EVER SMART was passing buoys no.6. If that is so then ALEXANDRA 1 ought to have been acquired as a reliable ARPA target by about C-17 which was when EVER SMART was passing buoys no.5. Thus it is clear that, allowing 3 minutes to acquire a reliable ARPA target, those on the bridge of EVER SMART ought to have had a reliable ARPA target of ALEXANDRA 1 several minutes before the pilot disembarked. They did not do so. There was a failure to keep a good radar lookout.   </p>

Those documents record that ALEXANDRA 1 was seen to be on a collision course. Such an observation is inconsistent with the explanation in the master's witness summary and is not relied upon by the EVER SMART interests. However, the explanation is supported or corroborated by the master’s VHF message sent to his owners about 6 minutes after the collision when he said that he did not realise that ALEXANDRA 1 was “transverse”. It seems to that that near contemporaneous explanation is likely to be true or, put another way, unlikely to have been fabricated. Further, it is improbable that the master completely failed to see a VLCC ahead of him and on his port bow in circumstances where the pilot had expressly advised him that there was a vessel to port. I consider it more likely than not that the master did observe the vessel after the pilot left. The vessels were about 1.5 miles apart at C-6 when EVER SMART was passing buoys no.2. It is likely that the observation was made shortly after the pilot left the bridge. His witness summary suggests it was at C-3 but this seems unlikely because at C-3 the vessels were less than a mile apart. However, the master did not keep ALEXANDRA 1 under observation. That is apparent from his question "what's that ?" three seconds before the collision. If it is right that he asked himself immediately after the collision why he did not see “it”, “it” was the vessel heading across his bows rather than, as he had assumed but without checking by radar or by visual observation, passing port to port. He has said that the pilot told him that the vessels would pass port to port but there is no evidence of that on the audio record. It is likely that it was his own assumption. </p>

Masthead lights are visible at a minimum distance of 6 miles and sidelights are visible at a minimum distance of 3 miles (see rule 22 of the Collision Regulations).  Had the master kept a good visual lookout he would have seen not only the green side light of ALEXANDRA 1 but also the orientation of the masthead lights which would have indicated to him from about C-4 that ALEXANDRA 1 was not set to pass EVER SMART port to port but was heading across his bows or, as he told his owners, "transverse". Had he acquired ALEXANDRA 1 as an ARPA target with a low CPA and paid attention to the radar he would have been alerted to the risk of collision by a CPA alarm and the heading of ALEXANDRA 1 would also have been apparent so that the master would have appreciated that ALEXANDRA 1 was not turning to starboard. Instead he continued to assume that the vessels were set to pass port to port. The master failed to use either his eyes or his radar to confirm his assumption. If he had done so he would have realised that his assumption was mistaken. I therefore accept that the master’s lookout was seriously defective. He ought to have been assisted by the officer of the watch, the third officer. But the third officer had left the bridge to escort the pilot to the portside ladder and when he returned to the bridge he went into the chart room to “update the log book” and did not concern himself, as he ought to have done, with his duty to keep a good lookout.  </p>

At C-5 the master increased the engines to half ahead, at C-4 he increased the engines to full ahead (manoeuvring) and at C-3½ he increased the engines to full sea speed. The result of these engine movements was that at collision EVER SMART had a speed over the ground of 12.4 knots.

This observation is confirmed by the audio record at C-6 (“it is slowing down, pushing the brake pedal”) at which time the pilot had disembarked from EVER SMART and the speed of that vessel had fallen.  In his witness statement the master said that it was clear to him that EVER SMART was not turning to port as he had (mistakenly) expected her to do. This is confirmed by the audio record. At C-5 it evidences the master’s frustration with EVER SMART (“kindly fuck off please ….it is time for us to make a turn”) which suggests that he was watching her. The audio record also shows that he continued to observe EVER SMART because at C-2 (when EVER SMART was passing the no.1 buoys) he notes that EVER SMART has not changed course and asks “what’s he doing ?”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">Thus it appears that the master of ALEXANDRA 1, notwithstanding that he may have failed to acquire EVER SMART as an ARPA target, did keep a good visual lookout such that he was aware of EVER SMART’s progress down the channel, that she had slowed down to disembark the pilot and that she was maintaining her down channel course and was not altering to port as he (mistakenly) expected her to do at the no.1 buoys. It was submitted that the master had a “constant appreciation” of what EVER SMART was doing. That submission is supported by the audio record. Thus although there may have been a failure to use ARPA it does not appear that such failure was causative of the collision. I am not persuaded to reach any different conclusion because the master’s letter of protest contains inaccuracies which Mr. Turner submitted were lies to make things look better than they were. The audio record is cogent contemporaneous evidence of the master’s visual lookout.   </p>

The master of ALEXANDRA 1 misheard or misunderstood the VHF conversation between Port Control and ZAKHEER BRAVO. He thought, mistakenly, that the conversation was between Port Control and EVER SMART and so concluded that EVER SMART was being instructed to pass astern of him at a distance of a mile. Since the name of ZAKHEER BRAVO was clearly stated on VHF, as was the fact that she was towing a barge from west to east, it is likely that the master was not listening carefully. ZAKHEER BRAVO was at the time of the conversation off the starboard quarter of ALEXANDRA 1 as indicated by the screen shot of EVER SMART’s radar at C-12. It was submitted that it was “not negligent to mishear a conversation”. I am not sure whether it was intended by that submission to say that the master was not under a duty to listen to the conversation. But if that was intended I think that it was his duty to listen carefully because the conversation concerned his vessel (“the big tanker waiting there”). It was after the reference to his vessel that ZAKHEER BRAVO said that the </p>

But even if his mishearing or misunderstanding could be explained by the noise of other conversations the master rightly appreciated that the instruction given by Port Control made no sense if it was directed at EVER SMART because it gave rise to a risk of collision with ALEXANDRA 1 in the vicinity of the no.1 buoys. Notwithstanding that appreciation, the master continued to think (right up until collision and afterwards) that EVER SMART really had been instructed to pass astern of ALEXANDRA 1. He was therefore expecting EVER SMART to turn to port at the seaward end of the channel. Having heard a message which made no sense to him because it gave rise to a risk of collision he ought to have checked whether his understanding was correct, either by contacting Port Control or EVER SMART. That was part and parcel of his duty to keep a good aural lookout; alternatively, good seamanship required him to check his understanding. The use of VHF for such purposes is permissible; see <span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Mineral Dampier</span> [2001] 2 Lloyd’s Reports 419 at paragraphs 37-38.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">I therefore consider that the master’s aural lookout was defective. It seems to me that it was causative of the collision. The master realised at C-5 and C-4 that ALEXANDRA 1 ought to be turning to starboard towards the channel. However, he did not order starboard helm because he mistakenly thought that EVER SMART had been directed to pass astern of ALEXANDRA 1. Had he not been under this mistaken impression it is probable that ALEXANDRA 1 would have turned to starboard at C-5 or C-4 in order to approach the channel in such a way as to enter it on a down channel course and on the starboard side of it which would entail the two vessels passing port to port in the approaches to the channel. Instead, ALEXANDRA 1 headed so as to cross the approaches to the channel so as to give room for EVER SMART to turn to port (and for the vessels to pass starboard to starboard). When the master realised at C-2 that EVER SMART was not changing course to port at the no.1 buoys, as he thought she would, he put the engines of ALEXANDRA 1 full astern. This had the effect of turning the vessel’s heading to starboard (as a result of transverse thrust from the propeller when the engines were put full astern) but at collision ALEXANDRA 1 was still heading across the entrance to the channel and had there been no collision she would have continued onto the portside of the approaches to the channel. Miss Selvaratnam stressed that ALEXANDRA 1 “remained on her own side of the notional mid line of the channel extended up into the pilotage boarding area”. That is true. But she was heading so as to cross that line and would have done so had there been no collision. </p>

Although ALEXANDRA 1 was not blocking the exit to the channel in the sense that EVER SMART could, by altering course to starboard on passing buoys no.1, have avoided collision (by crossing ahead of ALEXANDRA 1 at a distance of only about a cable, as indicated on the plot to which I was referred) it does not follow that the prior fault by ALEXANDRA 1 in the form of her poor aural lookout, which resulted in her heading across the channel rather than having altered to course to starboard so as to pass EVER SMART port to port in the approaches to the channel, was not causative.

However, the effect of such engine movements was to increase the vessel’s speed from a little under 2 knots (C-10) to a little more than 2 knots whilst she awaited the pilot.

It seems to me that, but for the master’s poor aural lookout, he would have altered course to starboard so as to approach the channel in such manner that when he reached it ALEXANDRA 1 would be on the starboard side of the channel in accordance with the narrow channel rule. Instead, at C-3 ALEXANDRA 1 was heading about 90 degrees so as to cross the approaches to the channel and at collision ALEXANDRA 1 was crossing the approaches to the channel on a heading of 101 degrees with her bows on the centre line of the channel (as extended from the no.1 buoys).  From such position it would have been difficult to reach the channel at the no.1 buoys on the starboard side of it.  Miss Selvaratnam said that because from C-2 ALEXANDRA 1 was taking avoiding action her position at collision cannot be used to suggest that she would not or could not have entered the channel on her starboard side; but it was her failure to alter course at C-4 which meant that it would be difficult for her to reach the channel on the starboard side of it. If it could have been achieved by a laden VLCC in the 5 cables available it would have entailed ALEXANDRA 1, having crossed onto the portside of the approaches to the channel, applying starboard helm to regain the starboard side of the approaches to the channel before applying port helm to adopt a down channel course by the time the starboard hand no. 1 buoy was reached. Such a snaking manoeuvre is not the sort of manoeuvre which would be expected of a vessel approaching a narrow channel. However, this was not an additional fault. Her failure to turn to starboard at C-5 or C-4 was caused by her poor aural lookout.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">It is accepted that ALEXANDRIA 1’s AIS was not working on the day of the collision. Mr. Turner submitted that those on board ALEXANDRA 1 had switched off her AIS system and that she therefore had no ready means of identifying vessels in her vicinity. It was further submitted that had her AIS system been working ALEXANDRA 1 would have triggered an alert on EVER SMART’s radar. I was not persuaded that there was any causative negligence in this regard. First, the suggestion that the AIS system had been switched off was based upon no more than, in circumstances where it had been alleged that ALEXANDRA 1 had not been properly equipped with AIS and/or that the AIS had not been operated, the absence of evidence dealing with these allegations. It was suggested that in the light of the “yawning gap” in the evidence the “only safe conclusion” was that the AIS was capable of working and had been switched off. I do not consider that it would be safe to draw that conclusion. In an email dated 20 February 2015, that is 9 days after the collision, the master of ALEXANDRA 1 reported that the AIS system sometimes “stuck or malfunctioned” due to “vessel vibration”. Given the proximity of this email to the collision it is likely that this was the reason why the AIS was not functioning on the day of the collision. There was no investigation at trial as to whether this malfunction ought to have been prevented by the deck superintendent (before the voyage) or by those on board (during the voyage). Second, whilst the absence of AIS meant that those on board ALEXANDRA 1 were deprived of that system’s ability to identify vessels in the vicinity those on board were keeping a good visual lookout on EVER SMART and were aware of what she doing. The absence of AIS did not therefore impinge on their visual lookout. (AIS would also have identified ZAKHEER BRAVO by name but in circumstances where the attention of those on board ALEXANDRA 1 was not directed to ZAKHEER BRAVO by the VHF conversation between that vessel and Port Control it is unlikely that the absence of AIS impinged on her lookout, either visual or aural.) Third, whilst an alert or alarm would have been triggered on EVER SMART’s radar had ALEXANDRA 1’s AIS system been working and had pre-set CPA and TCPA limits been set on EVER SMART (see IMO resolution A.917(22) paragraph 28) it is not likely that those on board EVER SMART would have noted the alert or alarm since they were not keeping a good radar lookout and in particular had not captured ALEXANDRA 1 as an ARPA target. For these reasons I am unable to accept the submission that there was negligence with regard to the AIS or that, if there was such negligence, it was causative of the collision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">116.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In terms of causative potency, whilst EVER SMART's failure to navigate on the starboard side of the channel created a risk of collision with ALEXANDRA 1, ALEXANDRA 1's failure to alter course to starboard at C-5 or C-4 increased that risk of collision by causing ALEXANDRA 1 to head across the approaches to the channel. I do not think that one can characterise the fault of ALEXANDRA 1 as a failure “to react properly to a situation of difficulty or danger created” by EVER SMART (the wording being taken from my summary of Sir Henry Brandon’s principles or broad lines of approach in <span style="font-style:italic">The Nordlake and Seaeagle</span> at paragraph 149(iv)). Rather, ALEXANDRA 1’s  fault stemmed from her poor lookout at C-12 and was not in substance a failure to react properly to a situation of difficulty or danger created by EVER SMART. Whilst the situation of difficulty or danger created by EVER SMART was that she was on the portside rather than the starboard side of the channel, from ALEXANDRA 1’s (mistaken) point of view the difficulty or danger was that EVER SMART was not turning further to port early enough. I therefore do not consider that this is one of those cases where one say that there is a marked difference in quality between the contribution which each vessel made to the fact that the collision occurred. But the unsafe speed of EVER SMART contributed far more to the damage resulting from the collision than the very much lower (and safe) speed of ALEXANDRA 1. This is apparent when one looks at the damage done to the bows of ALEXANDRA 1 and at the much lesser damage to the port bow of EVER SMART.  It must follow that the causative potency of EVER SMART’s fault was greater than that of ALEXANDRA 1.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.20in">Thus in terms of culpability and causative potency there was, to use Sir Henry Brandon’s phrase, a “clear preponderance of fault” on the part of EVER SMART. I have asked myself, as Admiralty judges have frequently done, how many times greater the fault of EVER SMART was than that of ALEXANDRA 1. This can only be assessed “somewhat broadly and upon common sense principles” (see <span style="font-style:italic">The Volute</span> [1922] 1 AC 129 at p.144 per Lord Birkenhead).  To conclude that the degree of EVER SMART’s fault was no more than three times as great as that of ALEXANDRA 1 would, I think, underplay the extent to which in terms of culpability and causative potency the fault of EVER SMART exceeded that of ALEXANDRA 1. In my judgment the degree of EVER SMART’s fault was at least four times as great as that of ALEXANDRA 1. I have asked myself whether it was more than four times as great but I have concluded that it was not. As I have said the culpability of ALEXANDRA 1's fault was substantial. Her master could have corrected his misunderstanding of the VHF conversation at any time after C-12. Instead, he allowed his misunderstanding to affect his navigation and in consequence it caused him to fail to turn to starboard at C-5 or C-4 when he would otherwise have done so. That failure contributed to the fact that the collision occurred. The assessment of relative liability which is required by section 187 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 requires that account be taken of that fault.  </p>
