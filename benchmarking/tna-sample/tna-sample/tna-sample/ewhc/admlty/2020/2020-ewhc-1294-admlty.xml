	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is the trial of a limitation action in which three related companies seek a decree limiting their alleged liability for damage caused by the anchor of the barge STEMA BARGE II to an underwater cable carrying electricity from France to England. It is accepted by the owners of the cable that Splitt Chartering APS, the registered owner of STEMA BARGE II, is entitled to limit its alleged liability. It is also accepted that Stema Shipping A/S, as charterer or operator of STEMA BARGE II, is entitled to limit its alleged liability. The only issue is whether Stema Shipping (UK) limited, a company said to be the operator of STEMA BARGE II whilst it was at anchor off Dover, is within the class of persons entitled to limit their alleged liability pursuant to the Limitation Convention 1976, which has the force of law pursuant to The Merchant Shipping Act 1995, section 185.   </p>

The necessary repairs required the provision of rocks (rock armour) to support the line. Network Rail contracted with a consortium of contractors called the South-East Multi-Functional Framework (“SEMFF)” to undertake the necessary work. SEMFF included Costain Limited who acted as project manager and lead contractor.   </p>

It is said that she too dragged her anchor and at 0847 collided with STEMA BARGE II. At 0920 another undersea cable (cable 34) owned by RTE registered a tripping. It is the case of RTE that the cable had been damaged by the anchor of either STEMA BARGE II or SAGA SKY.  </p>

STEMA BARGE II is not mentioned. However, Mr. Boisen’s evidence was not challenged and I accept that the vessel intended to be used for the transport of the rock armour to Dover must have been STEMA BARGE II. Thus the document appears to evidence an agreement between Splitt and Stema A/S for STEMA BARGE II to transport the rock armour to Dover. In that sense it appears to have been “akin to a voyage charterparty”. The price payable by Stema A/S of Euros 19.85 must have been, I infer, the freight per mt.

(The barge was unmanned and so did not have a master. It is likely that this was a reference to the barge master at the loading port who, it appears, signed a bill of lading in respect of the cargo of rock dated 2 November 2016.) The message referred to the voyage to Dover, laycan dates, agents and the loading and discharging ports and said that the vessel “is fixed with ….Splitt”. Thus it is consistent with Stema A/S having fixed the vessel with Splitt in a manner akin to that of being a voyage charterer.

It was suggested by counsel for RTE, based upon a passage in the method statement which contemplated that the trim of CHARLIE ROCK was to be determined by the barge master, that the term “barge master” referred to CHARLIE ROCK rather than to STEMA BARGE II, though this distinction was not expressed by either Mr. Johansen or Mr. Boisen in their evidence. But whether the term referred to STEMA BARGE II or to CHARLIE ROCK or, which I consider likely to be the case, to both barges does not matter. “Personnel” provided by Stema UK (to use Mr. Grunfeld’s term) dropped STEMA BARGE II’s anchor. They then followed a check list of items such as checking that the navigation lights were on, and ensuring that the emergency towing wire was out and ready for use. Whilst the barge was at anchor they were responsible for ballasting the barge, maintaining her generators and monitoring her position. For this purpose a detailed check list was used. It would appear that the same personnel were also responsible for the operation of CHARLIE ROCK and in particular for the maintenance of her trim.  </p>

A manager may deal with the full combination of commercial, physical (“technical”) and crewing management, or just part of the overall management role. Similarly, “operator” includes anyone who operates a ship, or part of a ship, or an aspect of a ship. It includes anyone who operates the commercial or physical working of a ship. </p>

But if that were wrong he said that Stema UK was an operator of the barge because it was Stema UK who placed those persons on board to drop the anchor and to carry out other necessary work. He accepted that management and operation may overlap or cover the same ground. On the facts of this case he said that the number of activities for which Stema UK was responsible off Dover could be said to be such as to amount to management and control such that Stema UK could properly be described as the manager of the barge off Dover.</p>

It could not do that because, looked at in the round, it was in reality a purchaser of rocks who had to do certain things on board the barge in order to take delivery of the rocks.

Before 1976, any person, arguing in the United Kingdom that the limit should not apply, only needed to show "actual fault or privity" on the part of the party relying on the limit. Under the 1976 Convention the (now higher) limit is to apply unless it can be shown that the loss resulted from the personal act or omission of the party relying on the limit "committed with intent to cause such loss or recklessly with the knowledge that such loss would probably result". It is thus particularly difficult to break the limit, but the amount available for compensation is higher than it was previously; </span>

In my judgment the ordinary meaning of “manager” in the Limitation Convention must reflect the role of manager which I have described above. I therefore consider that “the manager of the ship” is the person entrusted by the owner with sufficient of the tasks involved in ensuring that a vessel is safely operated, properly manned, properly maintained and profitably employed to justify describing that person as the manager of the ship. I put it that way because if a person is entrusted with just one limited task it may be inappropriate to describe that person as the manager of the ship. A person who is entrusted with one limited task of management may be described as assisting in the management of the ship, rather than as being the manager of the ship; cf <span style="font-style:italic">ASP Ship Management PTY Limited v The Administrative Appeals Tribunal</span> [2006] FCAFC 23 at paragraph 90 and <span style="font-style:italic">the Nancy</span> [2014] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 14 which involved a company, Blue Fleet, assisting the manager, Swedish Management, see paragraphs 88-92 and 106.     </p>

For those reasons, those having the management and control of the ship have responsibilities concerning the deployment of the ship, the technical safety and adequacy of the ship as a complex integrated working entity, and the choice, supervision, care and discipline of the master and crew on board the ship. All these activities, indeed operational responsibilities, have a relationship with one another. The commercial enterprise undertaken (the types of cargoes lifted, the ports visited and routes taken on voyages) is not unrelated to the maintenance of an appropriate standard of technical adequacy of the ship for the tasks involved in carrying out that enterprise. The skill and competence of the chief engineer and those under him or her will be vital in the assessment of the day to day adequacy of performance of the ship from a commercial and technical point of view. The skill, competence, discipline and working conditions of the crew will also, in a real and practical way, be related to the efficient and safe working of the ship, productively from a commercial point of view of human and environmental safety.

(2013) by Brodie which defines “to operate a ship” as to “run a ship” and to include the technical operation (crewing, supplies, maintenance and stowage) and the commercial operation (booking cargoes, negotiating freight rates and bunker prices, and appointing ship’s agents at ports of call). A person who runs those technical and commercial operations would ordinarily be described as the vessel’s manager. Another Dictionary of Shipping Terms by Branch and Branch defines “managing owner” as “the person or company appointed by the shipowner to be responsible for ship operation, manning levels, maintenance of vessels and so on.” </p>

There is, I accept, a sense in which managing and operating can be distinguished in this way. Indeed, when reflecting on the issues in this case I asked myself whether it could be said that management is concerned with standards, procedures and monitoring systems to ensure the safe operation of a ship whereas operation is the actual working of the ship on a day to day basis.  </p>

The question which arises in these circumstances is whether the ordinary meaning of “the operator of a ship” in article 1(2) can include those who physically operate the machinery of the ship and those who cause the machinery of the ship to be physically operated, or whether the ordinary meaning of “the operator of a ship” is limited to the manager of the ship.

The purpose of owners, charterers, managers and operators being able to limit their liability is to encourage the provision of international trade by way of sea-carriage. The meaning which I consider to be the ordinary meaning of that phrase, that is one which includes those who, with the permission of the owner, send their employees on board with instructions to operate the vessel’s machinery in the ordinary course of the ship’s business, is consistent with and promotes that purpose. When the owner of a dumb barge arranges for the barge to carry a cargo by sea from one place to another the barge, on arrival at the destination, is unmanned. If it has to be anchored and secured so as to remain safely at anchor whilst waiting for the cargo to be discharged the owner has to arrange for the necessary work to be done, that is, for the barge’s equipment and machinery to be operated. If he arranges for an associated company to do that work and it is done negligently so that loss or damage is caused to others, it would not encourage the provision of international trade by sea carriage if the owner could limit its liability for the loss and damage but the associated company which operated the barge at the discharge location could not do so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">article 2 refers to “the operation of the ship”. Since “the operator of a ship” in article 1 must be understood in the context of the Convention as a whole, it would be right in principle to take into account the use of the phrase “the operation of the ship” in article 2. Since the latter must refer to the physical operation of the ship it might be said to be consistent with it to construe the former as encompassing those who send their employees on board the ship to operate the ship’s machinery in the ordinary course of its business, though they may not be the manager of it. However, since article 2 refers to the physical operation of the ship, reference to that article would tend to narrow the meaning of “the operator of the ship” to those who physically operate it and so exclude those acting as manager. In my judgment the ordinary meaning of “the operator of the ship” clearly can include the manager and so reference to article 2 serves only to confuse. Accordingly, having taken article 2 into account I do not consider that it can assist in elucidating the meaning of those entitled to limit pursuant to article 1. It only defines the claims subject to the right to limit. I therefore do not rely upon it.  </p>

The context of the question before the Federal Court was different from the context of the question before this court. The Limitation Convention has a different purpose from that of the Australian statute which was construed by the Federal Court. Also, the Australian statute used different language and did not include both a reference to the manager and to the operator. The Federal Court held (see paragraphs 105 and 106) that the phrase “operated by” in section 10 of the Navigation Act “involved direct responsibility for the management and control of the ship” and “encompasses the notion of a real, substantial and direct role in the management and control of the commercial, technical and crewing operations of the ship.” But because the context is different in the present case caution is required before applying the meaning given by the Australian Court to the meaning of operator in that different context. That is especially so given that it is clear from the judgment of the Federal Court that the requirement for “direct responsibility” for the management and control of the ship came from a study of “the legislative history and relevant secondary material” (see paragraphs 99 and 105). That legislative history was extensive (see paragraphs 14-46) and the secondary materials included parliamentary materials (see paragraphs 24-26).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">No argument was advanced on this “convention history” but it could be suggested that the juxtaposition of the manager and operator in the 1957 and 1976 Conventions, coupled with the likely use of operator in the 1924 Convention to mean manager, indicates that the terms are being used interchangeably. On the other hand it could be said that manager was first used in 1957 to reflect the fact that manager was the word used in the industry more often than operator but that it was nevertheless thought appropriate to add the word operator as well. David Steel J. noted at paragraph 21 of his judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">CMA Djakarta</span> that the range of those entitled to limit was enlarged by article 6(2) of the 1957 Limitation Convention. The same observation had been made in <span style="font-style:italic">Temperley’s Merchant Shipping Acts</span>, Vol.11 of the British Shipping Law (1976), at paragraph 1214 fn.2, where the editors, Michael Thomas and David Steel, noted that section 3 of the 1958 Merchant Shipping Act which sought to give effect to article 6(2) of the 1958 Limitation Convention “extends the class of persons entitled to exclude or limit their liability under Part VIII of the MSA 1894 in accordance with Article 6(2) of the Convention.” Article 6(2) certainly extended the range of those entitled to limit by including “the charterer of the ship”. The range may also have been extended by including “the manager and the operator of the ship”. Whether it did so can only be decided by understanding the ordinary meaning of operator when used in addition to manager. On balance therefore I do not consider that the convention history materially assists.  </p>

It was suggested that to interpret “the operator of the ship” as including “anyone who operates the ship or part of a ship” is to put on the words of the Convention an impermissible functional gloss which was contrary to the approach of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">CMA Djakarta.</span> I do not accept that submission. The Court of Appeal in that case had to interpret “the charterer of the ship” and held that it was wrong to interpret that as referring to the charterer when he was acting in the management or operation of the ship. To do so placed an impermissible gloss on the words of the Convention. But in the present case the court is required to construe “the operator of the ship”. The ordinary meaning of that phrase can include the person who operates the ship in the sense of placing on board an unmanned ship, with the consent of the owner, personnel to operate the ship. That is not to place an unjustified functional gloss on the words used. Rather, it is to give “the operator of the ship” its ordinary meaning. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for RTE further submitted that the use of the definite article “the” and the singular form of “operator” means that there can be only one “operator”.  Article 1(2) therefore has no room for more than one “operator” and, if that is correct, then it was submitted that Stema UK’s claim to limit must fail because Stema A/S was the operator of the barge. I do not consider that this is correct. Although the definite article is used it would not, in this context, be correct to conclude that there cannot be more than one operator. The definite article is also used in relation to owner and charterer; yet there can be more than one owner, because there can be co-owners, and there can be more than one charterer, because there can be a time charterer and a voyage charterer (or indeed a slot charterer). If there can be more than one owner or charterer it must also be the case that there can be more than one operator. Of course, the facts must show that it is appropriate to describe the person as “the operator of the ship” at the relevant time. To that question I must now turn.     </p>

The duties in fact required of a manger or operator of such a vessel are therefore likely to be different from, or at least not as extensive as, those required of a manager or operator of a conventional merchant vessel. Indeed, I was informed by counsel for Stema UK that there was no requirement for STEMA BARGE II to have a Safety Management System pursuant to the ISM Code.  There are however “company procedures” produced by the Mibau Stema Group, such as the Barge Operator Manual, which set out the required procedures for safe operation of the barge, and the Barge Towing Manual for the benefit of the tug master which set out “the process and guidelines” from Stema A/S and Splitt. It provided particulars of the STEMA BARGE II, towage requirements (including IMO guidelines), weather routing and reporting. I was told that there was no document which identified any person or entity as the manager of the barge.    </p>

But STEMA BARGE II was not a conventional merchant vessel. It was an unmanned barge, the operation of which was governed by a document described as the Barge Operator Manual. In that manual Mr. Grunfeld is described as the “barge operator” and in his witness statement he states that he has “daily responsibility for the operation of barges owned by Splitt”.  In circumstances where he, an employee of Stema A/S, has such a duty it seems arguable that Stema A/S, albeit a charterer of the barge, was in fact the operator of the barge during the voyage from the loadport. This is not, however, crystal clear. The Barge Operator Manual refers in paragraph 5.3 to the “Splitt Chartering Operator” being responsible during the voyage for following reports from the tug master and taking necessary actions when needed. (The “Splitt Chartering Operator” is to be distinguished from the “Stema Shipping Operator” in paragraph 5.1). That suggests that Mr. Grunfeld acted during the voyage on behalf of Splitt. Of course, because Splitt had no employees the Splitt Chartering Operator and the Stema Shipping Operator were one and the same, namely, Mr. Grunfeld. It appears that the tug reported its position to Mr. Grunfeld throughout the voyage. The number for the tug master to ring in an emergency was that of Mr. Grunfeld.    </p>

They dropped the barge’s anchor. It appears that they did so in the location advised by the tug. (It later transpired, on 5 December 2016, that the anchor had been dropped outside the anchorage area.) Thereafter, and before leaving STEMA BARGE II, the barge master and crewman checked items such as navigation lights and the emergency towing wire. For this purpose they used a Check List provided by Splitt. Whilst the barge was at anchor and whilst cargo was being transhipped from STEMA BARGE II to CHARLIE ROCK they attended to various matters on STEMA BARGE II such as the ballasting of the barge (which was necessary as cargo was discharged </p>

Again, further check lists provided by Splitt were used for this purpose. The position of the barge was also monitored. There was a roster of barge masters and crewmen put in place by the superintendent Mr. Upcraft upon the instructions of Mr. Olsen of Stema A/S. The weather forecasts were considered by Mr. Johansen and the superintendent twice a day. They were also considered by personnel of Stema A/S in Denmark. There were discussions between Mr. Boisen and Mr. Grunfeld of Stema A/S and Mr. Johansen and Mr. Upcraft of Stema UK. The decision to leave STEMA BARGE II at anchor on 20 November 2016 was taken by them.  Both Mr. Boisen and Mr. Johansen said that the decision was taken on behalf of Splitt. (Whether that reflected the Barge Operating Manual paragraph 5.3 which refers to the Splitt Chartering Operator taking the “necessary actions” or the division of responsibility between Splitt and Stema A/S under the charter dated 28 June 2016 was not explained.)     </p>

In the event a preliminary damage inspection was carried out by TMC Marine on or about 28 November 2016 and the barge was towed to Newcastle for repairs on 10 December 2016.

On the other hand the Manual did not list the anchoring and care of the barge at anchorage as one of the necessary tasks.

He said that Stema UK’s main roles were to market the Mibau Group’s products imported into the UK and then to make local arrangements for delivery of the products. He also said that Stema UK was responsible for decisions regarding CHARLIE ROCK and the tug AFON GOCH. He said that Splitt was responsible for STEMA BARGE II.  </p>

Employees of Stema UK in fact operated the machinery of STEMA BARGE II. The question is whether such operation amounts to Stema UK in fact being the operator of STEMA BARGE II off Dover. Mr. Johansen did not himself describe Stema UK as the operator of STEMA BARGE II but Mr. Grunfeld described </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Stema UK as “providing the personnel to physically operate the barge on behalf of Splitt”. I consider that he was right to say that. There was no-one present from Stema A/S to operate the barge off Dover. Although Stema A/S was the operator of the barge in the sense of being its manager I would not describe Stema UK as merely assisting Stema A/S to operate STEMA BARGE II off Dover in circumstances where Stema A/S had no personnel present able to operate STEMA BARGE II of Dover. The necessary operation of STEMA BARGE II was in fact performed by Stema UK alone, sending its personnel on board to do what was necessary. The importance of Stema UK’s operation of the barge off Dover was demonstrated when storm force winds were forecast. Although the Barge Operator Manual did not give any function to Mr. Johansen or Stema UK by name, paragraph 6.2 envisaged that when winds in excess of force 9 were forecast the appropriate action to be taken was to be decided by “the steering committee”. There was no direct evidence as to the members of that committee but what is known is that on 20 November 2016 the appropriate action was discussed and agreed by Mr. Boisen and Mr. Grunfeld of Stema A/S and by Mr. Johansen and Mr. Upcraft of Stema UK. It seems more probable than not that they were the steering committee for the period whilst the barge was at anchor off Dover. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">(In this regard it is also to be noted that the “charter” between Splitt and Stema A/S dated 28 June 2016 provided that Splitt would monitor the barge at anchorage “in cooperation with the receiver”.) Whilst the decision to allow STEMA BARGE II to remain at anchor during the storm was ultimately that of Splitt, acting through Stema A/S, in practical terms the decision was taken by, and important advice given by, the steering committee of which Mr. Johansen and Mr. Upcraft, it seems, were members. That is consistent with Stema UK being the operator of the barge off Dover.  </p>
