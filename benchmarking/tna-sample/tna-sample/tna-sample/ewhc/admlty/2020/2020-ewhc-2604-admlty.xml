At about 1750 the vessel at the head of the convoy, AENEAS, a container vessel, had an engine problem and, by about 1820, was anchored. Thereafter, the other vessels astern of her either took steps to moor or prepared to moor. Not all were successful. At about 1948 the eighth (and last) vessel, PANAMAX ALEXANDER, a laden bulk carrier, collided with the seventh vessel in the convoy, SAKIZAYA KALON, another laden bulk carrier, which was at anchor. (There is a dispute as to whether she was also moored to the bank of the canal.)  After </p>

The three vessels ended up in such positions that they formed, remarkably, a triangle across the Canal, with SAKIZAYA KALON heading towards the east bank, PANAMAX ALEXANDER heading towards the west bank and OSIOS DAVID heading down the Canal. The bows of PANAMAX ALEXANDER and OSIOS DAVID were in contact with each other, the stern of SAKIZAYA KALON was in contact with the stern of OSIOS DAVID and the bows of SAKIZAYA KALON were in contact with the stern of PANAMAX ALEXANDER. There was evidence of further contact between the vessels at 2013-2014 (though there is a dispute as to whether PANAMAX ALEXANDER struck OSIOS DAVID for a second time). By about 2015 the three vessels had separated. But, again remarkably, PANAMAX ALEXANDER and SAKIZAYA KALON ended up alongside each other on reciprocal headings. There was further contact between them at about 2018.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The collisions between these three vessels have generated claims totalling some US$18 million. Three actions claiming damages were commenced in the Admiralty Court. The Owners of OSIOS DAVID sued the Owners of PANAMAX ALEXANDER in one action and sued the Owners of SAKIZAYA KALON in a second action. In the third action the Owners of SAKIZAYA KALON sued the owners of PANAMAX ALEXANDER. PANAMAX ALEXANDER has counterclaims against the other vessels. The three actions were heard together. None of the vessels accept any liability for the collisions.  OSIOS DAVID and SAKIZAYA KALON say that the collisions were caused by the fault of PANAMAX ALEXANDER. PANAMAX ALEXANDER says that the collisions were caused by both OSIOS DAVID and SAKIZAYYA KALON. </p>

But the admitted duty of vessels in the convoy to inform those astern of their intention to moor, the presence of submarine cables which impeded the use of anchors to assist with mooring and the challenge of mooring in a following current enabled PANAMAX ALEXANDER to submit that that superficial view was wrong.      </p>

That schedule was of considerable assistance to the court. A </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.00in">“reconstruction animation video” of the VDR data produced by Collins Marine Consultants using MADAS software (Marine Accident Data Analysis Suite) shows the progress of the three vessels through the Canal. MADAS was developed under a project jointly funded by the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch and the US National Transportation Safety Board to create a methodology for the analysis and visualisation of time dependent VDR data for use in accident investigations. MADAS can incorporate data from other sources including AIS (Automatic Identification System) and ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information System). It is subject to error (for example small timing and positional errors and errors resulting from inherent GPS error) as explained in a report prepared by Collins Marine Consultants for the court. But the video was nevertheless of considerable assistance in understanding the progress of each vessel through the Canal leading up to the collisions. For example, it shows where each vessel was in relation to the submarine cables lying across the canal (which impeded the freedom of a vessel to anchor) and at the same time displays the underlying navigational data of each vessel (course, speed and so forth) on screen. I had not previously been persuaded that a “reconstruction animation video”, as opposed to a static plot of the vessels’ navigation, served any real purpose; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandra 1 and Ever Smart</span> at paragraph 5. However, in this case where it was necessary to know where each of the vessels was in relation to the submarine cables at different times, the video, which the viewer could pause and restart at will, was of considerable assistance. None of the parties suggested that the margin of error to which MADAS is subject was such as to make it inappropriate to rely upon it for the purposes of the resolving the issues in this case, save that counsel for PA suggested, perhaps with justification, that it could not be relied upon to show the nature and extent of the contact between the vessels.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The VDRs also recorded what was said and heard on the bridge of each vessel. These audio records are now commonplace in collision actions but an agreed transcript and translation often requires very considerable work by the parties. That was certainly so in the present case where the languages involved included Arabic, Mandarin, Tagalog and English and the audio records for over two hours from 1750 (when AENEAS had her engine problem) until 2035 (about 20 minutes after the last of the collisions) had to be listened to with great care. The importance of the audio record was illustrated in the present case by the considerable reliance placed on it by counsel, not only to show what information was given (or not given) by one vessel to another but also to show when certain actions not otherwise recorded were taken, for example, attempts to moor or the dropping of an anchor. The audio record can also enable inferences to be drawn as to the quality of a vessel’s look out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The shape of a collision action in the Admiralty Court is now very different from what it was before the advent of VDRs. In the past a trial was required to establish the navigation of each vessel. There was often little common ground save that there had been a collision. The reliability of the evidence of the master or officer of the watch had to be assessed. Findings were based on such evidence as proved to be reliable in the light of each vessel’s contemporaneous documents, in particular, the working chart, the deck and engine logs and the bridge and engine room bell books. Sometimes the veracity of those contemporaneous documents was challenged. The presence of an engine logger or a course recorder was often of considerable help though the latter required interpretation by experts. The probabilities had to be assessed in the light of all the evidence. Each side prepared (usually very different) plots of how the vessels reached the collision position. This has all been changed by the advent of VDRs. As this case illustrates the parties arrive at trial with the navigation of the vessels agreed in very considerable detail. Whereas in the past the value of a plot was generally regarded as showing what could not have happened rather than what did happen (see <span style="font-style:italic">The Bow Spring v Manzanillo</span> [2004] EWCA  Civ 1007 at paragraph 32 per Clarke LJ), a plot (or in this case a reconstruction animation video) can now portray the navigation of each vessel on the basis of reliable and detailed evidence, namely, the contemporaneous digital record contained in the VDRs. Whilst there still is a margin of error the detail of the recorded evidence on which such a plot is based is such that there is now, typically, no need for a trial to establish the navigation of each vessel leading up to the collision. What remains to be decided at trial are questions of fault (whether a vessel failed to comply with one or more of the Collision Regulations or the requirements of good seamanship) and questions of apportionment of liability (which requires assessment of the causative potency of a vessel’s fault and the degree of blameworthiness of such fault; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Nordlake and Seaeagle</span> [2016] 1 Lloyd’s Report 656 at paragraphs 148151). Thus the trial of a typical collision action (if it has not been settled once the navigation of each vessel has been agreed) ought now to be shorter than what it was. Perhaps it is, but the wealth of material contained in the VDR audio record provides much scope for detailed submissions (and cross-examination) as to why a vessel was navigated as she was, which submissions can be relevant to, but not determinative of, questions of fault and can also be relevant to the degree of blameworthiness. In the present case counsel’s closing written submissions totalled some 176 pages.     </p>

The master of PA accepted when cross-examined that this was so. AIS can be used to enhance safe navigation but does not replace an alert and systematic visual and radar lookout as the primary instrument for safe navigation; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexander I and Ever Smart</span> [2017] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 666 at paragraph 105 and <span style="font-style:italic">The Hakki Deval</span> [2006] EWHC 2809 at paragraph 24 per David Steel J. In the present case the AIS data of vessels in the convoy, in particular, their speed following the engine failure on AENEAS, informed other vessels in the convoy whether they were slowing or were stopped. In that way AIS was capable, in this case, of providing real assistance to safe navigation.  There was no suggestion that the AIS data was not reliable. The AIS data was displayed in another animation video from which stills at 15 minute intervals were prepared.    </p>

None of the masters understood Arabic and it is, I think, fair to say that none of the masters particularly interrogated the pilot as to what he learnt from the other pilots, though some questions were asked immediately after AENEAS’ breakdown and in the immediate run up to the collisions. Of course, each master remained responsible for the navigation of his vessel and was able to observe the progress of the other vessels by radar, ECDIS and the AIS facility and so to navigate his vessel in accordance with the Collision Regulations.  </p>

He had been provided with both electronic and hard copies of the trial documents. Although counsel for PA suggested that his evidence was confused and unhelpful, I formed the view that he gave his evidence with honesty, clarity and some firmness. It may be that his recollection on occasion differed from the contemporaneous record but that was inevitable and certainly did not suggest that he was not seeking to tell the truth as he recollected it. It was suggested by counsel for PA that his evidence that there had been an order to stop issued by the Suez Canal Authorities (when there had not been such an order) suggested that his evidence needed to be treated with considerable caution. The master referred to the order in his supplementary statement dated February 2020 and in his oral evidence. He did not do so in his main statement taken in August 2018. It seems to me likely that he had persuaded himself that there had been such an order and was not seeking to advance an account of events which he knew to be untrue. If so then he was not the only one to persuade himself that there had been such an order for the owners of PA, no doubt on the basis of someone’s evidence, expressly pleaded that there had been such an order. Significantly (in my judgment) the master accepted several matters put to him as to the conduct expected of a prudent master and as to assumptions made by him when navigating the Canal. That suggested to me that he was being candid with the court.    </p>

Arrangements had been made for him to have electronic copies of the trial documents but it was not possible to get hard copies to him. For most of his evidence he needed the services of an interpreter. It was, however, apparent that he had no real recollection of the detail of the events of 15 July 2018. That is perhaps unsurprising. However, when presented with conflicts between his written statements and what in fact happened he was, it seemed to me, prepared to say whatever he could to explain the discrepancy, regardless of whether it was the truth. Indeed the transcript of a conversation between the master and the pilot of SK after the collisions on 15 July 2018 strongly suggested that the master was prepared to put in his report to owners what the pilot told him to say. That suggested that even on the day of the collision he had little knowledge himself of the events leading up to the collisions.   </p>

He had a clear view that on 15 July 2018 he had monitored the vessels ahead of PA by radar and ECDIS and had kept a safe distance astern of SK but that the two vessels ahead, OD and SK created a dangerous situation by anchoring and blocking the Canal without advising PA of their intentions. When cross-examined he appeared keen not to depart from his written statement (which he maintained he had prepared himself without the assistance of lawyers) and was reluctant to accept what was clear from the VDR audio record. He had difficulty in answering questions about what good seamanship required when navigating the Suez Canal in a convoy, particularly when the answers to such questions threatened to paint his navigation on 15 July 2018 in a less than good light. I gained the impression that he was doing his best to defend his navigation of his vessel rather than to answer the questions put to him with candour and honesty.    </p>

No particular issue arose with regard to the lights exhibited by the vessels. There was a wind from the northerly quadrant about force 4 and there was a strong south going current of 2-3 knots. The current was not unusual. The Suez Canal Rules at article 84 state that the average peak current was about 2.2 knots and that in Spring tides the current may reach 4 knots. Low water was at about 1900 on 15 July 2018 and so the current was ebbing strongly at the time of the collisions. An analysis of the current derived from deducting the LOG speed from the speed over the ground of the vessels suggested a current of about 2.7 knots. Counsel for PA referred to a current of 3.5 knots although in PA’s Preliminary Act the current was initially said to be 2 knots and, by amendment, 3 knots. Whilst there were occasions when the analysis suggested a current speed of 3.5 knots there may well have been particular reasons for that as suggested in Appendix 2 to the closing submissions of counsel for OD. I find that the current was probably 2-3 knots, and probably nearer to 3 knots than to 2 knots. The existence of this following current meant that mooring a southbound vessel on either side of the canal was challenging, but not unusually so.  </p>

He further said that he recalled that at about 1928 he saw PA, visually and by radar, astern of SK and distant about 0.8 nautical miles proceeding at about 2.8 knots. His evidence was that he thought she was preparing to moor. This evidence was challenged on the basis that it was difficult to see why these relatively precise times of observation could be recollected. The position of the SK and the speed of PA as described by the master were not challenged. They were, I infer, based upon screenshots from the VDR and ECDIS available to the master when he made his statement. What is disputed is whether the master noted them at the times stated. When cross-examined about this he said that after dropping his anchor he “checked the surroundings”. This appears to me to be probable and explains why he made observations astern at 1927-8 when the mooring operation was about to be completed. I therefore accept his evidence that he noted the position of the vessels astern at or about the time he completed mooring his own vessel.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The master of SK gave evidence that at 1800 the pilot informed him that SK “would be mooring alongside the eastern bank between KM markers 151 and 152 until the grounded vessel was clear.” There is no trace of such an instruction in the VDR transcript. Indeed, in the master’s manuscript statement of 15 July 2018 he said that the pilot informed him that the SK would moor between KM 152 and 153. The VDR transcript for late on 15 July 2018 (after the collisions) strongly suggests that this is what the master was told to say by the pilot. When making his statement which stood as his evidence in chief in this action he changed the intended anchorage position to between KM 151 and 152. This correction appears to have been based upon the location at which SK in the event was anchored and, on SK’s case, moored. In the result I am unable to accept the master’s evidence either as originally stated on 15 August 2018 or as revised in his later statement. Had there been such an instruction from the pilot it is likely that it would have been recorded by the VDR. The master’s suggestion in crossexamination that information could also be imparted by the pilot in writing was a forlorn attempt to explain the absence of any reference to the suggested information in the VDR record.   </p>

I also have difficulty in accepting that engine breakdowns occur so frequently in the Suez Canal that there is a “normal practice” concerning the distance between vessels when they are forced to moor in such circumstances. That SK ended up so close to OD appears to have been the result of failing to moor because the attempt was made at a time when it was not possible to use an anchor to assist in the process. </p>

This suggestion was said to be based upon PA’s VDR audio record (from pages 116-134). I have read and re-read those pages but it is difficult to extract that from the record. Arrangements had been made to moor (the mooring boat had been lowered, crew were at forward and aft stations and it is possible that the astern movement at 1855 was part of that preparation) but there is no clear support for the proposition that attempts were made to moor.

So it seems that there may have been an attempt to moor between 1923 and 1930. If so, PA was attempting to moor without the use of anchors. It was unlikely to succeed. The master accepted in his statement that PA had touched bottom. He attributed the grounding to the transverse thrust of the propeller forcing the stern of the vessel towards the east bank. Even with the fall in speed caused by the movement of the engines astern and the touching of the bottom the distance between PA and SK had now fallen to about 0.5 nautical miles.

The evidence was said to be based upon an observation on ECDIS that MARY LISA V and FLORENTIA were underway to pass AENEAS and to exit the Canal. But at 1930 MARY LISA V’s speed over the ground was 0.2 knots and FLORENTIA’s speed over the ground was 1 knot. Obviously neither was underway. Whilst FLORENTIA did get underway and pass AENEAS between 1930 and 1945 MARY LISA V did not. She and the other vessels remained astern of AENEAS and, it appears, moored. There seemed to me justification for the suggestion by counsel for OD that this evidence had been made up in an attempt to justify the navigation of PA. Certainly it was not true and it is not possible to understand how the master could have reached such a conclusion. It is possibly inconsistent with the PA’s log which records difficulty in mooring at 1930.    </p>

He thought that SK had concluded that the situation ahead had <span style="font-style:italic">“normalised”</span> and that now SK did not plan to stop. He also said that although he observed OD <span style="font-style:italic">“not getting underway”</span> he assumed that she was <span style="font-style:italic">“about to get underway”</span>. He assumed that SK had slowed down in order to give OD more time to get going. This is deeply improbable. At 1900 SK had told PA that she was mooring and PA had wished SK good luck. At 1907 PA had heard OD inform Port Control that she had dropped anchor and was mooring. There was no reason for the master on PA to assume that at 1920 or 1925 (the two times mentioned by the master) SK and OD were now to get underway. I do not accept his evidence. It appears to be an untruthful attempt to explain why PA did not moor but continued down the Canal.  </p>

The natural inference to draw from this record is that the officer of the watch observed that a line from the starboard side aft of SK was secured ashore.

(The heading of SK began to turn to port at 1950 or 1951.) It is difficult to be sure what the precise cause of this was (save that it must have been connected with the collision). Several possible causes have been suggested. It may have been the result of SK heaving on her anchors (if this continued after collision, which is not clear). PA pleaded that it was in part caused by the anchor cable being “entangled” with PA. That suggestion was not developed. It may have been the result of contact between the portside aft of PA and the starboard side forward of SK as PA moved past </p>

There was a slight change of PA’s heading to starboard from 182<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">0</span> at 1952 to 185<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">0 </span>at 1954.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence from SK is that the swing to starboard caused the stern line to part. That the line did part is supported by the video footage. The PA’s fair deck log records this happening before the collision at C-4. As already noted it is difficult to see why this would have happened before the collision. At that time SK had begun to move ahead at a rate of 0.1 knots, that is a cable per hour (or about 10 feet per minute). Whilst it is possible that that very slight ahead movement of SK could have caused the parting it is more likely that the collision resulted in the rope parting. Further, there is video footage apparently showing a starboard line parting during the collision. (Whether the time of 1944 or C-4 was recorded in the scrap log is not known because that was not in evidence. It is possible that the timing was an (inaccurate) estimate made when entering up the fair deck log.) </p>

This evidence was corroborated by an entry in OD’s log which read “<span style="font-style:italic">ship’s spring lines parted. 2011 – 2nd hit from Panamax Alexander on port on abeam cargo hold No. 1, 2015 – 2nd Hit from Sakizaya Kalon on dead astern</span>.” I am not sure whether the log purported to record the time of the second collision between PA and OD at 2011 or 2015 but it is clear that it records a second collision between PA and OD. A second collision was disputed by PA. Reliance was placed on the absence of a reference to a second collision in the VDR audio record and on a video taken by the crew of OD from about 2012-2014 which was said to show PA clear at all times. The absence of a reference in the VDR audio log is relevant to note but does not establish that the master’s recollection or the OD’s log was in error. I viewed the video. It is very dark and the latter half appears to show a gap between the vessels. I had difficulty in making out what was shown in the first half and counsel for OD, after viewing it in a darkened room, suggested that it “starts with a loud </p>

I was not sure that I could see sparks but I did hear a bang at the beginning. In the result I did not find the video helpful.  Reliance was also placed on the ECDIS shots from 2011-2104 but I do not accept that they show “no contact” as suggested. What I did find instructive to note from the schedule of headings was that PA’s heading moved to starboard between 2008 and 2013, from 210<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o </span>to 225<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span>.

At about 2013 PA’s change of heading to starboard was arrested. This is strongly supportive of the second collision spoken of by the master of OD. The collision was caused by PA’s heading altering to starboard and the effect of the collision stopped PA’s swing to starboard. I therefore accept the evidence of the master that there was a second collision. It is supported not only by the contemporaneous log but also by the VDR record of PA’s swing of heading to starboard being arrested at 2013.    </p>

The collisions occurred in a narrow channel but the obligations imposed by the narrow channel rule generally concern vessels proceeding in opposite directions through a narrow channel or vessels crossing a narrow channel. Where vessels are proceeding through the Suez Canal in a convoy and the lead vessel suffers an engine breakdown causing it to anchor in the Canal the relevant obligations will be those imposed by Rule 5, the duty to keep a good lookout, Rule 6, the duty to proceed at a safe speed and Rule 7, the duty to determine if a risk of collision exists. The action required, if a risk of collision exists, will be determined by Rule 8. That rule contemplates that the appropriate action may be helm or engine action but the appropriate action will be whatever is required by good seamanship in the particular circumstances. In the present case the action required of PA was said by counsel on behalf of OD and SK to be not only a reduction in speed but also stopping her progress through the Canal and mooring.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">It seemed to me unlikely that the question whether PA ought to have reduced her engines earlier than she in fact did (for example between 1755 and 1808, rather than between 1809 and 1822) would prove to be relevant to an assessment of liability for the later collisions. The suggested fault occurred almost 2 hours before the first collision between PA and SK at 1948. Moreover, if it was a fault, there was a timely opportunity for PA to correct it by putting her engines astern at 1830 and so increasing the distance between PA and SK (which had fallen from over 2.5 miles to about 1.3 miles). In those circumstances it seemed to me that the relevant time to consider any fault of PA with regard to speed concerned the time at which she ought to have put her engines astern, which counsel for OD and SK put at no later than was at 1830. This is not, as was suggested in argument, to resurrect the “last opportunity” rule.  That rule once prevented a fault by the defendant from being causative of damage if the plaintiff had a later opportunity to avoid the damage and failed to take it. It is rule which has not survived as a principle of causation; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Ouro Fino</span> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Reports 325 at p.329. Restricting an examining of the speed of PA to the question when, if at all, PA ought to have put her engines astern is not to resurrect the “last opportunity” rule. Rather, it is a recognition that not all faults which precede a collision, particularly those which occur a long time before the collision, are causative of the collision.  A fault may provide the opportunity for the collision without being one of the causes of it.  </p>

YES, she should have taken off all way at 1830.  The transcript shows the ship making 8 knots at 1824, 6.7 knots at 1830 (given) and 5 knots at 1846 and slowing. The crew were at stations forward and aft.  We do not know if the mooring boat was in the water, although at 1833 they made it ready. One would have to allow at least ten minutes to launch it. If they were stopped in the water at the speed of the current – 3 knots, it would have taken 26 minutes to reach SK, had she stopped. At the approximate average speed they made between 1828 and 1846, approximately 6 knots, 1.3 nm would have taken 13 minutes and they would have had to stop short of SK, giving them even less time. Essentially, they had ten minutes to take all way off the ship and anchor or moor, which we consider would not have been sufficient to stop a safe distance from SK.   </p>

In their advice the Assessors advised in the first part of their answer that PA ought to have increased the distance by reducing her speed to the minimum at which her heading could be controlled. In the second part of their answer the Assessors used different language and advised that at 1830 PA ought to have taken off all way. These two answers could be regarded as inconsistent with each other. But I do not read them in that way. The second answer was in response to the question whether at 1830 the engines of PA ought to have been put astern. Thus the Assessors were of the view that the engines of PA should have been put astern. However, reading both answers together my understanding of their advice is that the speed of PA ought to have been reduced, by putting the engines astern, to the minimum at which her heading could be controlled.   </p>

In unrestricted, deep waters, minimum steerage speed would be 4kts “through the water” and at 18:30 PA was doing just 6.7kts “over the ground” with a strong following current. Reference was made to a page of the vessel’s sea trial data which stated, “minimum steerage speed: normal loaded condition: 4.0 knots”.  </p>

This is especially so given that a pilot card was in evidence which stated that PA’s minimum manoeuvring speed was 3 knots, not 4 knots.  In a 2-3 knot current following current the pilot card minimum speed would suggest a minimum steerage way of 5-6 knots.

	    <p style="margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.00in">“very strong following current” was approximately 6 knots, by which I infer he meant 6 knots over the ground. It is possible that he had in mind that in shallow waters the minimum steerage way may have been higher than in deep water. However, PA’s speed was in fact allowed to fall to 4.8 knots by 1854 whilst her pilot was deciding on which bank of the Canal to moor and, according to her pilot, PA was proceeding “at the least speed very slowly”. Her engines were put astern at 1855, causing her speed to fall further to 3.3 knots at 1901. They were stopped at 1900. There does not appear to have been an attempt to moor at this stage, although her mooring boat was in the water. What appears to have happened is that PA was experiencing difficulties in steering, presumably as a result of her low speed. At 1901 the helmsman can be heard (at least by some who listened to the VDR audio record) saying “rudders not working”. At 1901 her engines were put to dead slow ahead, perhaps to retain steerage way, and causing her speed to increase to about 4 knots. Her engines were stopped at 1903. This does not suggest that her minimum steerage way in the following current was about 6 knots over the ground but was in fact somewhat less than 6 knots over the ground. Having regard to the possibility that the later increase in speed to over 5 knots by 1923 was also to retain steerage way (the hard port and hard starboard helm orders suggest steering difficulties) it is likely that the minimum steerage way was in fact considered at the time to be between 4 and 5 knots over the ground, and probably nearer 5 knots than 4 knots. That appears to be the most reliable evidence of PA’s minimum steerage way at the time. Since her speed was in fact 6.7 knots at 1830 her engines ought to have been worked astern at 1830 (as the Assessors advised) to reduce her speed and increase the distance between PA and SK.  </p>

Her engines had been stopped at 1822 when, according to the AIS video, her speed was about 8.5 knots. Given that the distance between PA and SK had been about 2 miles at 1815 and was reducing, that the speeds of the vessels ahead of her must have been seen (by ECDIS and AIS) to be falling, that the vessels at the head of the convoy must have been seen to be getting closer to AENEAS, making it probable that the vessels astern of AENEAS would have to moor, the engines of PA ought to have been worked astern at 1822 in order to increase the distance between PA and SK. This is so whether her minimum steerage way in the Canal was 4-5 knots or about 6 knots.  </p>

By stopping her engines her speed was of course falling but astern engine action at 1822 would have reduced her speed further and so increased the distance between PA and SK.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">In response to this advice counsel for PA submitted that the fact that it would have been prudent to do so does not mean that it was negligent not to moor before KM 149 and therefore good seamanship did not “require” that PA planned to moor before KM 149. It was said that PA had set out in its Closing Submissions the countervailing risks if any attempt to moor failed and the Elder Brethren have acknowledged at paragraph 5 (iii) that it would, indeed, have been a “difficult manoeuvre”. Whilst they go on to say it was achievable, this does not mean, in PA’s submission, that it was negligent not to attempt such a difficult manoeuvre, particularly in light of the risks if it went wrong. </p>

However, the advice of the Assessors must be read as a whole. The Assessors’ answer to the question, Did good seamanship require PA to plan to moor before KM 149?, was, “On balance yes”.  The Assessors then went on to explain why. So read it is plain, as I see it, that the Assessors’ advice was that good seamanship required PA to moor before KM 149 for the reasons given. </p>

Although the pilot had given instructions for the mooring boat to be lowered at 1833 it appears that time was spent deciding on which bank to moor. It was not until 1854 that the east bank was selected. The engines of PA were then put to dead slow astern but, as already noted above, it does not appear that any attempt to moor was made before KM 149. The master accepted when cross-examined that between 1830 and 1845 he had no plan to moor anywhere ahead and at 1847 the pilot stated that he was “<span style="font-style:italic">moving very slowly till we see how it will end up</span>”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">It is therefore unlikely that either the master or the pilot appreciated that there was a risk of collision. The master does not refer to any such assessment in his written statement and in his oral evidence he was keen to say that he did not need to stop or anchor until there was an “<span style="font-style:italic">imminent danger</span>”. That is a different concept from risk of collision. The second sentence of Rule 7 provides that if there is doubt a risk of collision shall be deemed to exist. As the editors of <span style="font-style:italic">Marsden and Gault on Collisions at Sea</span> 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.ed. have suggested at paragraph 5-242 this “<span style="font-style:italic">represents a sensible principle of precaution which seems to support the view that it [the risk of collision] need not be a probability, but only a possibility or strong possibility in this context</span>”. Since the Collision Regulations are designed to secure safe navigation my own view is that a risk of collision is a real risk of collision. That does not entail a probability of collision. A possibility of collision will suffice so long as it would be recognised as a real risk of collision by a prudent master. Certainly, risk of collision is not confined to cases of imminent danger. (It is to be noted that Rule 2 allows a departure from the Rules to avoid “immediate danger”. That tends to confirm that that risk of collision in Rule 7 is different from immediate danger in Rule 2.) If the master of PA was truly deciding whether to stop or anchor on the basis of whether there was an imminent danger, then he was not acting in accordance with the Collision Regulations. However, it is improbable that the master was making decisions upon the basis of whether there was an “imminent danger” (because he must have known that the test in the Collision Regulations was risk of collision) and that he made reference to such a concept in an </p>

Given the speed of the current and the minimum speed over the ground while retaining control (using astern movements to take the way off and the occasional ‘kick’ of ahead power to control direction), With a 3 knot current and making perhaps 1 – 2 knots through the water, they would have covered most of the 1.4 nm before being ready.

At 1930 they were at a speed at which they could take the way off the ship by putting the engines astern and drop an anchor without hazard to the anchor party and still stop short of SK.  It is, though, difficult to predict what would happen next.  If dropping the anchor was part of the mooring to the bank operation and the master or pilot were experienced shiphandlers, they could have manoeuvred into position. If they simply used the anchor as an emergency brake they would, sooner or later, veer around the cable(s) pushed by the wind and current. In those circumstances the ship would have come to rest with the stern on the bank of the canal. The other possibility was that the stern, pushed by the current, would swing clear of the bank, through 180 degrees, ending up facing into the current, heading north. This could have resulted in a close quarter situation or collision with SK.  </p>

If it caused PA to swing clear of the bank and to end up heading north with a risk of collision with SK, any resulting collision would have been a different collision from that which in fact occurred. If the starboard anchor was let go (as in fact happened at C-6) it seems to me more likely than not that PA would have come to rest with her stern on the east bank of the Canal, thus avoiding any collision.

However, I am not persuaded that this fault was in fact causative of the later collision. If PA had decided not to moor before KM 149 because she had insufficient time in which to do so, PA’s failure to put her engines astern at 1822 could well have been causative because the reduction of speed would have given her more time in which to moor before KM 149. However, lack of time does not appear to have been the reason why PA did not moor before KM 149. Rather, the evidence indicates that neither the master nor the pilot appreciated that there was a risk of collision and for that reason they failed to moor before KM 149. Thus the failure to put her engines astern at 1822 does not appear to have been causative of the collision. A fault may also be causative if it contributes to the extent and severity of the damage or loss suffered; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Alexandra 1 and Ever Smart</span> [2019] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 130 at paragraph 124 (iii) and (iv) per Gross LJ. However, the failure to put her engines astern at 1822 occurred well over an hour before the collision and thereafter the engines of PA were operated astern, in particular at full astern between 1924 and 1929 (C-14 and C-9) causing her speed to fall to well under 2 knots.  Thereafter, between 1938 and 1940 (C-10 and C-8) they were operated at dead slow ahead causing her speed to increase to over 2 knots before her anchor was dopped at 1942 (C-6) with the result that at collision her speed was under 2 knots. In my judgment the failure to put her engines astern at 1822 cannot be shown in this case to have contributed to the extent and severity of the damage. Thus, although the failure was a breach of rule 6 of the Collision Regulations, it was simply part of the history and not causative in law either of the collision or of the damage caused by the collision.  </p>

In fact, although the pilot informed Port Control that OD had dropped her anchor and was mooring at 1907 the pilot gave no notice before the manoeuvre was commenced at or before 1845.

PA’s own duty pursuant to Rules 5 and 7 was to keep a proper lookout by all available means so as to make an appraisal of the risk of collision. In case of doubt a risk of collision shall be deemed to exist. Assumptions are not to be based on scanty information. Thus it would be quite improper for PA to assume that there was no risk of collision because notice of an intention to moor had not been given by OD. Careful observation of ECDIS and the AIS information would have revealed a risk of collision as explained above. PA’s duty was then to take the appropriate action to avoid that risk of collision </p>

The question is not answered by saying that PA had her own means of appreciating what the vessels ahead of her were doing by keeping a good watch and assessing by all available means whether a risk of collision existed. PA may not have kept a good watch or may not have appreciated the significance of what was apparent. The question is whether, had OD given notice that she was about to moor at KM152 at about 1845, PA would have acted differently than she did and taken action to moor before KM 149. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not the evidence of the master of PA that had notice been given PA would have decided to moor. On the contrary the master of PA gave evidence that shortly before 1900 he had noted on ECDIS that OD had reduced her speed. By this time OD’s speed was less than a knot. He said that a few minutes later OD had stopped and moored on the west bank. It is unclear why he did not act on this information. His explanation is that “the two ships ahead of me had not asked for a tug and the authorities did not send them any. I assumed this was because there was no need for the ships to stop because of the AENEAS situation.” I am unable to accept this explanation. It is connected with his untrue explanation that the situation ahead had “normalised” and that he expected OD to get underway. In circumstances where the master has given an untrue account of his navigation it is, I think, difficult for the owners of PA to prove that had the pilot of OD given earlier notice of his intention to moor at KM 152 PA would have acted differently. Of course, common sense suggests that if such notice had been given PA would have decided to moor. But common sense also suggests that where (i) the pilot on board PA had been informed at 1820 that there was no movement up or down the Canal and that AENEAS was in mid-channel, (ii) observation by ECDIS and AIS at </p>

It is possible, and indeed more likely than not as I have found, that the explanation is that the master and pilot of PA were not keeping a good lookout in the sense of making a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision. In those circumstances it may be said that a vhf message from the pilot on board OD at about 1845 would have made all the difference. However, I am not persuaded that it is more likely than not it would have made all the difference. The master and pilot on board PA had access to enough information to suggest a risk of collision and yet did not act upon it. The evidence does not enable the court to find, on the balance of probabilities, that notification by OD of her intention to moor would have alerted PA to the risk of collision and the need to moor. I have therefore concluded that the owners of PA are unable to establish that the absence of notice of an intention to moor by OD was causative of the subsequent collisions. It is more likely than not that they would have occurred even if the pilot on board OD had informed the pilot at or before 1845 that OD was about to moor.      </p>

In those circumstances I consider that OD’s duty to maintain a proper lookout extended to, at least, the vessel immediately astern of her, SK. No submission was made by counsel for OD that OD owed no such duty; see paragraphs 160-161 of counsel’s closing submissions.

Given that IWAMI’s speed at 1845 was just over 1 knot she must have been in the process of mooring so it was incumbent upon OD to moor without delay. It is likely that IWAMI was mooring just to the south of KM 153. (The ECDIS screenshot from OD at 1927 showed her moored in that position). I am not persuaded that in such circumstances it was a breach of good seamanship for OD to moor just north of KM 152 rather than just south of KM 152, essentially for the reasons given by the Assessors.

AENEAS had suffered an engine problem whilst in the canal and had had to anchor mid-channel. The vessels astern of her also had to moor, otherwise there was a risk of one or more collisions. In the absence of tug assistance it was necessary for OD to use an anchor to slow the vessel and to enable the mooring to take place when there was a following 2-3 knot current as explained by her master. Whilst those vessels closer to the tug station appear to have used tugs neither OD nor IWAMI used tugs. SK did not (clearly) summon a tug until 1929 (when she was in difficulty) and PA made arrangements to moor but did not summon tug assistance. Thus it appears that it was reasonable to moor without tug assistance. That being so the use of an anchor by OD was necessary in circumstances where there was a following current.    </p>

This was said to be a breach of good seamanship and also a breach of article 46 of the Suez Canal Authority Rules which required her engines to be ready for use. The essence of the criticism was that because the anchor cable led aft it could not be heaved up and so, whatever the state of readiness of the vessel’s engines, OD was unable to depart. However, as explained by the master of OD the anchor was used, in conjunction with the mooring lines, to hold the vessel in position. The anchor was also necessary to enable the vessel to depart without tug assistance. That evidence is supported by the fact that IWAMI was “moored straight to the bank” and after mooring at 1907 her pilot had said that for his exit he would need a tug. Thus in my judgment the failure immediately to retrieve her anchor could not be contrary to good seamanship. The anchor was required by good seamanship. The vessel’s engines were ready for use and ready to start. There was no breach of article 46.  </p>

That is readily understandable. Counsel also invited the Court to bear in mind that OD did, in fact, albeit belatedly, attempt to take action. I assume that this is a reference to the action taken at 2000. This was an attempt to move the bow towards the bank. I do not consider that it supports the case that OD ought to have attempted to unmoor at 1940. Finally, it was said that the Elder Brethren do not appear to have taken into account rule 2 of the Collision Regulations and the obligation (in essence) to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which OD could reasonably foresee would be likely to injure its neighbour. Rule 2 provides that “<span style="color:#111111">Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precautions which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.”</span> In circumstances where the Assessors consider that it would have been “extremely unwise to attempt to [move] with PA bearing down” I do not consider it realistic to suggest good seamanship required such an attempt to be made.   </p>

It is said that as a result OD “went straight towards the swinging SK’s stern” which made “the contact with PA and SK more significant and more damaging”. There is no dispute that the engines were put astern. According to the VDR audio record the OD’s pilot noted that PA “was coming towards me with the bow” and said that he was seeking to retrieve his anchor. Thus he had a reason for his astern action. A fuller account is given by the master in his statement. He said that at the same time as the engines were put astern he continued with tightening the forward spring and slackening the port anchor chain. Those actions would assist in moving the bow to starboard towards the shore. The astern engine movement would also be expected, as a result of transverse thrust, to push the stern to port and the bow of OD to starboard, away from PA (though the VDR record shows no significant change in heading between 2002 and 2003, 153.5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o </span>to 153.7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span>). Given the proximity of PA to port these would appear to be sensible steps. OD’s position was described by her pilot in these terms. “<span style="font-style:italic">Captain Amgad’s ship [SK] moved transversely and Captain Ahmed Sadeq [PA] moved forward, and I am sandwiched between them now</span>.” I do not consider that the astern movement at 2002 can be criticised. OD was in a most unusual (perhaps unprecedented) and perilous position. As counsel for OD described the position OD, she was “o<span style="font-style:italic">n the horns of multiple dilemmas</span>”. In any event it is unlikely that astern movement (dead slow and slow) for no more than about a minute, perhaps less, would have made the contact with SK more significant. In all these circumstances I do not consider that this astern action can fairly be criticised.     </p>

For the same reasons PA cannot show that she would have been navigated differently had SK given her notice at 1845 of her intention to moor. The master of PA made no suggestion in his evidence that PA would have been navigated differently.

Although it was not accepted that there was a duty to give such notice or to seek tug assistance there was no need to ask questions of the Assessors in order to determine whether this criticism was valid. Obviously tug assistance would help a vessel to moor and the vessels close to the tug station summoned tug assistance for that purpose. But those further away did not, at any rate when preparing to moor. SK did not summon tug assistance, at least not clearly, and OD certainly did not. They were not alone in preparing to moor without tug assistance. PA herself prepared to moor by putting her mooring boat in the water and decided to moor on the east bank at 1854 but did not summon tug assistance. Given the current, and the absence of tugs, it was inevitable that anchors would be used to assist with mooring. The explanation given by the master of OD for using his anchor was sensible and seamanlike. The use of the port anchor assisted with manoeuvring the vessel and with reducing her speed. It also enabled the stern to swing toward the mooring bollard. The pilot on PA must have appreciated such matters and that tug assistance was some distance away and so did not need to be told that SK was planning to moor by the use of anchors, rather than with tug assistance. I do not consider that there was any breach of duty in failing to advise that SK was to moor without tug assistance or in mooring with the assistance of anchors. In circumstances where there was a need to moor and tug assistance was some distance away the use of anchors was an “absolute necessity” and so not in breach of the Suez Canal Regulations. When OD dropped anchor at 1907 as part of the mooring process Port Control replied, “Good job, sir”. Port Control would hardly have said that if the use of an anchor was in breach of the Suez Rules of Navigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The manner in which SK attempted to moor is certainly open to question. It can be said with force (though for forensic reasons counsel for PA did not suggest this in terms) that SK ought to have moored before reaching KM 149. Had she sought to do so she would have been able to use her anchors to assist with the process of mooring. But having not done sought to do so she attempted to moor after KM 149 and failed because she was unable to use her anchors. Thus if SK had collided with OD in consequence she may well have been liable for the resulting damage to OD. But fortunately SK was brought to a halt at C-18 some 2 cables from OD.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The suggestion that the manner in which SK attempted to moor prevented PA from sailing past in safety (because SK ended up on the east bank whilst OD was on the west bank) is unrealistic and untenable. First, it was never the intention of PA to sail past a moored vessel. As her pilot said, if MARY LISA V moored, then all the vessels astern of her would have to do so. There was no alternative. Further, the pilot was aware that all vessels had received an instruction that there should be no overtaking.  Second, </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.00in">sailing past was not a safe option. The master of PA was keen during the course of his cross-examination to illustrate a vessel moored parallel to the bank to enable a vessel astern to sail past her. But a vessel which moors without tug assistance is likely to be angled into the Canal so as to enable her to depart without tug assistance. This was explained by the master of OD. His approach was seamanlike. (It appears that IWAMI, a smaller vessel, did not do so, despite having an anchor down, but in consequence she needed a tug to leave her moored position.) The Canal was a cable in width. With a vessel moored to the west bank, angled into the Canal and with her port anchor deployed, there was likely to be insufficient space to enable a laden bulk carrier to sail past in safety. Regard has to be had not just to the question of there being available water but also to the possible effects of interaction between the vessels and between the passing vessel and the bank (see <span style="font-style:italic">Interaction between Vessels and their Environment</span> by Brian Corlett, in Appendix 7 to <span style="font-style:italic">Marsden and Gault on Collisions at Sea</span> 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.ed.) It is no doubt because of the narrow width of the canal and the possible effects of interaction that article 73 of the Suez Canal Rules provides that vessels are not allowed to overtake one another while underway in the Canal unless authorised by Port Control. Third, it was not just one vessel which was moored. At least two others (and possibly three) were also moored (at 1930). For these reasons I have concluded that the master’s evidence that he was prevented from sailing past SK because she had moored on the east bank whilst OD was moored to the west bank was untrue. It was made up in an attempt to explain and justify PA’s navigation. Thus any negligence by SK in failing to moor before KM 149 on the west bank did not prevent PA from sailing past SK. That being so there was no need to put any question concerning this criticism to the Assessors.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for PA raised a fourth criticism, namely, that after SK stopped at 19.30 and prior to contact with PA at 19.48, SK should have moved ahead past OD. The criticism put to the master of SK in cross-examination was that as a result of arguing with the pilot about the mooring operation he failed to keep a good lookout astern but that at 1937 (C-11) and 1941 (C-7) he noticed and was warned of the danger from PA. At that time it was suggested that the master ought to have slipped anchor or driven forward on his engines so as to move forward. Indeed, it was, I think, suggested that if he had kept a good lookout astern he should have taken such action earlier. It is, however, difficult to find any reference to, or development of, this criticism in Counsel’s closing submissions; see paragraphs 145-152 of those closing submissions which deal with the period after 1930. (There is a suggestion in counsel’s chronology at paragraph 78 that at 1940 SK’s pilot informed the master that SK could pass OD. But nothing was made of this either in the lengthy submissions on fault or in cross-examination of the master and counsel’s understanding of the exchange was in any event challenged by counsel for OD at paragraph 76 of his closing submissions. It is unlikely, as it appears to me, that the pilot was saying that SK could pass OD at 1940.) Nor, I think, was the criticism mentioned in counsel’s oral closing submissions (though this may have been because of the pressure of time). When counsel received from the court the proposed questions for the Assessors (which contained none in relation to SK) counsel submitted that the following question be put to the Elder Brethren: “Whether, after SK stopped at 19.30 and prior to contact with PA at 19.48, SK should have moved ahead past OD ?” </p>

The practice is referred to by Lord Sumner in his clear and penetrating account of the respective roles of judge and assessor in <span style="font-style:italic">The Australia</span> [1927] AC 145 at pp. 150-153 with which Lords Phillimore, Carson and Blanesburgh agreed, see pages 155 and 157. Lord Sumner observed that the facts of that case made it “easy to state to the assessors the assumptions on which they were to consider the questions put to them.” As a result of the practice now followed to ensure compliance with article 6 of the ECHR (see above at paragraph 186) the factual assumptions tend now to be expressed more clearly than in the past. This is to ensure that counsel know the factual premises of the proposed questions at a time when they have not seen the judgment of the court setting out the facts as found by the court. This practice almost inevitably ties the question to a particular time.  The question proposed by PA, by contrast, states no assumptions and relates to a substantial period of time, namely, the 18 minute period between C-18 and collision. I do not consider that such a broad question can properly be put to the Assessors. It not only asks the Assessors their opinion on a matter of seamanship, their legitimate role, but also risks asking them to decide or assume facts of the case relating to that 18 minute period, an illegitimate role. As Lord Sumner stated in <span style="font-style:italic">The Australia</span> at p.151: “It is for them [the judges] to believe or to disbelieve the witnesses, and to find the facts, which they give to their assessors and which must be accepted by them.” </p>

At 1940 (C-8) her pilot informed Port Control that if he had not dropped two anchors SK would have collided with OD. At 1943 (C-5) attempts were still being made to make SK fast to the east bank. This was hardly the time to be contemplating slipping both anchors. Ahead of her was OD angled into the Canal with her port anchor out. To seek to pass her in the eastern half of the Canal where the (single) channel was only a cable in width would be fraught with difficulty. As has already been noted the pilot on SK feared that he would have collided with OD had he not let go two anchors. But had he been able to pass her safely he would then have to pass the other vessels which had moored, IWAMI and MAPLE LIV and possibly MARY LISA V, all at a time when he did not have the use of his anchors (because they had, on this assumption, been slipped). Although the master of SK was not generally a reliable witness his reaction to the criticism put to him in crossexamination appeared to me to redolent of good sense and seamanship.   </p>

At 1942 (C-6) the sound of the PA’s anchor chain paying out could be heard on the bridge of SK. At that time the bows of PA were about half a cable or a little more astern of the bridge of SK.  To slip both anchors and attempt to move forward at this time would have been hazardous. At 1945 (C-3) it appears that Port Control advised SK to move ahead.

The master accepted that it would have that effect but by the same token it would tend to swing the bow to port towards the bank. In fact the heading data from SK’s VDR shows that from 1946 until collision at 1948 the heading of SK moved two degrees to starboard from 185<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span>-187<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span>, so that her stern would have moved to port. <span style="font-weight:bold;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span> In the circumstances there is nothing in this criticism at least with regard to causation of the collision between PA and SK.

This appears to be the subject of the further question which counsel  submitted should be put to the Assessors: “At 19:55 Hrs, once the stern of SK started to rotate into the Canal, would putting her engine ahead and rudder hard to starboard have prevented further rotation ?”. This action was not taken, though at 1959 the helm of SK was put hard starboard. It had little effect. The heading of SK continued to swing to port until the stern of SK struck the stern of OD.  </p>

Whether or not the suggested helm and engine action would have arrested the swing of SK’s stern to starboard towards the stern of OD, the suggested helm and engine action would have risked exacerbating the contact between SK and PA. (If, as suggested by counsel for PA, PA and SK were not in contact at this time, the suggested helm and engine action would have risked causing such contact.) In those circumstances it is not realistic to suggest that it was negligent of SK not to put her engines ahead and her helm to starboard at 1955.

The prudent course of action, it was suggested, was to “drive the bow of SK into the east bank”. Since the SK was heading towards the east bank at 2002 putting the bows aground was a possible result of this action. It is difficult to criticise a mariner for not doing that (though there may be circumstances where it is the lesser evil). But in any event the collision occurred a minute later at 2003 and so it is unlikely that the suggested engine and helm action would have had time to prevent the looming collision. Similarly, the second collision occurred at 2013 and so the suggested action at 2012 is unlikely to have prevented it.  </p>

No such concession was made in the present case. It is therefore necessary to consider whether PA’s fault in causing the collision with SK at 1948 was also the cause in law of the later collisions between PA and OD and between SK and OD at 2003, the yet later collisions between those vessels at 2013 and 2014 and the final collision between PA and SK at 2018.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">That question of causation depends upon whether the effect of the first collision was continuing in such a way as not merely to provide the opportunity for the later collisions but as to constitute the cause of them. The courts have answered questions of this nature (which usually arise where there has been intervening negligence) by the use of metaphors. Was the hand of negligent navigator on board PA still heavy on SK and OD at the time of the later collisions? Were those on board SK and OD not free agents by reason of the hard necessities imposed on them by the first collision? Were those on board SK and OD still in the grip of the first collision? These metaphors and their source are described by Brandon J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Calliope</span> at p.101. Such questions are to be approached in a broad common sense way; see p. 102. </p>

Similarly, it was unwise for OD to attempt to move from her moored position. All she could do was attempt to turn the bow of OD to starboard away from the approaching PA. The first collision was the real and effective cause of the collisions at 2003.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">After the collisions at 2003 the three vessels moved down the Canal in the shape of the triangle to which I have already referred more than once. That triangle is a graphic display of the grip in which SK and OD were held as a result of the collisions at 1948 and at 2003. The first collision remained a real and effective cause of the later collisions which occurred at 2013 and 2014. There was nothing that SK could reasonably do to avoid the later collisions and PA understandably applied astern engine power to arrest or control the drift downstream of OD. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">The final contact was between SK and PA at 2018 as SK and PA lay on reciprocal headings. They had reached this remarkable position after they had been “released” from the triangle and the stern of SK continued to swing. In a broad and common sense way the first collision must be regarded as the real and effective cause of this final contact. </p>

Trinity House, since its incorporation in 1514, has been dedicated to the safety of navigation and the advice given by the Elder Brethren enables the Admiralty Court to ensure that its decisions reflect and uphold the standards and requirements of good seamanship. If, as noted by Clarke J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Sanwa and Choyang Star</span> 1998 1 Lloyd’s Reports 283 at p.300, one of the functions of the Admiralty Court is to help to avoid collisions in the future, Trinity House has an essential role in ensuring that that function of the Admiralty Court is discharged.     </p>
