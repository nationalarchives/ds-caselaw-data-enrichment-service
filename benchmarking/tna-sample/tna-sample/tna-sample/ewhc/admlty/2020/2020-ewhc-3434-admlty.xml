	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This case, like the board game Buccaneer, concerns 2364 bars of silver. The Claimant is a UK company formed in 2012 for the purpose of locating and salving valuable shipwrecks lying at depths which up until then had precluded salvage. It claims to have salved the silver bars from the wreck of the SS TILAWA which was sunk in the Indian Ocean on about 23 November 1942 by two Japanese torpedoes. There were many passengers and crew on board, 281 of whom lost their lives. The current value of the silver bars is said to be some US$ 43 million.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The alleged salvage was carried out in 2017 and the silver bars were taken to Southampton on 2 October 2017 where they were declared to the Receiver of Wreck. They are now held to the order of the Receiver of Wreck pursuant to section 236 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Subsequently, on 14 September 2018, the Government of the Republic of South Africa (“the RSA”) claimed to be the owner of the silver bars. The Claimant was made aware that a claim to ownership had been made but was unaware of who had made the claim. On 12 November 2018 the Claimant, by its solicitors, advised the Receiver of Wreck that it was entitled to the silver as “unclaimed wreck” but that if a claim to ownership were proven the Claimant sought a salvage award. If an award could not be agreed with the owner the </p>

Thereafter the Claimant was advised on 31 January 2019 that it was the RSA which claimed ownership of the silver and correspondence ensued between the Claimant, the RSA and the Receiver of Wreck.  </p>

However, it does not appear that the Government of the Union of South Africa did so with regard to the silver. With regard to the first sale of silver in 1942 the Government of the Union of South Africa, by letter dated 10 February 1942, requested the Government of India to arrange the shipment. The Government of the Union of South Africa further requested that the bills of lading be consigned to the Stores Superintendent, South Africa Railways and Harbours, Durban. One negotiable copy of the bill of lading was to be sent to the Stores Superintendent with the remaining copies posted to the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in Pretoria. No marine or war risk insurance was required. The Government of the Union of South Africa was to pay the cost of the goods plus the freight. It is more likely than not that the same arrangements were requested with regard to the shipment in November 1942 with which this case is concerned. Thus it would appear that the Government of the Union of South Africa, although it did not arrange the contract of carriage contained in or evidenced by the bill of lading, was party to it. Counsel for the RSA accepted that that was the probability.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is common ground that the silver bars were sold for use by the South African Mint. The Mint had been founded by the Mint Act of 1941. (Prior to 1941 there was a mint in Pretoria in South Africa which was a branch of the Royal Mint in London.) The Mint was a not a separate legal person but was an integral part of the Department of Finance of the Government of the Union of South Africa under the executive authority of the Minister of Finance. The Mint had no right to contract or acquire or own property in  its own name. The Mint Act provided for the Mint to produce coinage for use within the Union of South Africa or within other states. The Act contemplated that such activities would generate profit and made provision as to where such profit should be paid. If coinage for use in South Africa were produced the profit was to be shared between the Coinage Fund and the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The latter was a fund established by the Union of South Africa Act 1909 which contained all revenue collected in the Union (save for that from railways, ports and harbours). The former was a fund established by the Financial Adjustments Act 1930 which was used to fund the recoinage of worn coins and any losses arising from the coining of Union coinage. If coinage for use in other states were produced the profit could go to the other state (at the discretion of the Minister of Finance) or, in the absence of a direction to that effect, to the Coinage Fund.  </p>

During 1942 the production of silver and bronze coin had reached a record figure. In addition to increased demand for Union coinage there had been orders for non-Union coinage from East Africa, Egypt, French Equatorial Africa and Mauritius. Egypt required silver coinage. The Mint also had an ammunition department which, unsurprisingly, was particularly busy in 1942. The report also indicated that the Mint dealt with gold, meeting the demands of the dental profession and producing badges and medals. The latter were not only for the Union but for other states also. Thus badges were produced for the Belgian Congo Forces, Loraine Crosses were produced for the Free French Authorities in Central Africa and badges were produced for the Ethiopian Police. The Mint also had demands closer to home; the production of a handsome sports trophy for the Mint Recreation Club. </p>

The Union authorities were content for the question of priority between the Egyptian and East African orders to be agreed between London and Cairo. On 2 May 1942 the Union authorities were still waiting for an “early decision as regards priority between East African and Egyptian orders”.

The East African Currency Board reported on 19 June 1942 that the first part of the order for forgings had been shipped and that the balance would be forwarded as soon as manufacture was complete. This matter was of such importance that it engaged the attention of Mr. Eden, the Foreign Secretary.

That is evidenced by the Report of the Director of the Mint for 1942 which records that in 1942 10 million Egyptian silver piastres were produced. The submission made on behalf of the Claimant was that the silver bars shipped on board SS TILAWA were intended to be used for the production of Egyptian coin. By inference the Claimant’s case must be that when that cargo was lost the Egyptian coin must have been produced in what remained of 1942 from other silver bought by the Mint. In that regard there was evidence in a letter dated 13 May 1943 from the Mint that silver was also obtained from the Rand Refinery in 1942. The letter further stated that of the bullion received in 1942 approximately 80% had been used for Union coinage and approximately 20% for Egyptian coinage.  </p>

The report for 1942 referred to increased demand for both Union coinage and non-Union coinage. Consistently with that increased demand, a letter dated 30 August 1943 from the High Commission referred to a statement from the Mint that the order for 10 million pieces had to be carried out “at a time when extremely great pressure for coinage was being experienced in many directions”.

However, it is likely that this contact concerned requests by the Minister for more information, which was provided by Mr. Morris in the form of the most informative report. The Claimant does not accept the evidence of Mr. Scholtz that the minor amendments to the draft contract provided at this time were made unilaterally by Odyssey. However, there is no reason not to accept his evidence. The first draft identified three questions as to the draft (addressed to “Patricia”). Their content suggests that a draft based on English law had been used and that it was thought that the draft should be amended to refer to South African law. This was done in the amended draft. So the need for the amendments appears to have been spotted by Odyssey. The amendments could therefore have been made unilaterally. If the RSA had been involved in these amendments one would expect Mr. Scholtz or Ms. de Wet to have been involved and there is no email suggesting that they were. The questions asked by Mr. Scholtz on 31 July 2017 suggests that the RSA had not reached the position of deciding whether to enter into negotiations or not. The telephone discussion between Mr. Scholtz and Mr. Morris on 12 September 2017 do not suggest that negotiations were already underway. The RSA’s questions were only answered clearly by Mr. Stemm on 13 October 2017. Thereafter, it would appear that legal advice was given to the RSA and eventually in January 2018 negotiations commenced.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The most than can be said is that by 2 October 2017, the date upon which the Claimant says that the cause of action in salvage accrued, the RSA was aware of the silver, that there were salvors or treasure hunters interested in recovering it and that if it were recovered the RSA might benefit financially through receiving a modest share of the proceeds. I am unable to accept that from the time when the RSA was first informed of the silver in 2016 the RSA “looked to have it salved commercially, and to sell the silver commercially at a vast profit.” If anything their cautious response suggested some scepticism. I am also unable to accept the submission that by 23 June 2017 or 2 October 2017 the RSA “evinced an intention to continue to use the silver for commercial purposes.” Again the most than can be said is that if the silver were salved the RSA was aware that it might benefit. It was not until Mr. Stemm’s response of 13 October 2017 and after considering that response with its legal advisers that the RSA formed the intention of entering into a contract with Odyssey pursuant to which the silver would be salved and then sold to the benefit of the RSA.  </p>

The party liable for such claims was a company which was in possession of the vessel pursuant to a contract with the Republic of the Philippines. Ownership remained with the Republic. The vessel was arrested and ordered to be sold. The Republic applied for all proceedings to be set aside on the grounds of sovereign immunity. At first instance the court set aside the proceedings, applying the absolute theory of sovereign immunity pursuant to which the fact that the vessel was used for ordinary commercial purposes did not preclude the operation of the doctrine. The court followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in the <span style="font-style:italic">Porto Alexandre</span> [1920] P.30. The decision at first instance was reversed on appeal, the court of appeal holding that the decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">Porto Alexandre</span> could be distinguished. The Privy Council held that the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity was more consonant with justice and decided not to follow the <span style="font-style:italic">Porto Alexandre</span>. The Privy Council then had to consider whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Philippine Admiral</span> could properly be regarded as a mere trading vessel or was a ship <span style="font-style:italic">publicus usibus destinata </span>(destined for public use) which involved considering the past history of the vessel since she became the property of the Republic and the use to which she was likely to be put by the Republic in the future; see p.248 per Lord Cross. The Privy Council held that the vessel was a trading vessel. She had been used for commercial purposes for many years and there was no reason to suppose that that was to change. Accordingly the appeal was dismissed and the claim to immunity failed; see p.249.  </p>

In that case an action in rem was issued against <span style="font-style:italic">1 Congreso del Partido</span>, which was said to be a sister ship of the two vessels in connection with which the claims in that action arose, the <span style="font-style:italic">Playa Larga</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Marble Islands</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">1 Congreso del Partido</span> was arrested in Sunderland. At first instance the Republic of Cuba sought to have the actions set aside on the grounds of sovereign immunity. It was said that <span style="font-style:italic">1 Congreso del Partido </span>was destined for uses regarded by the Cuban Government as public but that even if she was to be regarded as an ordinary trading vessel the Republic was still entitled to immunity on the authority of the <span style="font-style:italic">Porto Alexandre</span>.; see pp.544-545. After judgment had been reserved by Robert Goff J., the advice of the Privy Council in the <span style="font-style:italic">Philippine Admiral</span> was delivered. Further argument was necessary. At the renewed hearing the Republic of Cuba conceded that <span style="font-style:italic">1 Congreso del Partido</span> was an ordinary trading vessel and did not seek to support the decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">Porto Alexandre</span>. However, the claim to immunity was maintained on the grounds that the English court would not implead a foreign sovereign where the claim on which the arrest was based arose from an exercise of sovereign or public or governmental power; see pp.546 and 551. That submission was upheld and it was held on the facts that the diversion of the two cargoes on <span style="font-style:italic">Playa Larga</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Marble Islands</span>  was an act of foreign policy in respect of which immunity may be invoked; see p.555. That decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.  However Lord Denning and Waller LJ were in disagreement and so the matter proceeded to the House of Lords; see [1983] AC 244. The House of Lords held, in the case of the <span style="font-style:italic">Playa Larga</span> unanimously and in the case of the <span style="font-style:italic">Marble Islands</span> by a majority, that the claims were based on private commercial acts.

Again, that phrase is readily applicable to ships which are used for the purposes for which they have been built, namely, carrying cargo. One only needs to examine whether the purposes are commercial.  When applying the same phrase to cargoes, the task is not perhaps as easy. For cargoes, typically, are not put to the use for which they were grown or manufactured during carriage. They are only put to the use for which they have been grown or manufactured after the carriage has been completed and they are no longer on board the ship. It may be necessary to bear this difference in mind when applying section 10(4)(a) to state owned cargoes.    </p>

The court may issue any process in respect of the property of a state where the property is for the time being in use or intended for use for commercial purposes. Thus what excludes immunity is the same concept in both the adjudicative jurisdiction and the enforcement jurisdiction namely, proof that the vessel and cargo, or the property, are “in use or intended for use for commercial purposes.” However, although the test is the same the context in which it is applied is different. In the one case it is applied in the context of the adjudicative jurisdiction. In the other it is applied in the context of the enforcement jurisdiction. Also, in the case of the adjudicative jurisdiction the test must be satisfied at the time when the cause of action arose whilst in the case of the enforcement jurisdiction the test must be satisfied “for the time being”, that is, at the time when the process is issued, which will be sometime after the cause of action has arisen.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In considering these competing arguments it is helpful to consider the consequences of the RSA’s argument. That argument invites the court to conclude that the SS TILAWA, although in use for commercial purposes in 1942, was no longer in such use in 2017. If that is the correct approach it would follow that in a case where both ship and cargo were in use for commercial purposes immediately prior to sinking they would cease to be so once they had been sunk with the result that if the cargo were later salved  the RSA would be immune from a claim in rem for salvage and indeed from a claim in personam for salvage, for at the time the cause of action in salvage arose the ship would not be in use for commercial purposes (see section 10(4)(b) which deals with in personam actions against a state-owned cargo). Other examples may be postulated which do not involve an historic wreck. A ship may run aground and as a result of structural failure caused by hogging stress be unsalveable and in need of a wreck removal contract on commercial terms. Salvors are able however to salve her cargo. If the cargo is owned by a state and is in use or intended for use for commercial purposes the state would be immune from both an action in rem and an action in personam because, at the time when the cause of action for salvage arose, the vessel was no longer in use or intended for use for commercial purposes but was merely a wreck.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These are surprising consequences. It is difficult to see why the fact that the vessel becomes a wreck should determine whether a state is immune from an action in rem for salvage in respect of its cargo. They suggest that Parliament cannot have intended that, in applying section 10 of the SIA, the court was to ignore the status of vessel and cargo when the vessel was carrying the cargo. It is of course clear that Parliament required the assessment of the question of use for commercial purposes to be made at the time when the cause of action arose but in doing so the above examples suggest that one must have regard to the use of the vessel and cargo when the vessel was carrying the cargo. If both were in use for commercial purposes when the vessel was carrying the cargo then that will usually identify the status of the vessel and cargo when the cause of action for salvage arose. Otherwise, in the examples suggested, a state would have immunity from salvage, both in rem and in personam. That cannot have been intended by Parliament when enacting the SIA in order to give effect to the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity. The RSA’s argument seeks, I suggest, to apply section 10(4)(a) mechanically, rather than intelligently having regard to its consequences and the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.   </p>

That case concerned an award of salvage pursuant to a contract on the terms of Lloyd’s Standard Form of Salvage Agreement (“LOF”). The award was challenged pursuant to section 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996. A vessel, laden with wheat, had grounded on 28 August 2006. An LOF dated 1 September 2006 was agreed and on 7 September 2008 the casualty was refloated, before being redelivered on 9 September 2006. The Grain Board of Iraq (“the GBI”) had bought the cargo of wheat from Eksim. The cargo was intended for “public distribution” in Iraq as part of the Public Distribution System (“PBS”). Gross J held, as the arbitrator under the LOF had done, that the GBI was party to the LOF and so had agreed to arbitration pursuant to the LOF; see paragraphs 42 and 59. The GBI was a separate entity from the State of Iraq and the entry into the LOF was not done in the exercise of sovereign authority and so GBI was not entitled to immunity pursuant to section 14 of the SIA; see paragraph 80.  The challenge to the award of salvage on the grounds of state immunity failed for those reasons. No question therefore arose for decision as to section 10 and the judge dealt with this issue briefly.

The fact that the silver may have been intended for use as part of the governmental or sovereign activity of producing Union coinage could not affect the “status” of the cargo as a commercial cargo.

Counsel pointed out that the commentary of the  International Law Commission in 2004 on article 16 of the UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property understood the phrase “used or intended for use” in this way; see paragraph 15 of the commentary.  (The UN Convention – which has been described by Aikens J. as a most important guide to on the state of international opinion, see <span style="font-style:italic">AIG v Republic of Kazakhstan</span> [2006] 1 WLR 1420 at paragraph 80 - deals with ships owned or operated by a state in article 16, and sub-paragraph 4 thereof refers to state-owned cargo. The structure of the article has some similarities with the scheme of the SIA but deliberately makes no reference to actions in rem and in personam and describes as “manifold” the difficulties inherent in the formulation of rules for the exception from the principle of non-immunity; see paragraph 3 of the commentary. It was not suggested that I should interpret the language of the SIA by reference to the much later 2004 UN Convention.

Whilst this may be a possible use of the phrase “in use” when applied to a cargo, it is perhaps not the typical way in which the phrase is used. The carrier would not say that he is using the cargo for the purposes of the contract of carriage. He would say that he was carrying the cargo. The owner of the cargo would not say that he was using the cargo. He would say that his cargo was being carried.

As I have stated earlier in this judgment there is little difficulty in applying the phrase “in use or intended for use for commercial purposes” to ships. Ships are typically used for the purposes for which they were built whilst carrying cargo. But cargoes are not typically used for the purposes for which they were grown or manufactured whilst being carried. That difference is part of the context in which the phrase “in use or intended to be used for commercial purposes” is to be applied to cargo. If the phrase “in use” were to be understood in the sense suggested by the RSA very few if any cargoes would be in use. The only one suggested in argument was the use of vapours  from an LPG cargo for fuel. That suggests that the phrase “in use” when applied to cargo is intended to be applied in a different sense from that in which it is used when applied to ships.    </p>

Those who enter such contracts can find themselves subject to liabilities in salvage which are ordinary commercial liabilities.  It would be surprising if a state which, like any private entity, enters into such contracts, were immune from actions in rem against its cargo in respect of salvage. It would be difficult to reconcile such a conclusion with the restrictive theory of state immunity against the background of which the SIA is to be interpreted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case the claim which the Claimant wishes to make in rem against the silver bars is a claim in salvage. It is a claim based upon the fact that a successful salvage service by the Claimant conferred a benefit upon the RSA as owner of the salved property. A liability to pay salvage is an incident of maritime law, now enshrined in the Salvage Convention as part of English law, which can affect all those who contract for their goods to be carried by sea. When a state contracts for its goods to be carried by sea, a classic example of a commercial contract, there is no reason why, pursuant to the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, it should not be exposed to the same liability in salvage as a private owner of cargo. To adopt the phrase used by Lord Cross in the <span style="font-style:italic">Philippine Admiral</span> to justify his preference for the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity it is “more consonant with justice” that the state should in such circumstances be exposed to the same liability in salvage as a private owner of cargo. As Gross J. observed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Altair</span> at paragraph 57 “there is no unfairness in a state, having enjoyed the benefit of salvage services, becoming bound to pay for them (subject to any particular questions as to enforcement)”.    </p>

Counsel said that an admiralty action in rem obliges the RSA to come before the court because if it does not do so its property would be arrested and sold to discharge the liability to pay salvage.

If there were no acknowledgement of service by the RSA the Claimant would still be required to prove its claim if it sought judgment; see CPR 61.9(3)(a)(iii). The enforcement aspect of an action in rem would only come into play if and when the Claimant sought to arrest and then sell the cargo. That has not happened and may never happen. The silver is held to the order of the Receiver of Wreck pursuant to section 236 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. If and when it did happen section 13 would have to be considered and applied as at the time when the Claimant sought the issue of an arrest warrant, not at the earlier date when the cause of action in salvage arose. At present all that is sought is that the court exercises its adjudicative jurisdiction to determine the amount of salvage that is due.  </p>

That is the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase “in use or intended for use for commercial purposes” when regard is had to the context of cargoes on board a ship and also to the restrictive theory of state immunity which is the background against which the SIA is to be interpreted. The fact that the Government of the Union of South Africa intended to use the greater part of the silver to produce Union coinage in South Africa after the silver had been discharged from the vessel does not detract from that conclusion.</p>

It leads to the conclusion that the RSA is immune from the adjudicative jurisdiction of the court where it has exposed itself to a liability in salvage by reason of having chosen, as any private citizen does, to have its property carried by sea. Those are not the circumstances in which the state would expect to be immune from the adjudicative jurisdiction of the court pursuant to the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity. Since the SIA is to be interpreted against the background of the restrictive theory of state immunity that is a powerful reason for interpreting “in use” when applied to cargo in the manner submitted by counsel for the Claimant.  </p>

For the reasons I have given the cargo of silver bars was not a non-commercial cargo and the RSA is not entitled to sovereign immunity under generally recognised principles of international law or in the form in which they have been enacted by the SIA.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Claimant requires the court to exercise its adjudicative jurisdiction in rem by assessing the amount of salvage that is due so that,  pursuant to section 239 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the silver can be delivered to the RSA, “on paying the salvage due”. Since the Receiver of Wreck has stated that the Receiver cannot assess the salvage due and that the court must determine the salvage that is due there is obvious good sense in the court exercising its adjudicative jurisdiction to do so. The RSA is not immune from the adjudicative jurisdiction of the court in this action in rem because, for the reasons I have given, the ship and cargo were, at the time the cause of action in salvage arose, in use for commercial purposes. The Claimant does not require the court to exercise its enforcement jurisdiction by arresting the cargo and selling it because there is no need to do so.      </p>
