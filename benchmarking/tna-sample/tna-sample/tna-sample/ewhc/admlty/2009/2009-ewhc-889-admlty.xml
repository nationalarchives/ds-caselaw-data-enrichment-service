	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A dispute has arisen between the assured and the underwriters as to the realisation of the value of the wreck.  I am told that it is unprecedented in the London market for such realisation to be dealt with on other than a consensual basis.  The fact that this has here not so far proved possible has brought into question the precise nature of underwriters’ rights in this regard and, in particular, whether they are such as to entitle underwriters to exercise control over the manner in which the residual value of the wreck is ascertained.  It is common ground that underwriters, having paid for a CTL and settled the salvors’ claim against the vessel, are entitled to the residual open market value of the wreck.  However there is acute controversy between assured and underwriters as to what is that residual value.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not asked at this stage of the dispute to find any facts.  When claiming that the vessel was a CTL the assured asserted that the cost of repairs would be about €91 million.  Underwriters say that the wreck was in 2008 worth about €75 million “as is, where is”.  The assured on the other hand say that the wrecked vessel was then worth of the order of €25 million, which sum they offered to underwriters in August 2008.  Underwriters rejected this offer and were anxious that the vessel be put out to global tender with a view to effecting a sale or, at the least, ascertaining the open market value.  However the assured have been unprepared to co-operate with this process.  They say that permitting access to the vessel for inspection by their competitors would allow those third parties to ascertain confidential information.  It is I think common ground that there are currently only two other vessels in the world of comparable size and capability, both of which are fully employed in a buoyant market.  The underwriters say that in an open market sale the assured would be bound to be prepared to pay considerably more than €25 million in order to prevent the vessel passing into the hands of one of their competitors.  The assured are plainly unwilling to see the wreck pass into the hands of a third party.  However without there taking place an open market sale, or at any rate a global tender with concomitant rights of inspection for prospective bidders, it may be difficult or impossible to ascertain the true open market value of the vessel.  By the end of 2008 the assured and underwriters had reached an impasse, apparently unprecedented in the experience of those working in the London market.  In December 2008 all of the Claimants bar one and all of the Primary Underwriters bar two, representing, respectively, 85% and 77.5% of the market, expressly elected to take over the interest of the assured in what remained of the subject matter insured.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is against that background that the insured owners of the vessel, the First Defendant, took the equally unprecedented step of selling her, or attempting so to do, without reference to underwriters and, therefore, without their consent.  On 9 January 2009 the First Defendant concluded with the Fourth Defendants a Memorandum of Agreement for the sale of the vessel and a Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance of the vessel was likewise executed by both parties.  The First and Fourth Defendants are related companies, in the sense that it is conceded that the Fourth Defendant is in the majority ownership of companies in the Boskalis Group.  The consideration for the sale was €1,000.  The First Defendant admits, it could hardly sensibly deny, that the purpose of the sale was to prevent underwriters from themselves realising the open market value of the vessel.  However the First Defendant contends that it was entitled so to do because not all of the underwriters had by the time of the sale exercised their right, under section 63(1) and/or section 79(1) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, to take over the interest of the assured in the wreck.  The First Defendant continues to acknowledge that it is liable to account to the underwriters for the open market value of the wreck but it contends that it is no longer within the power of the assured and the underwriters to bring about an open market sale.  </p>

That is because at the hearing it was common ground that the relevant system of law for determining the incidence of proprietary interests in the vessel prior to, at the time of, and after the purported transfer of the vessel to the Fourth Defendant is the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span>.  It is common ground that at all material times the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> was either Thai law or Dutch law, the latter being the law of the place where the ship was registered before transfer.  It is a further unusual feature of the dealings with this vessel that shortly before her purported transfer to the Fourth Defendant her registration in the relevant Dutch Registry was apparently cancelled.  The Memorandum of Agreement recites that the vessel is registered at Rotterdam and both that document and the Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance give the Dutch Register number.  However, one of the facts on the basis of which I am asked to resolve the Phase 1 Issues is that “at the time of the purported transfer, the vessel was not registered under any flag and remains unregistered” – see Statement of Facts paragraph 14.  </p>

They say therefore that English law will prove to be irrelevant to the efficacy of the transfer of title from the First to the Fourth Defendants.  Even if they are wrong about that, English law would they say only become relevant if the choice of law rules of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> so indicated, which it is said they will not, at any rate so far as Thai law is concerned.  I am not sure if any party has as yet asserted a positive case so far as concerns the choice of law rules of the Netherlands, not least because it was only in the course of the hearing before me that the First to Third, but not the Fourth Defendants, expressed an unequivocal preference for the identification of Dutch law as the law of the situs in relation to that period prior to the removal of the vessel from the Dutch register.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Milligan did not identify what would for this purpose be the <span style="font-style:italic">locus actus</span>.  The <span style="font-style:italic">locus actus </span>so far as concerns the sale and transfer may I suppose be the Netherlands, which is the place at which the Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance was purportedly made, and this is what is now asserted in the Claimants’ proposed re-amended Particulars of Claim.  However at paragraph 58 thereof the Claimants accept that, if valid, the proprietary effect of the sale and transfer must in an English court of first instance be regarded as governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span>, which the Claimants assert to be Thai law.  Mr Milligan is possibly more concerned with the <span style="font-style:italic">locus actus</span> of the transactions which are said to have given rise to proprietary interests in the vessel short of legal ownership.  The proposed re-amended Particulars of Claim assert that the <span style="font-style:italic">locus actus</span> of the relevant transactions was England, and that “the Claimants reserve the right to contend that the accrual of proprietary rights in the Vessel was governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci actus</span>, English law”.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan</span> case was not concerned with the priority of competing interests in tangible moveable property, in respect of which the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> rule appears well-established – see Dicey, Morris and Collins, Rule 124, above.  <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan</span> was concerned with the priority of competing interests in intangible moveable property, i.e. shares, or choses in action.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan</span> Millett J thought that there might be good reason for the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> rule in the case of tangible moveables, but less in the case of intangibles, where the situs is somewhat artificial.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan</span> the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci actus</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> of the subject matter of each of the transactions in question were one and the same, which as Millett J observed “is probably inevitable in the case of shares”.  However when the case reached the Court of Appeal the relevance of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci actus</span> was specifically rejected by each member of the court: by Staughton LJ [1996] 1 WLR 387 at pp 399F-402E and 405D, by Auld LJ at pp 410B-413A and by Aldous LJ at pp 421B and 424F-425A.  The Court of Appeal held that the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> was the applicable law, holding this to be the general rule for both tangible and intangible moveable property.  In the light of this, reliance at the next stage of the trial upon the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci actus</span> as governing the accrual of proprietary rights in the vessel seems unlikely to be fruitful.  </p>

The question whether the court enjoys a discretion under that section and, if so, should exercise it to order the Fourth Defendants (or any trustees) to transfer the vessel to the underwriters or to their nominee is to be decided at the second hearing in May.  </p>

Sometimes it is used to mean the cession to underwriters by the insured of their property and interest in the ship.  Sometimes it is used to refer to the giving of notice of abandonment.  See generally per Rix LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Kastor Navigation Co. Ltd v.

However if either proposition correctly stated the law, the automatic effect of payment for a total loss or of service of a valid notice of abandonment in respect thereof produced what was for underwriters a most inconvenient result, for the wreck might be a “damnosa hereditas” and the underwriters thereby exposed to liability for wreck removal – see Arnould, <span style="font-style:italic">Law of Marine Insurance and Average</span>, 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition, paragraphs 30-06 and 30-35.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that when agreeing to pay for a CTL in the present case insurers endorsed the claim settlement “net open market residual value of vessel to be accounted to insurers”.  It is as I understand it common ground that, having paid for the CTL, insurers are indeed entitled to that value, although no argument has yet been addressed to me on why that is so and what is the legal analysis which leads to that conclusion.  Possibly the concession is made because it was on those terms that the insurers agreed to settle the CTL claim and on those terms that the insured accepted payment.  I raise the point because on one view of the case underwriters only made an effective election to take over the interest of the assured in what remained of the subject-matter insured after the assured had sold the vessel.  In Arnould at paragraph 30-35 it is suggested that an underwriter when paying for a CTL may indefinitely keep open his options so far as concerns taking over the interest of the assured in what remains of the subject matter insured.  Arnould also points out, at paragraph 30-36, footnote 198, that the underwriter may pay the loss while declining to accept the abandonment.  If he does so, it is suggested by the learned editors that he may be taken to have waived his right to salvage or to the proceeds of sale, or to be estopped from laying claim thereto – cf. <span style="font-style:italic">White Star SS Co. v. North British and Mercantile Insurance Co. Ltd</span> [1943] A.M.C. 399, an American case.  Ignoring for the moment the complication introduced by multiple underwriters, if an insurer elects to take over the interest of the assured only after the assured has sold the vessel, there may be a question what interest remains to be taken over.  Possibly the proceeds of sale represent “the interest of the assured in whatever may remain of the subject-matter”.  Possibly insurers in any event derive their entitlement to the sale proceeds from their rights of subrogation.  Indeed Mr Weitzman suggested in argument that an assured who sells a vessel at an undervalue having been paid for a CTL might be vulnerable to a claim based on his having prejudiced insurers’ rights of subrogation.  He also asserts/concedes that the Claimants have an equitable lien on the €1,000 proceeds of the sale to the Fourth Defendants, on the basis, so it would seem, that this is a subrogated recovery and in reliance therefore on the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Napier and Ettrick v. Hunter</span> [1993] AC 713.  However this still leaves open the question why an insurer who has not exercised his election under either section 63(1) or 79(1) is entitled to the net open market residual value of an as yet unsold vessel.  Mr Weitzman’s concession in that regard may, as I have already recorded, be based on the endorsement to the claim settlement.  It cannot be founded on any incident of what I might call “completed abandonment” because on Mr Weitzman’s case underwriters did not exercise their entitlement under either 63(1) or section 79(1) prior to sale of the vessel.  The election in December 2008 was he says ineffective because it was not participated in by 100% of subscribing underwriters.  The express election by 100% of subscribing underwriters after the sale of the vessel to the Fourth Defendants was made at a time when the assured no longer had any interest in the subject-matter insured which the insurers could take over, other perhaps than the proceeds of sale.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It may therefore be important to determine whether a request to be paid “net open market residual value” amounts to an election, either to take over or conversely not to take over the interest of the assured in whatever remains of the subject-matter insured and, if so, whether such election is revocable or irrevocable.  Amongst other things the answer to this question may be relevant to the question raised by Issue 7, whether insurers may require the sale of the vessel or dictate in principle the manner of such sale.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the case of an actual total loss, no notice of abandonment need be given –section 57(2) of the Act.  Where there is a CTL, the assured may either treat the loss as a partial loss or he may treat it as if it were an actual total loss –section 61 of the Act.  However the right of the assured to treat a CTL as if it were an actual total loss is dependent on his abandoning the subject-matter insured to the insurer – section 61 of the Act.  Where the assured elects to abandon the subject-matter to the insurer he must give notice of abandonment – section 62(1), subject only to the exception provided by section 62(7) where at the time the assured receives information of the loss there would be no possibility of benefit to the insurer if notice were given to him, in which case notice of abandonment is unnecessary.  It is I think because abandonment of the subject-matter insured to the insurers is a condition of being entitled to treat a CTL as if it were an actual total loss that it is now well established that preservation of the right to treat a CTL as an actual total loss is dependent upon the assured continuing to be prepared to abandon the subject-matter insured to the insurer – see per Rix J in <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Boskalis Westminster NV v. Mountain</span> [1997] LRLR 523 at page 557 and per Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">The Kastor Too</span> at page 137, paragraph 77 of the judgment.

It is essentially an offer to cede, a formal or even informal recognition that, if the insurer so elects, he will, upon payment, be entitled to a complete interest in the thing insured or what remains of it as from the time of the casualty.  If that offer is accepted it becomes irrevocable.  If it is rejected, like any offer, it can be withdrawn: <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Boskalis</span> at page 556.

The paradigm case would be where the assured sells the wreck without reference to underwriters.  It is thus clear that had the assured in the present case without reference to underwriters sold the wreck before receiving payment for a CTL then, subject to any argument as to underwriters having waived their rights, the assured would thereby have deprived themselves of their entitlement to recover for a CTL.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to notice certain other features of the statutory scheme.  Rejection of the offer to abandon constituted by the notice of abandonment does not destroy the offer.  Section 62(4) provides that where notice of abandonment is properly given, the rights of the assured are not prejudiced by the fact that the insurer refuses to accept the abandonment.  As Rix LJ pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">The Kastor Too</span>, like any offer, it can at any stage be withdrawn – with the consequences already discussed.  However the notice of abandonment need not I think be repeated, in the sense of given over again, indeed in the ordinary case an assured whose notice of abandonment is declined will be treated as continuing to make the offer constituted by the notice unless and until he does some act inconsistent therewith.  Furthermore the proper analysis of underwriters declining or declining to accept notice of abandonment is I consider, in agreement with Mr Milligan, ordinarily that they thereby intimate that they do not at that stage accept that the notice is valid.  The rejection of the assured’s offer to abandon is not ordinarily without more irrevocable.  Conversely however when notice of abandonment is accepted then section 62(6) provides that “the abandonment is irrevocable”.  More difficult to understand however is precisely what this means.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Both Mr Milligan and Mr Weitzman attempted to assist me on this point, for which I am grateful, although neither addressed what either they or I would regard as full argument on the point.  Notice of abandonment was not here accepted when tendered.  It is common ground that on payment for the CTL underwriters had the right, pursuant to section 79(1), to elect to take over the interest of the assured in whatever remained of the wreck, irrespective of the question whether a right under section 63(1) remained available to be exercised.  Both counsel therefore approached the matter on the basis that I do not need to decide what would have been the effect of actions which did not take place.  This is of course true.  On the other hand what is under discussion in this case is the question whether by payment for a CTL the underwriters acquired some equitable interest in the wreck of a nature not dealt with by the Act.  What is effectively suggested here by underwriters is that by or on payment for a CTL they acquired some form of security interest, the benefit of which they could enjoy whilst deciding whether or not to take over the interest of the assured in the wreck, the existence of which security interest (i) constrained the assured’s freedom of action (ii) arguably impaired the assured’s ability to give title to the vessel and (iii) would at the least affect a purchaser with notice thereof.  This being the nature of the enquiry, it is I think relevant to the analysis to determine precisely what proprietary interests the Act contemplates as being available to insurers, even if in this case insurers did not avail themselves of some or all of the opportunities offered.  Furthermore, since the interest for which insurers contend is one which confers benefits upon them but imposes no burden, it is relevant to enquire whether the existence of such a right is compatible with the scheme of the Act.  Taking over the interest of the insured in the wreck involves the assumption of liabilities, as already discussed.  It may be that the provision to underwriters by statute of a right which confers both benefits and burdens impliedly excludes the creation of a more limited right which is more favourable to underwriters.  Mr Weitzman does indeed so contend.  To my mind therefore it is relevant to enquire what would have been the position had underwriters accepted notice of abandonment before paying for a CTL.  My conclusions on this point, even if necessarily tentative, are likely to inform my approach to the question whether by virtue of paying for a CTL underwriters acquired a proprietary interest in the vessel.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I return therefore to the question what is meant by section 62(6).  It seems to me significant that the word used in the sub-section is “irrevocable” rather than “complete” or “perfected” or some other word signifying the crystallisation of the process of abandonment.  This approach is consistent I think with the second sentence of the sub-section.  That sentence should I consider be regarded as spelling out what is meant by the abandonment becoming irrevocable.  By acceptance of notice of abandonment the insurer admits his liability to pay for a CTL and admits that the offer to cede given by the assured is validly made.  If however acceptance of notice of abandonment without more achieved cession of interest from insured to insurer, it would hardly be necessary to provide expressly that acceptance of the notice admits its sufficiency.  Furthermore it is to be noted that it is the immediately following section 63(1) which provides what it is that the insurer is entitled to take over where there is a valid abandonment.  In the light of the logical sequence in which Sir Mackenzie Chalmers addressed the topic, this might be thought a pointer to the process described in section 62(6) not in itself amounting to the exercise of the right which is first described only in the next section.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milligan’s preferred analysis is that by accepting notice of abandonment the insurer accepts that the notice is validly given and indeed accepts liability to pay for a CTL, but does not thereby elect to take over the wreck.  That is a separate right which arises under section 63(1).  Mr Milligan did not address the point whether an express or implied election to take over the wreck would, before payment by underwriters for a CTL, bring about cession to insurers of the insured’s interest in the wreck.  Arnould puts forward two inconsistent views on this point.  At paragraph 30-09 it is stated that transfer of the assured’s proprietary interest in the subject-matter insured takes place automatically on acceptance of the notice of abandonment.  This would be a variant on some of the pre-Act thinking to the effect that a valid notice of abandonment of itself achieves the transfer, without the need for acceptance.  Arnould’s view expressed at paragraph 30-09 is supported by dicta of Lord Atkin in <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v. Glen Line Limited</span> [1930] 37 Ll L Rep. 55 although the case is not cited in Arnould in this connection.  A British ship in port at Hamburg was seized by the German authorities on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of war.  Notice of abandonment was given in January 1915.  Notice of abandonment was accepted as at 4 August 1914 and on 9 February 1915 underwriters paid for a CTL.  After the war the vessel was recovered and sold and the owners accounted to insurers for the proceeds of sale, which as it happens exceeded the amount paid for the CTL by a factor of three.  The Crown’s claim to be entitled to participate in a subsequent recovery from the German Government made under the Treaty of Versailles to compensate the owners for their loss of profits consequent upon the seizure of the vessel was however resisted.  It was apparently pursued only by reference to section 63 of the Act – see per Lord Atkin at page 61.  After observing “that confusion is often caused by not distinguishing the legal rights given by abandonment (section 63) from the rights of subrogation (section 79) Lord Atkin continued: </p>

But he derives his right from the provisions of section 79, whereby he is subrogated to ‘all rights and remedies of the assured in and in respect of the subject-matter’, very different words from ‘all proprietary rights incidental thereto’.  And it is to be noted that in respect of abandonment the rights exist on a valid abandonment, whereas in respect of subrogation they only arise on payment; and that subrogation will only give the insurer rights up to 20 shillings in the pound on what he has paid.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the context Lord Atkin’s reference to “a valid abandonment” must I think be to an accepted abandonment.  He appears however clearly to envisage that the acquisition of proprietary rights under section 63 occurs independently of payment, payment being required only to generate rights of subrogation under section 79.  Moreover, the proprietary rights thus acquired would be the insured’s full interest in the ship.  If formalities such as registration are required to perfect transfer of title the transfer would at least be effective to create an equitable interest in the property and would entitle the insurer to require its formal transfer, where possible – see again Arnould paragraph 30-09.  Whilst any dicta of Lord Atkin are highly persuasive, I do not regard his analysis of when rights are acquired by acceptance of notice of abandonment as contributing to the ratio of the decision.  The case turned on the nature of the claim to compensation, which was not a proprietary right incidental to the ship.  The insurer could not rely on rights of subrogation since they had already, in the shape of the proceeds of sale, received more than they had paid out.  </p>

The legal concept is the cession of the ship to the insurer (see the dictum of Martin B in <span style="font-style:italic">Rankin v Potter</span> cited above and now sections 63 and 79 of the Act).  That cession occurs in both forms of total loss, actual as well as constructive (<span style="font-style:italic">Kaltenbach v. Mackenzie</span> [1878] 3 C.P.D. 467, see paragraph 58 above).  The cession, however, only occurs upon payment, and only if the underwriter is willing to accept the cession: for even in the case of an actual total loss, where the cession operates as a matter of law, the language of section 79(1) speaks of the insurer being ‘entitled’ to take over the interest of the assured: see <span style="font-style:italic">Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft Helvetia v. Administrator of German Property</span> [1931] 1 KB 672 at 687 to 688 per Lord Justice Scrutton.  In the case of a constructive total loss, because of the need for a notice of abandonment save in exceptional cases, the underwriter’s decision will effectively occur when he accepts, if he does, a notice of abandonment (see section 62(6)), but even so the abandonment only takes effect on payment.

He may already have made an irrevocable decision to take over the property if he has ‘accepted’ the assured’s notice of abandonment, but even then it is only on payment of the claim that the cession takes effect.  The offer which the assured makes when he elects to abandon is to transfer his interest upon payment.  If the underwriter accepts that offer, the transfer takes place when the claim is settled but the underwriter’s title as abandonee of the property vests retrospectively from the date of the casualty.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two points to note about the analysis of Rix LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Kastor Too</span>.  First, Mr Milligan suggests that he approaches the matter on the basis that acceptance of a notice of abandonment amounts also to an exercise of the election available under section 63(1).  Mr Milligan would prefer the analysis that acceptance of notice of abandonment does no more than is stated in section 62(6), i.e., it is an irrevocable admission of liability or a promise to pay for a CTL, and an irrevocable acceptance that the notice of abandonment is valid, but not an exercise of the separate right given by section 63(1).  Second, Rix LJ does not accept the analysis that cession of the assured’s interest in the property occurs upon acceptance of the notice of abandonment.  It occurs “only … on payment, and only if the underwriter is willing to accept the cession”.  If the insurers have before payment already accepted notice of abandonment then underwriters will have already irrevocably indicated their willingness to accept the cession, but even in such a case the cession [abandonment] takes effect only on payment, and is then retrospective to the time of the casualty.  This last proposition is said to flow from section 79(1).  It follows therefore that Rix LJ must have thought that the concluding words of section 79(1) “as from the time of the casualty causing the loss” apply equally to the cession of interest which is abandonment as to the acquisition of subrogated rights.  Even so, the insurer cannot of course on payment take over any interest greater than that which the insured then retains.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milligan contended that it was no necessary part of his thesis to suggest that on the first point Rix LJ was wrong, although he submitted that simply as a matter of analysis of the Act, he was.  On the second point, Mr Weitzman for his part preferred the analysis that cession occurs on acceptance of notice of abandonment.  However he made what he termed a concession that on the hypothesis, if I may respectfully so put it, that on the second point Rix LJ is right, that even after acceptance of notice of abandonment cession only occurs on payment, nonetheless in such circumstances equity would upon acceptance of notice of abandonment impose an equitable lien in favour of insurers.  That would arise because of the irrevocable promise to pay for a CTL and the irrevocable election to take over the interest of the assured in the wreck.  The equitable lien would secure insurers’ position in the interval between the making of their irrevocable promise and irrevocable election and the transfer of the right on payment, whether legal title or, pending the formalities of transfer of legal title, equitable title.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although couched as a concession, this approach of Mr Weitzman was of course beneficial to his clients’ overall position since it supports the notion that underwriters have it in their power to obtain a security interest in or over the vessel prior to payment of the claim.  Mr Milligan submitted that the “concession” was wrongly made.  He submitted that where notice of abandonment has been accepted but payment not yet made, the promise to pay is conditional on the right of election subsisting.  The promise to pay is conditional on the assured being in a position to tender the wreck against payment.  So, he submits, there is no lien because security is not required.  However I do not consider that this analysis is correct.  It flies in the face of section 62(6) of the Act.  Acceptance of the notice of abandonment conclusively admits liability for the loss – it is not a conditional admission.  Dealing with the wreck by the assured in a manner inconsistent with the interests of underwriters after acceptance of notice of abandonment may be unlikely but the present case demonstrates that in unusual circumstances that might occur.  It would not in my judgment disentitle the assured from recovering for a CTL, liability for that having already been conclusively admitted.  Underwriters do therefore in this situation require security, and in my view Mr Weitzman’s “concession” is rightly made.  It is accepted on all sides that payment for a CTL coupled with an express election to take over the interest of the assured in the vessel will be effective to transfer to insurers the assured’s legal or at least equitable title to the vessel.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

	      </authorialNote>  In those circumstances, the law would be seriously deficient if it did not provide to insurers upon their irrevocable promise to pay for a CTL and their irrevocable election to take over the interest of the assured in the wreck some form of security interest anticipating the crystallisation of their rights upon payment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The correctness or otherwise of Rix LJ on the first point is however of more importance to the overall analysis.  There is I think some force in Mr Milligan’s argument.  However, although important to the analysis, the practical significance of an accepted notice of abandonment is of course slight in modern conditions, since notice of abandonment is rarely if ever accepted.  It is rarely if ever accepted because underwriters believe that by acceptance of a notice of abandonment they will assume the burden of ownership.  That belief may be in part a throwback to the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the MIA 1906.  However if one asks what message would reasonably be conveyed to an assured in the unlikely event of their receiving from their underwriters an unqualified acceptance of notice of abandonment, it would I think be that insurers are irrevocably committing themselves to assume responsibility for the wreck.  There is also I think some support for that notion in section 62(6).  If acceptance of the notice of abandonment amounts to an unequivocal acceptance of liability to pay for a CTL, of what further interest is it that the insurers additionally and irrevocably accept the sufficiency of the notice unless they also intend to exercise their right to take over the interest of the assured in the vessel.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of these considerations, and on reflection, I am not sure that Mr Milligan is necessarily right to suggest that Rix LJ’s analysis is that by accepting notice of abandonment, the election under section 63(1) is thereby made.  That may be his analysis.  Equally however his analysis may be that acceptance of a notice of abandonment is properly to be understood as an irrevocable election to exercise the right which on the promised payment for a CTL will become available to the insurer by virtue of section 79(1).  Again I do not think it matters for present purposes which of these analyses is to be preferred.  On either view, what is demonstrated is that insurers have it within their power to create in their favour proprietary rights in the vessel either by acceptance of notice of abandonment or, if it is different, by irrevocable election to take over, on the promised payment for a CTL, the interest of the assured in the wreck.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This however leaves finally for consideration the case where notice of abandonment has been declined but, on subsequent payment for a CTL, underwriters say nothing which amounts either to express acceptance or to express disclaimer of a proprietary interest in the subject matter.  That is arguably this case, but subject to the important point reserved as to the effect of the endorsement on the claim settlement.  It is plain that the mere fact that underwriters decline notice of abandonment cannot without more in the ordinary way deprive underwriters of their right to take over the insured’s interest in the subject-matter insured, which right becomes available on payment for a CTL as a result of section 79(1).  It is common ground that in the present case underwriters had the right to elect under section 79(1), whatever had happened to their rights under section 63(1).  I need not therefore consider further whether declining notice of abandonment amounts to an irrevocable election by underwriters not to exercise their right under section 63(1), although I can see no reason why ordinarily it should.  The right to recover for a CTL is in these circumstances dependent on the assured’s continued willingness to cede its interest in the subject matter.  Dealing with its interest without reference to underwriters would be inconsistent therewith.  After notice of abandonment has been declined, a further future right of election is in any event potentially available under section 79(1) if the insurers in fact pay for a CTL.  It might be thought therefore that loss by underwriters of their right of election under section 63(1) is likely to be achieved only by express agreement or by the assured’s reliance upon a very clear representation disclaiming future exercise of the right.  Loss of the right under section 79(1) at any time prior to payment is an <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> case.  What is I think important for present purposes is simply to notice that after declining notice of abandonment underwriters will therefore ordinarily have a further opportunity prior to payment for a CTL to create in their favour a proprietary interest in the vessel.  That is because ordinarily, as I think, so long as the assured continues to press for payment for a CTL after underwriters have declined notice of abandonment, the assured impliedly repeat their offer to cede their interest to underwriters and it is open to underwriters to accept that offer, by acceptance of notice of abandonment, with the consequences which I have already described.  Mr Weitzman’s preferred analysis is that after declining notice of abandonment an insurer who changed his mind would then have to invite the insured to offer abandonment again.  An assured who refused that invitation would be acting inconsistent with its earlier abandonment – or perhaps with its continued request for payment for a CTL.  I prefer my own analysis, but both Mr Weitzman’s and my own achieve the same practical result.  </p>

The learned editors also point out that the insurer may settle the claim on a total loss basis without either expressly accepting or disclaiming a proprietary interest in the subject-matter, and suggest that in the latter event the insurer’s rights of election under both section 63(1) and 79(1) of the Act continue indefinitely.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This last passage again underscores the importance of determining what is meant by underwriters’ endorsement of the claim settlement.  I would however point out, I hope uncontroversially, that it is open to underwriters on payment for a CTL to claim their full proprietary interest in a vessel and thereby, subject to the problem of partial interests which I discuss below, to acquire the right to control or to dictate the sale thereof.  Underwriters have not I think as yet suggested that their endorsement had this effect.  I do not propose to anticipate the parties’ submissions in this regard.  However I must first establish and set out clearly the basis upon which I am proposing to address the Issues.  At this stage that must necessarily be that underwriters declined notice of abandonment in the conventional manner and subsequently paid for a CTL without either expressly accepting or disclaiming a proprietary interest in the subject-matter insured, by which for the avoidance of doubt I mean the wreck, not the proceeds of sale of the wreck.  It follows that the equitable lien under discussion in Issue 1 is a lien potentially unlimited in time, albeit Mr Milligan suggests that for practical purposes it would not in fact be likely to be enforceable indefinitely because equitable considerations would govern the question whether the court would grant relief by reference to it.  Against this background and on this basis I turn to the Issues posed.</p>

It exists independently of possession and, unlike a legal lien, which is effectively a negative right of retention, it confers positive rights enforceable by means of an order for sale.  It may also be enforced by injunction to prevent disposal of the property subject to it without satisfaction of the obligation, the performance of which it secures.  The right conferred is a proprietary right in the property which is the subject of the lien, which will not avail against a bona fide purchaser for value of a legal estate without notice of it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milligan submits that an equitable lien does so arise.  He suggests that the question can be tested by asking whether the assured would be free to dispose of the vessel after a total loss had been paid but before the underwriters had decided, or even had an opportunity to decide, whether to take her over.  The answer to that question he suggests is obviously not, and a court would enjoin the assured from doing so because it would be unconscionable, and unconscionability is the foundation of the equitable lien – see <span style="font-style:italic">Napier</span> at 738BC per Lord Templeman.  However I do not agree with Mr Milligan that the answer to his test question is so obvious as he suggests.  An underwriter who pays for a CTL has by definition had an opportunity to decide whether to take over the wreck.  Whether it would be unconscionable for an assured to sell the vessel without reference to underwriters must depend on the circumstances.  It would hardly be unconscionable if for example underwriters had been pressed for a decision for many months, had failed to come to a decision, and circumstances had arisen in which the assured were desirous of selling the vessel urgently in order to rid themselves of any further or potential liability for wreck removal, pollution etc.  I do not suggest that this is such a case.  Mr Milligan would say that in such circumstances the court would be unlikely to enjoin the assured from selling, so that the equitable lien would simply be ineffective.  However the existence of a lien could of itself hinder the assured’s ability to take steps to protect its own interests.  The lien in such circumstances will reserve to the insurers all the benefits which might flow from taking over the interest of the assured in the wreck whilst imposing none of the corresponding burdens of ownership.  The insurer is not ultimately entitled to the benefit without the burden, and it can secure the benefit if it wishes on payment for a CTL by electing to take over the wreck.  Indeed the insurers can secure the benefit at any time after payment for a CTL provided only that the insured has retained an interest.  It is not obvious to me that the situation under consideration is one in which equity will impose a lien in favour of insurers since they can so easily secure their position in the manner contemplated by the Act.  Indeed in the ordinary case where notice of abandonment has first been expressly declined and payment made subsequently for a CTL without ownership in the wreck being either expressly claimed or disclaimed, it would I think be arguably unconscionable that equity should impose a security interest over the vessel in favour of insurers.</p>

Rights of subrogation accrue automatically upon payment of an indemnity, as is reflected in section 79(1) of the Act.  It has long been established that the insurer has an enforceable equitable interest in the damages payable by the wrongdoer – the insured person is guilty of unconscionable conduct if he does not provide for the insurer to be recouped out of the damages awarded against the wrongdoer – see <span style="font-style:italic">Napier</span> at page 738 per Lord Templeman.  Equity imposes an equitable lien rather than a trust in recognition of the onerous duties cast upon trustees and because the function of the proprietary right is simply to protect the interest of the insurer in an asset only to the extent that its retention by the assured will have the effect that he is more than indemnified under the policy of insurance – see again <span style="font-style:italic">Napier</span> at page 738 per Lord Templeman and at page 745 per Lord Goff.  The House of Lords left open the question whether the equitable lien would attach also to the rights of action vested in the insured to recover from a third party.

IR 742 Lawrence Collins J had to address the question left open in <span style="font-style:italic">Napier</span>.  The case concerned an application by an insurer under section 181 of the Insolvency Act 1986 pursuant to which a person who claims an interest in disclaimed property may seek an order vesting that property in him as the person entitled thereto.  The liquidator of the insured Ballast, who before liquidation had been indemnified by St Paul, disclaimed a cause of action against a third party against whom Ballast arguably had a claim in contract which would have diminished the loss in respect of which Ballast had been indemnified.  Lawrence Collins J decided that St Paul’s right of subrogation conferred no proprietary interest in the cause of action as opposed to the proceeds of its successful exercise.  He gave six reasons for his conclusion.  First, the cause of action belongs beneficially and, unless assigned, at law to the assured.  Second, there are decisions the basis of which is inconsistent with the insurer [the text of the judgment says assured but plainly insurer is meant] having a proprietary right in the cause of action.  Third, although an insurer may compel the use of an assured’s cause of action against a third party, it is unable to compel the assured not to use those rights.  Fourth, an assured may compromise any claim he has against a third party in respect of his insured losses, and may do so without reference to the insurer and in such a way as validly to bind the insurer.  Fifth, an assured alone can give a valid receipt and discharge to a third party against whom a judgment has been given following a successful subrogated claim and sixth, the insurer may only recover up to what he has paid the assured.  I agree with Mr Milligan that none of those reasons is in itself necessarily inconsistent with the existence of an equitable lien over the cause of action.  The compromise and receipt points for example are not inconsistent with there being an equitable lien – a compromise could be reached with any third party acting in good faith without notice of insurers’ rights and the same is true of a valid receipt and discharge.  The purpose of an equitable lien would not be to enable the insurer to prevent the assured pursuing a cause of action but rather simply to enable the insurer to compel the assured to lend his name if the insurer wishes but the insured does not wish to pursue the cause of action.  At paragraph 108 of his judgment, page 756, Lawrence Collins J said this: </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… The argument for St Paul on this application was that St Paul claimed, and had, an interest in the claim because it was entitled to pursue the claim in Ballast’s name either with its consent, or if it did not consent, by seeking an order that its name be lent to the proceedings; and that St Paul had a proprietary interest, by way of a lien or charge, over the fruits of the claim and ‘possibly’ also in respect of the claim itself as a right of action.”</p>

Although not bound, I should be reluctant not to follow his lead.  </p>

Thompson</span> [1877-78] LR 3 App. Cas. 279 at 292-293.  Even if that were the principle so far as concerns subrogated rights, it would not be conclusive of the point which I have to decide, since the acquisition of subrogated rights is automatic, whereas the assumption of interest under section 79(1) is dependent upon election.  Still less however does the absence of an equitable lien over subrogated causes of action compel me to the conclusion that an equitable lien is similarly absent in the situation under consideration. </p>

As I have already mentioned I have not heard argument on the question what is the legal analysis which leads to insurers’ entitlement either to the market value of the vessel or to the proceeds of sale.  In the absence of full argument I would certainly not wish to rule on the question whether entitlement to the sale proceeds derives from rights of subrogation.  I cannot therefore agree with Mr Milligan that Mr Weitzman’s concession is necessarily inconsistent with his denial of the existence of an equitable lien over the vessel itself.  Furthermore, without deciding the point, even if the sale proceeds do not represent a recovery to the benefit of which insurers are subrogated, still I see great attraction in the notion that the sale proceeds should in a situation such as the present be impressed with an equitable lien in favour of insurers by analogy with the position as to subrogated recoveries.  The analogy is I think quite compelling.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not however regard as compelling any analogy between a cause of action to which insurers are subrogated and a right which they can elect to exercise but which on this hypothesis they have not elected to exercise.  Furthermore for the reasons which I have already given I regard the underwriters as having once expressly declined to exercise their right or, if not the same right, a right to similar effect.  Whilst that does not preclude later exercise of the same right, or a right to similar effect, it is nonetheless a consideration which cannot be ignored when one is enquiring where the equities lie.  My conclusion is that equity does not in this situation impose an equitable lien.  Equity will secure the position of an insurer who exercises his election to take over the vessel in the manner which I have already described.  After payment for a CTL the obligation upon an insured to cede to underwriters his interest in the wreck is contingent upon underwriters agreeing to assume the heavy burdens of ownership to which the insured is immediately exposed.  I can see no reason why equity should intervene to secure insurers’ position whilst they take further time to decide whether they wish to assume those burdens.  Furthermore, whilst it is a small point, I note that the Act does not provide that an insured who is paid for a CTL must not dispose of his interest in the subject matter insured without underwriters’ consent.  The suggested equitable lien would I think achieve that result.  The lien would impose a significant obligation on the assured which is not to be found in the Act and which is unnecessary to the efficacy of the regime prescribed by the Act.  The point can of course be dealt with by express agreement between assured and insurers, as no doubt generally it is.  However on the basis upon which I am obliged to approach the question and in the light of the agreed Statement of Facts alone, the answer to Issue 1 is in my judgment “no”.  </p>

Independently of that Mr Milligan suggested that even if no equitable lien was obtained by payment for the CTL, it would be unconscionable for the assured to retain the benefit constituted by the preservation of the value of the vessel by salvage and, I think, the discharge of the salvors’ lien.  Mr Milligan says that this raises an issue of double counting.  Not only has the assured been paid for the vessel in the form of the payment for the CTL, so too he retains a vessel which has been “improved” by virtue of the payment for the salvage and he is keeping the benefit of the improvement as well without paying for it.  However I see nothing unconscionable in this result.  It is simply the consequence of (a) the insurers not electing to take over the wreck and (b) it being an incident of the policy that the underwriters are obliged to pay for salvage.  In my view this argument adds nothing to the argument under Issue 1.  Subject to the point reserved about a maritime lien, the answer to Issue 3 is “no”.  </p>

The question whether the election is “effective” can only be answered by reference to the rights thereby acquired and the remedies available to enforce them.  Here a difficulty arose because at the hearing Mr Milligan proffered an analysis which led to the conclusion that upon deletion of the vessel from the Dutch registry those insurers who had elected in December 2008 to take her over became together with the First Defendant co-owners of the vessel as tenants in common at law, there no longer being any requirement for registration to achieve that result.  Before de-registration, Mr Milligan submits, the assured as registered owners would hold the ship on trust for themselves and for those insurers who had elected to take over the vessel in their respective proportions.  Issue 5 is framed in terms only of the acquisition of equitable interests, and I am invited therefore at this stage not to come to any conclusion as to the acquisition of a legal interest.  </p>

He submits that in a subscription market such as the present this requires all subscribing insurers to make the election.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This argument is I think misconceived.  It ignores the fact that each insurer has a separate contract with the insured and that it is with the incidents of each individual contract of insurance that the Act is concerned.  I agree with Mr Milligan that as a matter of principle it is irrelevant to the rights of one insurer what another insurer decides to do.  I also agree with Mr Milligan that the opening phrases of section 79(1) of the Act simply identify what it is that has been paid for, either a ship as a single entity or goods which may be divisible.  Provided that any one underwriter has paid his proportion of a total loss of the ship, or his proportion of a total loss of an apportionable part of or of the whole of the goods, he has a right of election.  It is obvious that the process of abandonment must be available, pro tanto, if the insurance extends only to a proportion of the value of the thing insured.  Furthermore, even where the insurance is as to 100% of the value, the process must likewise be available if a proportion, perhaps a small proportion, of the market declines or is unable to follow the lead.  On Mr Weitzman’s case an insolvency of insurers representing 2% of the cover would prevent the remaining 98% from electing to take over the interest of the assured in what remains of the subject matter insured.  That would be absurd – but it is in any event contrary to principle to fail to address the position of each insurer separately and for his own account.  The only question therefore is how is effect given to an election.  In every case in which there is more than one subscribing underwriter the election by any one underwriter will inevitably be effective only as to a proportion of the assured’s interest in the subject matter insured.  The assured for his part must be prepared to cede his whole interest in the thing insured, as far as that interest is covered by the policy – see Arnould paragraph 30-08.  An abandonment cannot however extend further than the interest that is covered – see again Arnould paragraph 30-09.  In principle therefore partial insurance and non-insured retention throw up precisely the same problem as partial election.  The relative dearth of cases in which the point has been discussed would seem to indicate that it seldom gives rise to any practical difficulty.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with Mr Milligan’s analysis that the electing underwriters simply become co-owners of the vessel together with the assured in their respective proportions.  As it happens in the present case there was no deductible in the event of a total loss, possibly for the very reason under discussion, i.e. to simplify the process of abandonment – see in that connection Arnould paragraph 30-11 at footnote 56 at which it is said that “it should be noted that the standard deductible clauses in hull and machinery policies do not apply in cases of total loss”.  The point was discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">The Commonwealth</span> [1907] P 216 where at 222 Sir Gorell Barnes P with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed approved a passage in the then current edition of Arnould, the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, to the following effect: </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“It appears equally clear that where a ship is only partially insured, so that her owners remain to some extent ‘their own underwriters’, the effect of a notice of abandonment will be to make the owners and the underwriters joint tenants of the property, in the proportion which the amount uninsured bears to the insured.”</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">If the position were otherwise, the rights discussed in sections 63(1) and 79(1) of the Act would be completely unavailable in cases where there is partial insurance or a self-insured retention.  That situation no more defeats operation of the principle of abandonment than does the failure by some subscribing underwriters to exercise their rights of election.  Interestingly, as Mr Milligan points out, <span style="font-style:italic">Whitworth v. Shepherd</span> [1884] 12 Ct. of Sess. Cas. (4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>) 204 on which he relies in this context is cited in Chalmers only in relation to section 81 of the Act, which provides that where an assured is insured for an amount less than the insurable value, or, in the case of a valued policy, for an amount less than the policy valuation, he is deemed to be his own insurer in respect of the uninsured balance.  Yet <span style="font-style:italic">Whitworth</span> was a case concerned with partial election by underwriters, those representing only a small proportion, £500, of the full insured value, £9,000, paying for a CTL whilst those representing the balance successfully defeated the claim for a CTL and in consequence paid only for a partial loss.  The Lord Ordinary, Lord McLaren, at 207 proceeded upon the basis that the underwriters who paid for a CTL accepted the abandonment – at one point in his judgment he seems to espouse the pre-Act theory that cession of interest is automatic upon payment for a total loss – see at 206.  However this is of no consequence so far as concerns his analysis of the manner in which the right which accrued to underwriters on payment could be given effect.  He held that their right was to require the owners to execute a transfer to them which would enable them to be registered as owners to the extent of the interest which they had acquired in the vessel by abandonment.  In fact the underwriters concerned had been dilatory in attempting to enforce their right, allowing two years to pass during which time the assured mortgaged the vessel for £13,000, which exceeded her value.  In the event therefore the insurers were awarded the value of their interest in the ship before it was encumbered.  The judge found that £9,000 represented the real value of the ship when insured and that the damage by stranding in consequence of which these underwriters had settled for a CTL was a 20% depreciation in her value.  The underwriters were therefore awarded £400.  Arnould, at paragraph 30-11, casts no doubt upon the correctness of this approach, expressing only a doubt how the legal title to a British ship could appropriately be transferred, legal ownership of such a vessel being permitted only in sixty-fourth shares.  I referred to this problem in paragraph 41 above at footnote 4.  I agree with Mr Milligan that in principle the insurers must be entitled to have the appropriate number of whole one sixty-fourth shares transferred to them to be registered in their name.  Any remaining part one sixty-fourth share would be held on trust by the owners for themselves and the insurers in their respective proportions.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Whitworth</span> the insurers had not yet been registered as owners.  Consequently their interest in the vessel was equitable only, although not expressly so found.  The mortgagee was, presumably, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the insurers’ interest and therefore took the mortgage free of that interest.  </p>

The subsequent election by the remaining underwriters would on these assumptions be ineffective, since the assured would at the time of the election have no interest in the wreck which could be ceded or assumed.  In the event that prior to the purported sale those underwriters who had elected in December 2008 became legal as opposed to beneficial co-owners of the vessel as tenants in common at law, they would as a matter of English law remain legal co-owners after the purported sale, there being no relevant exception to the principle <span style="font-style:italic">nemo dat quod non habet</span>.  In the event that the Fourth Defendant is not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the Claimant’s equitable interest as co-owners in equity, those interests would survive the purported sale.

Even if relief under that section is available only to owners at law, equity would treat as done that which ought to be done, i.e. the transfer of legal title.  However the effect of my conclusions thus far is that the insurers collectively had a clear majority interest falling short of 100%.  The question is how on that assumption they could achieve the sale of the vessel.  On this footing the First Defendant prior to the purported transfer and the Fourth Defendant subsequent thereto would have a minority beneficial interest in the vessel.  </p>

At paragraph 30-09 the editors speak of the creation of an equitable interest in the property entitling the insurer to require its formal (i.e. legal) transfer <span style="text-decoration:underline">where possible</span> (my emphasis).  In paragraph 30-11 the editors say of insurers like those who paid for a CTL in <span style="font-style:italic">Whitworth v. Shepherd</span> (who they describe as having accepted notice of abandonment) that it would seem that they become “in some way interested as owners of the vessel in the proportion which the amount subscribed by them bears to her full value”, but that “it is not clear what their exact legal position in such a case would be”.  I have already indicated my agreement with Mr Milligan’s analysis of the situation but that leaves open the question how practically the insurers can compel the transfer to them of the relevant proportion of the legal title.

Footnote 51 to paragraph 30-09 in Arnould suggests that “it would … seem to be implicit in the agreement concluded by the acceptance of notice of abandonment that the assured must co-operate in enabling the transfer to be effected, if required.  The Merchant Shipping Act 1995 section 16 preserves the position that interests arising under contract or other equitable interests in a British ship may be enforced in the same manner as in respect of any other personal property”.  Here of course notice of abandonment was not accepted, but it may be that, absent countervailing express terms, payment for a CTL and express acceptance of notice of abandonment at that stage or an express election under section 79(1) carries with it some similar implication.  Any argument along these lines might assist underwriters as against the assured but would possibly not assist directly as against the Fourth Defendant.  </p>

That would also meet Mr Gaisman’s point that trusteeship may bring with it practical issues and responsibilities which are inappropriate to the commercial relationship under discussion – see also per Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Napier v.

The owners in the latter case had succeeded in a claim against hull underwriters for a CTL as a result of which they had to account to the hull underwriters for freight earned on the voyage.  The owners then sought to recover the freight from separate freight insurers and failed.

I have already concluded that upon acceptance of notice of abandonment he would acquire an equitable lien.  On payment for a CTL he would on the conventional analysis acquire equitable ownership in the appropriate proportion.  Unless the equitable lien and the equitable ownership can co-exist, the underwriter faces the prospect that he is in a less advantageous position after payment for a CTL than that which he enjoyed before payment.  This too may be a pointer to the need to reconsider the conventional analysis.  All these are considerations for another day.  </p>

That is the effect of Dicey, Morris and Collins, Rule 124, set out above.  However there is disagreement as to what is meant in this context by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span>.

The Defendants say that reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> in this context is simply to the domestic law of the situs.  I am asked to resolve this question as to the applicability of the doctrine of renvoi in the abstract without reference to the content of whatever is the relevant <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span>, of which there may be more than one, and without reference therefore to the question whether the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span>, in fact, has any relevant conflicts rules, and, if so, what they are.  This may be an unsatisfactory approach.  Professor Adrian Briggs, in a vigorous contribution to the debate in [2007] BYIL 626 (Decisions of the British Courts in 2007) suggests, at page 629, that the English court should ask itself whether the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> rule, which English private international law seeks to apply, is more faithfully given effect by referring to the domestic law of the situs or to the private international law of the situs.  Without knowing the content of either, indeed without at this stage identifying the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> at all, that enquiry can only be undertaken in a limited fashion.

The passage in question follows a paragraph, paragraph 4-024, in which it is suggested that, so far as concerns the question of title to land, there is a relatively strong case for the application of the doctrine of renvoi since in the last resort land can only be dealt with in a manner which will actually be permitted by the courts of the country in which the land is situate.

An international trading vessel can confidently be expected to be taken out of the jurisdiction of the courts of the territory where the relevant disposition took place.  Similarly however the practical control capable of exercise over a ship by the courts of the place of registry may be non-existent, so that the argument from practical control does not assist in determining, as I must under Issue 9, whether the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> is the law of the flag.  </p>

There is no authority on the question, but in my judgment the question should be answered in the negative.  The doctrine has most frequently be applied in the field of succession.  Outside that field it seems that it has been applied only to legitimation by subsequent marriage.  It has not been applied in contract or other commercial situations.  It has often been criticised, and it is probably right to describe is as largely discredited.

A decision by an English court, based on English principles of conflict of laws, that the question should be determined by the application of the rules of a foreign law is also based on considerations of legal policy, albeit at a higher level of abstraction.  It involves a policy decision, at the higher level, that the policy which has been adopted, at the lower level, by English law should not be applied because the considerations which led to its adoption in the domestic law are not relevant in the particular circumstances of the case; and to a policy decision, at a higher level, that the policy which has been adopted, at the lower level, by the foreign law should be applied in its stead.  In my judgment there is or ought to be no scope for the doctrine of renvoi in determining a question of priority between competing claims to shares, and in the absence of authority which compels me to do so – and there is none – I am not willing to extend it to such a question. </p>

That case was concerned with title to a fragment of an ancient limestone relief taken from Persepolis.  The fragment was bought by the Defendant, a French national, in public auction at New York and, according to French law, her title had been perfected on delivery of the fragment to her in Paris following her purchase.  Over 30 years later the Defendant delivered the fragment to Christie’s in London for the purpose of it being again sold at auction.  The Republic of Iran came to hear of its whereabouts and asserted its title in the English court.  It was accepted that title had once vested in the state of Iran – the question was whether the Defendant could rely upon a title acquired in good faith by delivery to her in France consequent upon her purchase which, it was held, would be recognised as a matter of substantive French law as the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> of the fragment when the disputed title was obtained.  The Republic argued that application of the French conflict rules would bring into play an exception to the traditional French rule and application of the law of Iran as the law of the state of origin of the fragment.  Eady J followed Millett J’s approach.  He saw no principled reason to draw a distinction for this purpose between the context of title to shares and the context of title to a tangible moveable object.  He saw no reason “to hold, for the first time, that public policy requires English law to introduce the notion of renvoi into the determination of title to moveables”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">A Chinese court would undoubtedly have applied Australian law to determine the rights and obligations of the plaintiff and the defendant, both Australian “nationals” and domiciled in Australia.  The High Court of Australia held that, at least where the choice of law rules of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span> depended upon a connecting factor other than place, such as nationality or domicile, the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span> was the whole of the law of the foreign jurisdiction.  The <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span> included Article 146.  The defendants, who under domestic Chinese law could have relied upon a one year limitation period, contended for a general “no renvoi” principle.  Heydon J, at page 418, said that it would be absurd that the regime which the Chinese government enacted for incidents causing injuries of the type which the plaintiff suffered should be set at nought by reason of Australian law, as it would be if the supposed “no renvoi” principle existed.  There is, if I may respectfully say so, great force in that observation.  However the decision of the High Court of Australia does not accord with the law of England, whether as provided by statute in various contexts other than that with which I am presently concerned or at common law as it has so far been declared to be by courts of first instance.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This notwithstanding, I draw back from giving a definitive answer to the question whether reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> in this context includes or excludes reference to the private international law rules, if any, of that system of law.  In the light of the illuminating discussion of the point in the High Court of Australia, it would I think be unwise so to do.  If the rationale of the English <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> rule is a policy decision by English law that the policy adopted by the foreign law should prevail, so then in any given case it would in my judgment be unwise to describe in advance that part of the foreign law which is to be applied, because in so doing the English court may adopt distinctions or characterisations unknown to the relevant foreign law.  Put differently, one should not answer the question in advance in such a manner as may, inadvertently, preclude application of the policy adopted by the foreign law.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Neilson</span> Heydon J concluded his judgment by pointing out, at page 421, that the result in that case turned on the specific content of Chinese legislation, not on the wider principles that each of the parties to the appeal advocated.  It is for these reasons that I do not consider it appropriate or sensible to give a definitive answer to Issue 8 without first examining the specific content of whatever system or systems of law may prove to be applicable in the light of the answer to Issue 9.  A further reason for caution in this case is my belief that in relation to the question of legal or registered title to a merchant vessel, many legal systems might well by reference to what we would perhaps characterise as a conflicts rule look to the law of the place of registration.  My provisional answer to Issue 8 is therefore the domestic law of the situs, but English law has not in my judgment crystallized to the point where a different answer is simply impermissible.  I cannot rule out that, paraphrasing what is said in Dicey at paragraph 4-023, the object of the English conflict rule in referring to a foreign law will on balance be better served by construing the reference to include what to English eyes are the conflict rules of that law but which may do no more than reflect the policy which has been adopted “at the lower level” as appropriate by the foreign law.

Where, however, a vessel is within territorial or national waters the reasons for ascribing her a situs at her port of registry are not compelling, and the artificial situs is displaced by the actual situs.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Only two authorities are said by Dicey to support the propositions stated in the text for, respectively, ships and aircraft.  For ships the authority is one concerned with estate duty, <span style="font-style:italic">Trustees Executors and Agency Co Limited v. IRC, </span>[1973] Ch 254.  A testator died domiciled in Australia.  He owned a yacht, “Natalie”, registered in Jersey but usually berthed at Southampton when not in use.  It would seem that he used the yacht for only about two months of each year so that the vessel was for about ten months of the year berthed at Southampton.  After his death the executors sold the yacht for £40,000.  The proceeds of sale were subject to estate duty unless at the date of death the yacht was “situate out of Great Britain”.  At the date of death the yacht was berthed at Southampton.  Pennycuick VC pointed out that unlike shares in a company, to which an artificial local situation has to be attributed, a ship does not, for the general purposes of the law, possess an artificial local situation, e.g. a situation dependent upon its port of registry.  Thus a ship locally situate in England is treated for the purposes of the general law as being in England.  Pennycuick VC cited a passage from Dicey &amp; Morris, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition, 1967 which is in almost identical language to that from paragraph 22-058 of the current edition which I have set out above, save that whereas in the current edition it is stated that when the vessel is within territorial or national waters the artificial situs <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> displaced by the actual situs, in the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition it was said that in such a situation “it would seem” that the artificial situs is displaced by the actual situs.  Pennycuick VC expressed his agreement with the statement in the text which he paraphrased as meaning that so far as a ship registered abroad and locally situate here is concerned, the artificial situs <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> displaced by the actual situs.  Pennycuick VC also discounted as unhelpful a dictum from Lord Wright in <span style="font-style:italic">Compania Naviera Vascongada v. SS Cristina</span> [1938] AC 485.  That case was concerned with the efficacy of the requisition of a Spanish registered vessel by the Spanish State.  Her owners attempted to arrest her at Cardiff.  The arrest was not permitted as it would amount to impleading a foreign sovereign state without its consent, which was not then ordinarily permissible.  It was in that context that Lord Wright said, at page 509: </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">Of that observation Pennycuick VC remarked that it “does not go very far”.  That is no doubt true.  On the other hand Lord Wright’s observation does reflect the significance traditionally attached to the circumstance that a ship has a recognisable nationality, whereas most ordinary chattels do not.  The same is probably also true of aircraft, although their place of registration may not perhaps be so prominently displayed or so readily recognisable except by the cognoscenti.  The reasoning in the <span style="font-style:italic">Trustees Agency</span> case, unsurprisingly, has no real relevance to the question by what system of law a transfer of title to a ship should be regarded as governed, and indeed Pennycuick VC regarded as unhelpful authorities establishing that the purchaser of a ship acquires ownership irrespective of registration although title might require perfection by registration.  Furthermore, whilst being cited in Dicey as support for the statement in the text in which the tentative “it would seem” has now been replaced by the positive “is”, Pennycuick VC did not for his part explain why the reasons for ascribing to a vessel a situs at her port of registry are less compelling when the vessel is in another port.  </p>

An American registered ship was sold in England.  The vessel was subject to two mortgages which were duly registered in the US Registry but notice of neither mortgage was endorsed on the certificate of registry.  The purchaser in good faith had no notice of the mortgages.  The shipbuilders who in fact sold the ship received the sale proceeds and became insolvent before discharging the mortgages.  The mortgagees attempted to assert their title as against the purchaser in the English court, but failed as they were found deliberately to have suppressed notice of the mortgages so as to facilitate sale and moreover to have constituted the shipbuilder their agent to conclude the sale.  The Court of Appeal held that the law of England governed the effect of the sale but that the question whether the mortgagees could establish legal title to the ship fell to be determined by American law.  It is not altogether clear whether American law was regarded as relevant for that purpose because it was the place of registry or because the vessel was physically situate in the USA when the mortgages were executed.  Lord Chelmsford LC says simply that the mortgagees’ legal title to the ship “would, of course, be determined by American law”.  Turner LJ however said, at page 290: </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">It would seem that the position in Australia is the same – see <span style="font-style:italic">Tisand</span> at paragraph 158, where the relevant provisions of the Australian Shipping Registration Act are set out.  There is no evidence before me as to the position in other jurisdictions although I suspect that ship registries generally deal only with legal title and not with other proprietary interests.  Indeed as Robert Goff J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">1 Congreso del Partido</span> [1978] QB 500 at 541 the special English institution of the trust and hence the dichotomy between legal and equitable ownership may form no part of the domestic law of many of the maritime states who are signatories to the Arrest Convention 1952.  It follows that reference to the law of the place of registration has in this context no particular logical virtue, notwithstanding that it is natural that it is to the ship’s register that those who are interested first look, whether they be prospective purchasers, potential mortgagees, or insurers.  They are likely to find there no trace of proprietary or equitable interests short of legal title.  </p>

The ship was registered in Liberia at the date of arrest although her new beneficial owner who had recently purchased her had applied for provisional registration in Hong Kong.  At the time of the transaction pursuant to which the purchaser acquired the beneficial interest the ship had been in Brisbane where delivery was effected pursuant to the bill of sale.  The Full Court determined that the existence, nature and extent of the rights created or recognised by the sale and transfer of the ship was governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span>.  They then turned to consider what was the situs of the vessel at the relevant date.  As it happens, the choice was academic, since no evidence of foreign law had been adduced.  The court therefore expressed no concluded view – see paragraph 148.  The court nonetheless made the following observations: </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.42in;text-indent:-0.42in">“146.<marker name="tab"/>There seem to us to be powerful reasons for giving effect to the law of the country of register as the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> in relation to questions of title, property and assignment (subject, of course, to local statute and public policy).  The chance location of a working merchant ship in a port within its range of sailing or on the high seas appears to introduce an element of arbitrariness to the legal analysis.  This is especially so if, as is likely, the national register and registration laws of the port in question are directed to ships of that country.  If a law of a country other than the country of registration is chosen to deal with the assignment of property in a ship, it is likely that there will be no statute dealing with registration that is made relevant.  </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.42in;text-indent:0.5in">… Given the importance of the register in the workings of international maritime law and commerce and the importance of the law of the flag state in many contexts, it would be odd to decline to give effect to a statute of the flag state governing the transfer, or not, of rights created or recognised by the statute of that country.  Particularly for reasons of clarity and certainty in commercial dealings and conformity with notions of ship nationality, there is much to be said for regarding the situs of a merchant ship as its country of registry.  These circumstances also commend the relevance and admissibility of evidence of the law of the flag state as to the role and effect of the register, in particular whether it gives title or rights by the fact of registration or merely acts as a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> record of such matters, and what recognition it gives to rights created by transactions dealing with the ship before registration.  One is assisted to these views by the recognition of the fact that, if Australian law governs the questions solely, as the law of the forum, or the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> of the ship at the time of delivery, the question of who was ‘the owner’ in the proprietary sense would be determined without regard to any statute dealing with registration and its legal consequences.  The Shipping Registration Act would be irrelevant because it only deals with Australian-owned ships.  It would be similarly anomalous if the law of the country of domicile of the buyer or seller dealing with the registration of ships (if that were not the flag state’s law) were treated as relevant to the ascertainment of rights passing or created in a transaction by way of assignment.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milligan rightly points out that in terms of practical considerations there is little to distinguish a ship’s register from a share register.  Adoption of the place where the register of shares in a company is kept as the situs of the shares would have afforded a simple answer to the question debated at such length by Millett J and by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan v. Bishopsgate</span>.  The reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan</span> cannot of course be understood without paying careful attention to the characterisation of the issue to which it was directed.  Thus if transfer of shares may be effected only by registration on a particular register, the shares must inevitably be regarded as situate at the place where the register is kept for the purpose of ascertaining the efficacy of any purported transfer.  However for the purpose of ascertaining the priority of competing proprietary or security interests falling short of registered ownership, only Auld LJ in the Court of Appeal seemed to regard the law of the place where the register is kept as significant – see [1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411E.  In that case however the place of incorporation, the place where the share certificates were at the time of the relevant transactions and the place where the share register was kept were all the same, New York, so the point did not need to be decided.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand adoption of a rule whereby the <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> of a registered ship (or indeed aircraft) is always regarded as the law of the place of registration would create an additional exception to the general rule that issues as to rights of property are determined by the law of the place where the property actually is, both in relation to land and in relation to chattels – see per Staughton LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Macmillan</span> at page 399G.  I am not bound by authority to recognise such an exception.  Except in relation to registered legal title, the register itself will probably usually be uninformative.  Moreover the place of registration will often have no connection whatever with the ownership, financing, management and insurance of the vessel.  The place of registration is in this sense often a most artificial situs.  It seems to me likely that, so far as concerns questions of legal title, most systems of law would inevitably, in consequence of their own conflict rule, look to the law of the place of registration.  Since however the register would not ordinarily be concerned with interests falling short of legal ownership, I can see no compelling reason for regarding the law determining the incidence of such rights as being the law of the place of registration as opposed to the physical situs of the vessel at the time when such rights are created.  That being so, I can see no justification for creating an exception, or a further exception, to the general rule.  It is also comforting to reach the same conclusion as the learned editors of Dicey, Morris and Collins.  The answer to question 9 is thus Thai law.  </p>
