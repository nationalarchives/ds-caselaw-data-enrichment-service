	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This action arises out of a collision which occurred in September 2007 in the Gulf of Mexico. The losses sustained by the claimants are very substantial, said to be in the region of $25 million.  Further it raises some interesting and novel issues. These issues have emerged despite the fact that there is a photographic record of the radar picture (including AIS data) on one of the vessels and there is an audio recording on the bridge of that vessel which includes all the VHF exchanges with the other vessels in the vicinity.</p>

She is some 8,369 tons gross and 2,511 tons net. She is registered in Panama. She is powered by two Bergen diesel engines developing a total of 10,810 b.h.p. She is manned by a crew of 57 hands all told, most of whom worked in the survey departments. It is of passing interest that the crew was made up of 22 nationalities with English as a common language. </p>

Surveying is carried out by sending sound waves generated by compressed air released from the arrays and recorded by the hydrophones in the streamers. At the time of the collision WESTERN NEPTUNE was carrying out a wide azimuth survey of the Green Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico about 150 miles south of New Orleans. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For this purpose she was towing a spread of ten streamers and six gun arrays (“the array”). Each streamer extended for about 8,030 metres (4.34 miles) astern of the vessel. With each of the streamers maintained about 120 metres apart the total width of the spread was some 1,080 metres.  They were being towed at a depth of 12 metres.  Almost the entirety of this array was cut in two or otherwise damaged when the defendants’ vessel ST LOUIS EXPRESS crossed about 4 miles astern of WESTERN NEPTUNE, giving rise to this substantial claim.</p>

At the material time WESTERN NEPTUNE was on a South Westerly leg.  The survey speed was maintained at about 4 to 5 knots.  WESTERN NEPTUNE was supported by three other vessels. Two, OCEAN ODESSEY and GECO TAU, were also towing gun arrays and were positioned off the port side of WESTERN NEPTUNE, the three vessels being interspaced by 1200m and proceeding on the same course and speed.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third vessel was positioned between one and three miles ahead of WESTERN NEPTUNE.  It was a ‘chase’ boat called FURORE.  Its main function was to “chase” vessels such as fishing craft which presented a potential hazard ahead of the seismic convoy.  It also acted as a “guard” vessel for the convoy by contacting approaching vessels on VHF channel 16 on behalf of WESTERN NEPTUNE.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">FURORE was an offshore support vessel (converted from a fishing vessel) of 235 tons gross and 70 tons net, some 34.7 metres in length and 7.5 metres in beam.  She was powered by diesel engines of 1,235 bhp giving a maximum speed of 12 knots.  She was equipped with three VHF units, an electronic chart display and two radars interfaced with AIS.  FURORE was usually accompanied by a second chase or guard boat TORSVIK.  However, on the day of the collision TORSVIK was unavailable as she was effecting a crew change ashore.  For reasons which were not revealed, she was not replaced.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as lights were concerned the position was as follows. WESTERN NEPTUNE was exhibiting normal navigation lights and a towing light above the stern light. However she was restricted in her ability to manoeuvre. Indeed she could scarcely make any material alteration in course or speed.  For instance an alteration of course of 180 deg whilst maintaining the array would take several hours.  Any material increase in speed would risk damaging the array: a significant reduction would risk the sinking of the array.  Thus, in accord with Rule 27(b) of the Collision Regulations, she was exhibiting three all round lights, the highest and lowest being red and the middle white.</p>

Given the length of the tow and the lack of manoeuvrability this proposed exclusion zone was understandable and legitimate.  Nevertheless the implications were quite far reaching.

The height of this shape was probably only a foot or 18 inches.  I assume that the buoys could not support diamond shapes of the prescribed size.  Certainly the buoys and their shapes would not be readily visible from WESTERN NEPTUNE, even less so in any sea. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In one sense the short answer may be that it was impractical to exhibit the prescribed shapes.  But this imports the obligation to take all possible measures to “indicate the presence” of the object: Rule 24 (h).  Since the collision took place at night the issue was not of course considered.  But the arrangements have to provide a seamless transition from night time to daylight and vice versa.  It does strike me (and the Elder Brethren agree) that these considerations in regard to the position in daylight and at twilight do much to support the need for a second guard boat.  But the point need not be taken any further at this stage.</p>

Whether a separate streamer designed to carry lights at reasonable intervals (even if much more than 100 metres) was wholly impractical is somewhat surprising, although it would no doubt be costly and inconvenient.

The explanation proffered for selecting continuous flashing as opposed to “U” flashes was concern that confusion might arise given that the many oil rigs in the vicinity were equipped with lights flashing “U”.

This is an important precaution because taken in isolation the lights on the tail buoys would give no information as to which side vessels should pass. But, as the recommendation states, the combination of flashing lights at each end of the array should make it clear on which side the danger lay.  But given the scale of the tow, this suggestion may not be valid.  It is all dependent on the visibility of the lights.  The minimum is 3 miles but that would be of limited value with a length of over 4 miles.</p>

In these circumstances there must be doubt whether the lights on them were seen at all before collision or at least until a very late stage. </p>

Nonetheless the information from the VHF exchanges and the AIS system was more than adequate to demonstrate that the lights were at the aft end of the tow and should be left to port.  </p>

In fact these were not picked up as echoes on the radar of ST LOUIS EXPRESS. They were no doubt effective in suitable conditions although somewhat less effective in a seaway.  In any event the likely explanation for the absence of any visible echo is that there had been over-adjustment of the anti-clutter controls whereby these weaker targets were erased. This explanation is the more likely given the identification of “heavy rain in the Northern Sector of the radar”.</p>

It is of course possible that the USCG would have adopted a similar policy to the MCA. In my judgment (in accordance with the advice of the Elder Brethren) if an application was required it ought to have been made.  It is at least possible that the US Administration would have permitted the use of transponders on the WESTERN NEPTUNE array if an application had been made.  If installed vessels approaching the convoy would have identified a strikingly long straight line echo proceeding at the same speed and on the same course as the other echoes.</p>

There was a need to interrogate AIS to establish the identity and relative positions of the four vessels in the convoy. In this context it may be of some note that, at the time of the collision between ST LOUIS EXPRESS and the array, WESTERN NEPTUNE was distant 4.22 miles (and thus inside the exclusion zone measured from her) but FURORE was distant 6.49 miles (and thus outside the exclusion zone measured from her). It would be entirely speculative to suggest that the third officer had regard to the CPA from the wrong vessel.

No references were made by or to him after the event as regards to the required lateral distance of three miles.

In fact encroachment into the zone would have been substantial had she remained on 333 degrees as from 0230.  Clearance was not achieved even after ST LOUIS EXPRESS came onto 347 degrees as from 0241.  On that course she would have “clipped” the limit of the zone on WESTERN NEPTUNE’s port quarter.

All appropriate means should have been adopted including the use of VHF, lights and flares. In fact it seems probable that a VHF call would have been sufficient to result in an alteration to starboard on ST LOUIS EXPRESS’s part. An added sensible step would have been to use the searchlight both to attract attention and to try and light up the buoys.  The range between the vessels probably militated against effective use of sound signals.  All this again identifies the desirability of a second guard boat.</p>

Allowing for a reasonable period for decision making the overall period for such an operation would have been little more than about 6 minutes.  Subject to the precise position of the initial contact, the outcome of such an operation would have furnished a substantial margin of safety given ST LOUIS EXPRESS’s draft. With reference to Rule 17 the defendants contend that this was a step that should have been taken.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Was such an operation called for?  It is notable that the initial reaction of the master of WESTERN NEPTUNE on being called to the bridge after the collision was to ask if the streamers had been dived. Furthermore, in response, the officer of the watch told the master “we are trying”.  This was not true but it pointed to the correct reaction to the situation of danger that had been created by ST LOUIS EXPRESS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Certainly in house “best practice” suggestions made within the claimants’ organisation both before and after the collision included procedures for diving the gear.  Albeit a measure of last resort, I have no doubt (nor do the Elder Brethren) that efforts to dive the streamers should have been undertaken to avoid or limit the damage, particularly given the vulnerability and value of the streamers.  The ability to take such evasive action timeously is emphasised by the fact that at C-6 ST LOUIS EXPRESS was already a whole mile inside the exclusion zone and, on a heading of 290 degrees, was shaping to cross the aft end of the array.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a considerable dispute between the parties as to the precise position of contact on the outside streamer number 10.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I was not persuaded that the resolution of this issue was particularly revealing although it is true that even when dived that part of streamer 10 in close proximity to the tail buoy would by definition not be lowered much if at all in the water (i.e. it would remain at about 4 meters).  Thus even when dived contact close to the buoy would still occur.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the claimants’ case on this issue (if it matters) is correct.  I find the evidence of their expert Mr Thomas, based on the damage exhibited by the streamers, is entirely persuasive.  In particular I accept his evidence that the strands of the streamer number 10 showed clear signs of being pulled around bows of the ST LOUIS EXPRESS while the other streamers had parted in straight tension. That is entirely consistent with the contemporary observation that ST LOUIS EXPRESS crossed in very close proximity to the buoys.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Calculations made by the defendants’ expert Mr Cavell do not persuade me that the observations derived from the damage give a misleading impression.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless I do not accept the proposition that once the point of contact at 20 meters forward of the tail buoy is established, failure to dive is shown not to be causative. It is clear that whilst the damage caused by the initial contact would have been unaffected, contact damage with some of the remaining streamers would probably have been avoided. In short the damage might not have been as extensive as it was although it would nonetheless have been substantial.</p>

There was no navigational reason for this alteration: the rigs in the vicinity posed no obstacle.  Indeed somewhat astonishingly she must have been steering a course with the flashing lights on the buoys almost dead ahead without appreciating their significance (assuming they were seen at all before impact).  </p>
