	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a claim arising out of damage sustained by the motor vessel “Bon Ami” (“the Vessel”) during the weekend of 6 to 8 May 2005, when she “grounded hollow” in a tidal berth (“layerage 3”) at a shipyard at Cremmyl in Cornwall belonging to the defendant, Coastal Marine 2004 Limited, which traded under the name “Mashfords” (“the Yard”).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Vessel, which was built in 1958, is a Scottish drifter, motor driven and of wooden construction.  She is a former merchant fishing vessel with a registered length of 21.3m, an overall length of 21.74 and length between perpendiculars of 20m.  She was purchased by the claimant, Christopher Martin Lee George (“the Claimant”) in December 1999.  At the time of the incident giving rise to this claim, he was in the process of converting the Vessel so as to enable him to charter her out for fishing and recreational trips from Plymouth.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Vessel has a wooden hull, protected by a metal strip, known as the keel band.  The keel itself is structural;  the keel band is not.  It serves merely to protect the keel when the Vessel takes ground on berthing.  A wooden vessel “grounds hollow” if it rests on the sea-bed when the tide falls, but does so in such a way that the flat keel does not rest evenly along the layerage bed.  In such a case, only part of the length of the flat keel band is supported, and there will be a gap, or hollow, between the unsupported length of the keel band and the layerage bed itself.  It was common ground between the experts and the parties that, if a vessel grounds hollow, it may twist and distort, because the weight pressing down on the keel will not be evenly distributed, and damage may consequently occur.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was common ground that, in this case, after the Vessel had moored in layerage 3 at approximately 5.30 pm on Friday, 6 May 2005, the Vessel’s flat keel band did indeed subsequently ground hollow.  That was because, when the tide went out, during the night of the 6-7 May, and the Vessel took the ground, at approximately an hour before low tide at 11.47 pm, its flat keel band would have spanned a 9.2m change in gradient on the sea bed of the layerage and thus would have been unsupported for a significant part of its length.  It was also agreed that this was an unsatisfactory situation which could lead to the damage to the Vessel’s hull, once the ground had been taken at low water.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant contends that the Vessel grounded hollow because, in breach of contract and/or its duty of care, the Yard failed to provide him with a safe berth.  He contends that, had a safe berth been provided, the Vessel would not have grounded hollow.  The Claimant says that layerage 3 was unsafe because of the increase in the gradient of the beach at the landward end and because of some alleged unevenness and debris on the bed of the layerage.  At trial he also contended that layerage 3 was unsafe because of the short length of the Coal Quay wall.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The following facts were common ground.  By an oral contract made on or around 26 April 2005, the Yard (by Richard Porter,<span style="font-family:'Palatino Linotype'"> the General Manager at the Yard)</span> agreed that the Claimant could moor the Vessel alongside a quay or beach wall at the Yard, in a tidal berth, or layerage, at which the Vessel could take the ground at low water and dry out so as to permit (i) pressure washing of her hull and (ii) the application of anti-fouling paint.  The Claimant wanted to moor at layerage 1, alongside the Yard’s east quay, having moored there previously.  Mr. Richard Porter agreed to this, in the knowledge of the purpose for which the Claimant wished to use the layerage.  The Claimant visited the Yard on 5 May to check that arrangements were in hand and to look at layerage 1, it being his practice to inspect berths at which the Vessel was to moor.  On the morning of 6 May 2005, Mr. Richard Porter telephoned the Claimant to inform him that layerage 1 was unexpectedly unavailable because two fishing boats had arrived overnight and moored on the berth.  Mr. Richard Porter had tried to contact the skippers of the boats, but had been unable to clear the berth.  Mr. Richard Porter duly offered the Claimant the options of rescheduling the appointment or taking a berth at layerage 3, alongside another quay.  The Claimant chose the latter.  He had not previously moored there or inspected the layerage bed at low tide.  Where the Claimant in fact moored the Vessel, alongside the quay at layerage 3, she did not lie safely aground, but grounded hollow.  After the incident, and the damage to the Vessel, the Yard did not charge the Claimant for the berthing fees.</p>

There was no evidence adduced by the Claimant to suggest that the Yard exercised a sufficient degree of control over the sea bed of the layerage such as to impose upon it an absolute obligation upon it to be responsible for repairing the bed, so as to make it fit for the purpose of berthing there.  In particular, I reject the Claimant’s suggestion that the evidence of  David Reed, a rigger employed by the Yard, as to his clearance of the quay, or as to his moving of stones on the sea bed, amounted to sufficient evidence of the Yard’s control over the seabed at the various layerages, to constitute it an occupier of the sea bed for the purposes of the 1957 Act.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the Yard was an occupier, for the purposes of the 1957 Act, of the quays or sea walls against which vessels would moor when berthing at the layerages.  Even if one assumes in the Yard’s favour that it was not an occupier of the sea bed, it still had the common law duty of care imposed by section 2(2) to see that the Claimant would be reasonably safe in using the sea wall or quay, and thus, in effect, the mooring, for the purposes of the mooring licence.  As <span style="font-style:italic">Marsden on Collisions at Sea</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

	      </authorialNote> points out, the duty is to see that a berth is in proper condition, or, failing that, to give a warning that it is not.  But the duty is merely a duty to take care;  the wharfinger is not liable without fault for defects in the dock.  Likewise, even if I were wrong in my conclusion that the Yard was not an occupier of the actual sea bed of the layerage, and the Yard is to be regarded as an occupier thereof, the common law duty of care imposed by section 2(2) “to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited” was not the absolute one contended for by the Claimant, but rather the more limited one articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">The Moorcock.</span></p>

If the Yard’s representatives had, as they claimed, warned the Claimant to move the Vessel back to avoid grounding hollow, and if the Vessel would have been reasonably safely moored, if he had done so, there can be no liability on the Yard, whether under implied terms of the contract, at common law or under the 1957 Act.  Section 2(4) of the 1957 Act  provides a defence where “damage is caused to a visitor by a danger of which he had been warned,” but “the warning is not to be treated without more as absolving the occupier from liability, unless in all the circumstances it was enough to enable the visitor to be reasonably safe”.  Section 2(5) also preserves the defence that a claimant willingly accepted the risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, the crucial issues in the case are therefore:  (i) what mooring instructions were given to the Claimant by the Yard, and were they an adequate warning of the risks of the change in gradient in the layerage;  and (ii) whether the Vessel would have lain safely aground if she had been moved 12 feet astern from her original mooring position to lie seaward of the change in gradient, as the Yard contends it instructed the Claimant to do.  It is to these issues which I now turn.  I deal first with the second issue, because, if the Vessel would not have lain safely aground even if she had been shifted 12 feet astern from her original mooring position, the Yard accepts that it would, in any event, have been liable under its limited duty of care for having failed to give an adequate warning.</p>

He was extremely familiar with the lie and condition of the layerage, as he walked over the layerages at low tide frequently;  he was at the layerages “literally every day”, at all states of the tide, guiding vessels in and out of the berths.  Indeed he had observed the change in gradient at layerage 3 at low tide on the very day of the incident.  He said that, even at high tide, he knew, from his experience, and his daily observation of the layerage, where the change in gradient in the sand stopped, by reference to the stones in the “old fashioned” dry quay wall, running along the side of the layerage.  He told the court that he “knew nearly every stone” in the wall and that he could tell, from his position at the top of the Coal Quay wall, exactly where the change in gradient began and stopped.

The evidence of the Yard’s employees, which I accept, was that there was no such debris at the time of the incident on the layerage bed, in the location where a vessel would ground, because the position in the sea bed, where keels of boats lay, was always kept clear.  As I have already stated, in cross-examination, Captain Paines conceded that he was not suggesting that debris in the layerage was a contributing factor to the damage sustained.</p>

This was so, even if, as the experts agreed, as a result of their inspection in 2007, a small length of the flat keel bar would have been to landward of the 9.20m change in gradient.  It was Captain Paines’ view that in such a position there remained “the potential for damage” to occur, from grounding hollow,  but on analysis,  his view was not so different from that of Mr. Keenor as to undermine my conclusion that, in this position also, the Vessel would have lain reasonably safely aground, with its flat keel bar adequately supported.  Moreover, this conclusion was also supported by the factual evidence of the Yard’s employees not only to the effect that the precise position of the change in gradient had changed since the incident, but also to the effect that, if the Vessel had been shifted back 12 feet, it would have been sitting on level ground, in a position where many vessels had previously been laid by the Yard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">In his closing submissions, Mr. Whitehead  sought to suggest that the Yard’s alleged recommended berthing position 12 feet aft in layerage 3 would in any event have constituted an unsafe berth, even in the absence of any risk of grounding hollow, because of the risk that the hull might be substantially unsupported by the Coal Quay wall when the tide went out and/or the risk that the Vessel might pivot round the Coal Quay knuckle on a rising tide.  In support of this contention, he sought to rely upon Mr. Keenor’s comment about not leaving the Vessel unattended overnight in the event of a 37 feet overhang.  I reject the allegation that, for these reasons, layerage 3 would have constituted an unsafe berth, even absent a change in gradient/ grounding hollow risk.  First of all the allegation of these hazards was not pleaded;  see paragraph 8(e)(iv) of the Particulars of Claim where the complaint is that a length of the Vessel’s keel would have been unsupported, not that the quay wall would not have provided adequate support for the Vessel at low tide, or that there was a pivoting risk on a rising tide.  But leaving aside this technical pleading point, more importantly, the alleged hazards were not addressed in the experts’ reports or in their cross-examination, although concerns about excessive stern overhang were referred to in the evidence of the Claimant and the factual witnesses.  Finally the evidence of the Yard’s employees, and, in particular Mr. Reed, was to the effect that, even though, in the recommended 12 feet aft position, a vessel of the size and dimensions of the Vessel, would have had a significant stern overhang in layerage 3, that did not render the berth unsafe, (a) since there was ample room for a sufficient length of  such a vessel (normally a quarter, to a half, of the Vessel’s length, because of its curvature) to lie against, and receive support from, the quay wall, and (b) since the point of contact between the vessel and the quay wall would be nowhere near the end of the quay.  I accept this evidence.  The fact that Mr. Keenor’s view is that, as a matter of caution, he would have spent the night on the Vessel if there had been a 37 feet stern overhang, does not detract from my conclusion.  </p>

However, despite its constraints, it was not such an unsuitable or unsafe berth that the Yard should have told the Claimant that he could not, or should not, moor the Vessel there.  The reality was that it was a reasonably safe berth at which to moor, provided that an adequate warning was given about the risk of grounding hollow because of the change in gradient.  It is to this issue that I now turn.</p>

Although he has no professional marine qualifications, and was not the holder of a commercially endorsed skipper’s licence, he has considerable experience as a seaman, having worked on various marine projects, and as a delivery crewman and skipper on motor and sailing yachts.  He told the court that he was a competent seaman and navigator, having worked on boats and sailed or driven then as a hobby since 1987.  He told the court that he had taken a 75-foot vessel that drew 12 feet through first the Bristol Channel, and then the Avon Gorge into Bristol Docks.  He also told me that he had taken the Vessel to the Gulf of Morbihan in Brittany with paying passengers.  He also gave evidence to the effect that he would charter the Vessel on a daily basis from time to time.  Although he did not have the requisite Small Commercial Vessel Coding for charter licence (“SCV 2”), he had, prior to the incident, submitted a deposit and form SCV1 so that the Vessel could in due course be surveyed by the Marine Coastguard Agency to qualify as a charter vessel and obtain SCV approval.  However, at the time of the incident, the Vessel required further restoration work and the purchase of further safety equipment to qualify for such approval.  He told the court that, effectively, in order to circumvent chartering regulations, his chartering customers would pay “donations” or “contribute to expenses” for the day’s trip.  He also told the court that his current work involved running a commercial garage at Norton Ferrers, “… where currently about 25% of the work is invoice-related”.  His competence as a seaman was endorsed by a friend of his, Mr. David Walker, a retired Master Mariner, who had sailed with the Claimant on a number of occasions, including on the trip to the Gulf of Morbihan, and who also gave evidence at trial.  I have no doubt that the Claimant is indeed a competent seaman.</p>

This made manoeuvring into Layerage 3 very tight.  As I approached Layerage 3 there were three or four Mashfords staff standing on The Coal Quay ready to assist us with the berthing of the ‘Bon Ami’.  I heard one of the Mashfords staff saying:  ‘That was pure luck, or he can drive that boat’.  I do not recall which member said this.

I took his advice and moved the vessel astern.  There appeared to be some disagreement between the Mashfords employees standing on the quay as to the exact location of the step on the beach and after some discussion they decided where it was and gave me guidance on how far to move the ‘Bon Ami’ astern.  Mr. Reed directed me from the quay using very clear signals to indicate when I should stop.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Whitehead also placed great emphasis on the fact that the pleaded Defence (certified by a Statement of Truth from Mr. Richard Porter) was inaccurate and inconsistent with the evidence given by the Yard’s witnesses in two important respects:  first, that it wrongly asserted that the Vessel arrived at 1530 hours, and not 5.30 pm;  and second that, having advised the Claimant to shift the Vessel astern at about 1530, Mr. Reed then returned an hour later and repeated the warning to the Claimant.  Mr. Whitehead emphasised the fact that the Claimant’s account of the timings was accepted by the Yard in their oral evidence, thus demonstrating that the Claimant’s evidence on crucial issues has been consistently right all along.</p>

In a case of this sort, where there is an acute difference between the two accounts put forward, the court’s task of ascertaining where the truth lies cannot principally depend on a meticulous textual analysis of variants between accounts given in witness statements, pleading or in oral examination.  The court has to adopt the robust approach of assessing the credibility of witnesses and the totality of the evidence which has been given in the light of all the facts.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Reed was a patently honest witness who, as I have already said, gave his evidence in a modest and impressive manner.  He was unshakeable in cross-examination and indeed no challenge was made to his honesty.  Apart from his work record and his experience, he had, in common with Mr. Martyn Porter, seen the Vessel out of the water (when it had berthed at the Yard on a previous occasion) and had a very good idea of the length of her flat keel bar and where he needed to position the Vessel in the layerage to avoid the change in gradient.  He had experience of guiding many other vessels into the layerage.  He clearly knew the state of the sea bed at layerage 3 extremely well, not only because he had worked there for so long, but also because he regularly inspected the sea bed at low tide, and had done so on that day.  Consequently he knew precisely where the change in gradient lay.  He was clearly able to assess, with some degree of accuracy, from his experience, where the keel bar lay in relation to the change in gradient, and had allowed for a margin of safety.  It is simply not credible on the evidence, or consistent with the impression he gave as a witness, that he would have misjudged the safe place for the Vessel to lie and then told lies to cover up his mistake.  Contrary to Mr. Whitehead’s submissions, his conduct the next morning in not engaging the Claimant in a discussion about the Vessel’s grounding hollow, or not advising him at that stage to move the Vessel a further 12 feet astern is entirely explicable by his concern not to have any further confrontation with the Claimant, who had clearly offended him.  Mr. Reed was a mild man in his sixties who, once having been rebuffed, would not again attempt to offer advice.  Likewise, I was not surprised that he did not use his logbook to record the precise words used by the Claimant in rejecting his advice.  The logbook was not that sort of record, nor would Mr. Reed have thought it necessary or appropriate to record the Claimant’s abusive comments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">The obvious inconsistencies between the case as put forward in the Defence as to the timing of the Vessel’s arrival at the layerage and the warnings given by Mr. Reed, albeit glaringly wrong, did not persuade me that the Yard’s employees were lying.  I suspect that the fault in the accuracy of the pleadings can be placed at the door of the legal team, the inevitable difficulties in obtaining instructions through the filter of insurers, and Mr. Richard Porter, when signing the statement of truth, simply not bothering to check the precise facts, in detail, many of which he knew only second-hand.  In particular, Mr. Watthey, for the Yard, submitted that this was not a case where the witnesses asserted the incorrect case as pleaded in the Defence.  On the contrary, the defence witness statements (which were not detailed and fairly broad-brush in approach) did not suggest that the timings asserted in the Defence were accurate, or indeed address such issues at all.  In any event, Mr. Reed corrected the errors in the Defence when he gave his oral evidence in chief.  Although the Claimant was cross-examined by Mr. Watthey on the basis of the wrong timings, the Claimant was not prejudiced by this in any way, and stuck to his (correct) version of the timing of events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Richard Porter and Mr. Martyn Porter were also entirely credible witnesses, with no axe to grind.  I reject Mr. Whitehead’s suggestion that, after the event, they collaborated with Mr. Reed to “fashion a defence”, or that Mr. Richard Porter’s conduct on the evening of Saturday 7 May was inconsistent with a 12 feet warning having been given by Mr. Reed on the previous day.  I accept that Mr. Richard Porter did indeed give advice to the Claimant to move the Vessel back a further 12 feet on the evening of Saturday 7 May to ensure that the Vessel was not resting on the change of gradient, which the Claimant duly did.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">I formed the distinct impression that the Claimant was attempting to trim his evidence to suit his case.  He had a tendency to overstate and exaggerate points in his favour.  For example, the manner in which he gave his evidence in relation to his loss of chartering income, and other aspects of quantum, was not straightforward.  He had perhaps convinced himself that he had indeed moved the Vessel back as he contends he was instructed so to do by Mr. Reed.  But, in my judgment, the reality is that he was indeed under some pressure in manoeuvring the Vessel into what was clearly, on his own evidence, a tight berth at layerage 3.  I conclude that his over-riding concerns when mooring were to ensure:  a) that the Vessel had sufficient support from the Coal Quay wall when the tide went out;  and b) that the Vessel would not be resting too far to seaward to prevent it from drying out completely, so that the job of pressure-hosing and anti-fouling the Vessel could be completed.  I accept that he manoeuvred the Vessel back somewhat from the position in which its bow touched the beach, but I consider it likely that, having done that, he took the view that the Yard’s employees were being unduly cautious about the risk of grounding hollow and that he was much more concerned about the two factors I have identified above.  He certainly presented as someone who was confident in his own judgment and abilities.  I would not have expected him to have shown deference to Mr. Reed, and I do not find it surprising that he swore at Mr. Reed.</p>

I accept that some of the work covered by the estimate may have been necessitated by damage caused to the Vessel as a result of the incident, in particular that relating to “raking out caulking on deck, recaulk and seam”, but many of the items of work for which an estimate have been provided require further investigation as to whether they are necessary or not.  The difficulty about this estimate is that the Claimant left it until 2008 to obtain it, and has not done any of the work to date.  If is difficult to know whether many of the items referred to need in fact to be carried out.  Moreover, work necessary to repair damage caused by fresh water may well not be attributable to the incident at all, but rather to the Claimant’s failure to ensure that the deck was properly caulked, or at least to cover any areas of the Vessel whose watertight integrity had been compromised, so as to prevent rain water from entering.  The damage caused by rot which was the inevitable consequence of the incident has been aggravated by leaving it so long before attending to it.  Although it was for the Yard to prove betterment, it was up to the Claimant to provide that the damage was indeed caused by the incident, and that the repair costs were justified.  I would have held that the Claimant had not fully proved his case in relation to the outstanding repairs, and would have awarded him the limited amount of £8,000 to reflect the fact that some outstanding repairs were still necessary as a result of the incident.</p>

In the absence of further argument (which I would have required as to the presumption of the Commercial Court rate), I would have awarded interest on that figure at a rate of 1% above Bank of England base rate for the time being;  see CPR 7.0.17.  However, I do not consider that the Claimant is entitled to claim loss of use for the extended period of time for which he claims:  i.e. up to the present date on the grounds that the repairs have still not been done and therefore, it is claimed, the loss of use is continuing.  Despite his claim to impecuniosity, the Claimant produced no evidence of his earnings or capital assets, and no evidence to show that he could not have realistically obtained a loan from a bank to fund the additional sum of £17,000 or so, by way of the repair costs which I would have additionally awarded him.  Likewise, his various explanations as to why he took quite so long to get the repairs done were also unsatisfactory.  In the circumstances, and approaching the matter generously so far as the Claimant is concerned, I would have awarded loss of use for two years from the date of the incident in May 2005 to May 2007, being the period in which, on any reasonable basis, the repairs should have been completed.</p>
