In return for an undertaking from the Port of Tilbury not to exercise its statutory rights of detention and sale, he ordered that all charges properly owing to the Port in relation to the Vessels up to the date of delivery to the purchasers of the Vessels in respect of which the Port would have power to exercise a statutory right of detention or sale were to be payable by the Admiralty Marshal to the Port as one of his expenses of sale, provided that the amount so payable did not exceed the net proceeds.  He gave directions for the determination of the Port’s charges, which included the right of interested parties, i.e. other persons with claims against the Vessels, to object, to file evidence in support of the objection and to appear at the hearing to determine the charges. </p>

One of the directions was that parties who had notified opposition to the Port’s claim were to appear by jointly instructed counsel.  Ms Philippa Hopkins QC appeared for those parties, (who have come to be called “the Cautioners”, though not all of them entered cautions).  Mr James M. Turner QC represented the Port.  I am extremely grateful to both counsel for their cogent and economical submissions. </p>

They had a pressing need to lay-over their vessels until they could resume trading.  On 13 March 2020, Mr Chris Coates of CMV informed Mr Steve Lyons of the Port that CMV was suspending operations until 24 April 2020 because of the pandemic.  In response, Mr Lyons assured Mr Coates “of our full support”.  Mr Coates replied that the message was “very much appreciated from CMV’s premier port partner” and also thanked him “for securing the lay-over berths for us”.   </p>

Taking into consideration the critical aspect of the whole thing, please let me know your best charges PER BERTH/PER DAY (lump sum all inclusive please) and I hope you will be very generous and understanding!!”.  Mr Lyons for the Port had responded as follows: “… In round figures £3k per ship per week or part thereof.  Lock charges per tariff”.  (The reference to a “tariff” was intended to be to the Port’s Schedule of Extra Charges, which includes figures for lock charges.)  Ms Onufriyenko stated that she would pass the message on to management and “get back to you”.  She subsequently spoke to Mr Lyons and agreed verbally to the £3,000 </p>

As noted above, on the Port’s case, that rate was £29 per metre LOA per 12 hour period.  In comparison to the agreed rate of £3,000 up to that point, the difference was dramatic.

On the contrary, the Schedule stipulated that such charges had to be negotiated.  The “Lay-by Charge” in the Schedule applied where a vessel had failed to depart the port when required to do so and was then designated a lay-by berth.  It did not apply to an extended layby.  That part of the Schedule dealing with detained vessels was, on a proper construction, referring to vessels which were unable to meet a required time of departure because of the detention, which was not this case.  It was not intended nor apt to apply to a vessel on extended lay-by which was then detained.  If the provision could be construed more widely than this, it still did not assist the Port because it purported to apply “lay-by charges … as applicable and advertised”, but there were none such.

Neither communication was couched in the language of termination.  On the contrary, they treated the contract as remaining on foot for all purposes.  The only element which they purported to change was the charging rate.  Further, even if the email and the letters had been differently expressed, there was no repudiatory breach to accept.  CMV had gone into administration.  That was not a repudiatory breach.  No authority supports the proposition that it was.  The aim or goal of administration is, of course, the company’s revival and continued trading. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">Section 233B of the Insolvency Act 1986 did not prevent that.  The wording of subsection (3) is probably wide enough to capture a variation provision such as Regulation 5.6 because it refers not only to “termination” but also to doing “any other thing”, which would include an upwards variation of the charge for (the same) services.  The Explanatory Notes to CIGA 2020 state that the Section was intended to “prevent suppliers … relying on termination clauses or doing ‘any other thing’ due to a company entering a restructuring or insolvency procedure”.  Prior to 20 July 2020, the Port was providing services to CMV and GCL as well as to the demise charterers of the Vessels and the administration of the CMV Group of companies would, all other things being equal, have triggered the effect of the Section.  The difficulty, however, is that on 20 July 2020, CMV / GCL had terminated the ship management arrangements and, effectively, abandoned the Vessels.  From that point onwards, the Port was not dealing with CMV / GCL.  The Port was dealing directly with the demise charterers, Lyric and Mythic.  These companies were not in administration or any other insolvency process and Section 233B could have no, or no further, relevance. </p>

Although there is no direct evidence of that from the side of the Vessels or the Cautioners, it is an inference from the Port’s evidence as to the numerous enquiries it received from other vessels wishing to layover, which it had to turn away.  It is also common knowledge.  My view is that a reasonable period in those circumstances would have been 28 days.  This coincides with the period allowed by Regulation 5.2 for the payment of charges levied (and which is also some indication of the scale of a reasonable period of notice).  The fact that the email and the letters stipulated a shorter period, or no period, did not deprive them of all effect and no authority was offered by Ms Hopkins QC for this proposition.  They were quite clearly intended to give notice of a variation and were effective to do so, albeit that they must be construed according to my finding as to what the length of reasonable notice was. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">Regulation 5.6 is not qualified by a requirement that charges may only be varied by an amount which is reasonable.  As a matter of statute, the Port was free to charge such ship dues as it thought fit and, as a matter of contractual interpretation, the Regulations were also not subject to any such constraint.  The wording of Regulation 5 cannot be said to restrict the Port to upwards variations neatly calibrated in accordance with increases in the scope of the services provided, or which reflect “losses”.  The situations addressed by the Regulation are too diverse to admit of such a restriction.  The wording of 5.6 was clearly intended to give the Port complete freedom to increase the charges as it saw fit, on reasonable notice.  It would be odd indeed if the Port was unable to exercise that power to terminate what was clearly a preferential rate intended to operate only for a temporary period and substitute a new rate which was more in accordance with its business model, which was to encourage the quick turnaround of vessels and to discourage extended lay-bys.  In those circumstances, it cannot possibly be said to be necessary to imply a requirement of reasonableness in order to give the contract business efficacy or because it is so obvious that it goes without saying.  Neither of those familiar tests for the implication of terms was remotely made out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">The phrases “the published tariff on our marine link” (the email) and “the published tariff for the Port” (the letters) were clearly referring to the Lay-By Charge of £29 per metre LOA per 12 hour period.  There was only one published tariff, which was the Extra Charges Schedule on the Port’s website, and it contained only one charge for Lay-By.  No one could reasonably have been confused or uncertain that that was what “the published tariff” meant.  And there is no evidence that anyone was in fact in that state of mind either at the date of the email of 20 July and the letters of 23 July, or later, when there was discussion with the new managers, V Ships, about a new rate of £10,000 per week per vessel.  To switch from the agreed, concessionary rate to the tariff rate on the website did not bring the Port into the territory of Lord Denning’s well-known “red ink … with a red hand pointing to it” test; see <span style="font-style:italic">J. Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw</span> [1956] 1 WLR 461 at 466.

In that scenario, no one on the Vessels’ side could have thought that the part of the Schedule referring to “negotiated” rates for “extended lay-by” was the applicable part – because the negotiated rate had just been withdrawn.  Equally, this was not a case of a failure to leave a berth at the required time “on completion of cargo operations”.  That left only the rate for a vessel “detained at the port”.  The Vessels had indeed been detained at the Port.  So the rate could only be the rate stipulated for that situation, which was the “lay-by charges … as applicable and advertised”.  The only advertised rate for lay-by was the £29 per metre LOA rate.  No one could reasonably have thought otherwise and nor did they. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">The foregoing is a contractual analysis, which Ms Hopkins QC impressed upon me (and I agree) is the correct approach in the circumstances of this case.  But if and to the extent that it was necessary for the Port to rely upon the Regulations’ statutory origin for their binding effect, then Section 22 of the 1968 Act would not prevent that.  This provision makes the binding effect of the 2005 Regulations subject to a requirement that “a relevant extract from subsisting regulations” was “included in each schedule of charges published by the Port Authority”.  In 1968 that would, no doubt, have taken the form of the Regulations (or at least Regulation 5) being cited alongside the Extra Charges Schedule or perhaps included in the same booklet or fixed to the same notice board.  Provisions such as this have to be interpreted in the light of changing times and technology.  The Extra Charges Schedule stated in the top line, immediately below the title, that it was to be read in accordance with the Port of Tilbury’s General Terms and Conditions – 2005 Edition.  That was, and was acknowledged to be, a reference to the 2005 Regulations which were on the same website.  That plainly satisfied the requirements of Section 22, the statutory intention of which was to bring the 2005 Regulations to the attention of the Port’s users and to make them readily accessible. </p>

It was not the Port’s fault that that did not happen.
