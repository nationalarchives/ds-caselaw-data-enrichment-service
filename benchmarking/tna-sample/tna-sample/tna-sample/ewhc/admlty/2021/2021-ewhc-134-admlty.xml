      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">1.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The parties require the court to give a decision as to the incidence and quantum of the costs arising out of this claim in which the vessel “ASTORIA” (the “vessel”) was arrested and subsequently released following which the Claimants applied for permission to discontinue the claim. Although the Claimants accept that they have a liability for costs arising from the arrest of the vessel a dispute has arisen as to which of the parties should be liable for the further costs incurred before the claim was discontinued largely arising out of what has become known as “the port charges issue”. </p>
      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:-0.01in">The issues before the Court</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">2.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The questions which the Court has been asked to address are set out in the Order agreed between the parties and sealed on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2020. There had been a hearing fixed for the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November but, in order to avoid that the parties put forward an agreed order which was made on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. Owing to a misunderstanding about the precise terms that was replaced by the Order of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November as appears from paragraph 1 of that Order. Paragraph 2 contains a declaration that no sums were due from the Claimants to the Admiralty Marshal by reason of the undertakings given by the Claimants under forms ADM </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">4 or ADM 12. Paragraph 3 provides that the Claimants should be permitted to discontinue the claims against the Defendants. The matters which the parties have agreed should be referred to the court are set out follows:</p>

The Claimants’ application to discontinue the claim and seek the assistance of the court is supported by two witness statements but the First Defendant has elected not to provide a witness statement. Neither of the Claimants’ witness statements directly address the issues presently before the court and the matter has been complicated because Mr Moisley’s first witness statement refers to exhibit pages which are not those provided in the hearing bundle, the email communications have not been provided in a chronological order, they were, in some cases, incomplete and/or were repeated in different sections and some of the emails refer to draft orders which have not been provided. I have not had the benefit of oral submissions or an explanation of the various communications placed in the bundle and in order to understand the nature of the dispute and how it arose it has been necessary to give a detailed consideration to the documents, particularly the various emails.

Hill Dickinson also stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">At this time we just make one point – you/your client arrested the vessel just 17 days after the bareboat charter was repudiated, in circumstances where our clients were thrown into a situation not of their making where the vessel had obviously not been previously under their management. As you can no doubt imagine, there were many issues to be sorted out before the vessel could sail, but the delay since has been down to the arrest instigated by your clients. Harbour dues that need to be settled prior to the vessel being allowed to sail will no doubt be settled by our clients once they know when the vessel can sail – mainly dependent upon when your clients release the arrest, but in any event that will not include the harbour dues for the period of the arrest which fall within the classification of Admiralty Marshal’s costs</span>”. </p>

Furthermore Mr Haddon made 7 points in support of his contention that the Claimants’ conduct in making an application to the court regarding port dues was precipitous and, in any event, not influenced by the actions of the Owner. These included: (a) that the Claimants’ solicitors were concerned about and had been in correspondence about the port dues prior to the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September; (b) that, prior to Hill Dickinson’s email at 1919 on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September, the Claimants understood that the port would be looking to the Claimants to recover the dues. That belief was not influenced by the Owner; (c) that on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September, 2020 in circumstances where the vessel was being released from arrest by the Claimants, it was not unreasonable for Hill Dickinson to state that the Owner would not accept liability for port costs which “<span style="font-style:italic">fell within the classification of Admiralty Marshal’s costs</span>”; (e) that the application for the court’s assistance as to liability for port costs was precipitous and made without any involvement with the Owners; (f) that the vessel departed from Tilbury on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2020. Negotiations with the port, related to port costs, were ongoing until that time and that it was only then that the Owner was in a position to decide whether to pursue a contribution for those costs from the Marshal or the Claimants. The decision not to pursue such a contribution was communicated to the Claimants on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. On the basis of these Mr Haddon invited the Claimants to drop their very late application for a wasted costs order.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.24in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.05in">i.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The claim arose from the supply of bunkers to the vessel to the order of Global, the Second Defendant, which had been the bareboat charterer of the vessel since 2014. As a result of the Covid pandemic the vessel had remained in port since March 2020 and Global had become insolvent. As a consequence the bareboat charter was terminated on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2020 which was just over 2 months before it was contractually due to end. Incidentally it appears that the Owner of the vessel was also insolvent since 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2016 when a Portuguese judicial administrator was appointed who found himself having to cope with the consequences of the early termination at short notice. ii.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>After the Claimants commenced proceedings Hill Dickinson were instructed to advise and conduct the litigation on behalf of the Owner.

The discretion is to be exercised judicially and, in accordance with CPR Part 1, with a view to coming to a fair conclusion. How that is to be approached has been the subject of guidance from the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Straker v Tudor Rose </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 368 referred to in Cook on Costs 2021 Edition which states that the proper approach is (i) to consider whether it is appropriate to make an order for costs, (ii) if it is then the general rule is that the successful party should get its costs, (iii) to identify the successful party, and (iv) consider whether there are reasons for departing from the general rule in whole or in part. The White Book also contains copious notes on these aspects. At 44.2.13 (p. 1386) it states: “<span style="font-style:italic">As a practical matter r.44.2(2) poses two questions: (1) who is the successful  party and (2) when should the general rule be applied? The two questions tend to get conflated and therefore muddled</span>”.  The same page also contains reference to the cases where the question of identifying the successful party have been referred to. These indicate that the success is to be regarded in the context of the overall proceedings rather than a particular issue (<span style="font-style:italic">Kastor Navigation v AGF MAT </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 277) and that the court should seek to ascertain who has won as a matter of ‘substance and reality’ (see Sir Thomas Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">Roache v Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd</span> [1998] EMLR </p>

Part 38.6 deals with costs upon discontinuance and provides that the discontinuing party will be liable for costs to the date when the notice of discontinuance is served upon him where permission is not required. The note at 38.5.2 of the White Book indicates that where permission to discontinue is required the order granting permission should indicate when discontinuance takes place. However by CPR Part 38.6 the court may make another order but it is to be noted that there is a strong presumption that the defendant should recover its costs and the burden is upon the claimant to show that there is a good reason for departing from that position, see <span style="font-style:italic">Nelson’s Yard Management Co. v Eziefula </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Ashany v Eco-Bat Technologies Ltd </span>[2018] EWCA Civ 1066, referred to in note 38.6.1 of the White Book.</p>

As this case deals with the appropriate approach to harbour dues in cases where there is to be an order for the sale of a vessel it is not strictly on point. Nonetheless the judgment of Brandon J, as he then was,  considers the competing interests of a harbour authority, with its lien for mooring fees, and the need for the court to be able to sell a <span style="font-style:italic">res</span> in an appropriate case. At the end of the judgment he gave helpful guidance to future cases where points involving harbour dues might arise. What clearly stands out from that dictum is that there can be no doubt that in an appropriate case such fees <span style="text-decoration:underline">may</span> be considered as part of the Marshal’s costs but that this should be after consultation between the various interests and <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> after the matter has been referred to the Admiralty Registrar or the Admiralty Judge.  This reinforces the principle that although the Admiralty Marshal has custody of an arrested vessel his actions to preserve the property, which may cover a wide variety of scenarios, should only be taken with the sanction of the court itself. </p>

This case and the explanation in Cook on Costs has been cited by the Claimants and, in my view, reliance upon the guidance referred to provides a helpful means of resolving the present dispute. The first step is to decide whether a costs order would be appropriate. This can be dealt with shortly because the Claimants expressly submit that an order for costs is appropriate and it is clear from the tenor of their submissions that the First Defendant accepts that an order for costs would be appropriate. Even if the parties did not accept this proposition I have no doubt that an order for costs is appropriate in the present circumstances because CPR Part 38 makes it clear that some type of order for costs will usually, if not invariably, be appropriate where a claimant has discontinued a claim brought in the Senior Court.  </p>

The relevant person was the demise charterer of the vessel because it was that charterer which had requested the supply of the bunkers which were the subject of the claim however, unfortunately for the Claimants, the charterer had terminated the charter and surrendered the vessel to the Owner before the proceedings were commenced. In these circumstances it was not permissible to exercise the jurisdiction of the court against the vessel. It is also to be noted that on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August the Admiralty Marshal, who had been copied into the email from Hill Dickinson, sent a message to Penningtons advising them that the original arrest had not been properly served on the vessel and asking whether, in the light of the correspondence from Hill Dickinson, the Claimants wanted him to effect the arrest. Penningtons confirmed that they did and the arrest was effected by the Admiralty Marshal despite having been given the information which should have put them on notice that, if it was correct, must have meant that the jurisdiction of the court could not be invoked by the <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> procedure.

The claim was finally discontinued by the Order of the Court on November 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.

That the Claimants should pay the First Defendant’s costs in the present case is clearly the proper order because, had the Claimants not discontinued, the First Defendant would have been entitled to apply for and obtain an order dismissing the claim. If that had occurred there would be no doubt that the Claimants would have been liable for all the First Defendant’s costs up to the moment of dismissal most probably to be assessed  on the indemnity basis. </p>

This concentration upon the ‘costs of arrest’ is a thread which runs throughout the Claimants’ reasoning and, in my judgment, is also misconceived. As Hill Dickinson pointed out in correspondence the relevant costs in these circumstances are not only those arising out of the arrest but the costs of defending the claim as a whole. In these circumstances, if the general rule is followed, the Claimants must bear the First Defendant’s costs to the date of discontinuance. However that is subject to  the last step of the guidance: whether it is proper, in the  circumstances of this case, to depart from the general rule and make a different order and, if so what. </p>

This course is put forward as an alternative case by the Claimants in paragraph 27-30 of their submissions and, in my view, is the proper approach in the present case. The Claimants have submitted that the court may take account of all the circumstances including the conduct of the parties and in particular whether it was reasonable for the First Defendant to raise, pursue or contest the issue of the port costs. As a broad statement of principle this accords with CPR Part 44.2 however it should be borne in mind that the court is not restricted to considering the conduct of one of the parties but may consider the conduct of all the parties in the light of all the circumstances of a particular case. In this case the matter under consideration has been described as “the port charges issue”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The Claimants’ case is that the issue about the port charges was caused by the conduct of the First Defendant. This assertion relies mainly upon Penningtons’ interpretation of the words used by Mr Haddon of Hill Dickinson in the email of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September. In paragraph 5 of the Claimants’ written submissions it is said that Hill Dickinson wrote to say that the Owner would not pay “<span style="font-style:italic">port charges for the period of the arrest</span>”, see paragraph 5 of the Claimants’ submissions. That statement is materially inaccurate. In fact Mr Haddon stated that the “<span style="font-style:italic">Harbour dues that need to be settled prior to the vessel being allowed to sail will no doubt be settled by our clients once they know when the vessel can sail</span>”. But he added that this “<span style="font-style:italic">will not include the harbour dues for the period of the arrest </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">which fall within the classification of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Admiralty Marshal’s costs</span>” (emphasis added). That is not a refusal to pay harbour dues but only those harbour dues which form part of the Admiralty Marshal’s costs. This statement was made in response to the information from Penningtons’ that the vessel was to be released at the behest of the Claimants and was, in my view, both factually correct and a reasonable position for the Owner to adopt. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In the majority of cases where a vessel is arrested, judgment obtained and the vessel sold the Marshal’s costs are taken from the proceeds of sale as a first charge on the fund. Similarly if the arresting party has incurred costs of the arrest or preservation of the vessel, such as happens where they pay costs of crew repatriation or harbour dues, the arresting party may recover those from the fund in court once the vessel is sold. However where a claim <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> is abandoned or the vessel is released at the instigation of the arresting party the Marshal can only recover his costs from the arresting party. That is the reason for the undertaking in both forms ADM4 and 12. In suggesting, as they have, that Hill Dickinson’s position, as set out in the email of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2020, was incorrect or unreasonable I consider that Penningtons have fallen into a serious error which lies at the heart of this dispute. In this case the Claimants were responsible for the arrest of the vessel. Thereafter  they decided to have the vessel released and it follows that, insofar as the Marshal had incurred any expenses arising from the arrest, it was for the Claimants (not the  First Defendant) to reimburse the Marshal under the terms of their undertakings for all his expenses incurred during the relevant time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Further in paragraph 5 of their submissions Penningtons state that on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2020 the Admiralty Marshal indicated to Penningtons that Tilbury had outstanding charges for his account amounting to nearly £130,000. It is stated “<span style="font-style:italic">This was the start of a new issue: in effect a claim by the First Defendant for a contribution to the port charges for which they were contractually liable</span>”. In my view this is an astonishing assertion as Mr Haddon’s email, written at a time when he was unaware of the claim put forward by Tilbury, makes no reference whatsoever to seeking a contribution to the port dues from the Claimants or anyone else. The evidence before me contains not a single intimation by the First Defendant that they might be seeking such a contribution to the harbour dues and the only message referring to a contribution is that from Hill Dickinson dated the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2020 indicating that the Owner was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> seeking a contribution. However the Claimants seek to argue that the wording of that email gives rise to an “<span style="font-style:italic">implication</span>” that the Owners were seeking such a contribution at a much earlier stage. This is an equally astonishing submission because it is impossible to see how the contents of an email dated the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October can possibly have led Penningtons to believe that the First Defendant was seeking a contribution or have influenced their actions in any way nearly two months earlier and, in my view, the Claimants’ attempt to construct an argument for costs upon such strained logic is unacceptable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">That conclusion is also supported by the contemporaneous correspondence between Penningtons and Hill Dickinson provided in the hearing bundle. The starting point for considering this aspect is that on the on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August Penningtons received the email from Hill Dickinson stating that the charterparty had been terminated in July so that, in effect, the court had no jurisdiction to consider the claim and therefore the claim was ill founded. On the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August Hill Dickinson filed an Acknowledgment of Service indicating that the claim would be defended and the court’s jurisdiction challenged. On the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August the Admiralty Marshal reported that the original service of the claim form and arrest documents had been ineffective and asked whether the Claimants required him to re-serve them to which Penningtons responded positively despite the fact that, from an early stage Penningtons were, as is shown by their correspondence with the Admiralty Marshal and others, indicating concerns as to their clients’ possible liability for harbour dues arising from the undertaking given to the Marshal in ADM4. On the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August Penningtons sent the email which, whilst indicating that the vessel was to be released, stated that the Claimants did not accept that the charter had been terminated and that the claim was going to be maintained. The wording of the that email does not indicate that the Claimants are intending to discontinue and it was reasonable for those at Hill Dickinson to take the Claimants’ message at face value and assume that the Claimants intended to continue however poor the Claimants’ position was. </p>

That refers to Mr Moisley’s witness statement dated the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November which had just been received from Penningtons and to the draft order proposed by the Claimants. It is clearly apparent from Mr Haddon’s email that the draft order contained parts which were not acceptable and  novel. In the paragraph numbered 4 in Mr Haddon’s email he refers to paragraph 3 of the draft order and reiterates the point made earlier by Hill Dickinson that the First Defendant was entitled to its costs of the claim until discontinuance, not just of the arrest. In the numbered paragraph 5 of the email Mr Haddon states that paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft order are not agreed. He states: “<span style="font-style:italic">First we strongly object to a completely new issue being raised just 3 clear working days before the scheduled CMC. Contrary to what is stated in your draft order 4, there has been no application made by your clients for wasted costs by reason of the First Defendant’s assertion that the Admiralty Marshal was liable to pay the port charges incurred during the period of arrest. You have had some 6 weeks since the CMC date was set down to amend the application. You have at no time previously suggested your clients would be looking to recover any aspect of costs and it is totally out of order to suggest that we are to prepare, file and serve written submissions on a totally new aspect of costs by tomorrow</span>”.  From the foregoing it is abundantly clear that the first time the Claimants put forward a case (that they were entitled to the costs which they now claim) was in that draft order. It is also to be noted that Mr Moisley’s second witness statement contains no material at all which supports the Claimants’ present case on costs. </p>

I think that is possibly a submission made with the benefit of hindsight but it has some force. The communications included in the hearing bundle appear to indicate that Penningtons had a real concern as to the possible level of dues which might be claimed by Tilbury and became further concerned that, if those were paid by the Admiralty </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">Marshal, they could be included as part of the Marshal’s expenses. Although there is no evidence which indicates that the Marshal had committed to paying the harbour dues or that he would actually do so there is one email which intimates that he could look to Penningtons for a recovery under the undertakings. However it is important to note that, pursuant to Brandon J’s guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">The Queen of the South</span>, the Admiralty Marshal will not pay such costs without the sanction of the Admiralty Registrar or the Admiralty Judge and, where a party is concerned about such matters the appropriate means of dealing with those concerns is to ask the Marshal to make an application to the Registrar on notice to themselves for directions as to whether the payment should be made or, in the very unlikely event that, he refused to do so, to make an application to the court themselves. That course apparently accords with the advice given to the Penningtons by counsel. In these circumstances although Penningtons do not appear to have fully engaged with the Marshal on the question of him paying the harbour dues (which would have been the sensible course) they did make an application for the guidance of the court with respect to those dues. Therefore I do not think that Penningtons should be criticised for that <span style="font-style:italic">per se. </span>However it must be recognised that such an application must have been to consider an apparent  difference of views between themselves and the Marshal. The necessity to do so, as Penningtons clearly recognised in their email of the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September referred to above, had nothing to do with the Owner but was to clarify the Claimants’ own position arising out of their arrest of the vessel. In those circumstances this would simply be a matter arising from the circumstances surrounding the arrest of this particular vessel and there is no reason at all why the Owner should have to face an order for costs with respect to a matter which was not of their making. However that is not to say that the conduct of the Claimants with respect to their handling of this matter overall  is without fault and not worthy of criticism as set out below. </p>

However, even on a summary assessment, it is necessary for the court to indicate upon which basis it is making the assessment. By reference to the cases cited at paragraph 44.3.9 of the White Book, it is appropriate to proceed on an indemnity basis where the conduct of a party or other circumstances of a case take the situation ‘out of the norm’, see <span style="font-style:italic">Excelsior Commercial and Industrial Holdings Ltd </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 879.

Further it is not the law that an indemnity order will only be made where the unreasonable conduct of the paying party increased the costs recoverable by the receiving party, see <span style="font-style:italic">Phoenix Finance Ltd v Federation Internationale de L’Automobile </span>[2002] EWHC 1242 (Ch) <span style="font-style:italic">per </span> Sir Andrew Morritt VC. </p>

The Claimants have not contended that those costs were disproportionate and it is clear that they were not.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In Part 2 the First Defendant claims costs amounting to £20,285.50 for the period between 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. Mr Henderson has informed the court that they do not include costs arising from negotiating and liaising with the Port Authority and having considered the documents schedule I accept that assurance and consider that the work done relates to Hill Dickinson having to deal with the case until it was discontinued and thereafter with regard to the costs claim and was reasonable. In paragraph 30 of their submissions Penningtons have submitted: (i) that the Claimants should not have to pay the First Defendant’s costs of the MCA detention and (ii) that the time spent on documents was excessive in circumstances where it has not provided any documents nor served evidence. The only reference to the MCA in the First Defendant’s document schedule appears in items 3 and 4. Item 3 is for 1.2 hours of time by a junior member of Hill Dickinson for a review of the grounds for MCA detention arising from the ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Claimants’ allegations in their witness statement</span>”. It also appears that a small part of item 4 may be a reference to some further consideration of this by more senior members of Hill Dickinson which is understandable. It therefore appears that Hill Dickinson’s work regarding the MCA was brief and arose from the contents of the Claimants’ witness statement. It follows that it related to a matter raised by the Claimants, as part of the dispute between the Claimants and the First Defendant and it is therefore recoverable. Aside from that I can find no other reference to work performed by Hill Dickinson relating to the MCA and I do not consider that Pennington’s objection is made good. Further I do not accept Penningtons’ submission that Hill Dickinson spent an excessive amount of time working on the documents. The work performed by Hill Dickinson is set out in their schedule and was, in my view, all work directly related to the matters being raised by the Claimants. Furthermore the time spent by the 2 main members of the Hill Dickinson team, Mr Haddon and Ms Rosie Goncare, was 11.9 and 27.4 hours respectively giving a combined total of 39.3 hours. That compares reasonably with the times put forward by Penningtons team of Mr Moisley and Mr Cheuk of about 23.7 and 22.6 hours respectively, totalling 46.3 hours. It is interesting to note that, the senior member of the Claimants’ team, Mr Moisley, was engaged for about twice the time that Mr Haddon was involved. In my judgment the Claimants’ criticism of Hill Dickinson’s time spent has not been made out, the First Defendant’s costs were reasonably incurred and it should  be awarded the full sum of £20,285.50 claimed for Part 2. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally in Part 3 Hill Dickinson have put forward an estimated claim of £6,345 for the work done on preparing the costs submissions. For the solicitors most of work was done by Ms Goncare and Mr Martin Rothwell, a costs lawyer. That work apparently included attending upon Mr Henderson, whose fees are put forward as £3,000 for both advising in conference and preparing the costs submissions. When compared with the Claimants’ claim for counsel’s fees of £8,485 for only advising Mr Henderson’s fees appear very reasonable indeed although I accept that he is some 12 years more junior than Claimant’s counsel. I accept that it was proper and reasonable for the First Defendant’s solicitors to have played a part in the preparation of the written submissions and to charge for that work. In my judgment the sum of £6,345 put forward by Hill Dickinson for the preparation of the submissions was reasonable and is recoverable.</p>
