The claims are respectively for €275,863.00 and<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> </span>€123,884 in respect of travel agency services for the transport of crew to and from the vessels.  The period during which such services were provided was from 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020.  Some, though not all, of the costs were incurred in repatriating crew following the lay-up of the vessels in Tilbury due to the pandemic.  By Forms ADM13 dated 11 December 2020, Aspida has claimed judgment in default.  Those applications were served on the other persons claiming against the vessels.  Objection has been taken to the claims by a group of claimants represented by Salvus Law, (“the Salvus Claimants”), and by the former owners of the vessels, Carnival Plc (“Carnival”).  The objection to the claims is that they do not meet the requirements of section 21 of the Senior Courts Act.  Section 21(4) is in the following terms: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.00in">As a general proposition, the law frowns upon a person who both “approbates and reprobates”.  “A man cannot adopt two inconsistent attitudes towards another: he must elect between them and, having elected to adopt one stance, cannot thereafter be permitted to go back and adopt an inconsistent stance”; see <span style="font-style:italic">Express Newspapers Plc v News (UK) Ltd &amp; Ors</span> [1990] 1 WLR 1320 at 1330.  But no breach of that principle has been demonstrated, nor any sound legal basis to elevate it into some kind of estoppel in Aspida’s favour.  Following the hearing on 2 September 2020, Carnival held off from terminating the charters for 5 weeks, which was ample further time for claimants to bring claims.  On the evidence that I have (which only consists of Mr Fidoe’s email) they did not give a completely open-ended assurance and nothing to that effect appears in the orders.  The reference to “an <span style="font-style:italic">absolute</span> cutoff date” is inconsistent with an open-ended assurance.  Further, if they had, there is no evidence that Aspida relied on it.  Finally, even if there was an assurance and Aspida had relied upon it, it is hard to see how that could confer jurisdiction under section 21(4) where the requirements of that section were not met.  As Ms Honey, for Carnival, observed during the hearing, how that state of affairs came about is neither here nor there – a person either satisfies section 21(4) or they do not. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.00in">The second limb of this part of Aspida’s argument was that the demise charters were not validly terminated.  The letters dated 7 &amp; 9 October 2020 from WFW acting on behalf of Carnival purported to terminate the charter agreements “under clause 22 and at common law” and with immediate effect.  No hire payments had been made since June 2020 and the vessels had effectively been abandoned due to the insolvency of the CMV group.  That situation had already forced Carnival reluctantly to retake possession of the vessels on 4 August 2020 by installing V.Ships as protective managers.  By reference to the detailed provisions of clause 22, Mr Joseph, for Aspida, attempted to persuade me that Carnival’s legal right to terminate was constrained by the need to serve a 30 day notice giving Mythic and Lyric the opportunity to remedy the breaches of the charter agreements.  The difficulty with this is that Carnival terminated both under clause 22 <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> at common law.  “One starts with the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising by operation of law, and clear express words must be used in order to rebut this presumption”: Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd</span> [1974] A.C. 689 at 717; see also the discussion in Chitty on Contracts, 33<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Ed at 22-049.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">my view, such words are not found in clause 22 and nor can they be implied.  It follows that Carnival were free to exercise their common law right to terminate.  But if I am wrong about that, I would find that even if clause 22 qualified Carnival’s common law rights, their unequivocal immediate termination (which drew no protest at the time) was still effective.  I would so find for two reasons, which are related.  The first is that the charterers had abandoned the vessels.  That was a circumstance which (a) amounted to the clearest possible repudiation / renunciation and which (b) did not squarely fall into any of the categories contemplated by clause 22.  It follows that the notice provisions of clause 22 did not apply.  The second is that in such circumstances and where the owner had already resumed possession and control of the vessels the contracts cannot sensibly be said to have remained on foot.  The common sense and commercial reality is that the contractual relationship was over and any failure on Carnival’s part to give notice could only sound in damages. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.00in">Mr Joseph had a subsidiary point, which was that for the termination to take effect the vessels had to be re-possessed by Carnival <span style="font-style:italic">qua</span> owners.  Carnival did precisely this when they installed V.Ships as managers on 4 August 2020.  They had retaken possession before the termination of the charters.  They had little choice in the matter.  The evidence of Mr Handley demonstrates that Carnival’s motivation in appointing V.Ships was to maintain safe and lawful operation of the vessels, with the particular interests of the crew in mind.  If there is a requirement to retake possession as an owner in order validly to complete a termination, then that requirement was amply met in these cases. </p>

They did not.  It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether the principle could be extended to the case of a demise charterer (whose charter, if still on foot, would be terminated by the sale) or whether the demise charterer could then be regarded as the beneficial owner of the proceeds of sale. </p>

Mr Joseph submitted that those orders had to be interpreted in a way that was not misleading and that “if judicial sale extinguished the possibility of further claims” then that principle was transgressed.  It is debateable whether a standard form court direction could suspend or negate what would otherwise be the effect of section 21(4).  But it does not assist Aspida in this case.  It was not the judicial sales that extinguished the possibility of their claims.  It was the earlier termination of the demise charters. </p>

This was because the demise charters to Mythic and Lyric were hire purchase agreements which contained options to purchase.  It is hard to see how an unexercised option to purchase could give Mythic or Lyric a beneficial interest in the proceeds of a judicial sale.  But the options could not have survived the termination of the demise charters and the point is academic. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.00in">Aspida’s final broad point was that, in any event, they had valid claims against Carnival (who were beneficial owners of the vessels).  I read the evidence and heard Mr Joseph’s arguments on this point notwithstanding the objections of Ms Honey and Mr Mukherjee that the point had been sprung upon them.  I said that I was reluctant to bifurcate the hearing and that I would deal with the point, if I was able to and could do so without unfairness to the other parties.  For the reasons that follow, I cannot do that and this part of the claim must be adjourned.  The claims against Carnival are based upon evidence (filed the day before the hearing) from Mr Matthaios of Aspida that he was told by Mr Ioannides of Global Cruise Lines Ltd (“Global”), the managing agents of the vessels, that Global were acting on behalf of both the charterers <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> the owners in contracting for air tickets for repatriation.  Mr Joseph argued that Global also had ostensible or usual authority to act for the owners.  This evidence was highly contentious.  Ms Honey and Mr Mukherjee were correct to point out that there was no evidence (other than Mr Ioannides’ implied assertion) that Global were expressly authorised by Carnival, or that Carnival had clothed Global with authority so as to support the plea of apparent authority.  They were similarly correct to observe that it was difficult, if not impossible, to assert that an agent appointed by the demise charterers had usual authority to act for the owner.  For these reasons, I have come close to rejecting these claims <span style="font-style:italic">in limine</span>.  I have not done that.  But, plainly, I must give Carnival a proper opportunity to respond, (which would include the opportunity to seek an order that they be permitted to cross-examine Mr Matthaios). </p>
