At about 0530 (local time, or 0130 UTC) a fire alarm sounded indicating a fire in the unmanned engine room. Fire fighting took place consisting of boundary cooling and injection of CO2 into the engine room. Shortly afterwards the vessel was observed to be listing to port and her master and crew abandoned her into two lifeboats. They were taken on board by a passing merchant ship. Over the next four days the vessel continued to take on water until she sank on 3 April at 1055 (local time).  </p>

The burden of proving such conduct lies upon the person challenging the right to limit, in this case, Cargo. That burden was described by Sheen J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Bowbelle</span> [1990] 1 WLR 1330 as a "very heavy burden", which description has been approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">The Leerort </span>[2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 291 and by the Privy Council in <span style="font-style:italic">The Cape Bari</span> [2016] UKPC 20. The burden is "very heavy" because of the nature of the conduct which must be proved to break the right to limit. It was described by Lord Clarke in <span style="font-style:italic">The Cape Bari</span> at paragraph 14 as "a high hurdle to jump". Cargo seeks to jump that hurdle in the present case, and thereby break the right to limit, by alleging that the Owners scuttled the vessel. It is said that the fire was deliberately started and that the sinking was carried out upon the instruction of the <span style="font-style:italic">alter ego</span> of the Owners, Mr. Ahmet Ali Agaoglu, the sole shareholder and director. If that case is proved then it is said that the loss suffered by Cargo resulted from the personal act or omission of the Owners committed with the intent to cause such loss.  </p>

The two situations are not identical; for example, the shipowner claiming on his hull insurance policy must prove that the loss was caused by an insured peril whereas the shipowner claiming a right to limit bears no such burden of proof. But I accept that in determining whether Cargo has proved on the balance of probabilities that the vessel was scuttled in a limitation action the court should follow the same approach as it does when determining whether a hull underwriter has proved on the balance of probabilities that a vessel was scuttled. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE sank in deep water. The wreck has not been inspected with a view to determining the cause of the fire or the cause of the sinking. The available evidence as to mechanism is therefore limited and consists of surveys of the vessel prior to the final voyage, the observations of the fire by the chief engineer and second engineer and photographs of the vessel taken after the vessel had been abandoned and before she sank. In such circumstances it is inevitable that Cargo will be unable to give a full and complete account of the alleged scuttling (and unsurprising if the account changes as the litigation proceeds). That need not be fatal to Cargo’s case so long as, after examining all of the evidence, the court is able to infer that the vessel was scuttled on the instructions of Mr. Agaoglu. In deciding whether the court is able to draw such inference the court must keep well in mind that it is possible, especially where the evidence is limited, that the case may be one where Cargo is unable to establish its case with the result that the cause of the loss remains in doubt and the court is unable to make a finding as to the cause of the loss; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Popi M</span><span> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">[</span>1985] 2 Ll.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The court will only be able to draw such inference when the case is established on the balance of probabilities. Shipowners do not generally resort to scuttling and an allegation that a shipowner has done so is a grave charge to make. Thus, as Aikens J. said in <span style="font-style:italic">The Milasan</span>, “effectively the standard of proof will fall not far short of the criminal standard”. Precisely what that means and how the court determines whether the charge of scuttling has been proved on the balance of probabilities has been elucidated in the cases, in particular by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">National Justice Compania Naviera SA v Prudential Assurance (The Ikarian Reefer)</span> [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 455.  Thus, if Cargo is unable to exclude “a substantial as opposed to a fanciful or remote possibility that the loss was accidental” the court will be unable to draw the inference. But “the mere existence of an opposing possibility does not prevent the balance from tilting heavily and sufficiently far in favour of the insurers” (see p.459 rhc). To the same effect is the following later passage, “there must be a real or plausible explanation which is supported by the evidence, or at the least is not inconsistent with it……..It imposes too high a burden on the underwriters to say that such witnesses must be telling the truth unless the underwriters prove their accounts are impossible” (see p. 484 lhc). In <span style="font-style:italic">Strive Shipping v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association (The Grecia Express)</span> [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 88 at pp. 97-99 Colman J. concluded that it must be "highly improbable” that the vessel was lost accidentally and that there must be derived from the whole of the evidence “a high level of confidence that the allegation is true.” As Aikens J. said in <span style="font-style:italic">The Milasan</span>, the facts proved against the owner must be "sufficiently unambiguous" to establish that the owner was complicit in the casting away of his vessel. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cargo's case is that those involved in the conspiracy to scuttle the vessel were the master and chief engineer and, in the office, Mr. Agaoglu, Captain Toran, the chief executive officer or fleet manager of the Owners, and Captains Taner and Mahmut, two deck superintendents. They, and other witnesses of fact called by the Owners, were Turkish. Some gave their evidence in English, such as the master and Captain Toran, using the interpreter when necessary. Others gave their evidence through an interpreter, such as Mr. Agaoglu and the chief engineer. The alleged conspirators all denied the serious allegations put to them. Determining whether they were telling the truth or lying depends upon a consideration of all the evidence in the case. There are several reasons for that. First, a fact-finding judge can gain little from the demeanour of a witness when the witness is foreign, comes from a different culture and does not give evidence in his first language or does so through an interpreter; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Business of Judging</span> by Tom Bingham at p.11. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Ikarian Reefer</span> at p.484 lhc para. (4) Stuart-Smith LJ said that “most experienced judges recognise that it is not easy to tell whether a witness is telling the truth, particularly if the evidence is given through an interpreter.” Second, in all cases, but especially in those cases where scuttling is alleged, the assessment of the reliability of a witness depends, not only upon a consideration of the extent to which his evidence is consistent with what is not in dispute, is internally consistent and is consistent with what the witness has said on other occasions but also upon a consideration of the extent to which his evidence is consistent with the probabilities. That involves placing the evidence in the context of the case as a whole. As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ikarian Reefer</span> at p.484 lhc para. (4) the evidence of those impugned “has to be tested in the light of the probabilities and the evidence as a whole”. Third, other aspects of the evidence will or may have a bearing upon whether their evidence is true. For example, if no real or substantial explanation can be put forward to explain an accidental loss of the vessel, that will or may have a bearing upon whether factual evidence that the loss was accidental is true; see the approach of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ikarian Reefer</span> at p.484 lhc para. (3) to the issues in that case.  </p>

Thus the accounts recorded that Mr. Agaoglu had contributed US$3.5m to the share capital of the Owners. There was no documentary evidence that he had done so and the document provided by the Owners’ solicitors as evidence of such a contribution was in fact evidence that the Owners’ Netherlands based bank Credit Europe Bank (“CEB”) had lent $3.5 million to the Owners in 2011. In fact, a document (disclosed very shortly before the trial) recorded that Mr. Agaoglu had actually provided capital of only US$2,000. Also, the accounts recorded that the “cost” of the vessel was US$19.8m. when in fact it was US$15m. He referred in his third statement to a valuation of the vessel in the sum of US$18.5m. but that valuation is undated (and Captain Toran in his disclosure statement said that no vessel valuations had been obtained between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013) and is any event not in the figure of US$19.8m. There was no evidence from the company’s auditors as to the provenance of this figure. The fact that these two misrepresentations in the Owners' audited accounts had been approved by Mr. Agaoglu suggested that he was prepared to make statements in important documents which were not true. </p>

He said that whilst there may have been some marginal reduction of the borrowings due from Capella (another company in the same group which owned the vessel ATLANTIK GLORY), the remainder of the fleet received no benefit. However, it appears from the analysis carried out by Mr. King of Moore Stephens LLP (which was not challenged by any accountant’s report commissioned by the Owners) that that was not so. In fact, whilst Kairos used the greater part of some US$20.29m. paid by the brokers Willis to discharge part of its indebtedness to CEB (and Capella used the US$1.6m. paid by the brokers Willis to discharge part of its indebtedness to CEB) some of the insurance proceeds, approximately US$4.56m., were transferred by Kairos to other companies within the group, including the owners of ATLANTIK GLORY, ATLANTIK MIRACLE and ATLANTIK PRIDE. Of that sum of US$4.56m. some US$1.5m. consisted of unidentified transfers. Mr. Agaoglu accepted that his witness statement was not accurate in this regard but he maintained that it was not a lie. However, I found it very difficult to accept that Mr. Agaoglu did not know that US$4.56m. of the proceeds had been used for the benefit of other owning companies within the Atlantik group when he made his statement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, other aspects of his evidence did not suggest that he was a reliable witness. He was reluctant to accept that a loan from CEB of some $437,000 had been required to pay for the dry docking in January and February 2013 when he had said in his statement that the Owners had paid for the dry docking “with the full support of CEB” which, when asked, he accepted meant that the Bank had lent that sum of money. He also said that he was unaware that the loan agreement with CEB required an asset/loan ratio of 130%. It is improbable that he was unaware of that. His difficulty in accepting that if the market value of the vessel had been used in the company’s accounts the company would have been “balance sheet insolvent” suggested that he was unwilling to accept matters which were obvious. For example, the audited accounts showed that Kairos had net assets of US$2.38m. at the end of December 2012 whereas when the market value of ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE was taken into account Kairos had net liabilities of over US$9m. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition to being a witness in the case Captain Toran had made statements concerning disclosure by the Owners. There does not now appear to be any dispute that, although a considerable amount of material was disclosed, the disclosure process was not conducted in an appropriate manner. Large amounts of documentation were produced just before the trial and during the trial. Mr. Robert Thomas QC, in his closing submissions on behalf of the Owners, apologised to the court for the most unsatisfactory way in which disclosure was handled. Some aspects of the unsatisfactory disclosure were not, I was told, the fault of Captain Toran. For instance, although the Owners disclosed the vessel’s technical plans to their solicitors Clyde and Co., the latter provided the plans to their experts but only disclosed to Cargo such plans as their experts suggested should be disclosed. The result was that Cargo’s experts did not have the plans which the Owners’ experts had and saw some of them for the first time when cross-examined. That was unfair; but it was not the responsibility of Captain Toran. However, when Cargo’s solicitors Holman Fenwick Willan LLP (“HFW”) sought better copies of certain plans (poor copies having been supplied) Captain Toran said that no better copies were available. Had he checked what had been provided and compared that with the plans supplied to Clyde and Co. he would have seen that better copies were available. This first became apparent during the trial and was confirmed after the trial when Clyde and Co. supplied HFW with a full set of the plans which had been received from the Owners. Moreover, there are two further aspects of the unsatisfactory disclosure which were his responsibility. The first was the financial disclosure and the second was the photographic disclosure. I shall deal with the former when dealing with the question of Motive. The latter I shall deal with now. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The photographs were the most important evidence for the naval architects to study in forming their views as to the compartments which had flooded and in what sequence. This was observed by HFW when making an application for specific disclosure of the photographic metadata in March 2015. Captain Toran replied in his disclosure statement dated 14 May 2015 that “electronic copies of all photographs in the [Owners’] possession have been provided to HFW on 14 January 2015. Therefore, HFW have just as much access to the metadata as we have.” Notwithstanding this response, during the trial and following the electrician’s evidence, the Owners disclosed the metadata for the electrician’s photographs. This disclosure, on 22 April 2016, after Day 8 of the trial, required the naval architects to reconsider their work. Other “photographic” developments during the trial included (a) the evidence of Captain Taner (one of the superintendents who went to the vessel after she had been abandoned and before she sank) that he had taken photographs on 2 April 2013 when no photographs for that date had been identified at that time and (b) the evidence of Mr. Uzun (the Owners' insurance broker) that photographs which had been disclosed as having been taken by the Omani coastguard had in fact been taken by a private company. Captain Toran was asked during his cross-examination to explain why the metadata from the electrician’s photographs had only been produced a few days earlier. He replied that he had not known what metadata was and had discovered from the internet that it was the date of the photograph. He said that it was very hard to collect all the metadata and so he had put all the photographs into one file (I assume an electronic file) which he sent to Clyde and Co. in 2013. Then, the week before he gave evidence, he said he had done the same again. He was asked again why the metadata from the electrician’s photographs had only been provided the week before. He replied that counsel would have to explain what is meant by metadata. </p>

If he did not I have no doubt that Clyde and Co. would have explained it to him. Since the metadata for the electrician's photographs was not supplied to Clyde and Co. in 2013 but was supplied to Clyde and Co. in 2016 during the trial I can only infer that Captain Toran in fact supplied to Clyde and Co. during the trial electronic data which he had not previously supplied. The electrician had given evidence that he had supplied his photographs to the Owners on a memory stick. Whether that memory stick was located I do not know. It would appear that Captain Toran did not give a full and frank explanation as to why the metadata for the electrician’s photographs was only supplied during the trial after the electrician had given evidence. Mr. Thomas’ closing submissions at paragraphs 352-361 contain no such explanation.</p>

He made no reference to the fact that the Owners had in fact instructed the master what route to take on 25 March 2013.

His explanation for these (and other suggested errors) was that his first and second statements had been written in English which he did not understand and had not been translated for him. He said in his oral evidence that he had written a manuscript statement of the events for his own purposes before he gave his second statement which was dated 19 November 2014. In his third witness statement dated 7 April 2016 he had said that he had prepared the manuscript statement in April 2013 and in re-examination he suggested that it might have been written shortly after his first statement.

I am doubtful that he did not sufficiently understand English to understand what he had said in his statement. He was interviewed by representatives of Clyde and Co. and of Norton Rose. Before the interviews Norton Rose had asked whether the crew spoke English and had been informed that the master and officers should be fluent. Mr. Nigel Jacobs QC, on behalf of Cargo, submitted that Clyde and Co. and Norton Rose would not have allowed a witness to make and sign a statement in a language which he did not understand when they interviewed him face to face. Certainly, one would not expect them to do so. The second statement, also in English, was expressly for the purpose of clarifying the first statement and yet did not suggest that he did not understand English or that he had not understood his first statement. The suggestion that it had not been translated for him was made for the first time in the chief engineer’s third statement dated 7 April 2016.

I would have expected him to have wished to check that the statement he signed on 25 April 2013 accurately stated what he intended to say about the circumstances of the loss of the vessel on which he had served as chief engineer and on which there had been a fire in the engine room. It was after all, at that date, his only account of those circumstances. I am also surprised that if he had written his manuscript statement before he made his second statement in November 2014 he did not provide the Owners or their solicitors with his manuscript statement when making his second statement. If, as he said in re-examination, he prepared it shortly after making his first statement I would have expected him to have provided it to the Owners without delay, particularly if his first statement had not been translated for him. </p>

In his supplementary statement he had said that the power pack was left on standby whilst the vessel was at sea. When asked why this was done, given that no ballast operations would ordinarily be required at sea, he was unable to give any answer, save to refer to his statement. The explanation for this was probably that this voyage was the only time he had served on the vessel and, as he said in re-examination, he had not come across this particular ballast system before. In the result I did not find his written evidence as to the operation of system convincing.

That gave rise to the possibility that his recollection was mistaken in other respects. Shortly before the end of the trial late disclosure of some of his documents was made.

There was therefore an obvious limit to the value of his evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Nigel Jacobs QC, on behalf of Cargo, submitted that the fire was deliberately started in the store room using oil as an accelerant. The fire was extinguished because of the application of CO2 and because there was limited fuel for the fire in the store room. Cargo also say that the engine room, aft peak tank and nos. 5 and 4 double bottom tanks (portside) and their connected top side tanks were deliberately flooded. The engine room was flooded by shutting off the relevant valves of the lower sea water chest in the engine room, loosening the filter cover by slackening back the bolts and then opening a valve to let water enter the engine room. The aft peak tank, nos 5 and 4 double bottoms (portside) and their connected top side tanks were flooded by deliberately ballasting them. Some further flooding into the steering gear room and other spaces aft occurred as a result of down flooding. Cargo say that this was assisted by the opening of the door to the steering gear room on the poop deck.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is accepted by Cargo that the flooding of the engine room, aft peak tank, nos. 5 and 4 double bottom tanks (portside) and connected top side tanks and the steering gear room would not have caused the vessel to sink. Cargo further accepted that the vessel sank because, in addition, hold no.5 flooded. However, Cargo does not suggest that hold no.5 was deliberately flooded. Cargo’s case (advanced very late in the day, in part after the pre-trial review and before the commencement of the trial) is that hold no.5 flooded as a result of down flooding through the hatch cover, inspection hatch and air vent. That occurred as the vessel, whilst listing to port, lay beam on to the wind and swell causing water to flow across the deck and enter the no.5 hold. Thus, on Cargo’s case, those who deliberately flooded the vessel achieved their aim of sinking the vessel because, in addition to the flooding caused by their own efforts, down flooding of hold no.5 occurred when the weather worsened. In answer to the point that those who plan to sink a vessel would not restrict their efforts to flooding a number of spaces which would not cause the vessel to sink Mr. Jacobs said in his closing address that those responsible for the sinking probably did not know what extent of flooding would cause the vessel to sink and perhaps thought that the spaces they flooded were sufficient to flood the vessel. With regard to the fact that only 2 ballast tanks were flooded Cargo had pleaded that those responsible for the sinking did not deliberately flood all the ballast tanks because to do so would have raised suspicions as to the deliberate nature of the casualty. In his oral opening Mr. Jacobs made a different point. He said that those who opened the ballast lines might well have intended to flood more of the ballast tanks but for some reason the ballast valves failed to open because, for example, there might only have been enough hydraulic pressure to open four ballast valves.     </p>

He prefers not to call it a “case” because the Owners do not bear any burden of proof. I accept that the Owners do not bear any burden of proof but it is obviously sensible for the Owners to put forward a scenario or case that the fire and sinking were accidental, if they can. If such scenario or case is real or substantial rather than remote or fanciful and Cargo is unable to exclude it then Cargo will fail to discharge the burden of proof which they bear. It is therefore helpful also to set out at this stage the Owners’ scenario or case. I will, for convenience, refer to it as the Owners’ case whilst accepting that the Owners bear no burden of proof and that the court’s task is not simply to decide which of two cases it prefers but to decide whether Cargo has proved its case to the required standard. </p>

The Owners say that such a fire could have spread into the store room.  The Owners also say that the fire could have led to a crack developing in the vessel’s shell plating below the waterline thereby causing the engine room to flood. The fire could also have created a “flashover” capable of attacking the cables which control the activation of the solenoids for the ballast valves thereby causing double bottom tanks 5 and 4 (and their associated topside tanks) to flood. Separately, as a result of mechanical damage to ballast piping in cargo hold no.5 or of damage to such piping by corrosion, water also leaked into that hold when no.5 double bottom tank had flooded. </p>

The subjects covered included fire investigation, marine engineering, metallurgy, fluid dynamics, electrical engineering and naval architecture together with photogrammetry. The paucity of evidence as to what actually happened together with the detail and complexity of some of the matters debated meant that cases originally advanced were modified or abandoned during the trial as particular matters were studied in more depth than had been the case when the initial or even later reports had been produced. In addition, new points emerged during the trial, as did some technical documents relating to the vessel together with the metadata to the electrician's photographs.  These matters led to the revision of views previously formed. The discussions between the experts also caused views to be revised; that is to be expected and is part of the purpose of such discussions. Although some criticism of Cargo and its experts was advanced in this regard it was not justified. What happened was not unusual or deserving of censure.

He is a fire investigator and mechanical engineer with some understanding of electrical engineering, though no particular experience of electrical engineering on board vessels, save to the extent that it related to his investigation of fires. He has been investigating fires for some 10 years. He expressed opinions with regard to electrical engineering, hydraulic engineering and combustion engineering (of which he had experience before becoming a fire investigator) which I did not regard as impermissible given his training and experience and that he was commenting upon the cause and effects of the fire. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He gave his evidence in a measured and reasoned manner. When asked to explain his opinion he was able to do so concisely and with clarity. In that regard he was an impressive and cogent witness. However, in other respects his evidence suggested that the court should examine his evidence with care before accepting it. First, during the course of his investigation of the fire he had made some mistakes. For example he had misread the electrical diagram of the ballast solenoids; he thought there was a fail-safe device (operated by a spring) when there was not (there was no spring shown). He had also misunderstood a research article; he thought it dealt with the rate at which fire could spread when in fact it considered the rate at which a fire consumed fuel. These (and other) errors (which Dr. Kelman accepted when they were pointed out) are evidence that, with regard to the subject-matter of those errors, he failed to exercise sufficient care when advancing his opinions in this case. Second, there was at least one occasion during his cross-examination when he accepted that he was in error but nevertheless maintained the conclusion he had drawn but for reasons put forward for the first time in the witness box. Thus he had said that no hot gases would be trapped under the deckhead of the store room and had concluded that there was no possibility of a “flashover". Having accepted in cross-examination that some hot gases would be trapped he then articulated another basis for maintaining his conclusion. This was open to the interpretation that he was willing to say what he could to support Cargo’s case. However, the alternative basis for maintaining his conclusion could well have been his honest belief. But even if that were so, as I think it was, the episode indicated that the court, before accepting any views expressed for the first time in the witness box, should carefully consider those views. Third, during the trial he prepared a further report in which he sought to describe, based on photographs and some undisclosed researches of manufacturers, the relative positions of the particular electrical cables within their steel sheath. In the two sheaths in question there were 33 cables in one and 26 cables in the other. Photographs of cables on a sister ship enabled him to identify the position of two cables in one sheath and of one cable in the other. A photograph of another sheath suggested that the cables were placed within the sheaths in an ordered manner and he assumed that that ordered manner applied also to the sheaths in question. It seemed to me that this was an unsure basis upon which to form an opinion as to the relative positions of the cables within the sheaths and that, if an opinion were to be expressed on this matter, it ought to have been expressed in much more tentative terms than those he used. Another example of Dr. Kelman expressing his view in dogmatic terms, when more guarded terms would have been appropriate, concerned the question whether it was possible for an oil spray from the high pressure fuel pipe to reach the turbo charger. He suggested that that was not possible when it was possible. He accepted that his opinion in this regard had been reached too hastily. </p>

Having carefully considered this matter I do not consider that that would be a fair conclusion to draw. I accept that he could and should have exercised more care than he did with regard to certain matters. I also accept that he was willing to express a clear view on matters which justified more guarded language. His opinion as to the respective positions of the cables within the sheaths was, in my judgment, a clear illustration of that. But I do not accept that he set out to be anything other than objective and fair. On the contrary, I gained the clear impression that he was seeking to express his honest and objective opinion. Nevertheless, he is capable of error and of reaching clear conclusions when he should have been more cautious. When assessing his evidence and the assistance which the court can gain from it I must keep that well in mind. Further, if any part of Cargo’s case depends upon views of Dr. Kelman expressed for the first time in the witness box, I must examine those views very carefully before accepting them.</p>

He obviously relied heavily on his own experience as a chief engineer at sea. He, like Dr. Kelman, had made some errors in his reports and had made certain assumptions. It was suggested to him in cross-examination that he had given a dishonest explanation of at least one of his errors. I was wholly unpersuaded that his explanation had been dishonest. It appeared to me that the reason for his errors had been either that he had initially been provided with poor copies of the ship's plans or that he had not exercised sufficient care when reading them. It may be that he was also too ready to rely upon his own experience without checking it against the evidence in the case. This appeared to have been particularly so with regard to his criticism of the master’s conduct in the matter of fire fighting. In that regard he made assumptions when he should not have done so. However, I do not consider that he made assumptions in order to advance Cargo’s case.

He explained that he deferred to Mr. Colman in terms of the “structural significance” of buckling. Nevertheless, it was surprising that he was reluctant to give his own opinion about the extent of buckling visible in the photographs, which must have been a matter within his own expertise.  He accepted that metallurgists examine the physical evidence to deduce what might have happened. Second, he appeared to concentrate on theoretical possibilities (to which he added in his oral evidence) without standing back and considering how realistic they were in the light of the photographic evidence. He said that without a finite element analysis (for which the data was not available) firm views could not be expressed. But nevertheless he made little attempt to relate his theories to the only evidence in the case, namely, the photographs.

This was a difficult task because of the paucity of evidence resulting from the fact that the vessel had sunk in deep water and there had been no inspection of the wreck. In truth, the only evidence available to the naval architects as to what happened were the photographs of the vessel after abandonment and before she sank. These were taken by, in particular, the electrician and fitter of ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE, those on board the vessels which came to the scene of the casualty and the crew of an aircraft chartered by the Owners to fly over the casualty. When originally disclosed some of the photographs had metadata (recording the date and time of the photograph) but others did not. In particular, the electrician’s photographs of which there over 80 did not. Certain assumptions about their timing were made. The naval architects exchanged some 6 reports before the hearing. They achieved considerable agreement as to the spaces which were likely to have been flooded in order to cause the vessel to sink. The principal spaces were the engine room, double ballast tanks nos. 4 and 5 port (and their associated topside tanks) and hold no.5. Having regard to the paucity of evidence it was, it seemed to me, remarkable that the naval architects were able to achieve this level of agreement. The photographs which enabled this agreement to be reached were primarily of 30 March 2013. Thereafter there was not a continuous photographic record. There were none for 31 March 2013. There were some (taken by an aircraft) for a period of less than an hour in the early morning of 1 April 2013. Initially it was thought that there were none for 2 April 2013 but then it was learnt that Captain Taner’s four photographs had been attached to an email dated 2 April 2013 and so must have been taken on that day when  he arrived on HEATHER. There were some for 3 April 2013 from 0700 until the vessel sank at 1103. <span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>When the electrician gave evidence he revealed that he had provided his photographs to the Owners on a memory stick. The result of this evidence being given in cross-examination was that the metadata for the electrician’s photographs was disclosed on 22 April 2016, after 8 days of the trial. That data (and the revision it brought about in the suggested timing of the fitter’s photograph) required the naval architects to re-evaluate their work and in a flurry of activity during the trial and right up to its end (the naval architects being the last experts to give evidence) 10 further reports were served. By the end of the trial there, however, three limited, but important, issues which remained in dispute between the naval architects: (i) whether the source of entry of water into the engine room was at a low level (the sea chest, Cargo’s case) or at the level of the second deck (a crack in the shell plating, the Owners’ case); (ii) whether, on Cargo’s case, down flooding of the steering gear room and other spaces aft occurred from a time before 0600 on 1 April 2013 and (iii) whether, on Cargo’s case, the only source of flooding into hold no.5 was down flooding on 3 April (as suggested by Cargo). All three of these issues were dependent on the photographs. </p>

In this case it was also necessary to deduce the draft of the vessel in certain of the photographs. That information enabled the mathematical model to be verified and for conclusions to be drawn as to the compartments which were likely to have been flooded and in what sequence so as to produce the “observed” drafts.

Thus, when the experts met, there were differences between them as to the assumptions fed into their models. These were considered and at their second meeting the naval architects agreed that the respective models were “consistent with each other, within expected tolerances.” (After the hearing the full set of plans was disclosed to Cargo’s experts. Mr. Jacobs informed me in written submissions that some of the plans, had they been disclosed at the proper time, might have resulted in Mr. Burnay producing a different model. Perhaps they would, but it is nevertheless likely, it seems to me, that, as agreed by the experts in their meeting, their respective models were within expected tolerances. Mr. Thomas’ response that the disclosure of additional plans would not have led to any materially different model is therefore likely to be correct.)  </p>

Unsurprisingly the naval architects reached different figures for the draft of the vessel as indicated by the photographs. For example the appendix to the memorandum of their first meeting recorded drafts assessed by Mr. Colman for one photograph as 10.9-11.3 metres and by Mr. Burnay as 10.5 metres. There were also differences in their assessment of trim and list. Their respective readings were considered and at their first meeting the naval architects agreed that their respective measurements were “consistent with the other, allowing for a reasonable tolerance on the measurement.” That Mr. Colman reached such an agreement was unsurprising because in his report he had said that “the distances off, perspectives, waves, ship motions and timing uncertainties associated with these photographs result in a level of error in the readings which is probably quite considerable.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider that Mr. Colman intended to be an advocate for his client’s case. He is an experienced expert witness and knows very well that that is not his role. But I do consider that Mr. Colman allowed his belief in the accuracy of his own work to cloud his objectivity. It seemed to me that his agreements at the experts’ meetings in February and March 2016 had displayed appropriate objectivity. For, whilst he had carefully assessed as best he could the draft of the vessel in the photographs, he nevertheless recognised that the exercise involved a margin of error so that although Mr. Burnay’s drafts were different they were nevertheless acceptable. When in June 2016 he hardened his opinions it seemed to me that, whilst I do not doubt his good faith in any way, he had forgotten, or more likely put to one side, those considerations which had caused him to make the agreement to which I have referred. Whilst in February 2016 he had appreciated the inherent difficulties in the exercise upon which he was engaged, in June 2016 he had persuaded himself that he had overcome those difficulties and that far from different views being possible only his were accurate. His later reports ignored the agreement he had earlier reached with Mr. Burnay. The late disclosure of the metadata for the electrician’s photographs meant that the timing uncertainties had been removed and the Rhino model was no doubt considered an improved method of reading off the drafts but there remained the problems mentioned in his first report of “the distances off, perspectives, waves, ship motions”. As a result, despite the very sensible agreement reached between the experts that their respective measurements were acceptable, towards the end of the trial there was criticism of Mr. Burnay’s use of the pilot ladder and guard rail (and, in response, criticism by Mr. Burnay of Mr. Colman’s measurement of the transom from the GA plan). Mr. Colman’s impaired sense of objectivity was also reflected in the unusually confrontational language used in his last report (“astonishing”, when commenting upon Mr. Burnay’s use of the pilot ladder to measure drafts; “this theory is at a lower level than A level maths. It should be completely clear to any engineer who has a degree with maths in the syllabus”, when explaining the “cubic” formula).  In his oral evidence he went so far as to accuse Mr. Burnay of dishonestly using only a particular analysis (a “quadratic” rather than a “cubic” analysis) in order to achieve a desired result. This was deeply improbable and an extreme view to express. When asked in cross-examination why he had used that analysis Mr. Burnay said that his computer had failed to return a cubic analysis, an answer which I accept, notwithstanding that Mr. Colman experienced no such difficulty when using Mr. Burnay’s own spreadsheet. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Burnay was also an able and skilled naval architect. There was however, it seemed to me, a difference between his approach to mathematical models and Mr. Colman’s approach to such models. Mr. Burnay had, I felt, less confidence in the value of mathematical models than Mr. Colman, at any rate for the purposes for which they used in this case, namely, to explain the flooding and sinking of the vessel. He accepted, as he said in his first report, that they can give “very precise answers and analysis” but the results are “based on the inputs involved”. Due to the “variable quality of the data available it is possible that individual list and/or trim comparison points cannot be perfectly recreated.” It was apparent from his oral evidence that he considered that whilst models could give some assistance in understanding what had happened they were not the complete answer. They were simply part of the evidence upon which he, as a naval architect, could express an opinion as to the mechanism by which a vessel had sunk. That evidence also included the photographs and what they suggested as to the spaces which were probably flooding between 1 and 3 April 2013. Perhaps for that reason (and perhaps also because he had been supplied with a poor copy of the vessel's GA plan and did not have the Docking plan until March 2016) his model contained inaccuracies. Some errors were repeated and not removed. This is not something Mr. Colman would have done but Mr. Burnay considered that in circumstances where a model could not be entirely accurate it did not matter and where the effect of the errors could not be significant there was no reason to start afresh. There were some errors which ought not to have made but the explanation for those errors did not, in my judgment, lie in any lack of objectivity on his part. Having read his reports, listened to his evidence and observed the manner in which he gave it I have no doubt that the opinions which he expressed were his honest opinions. I do not accept the suggestion that he was an advocate, rather than an expert, for Cargo.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Repeated comment was made of the fact that Mr. Burnay had put forward several flooding sequences to explain the casualty and that they had been superceded by others following criticisms and comment by Mr. Colman. This history probably shows that Mr. Colman is more adept and experienced in producing models than Mr. Burnay. Certainly, Mr. Colman’s model and proposed flooding sequence did not require substantial change in the manner that Mr. Burnay’s did. It also indicates that Mr. Burnay lacks Mr. Colman’s intellectual rigour when producing mathematical models and paying regard to what they show.  This was apparent in at least two respects. First, there was a discrepancy between the freeboard in way of certain down flooding points aft as indicated by his model for 1800 on 30 March 2016 and the freeboard in way of those points as indicated by the fitter’s photograph for, approximately, that time. He considered that the differences were not that great and were in fact “acceptably close enough within the modelling process and with all its variances to indicate that down flooding could then occur”. On an earlier occasion he had told me that he had run the model to the equilibrium point (that is when the level of water inside a flooded space is equivalent to the level of water outside) and that had placed the flooding points underwater. He later said that that was not correct “in literal terms”. In fact, when the model was run to the equilibrium point it became clear that none of the down flooding points was under water. The amount of freeboard was (depending upon what corrections for “errors” were made) more than half a meter. Second, although it was his opinion that the spaces aft had down flooded (based upon the photographic evidence) he had not attempted to calculate the effect of such down flooding on the draft of the vessel. He considered that such calculations do not stand up to scrutiny, are subjective and depend heavily on the assumptions made. I suspect he is right about that to some extent but the absence of any calculation means that I do not know whether it is feasible to suggest that the suggested down flooding could account for the suggested further increase in the vessel’s draft. It seemed to me that Mr. Colman’s model, being the result of greater intellectual rigour, was likely to be more reliable.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But at the end of the day there was much common ground between the naval architects as to which spaces were likely to have flooded in order to cause the vessel to sink. The important issues which remained were the three which I have mentioned. The first issue, whether the entry of water into the engine room was at a high or a low point depended upon the drafts as indicated by the photographs (and in particular one photograph) and the second and third issues, whether there could be down flooding of the spaces aft and of hold no.5, depended upon the extent to which water could realistically enter those spaces. These latter two issues went to the cause of the likely flooding of hold no.5. Mr. Colman’s opinion was that hold no.5 had flooded as a result of ballast water entering the hold (once ballast water had entered double bottom no.5 port) through a corroded or damaged pipe in the hold. His model showed that such a mechanism was consistent with the photographic evidence. At the end of the evidence I did not understand there to be any challenge to Mr. Colman’s model. Certainly, Mr. Jacobs’ closing address made no such challenge. However, Mr. Burnay’s model did not allow for any such flooding and instead Mr. Burnay suggested that water entered hold no.5 as a result of down flooding. Mr. Burnay’s difficulty, as was clear at the end of the evidence, was that his model was inconsistent with the fitter’s photograph which had no metadata but which, after comparison with the electrician’s photographs and their metadata, was estimated to have been taken at about 1800 on 30 March 2013. His model showed a vessel with considerably greater freeboard at the suggested down flooding points than was shown in the fitter’s photograph. This led Mr. Thomas to submit that Cargo’s case was impossible and must fail.  </p>

The ultimate decision in this case must depend upon an assessment of all of the evidence in the case, not just on one part of it. Making a finding on the balance of probabilities as to the cause of the sinking where the vessel lies in deep water and there is so little evidence as to what actually happened requires an assessment, not only of what little evidence there is as to what happened (the evidence of those on board and the photographs taken after abandonment) but also of the surrounding circumstances. The naval architects, working with very little material, have done well to identify the spaces which are likely to have flooded to cause the vessel to sink but I am unable to accept that the naval architectural evidence can determine the outcome of the case in circumstances where the only data on which they have to work comes from a limited number of photographs. There is an added factor in the present case. The metadata for the electrician’s photographs was only disclosed during the trial. That very late and unexplained disclosure meant that the naval architects had to reassess their opinions in the middle of the trial under very great pressure. They are to be congratulated for doing to so but the court must, it seems to me, take into account that their final opinions were reached in circumstances of urgency rather than in circumstances of measured reflection and where a halt had to be called to further reports in order to ensure that their evidence could be completed within the time available. For that reason also the court must be careful to make its findings after having considered all of the evidence in the case, not just the naval architectural evidence. </p>

Their evidence was of interest but ultimately the question whether the master’s change of route was to avoid the risk of piracy depended, it seemed to me, on a question of fact, namely, whether any, and if so, what information concerning recent pirate attacks (or possible pirate attacks) was taken into account by the Owners and/or the master and whether the change of route was motivated by fears of piracy or by something else.  Finally, there was Captain Malhotra who gave evidence (for the Owners) about the master’s conduct (although he himself had never sailed as master). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is necessary to say a little more about the ballast system. The ballast valves were opened and closed hydraulically, by hydraulic fluid flowing through a device called an actuator, located on the ballast valve. Hydraulic pressure was generated by electrically driven pumps (the hydraulic power pack) and was stored in an accumulator. Hydraulic fluid was directed to flow through an actuator by a solenoid control valve. The 26 control valves were located in the solenoid cabinet on the second deck, about 5 metres forward of the store room. The valves were themselves operated electrically from the ballast control console, located in the deck and engine office on the upper deck, though they could also be operated manually at the solenoid cabinet. Each solenoid control valve consisted of a sliding shuttle fitted with electrical solenoids (a wire coil) at each end. When the solenoid at one end was energised by electrical current it caused the shuttle to slide “open” and permit hydraulic oil to flow in one direction though the actuator and the ballast valve would open. When the solenoid at the other end was energised it caused the shuttle to slide into the “closed” position and permit hydraulic flow in the other direction through the actuator and the ballast valve would close. The electrical supply to the solenoid control valves was carried by steel-sheathed cables running down a pillar into the top of the solenoid cabinet from the deckhead. In order to energise a solenoid one end of the solenoid had to be connected to a live wire carrying one phase of the 220V AC supply and the other end of the solenoid had to be connected to a live wire carrying the second phase of the AC supply. One end of every solenoid was permanently connected to a wire carrying one phase of the AC supply (phase W or “return”). The other end was connected to a wire which led up to a push-button switch on the ballast control panel in the deck and engine office. Pressing the button would connect that wire to the second phase of the AC supply (phase U). The solenoid would then be energised. Each solenoid control valve was served by two dedicated wires carrying the phase U supply, one for each solenoid. A group of valves was served by a single “return” wire.</p>

That survey took place from 14 January until 12 February 2013 and cost, according to Mr. Agaoglu, some US$437,000, which sum was borrowed from CEB. This survey is relevant to the cause of the fire because it was suggested by the Owners that the cause of the fire may have been an oil leak from no.2 generator. During the survey, the three diesel generators were examined internally and externally and were given a running test. The chief engineer accepted that the insulation or lagging would have been renewed or, if it was in very good condition, put back in place. He agreed that if there were any exposed hot surfaces he would have ensured that they were covered. He also accepted that after the Class survey the high pressure fuel pipes were in good condition. “There were no leaks or anything.” He said that during the subsequent voyage, if there had been a leakage, an alarm would have sounded.  Had there been any problem with generator no.2 (the generator which was operating on 30 March 2013) it would have been reported. </p>

All the cargo holds were examined internally. In hold no.5 there was a close-up survey of 50% of the shell frames, including upper and lower end attachments and adjacent shell plating.  All piping in the cargo holds was examined (in a “close up” inspection) and found to be satisfactory as was the piping in the no.5 double bottom and topside tanks. It is however to be noted that corrosion was noted in holds 3, 4 and 5 (and in nos. 4 and 5 double bottom and top side tanks) but that repairs were also carried out in holds 3, 4 and 5 (and in nos. 4 and 5 double bottom and top side tanks).  It was suggested by Mr. Colman that the report of what was done made no reference to the piping. This is true of one document but another document states specifically that the piping was found to be satisfactory.   </p>

The cargo in hold no.5 was loaded at Oktyabrsk. On or shortly after arrival there on 17 February 2013 no.5 ballast tanks (double bottoms and top sides) were deballasted. The steel coils were slung on a spreader bar arrangement and lifted into the hold. The chief officer accepted in cross-examination that it was impossible for the spreader to contact the aft bulkhead because of the presence of the hatch coaming. The chief officer thought that it was not possible for the forklift truck (which was used when stowing the coils) to touch the sides of the ship but then said that he could not remember. He accepted that if a forklift truck had made contact with the ship he would have issued a letter of protest.</p>

The most recent of such incidents was a “possible” incident on 22 February 2013. UKMTO was investigating whether shots had been fired from suspicious vessels or only by the armed security team on board the merchant vessel in question. The co-ordinates of the position were given. The position was some 70 miles to the east of the vessel’s planned route. Also that day the master received from Maritime Security Centre for the Horn of Africa (“MSCHOA”) an email recommending that the vessel transit the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor (“the ITRC”) through the Gulf of Aden as part of a convoy.

He said that the chief engineer was coming out of the engine room and that they did not attempt to fight the fire with portable fire extinguishers. He went to the poop deck to assist with boundary cooling and noted that the emergency generator was working (as did the chief officer when he arrived on the poop deck). This is consistent with the master’s evidence that at approximately 0535 the main engine had stopped and the emergency generator had started. There is no evidence as to why the no.2 generator stopped. Cargo suggested that the chief engineer not only stopped the main engine but also stopped the no.2 generator. Mr. Chell said that if he had been the chief engineer he would have stopped the generator but only after having left the engine room.

The chief officer said that he and the chief engineer proceeded to the CO2 room which was opened with difficulty (the seal on the door had melted). The deck inside the CO2 room was too hot and so they commenced cooling it in order to enter. He said that the chief engineer released the CO2. The chief engineer said that after about 40 minutes the smoke from the funnel stopped so he assumed the CO2 had been effective. In his third statement he said that the smoke only stopped after the crew had abandoned the vessel. In his cross-examination he said that 40 minutes after the CO2 had been released the smoke had “considerably reduced”. There is no mention of the time when the smoke from the funnel ceased in his manuscript statement. The master said that smoke was “still leaving the funnel” until shortly before he ordered abandon ship and there was “no reduction in smoke” when he gave that order. The second officer also said that before leaving on the lifeboat there was black smoke still leaving the after side of the funnel. He was not said to be involved in the conspiracy to scuttle the vessel and there is no reason to doubt his recollection in his statement which was taken on 4 April 2013 and signed on 24 April 2013. The photograph sent by the master on 30 March after the vessel had been abandoned showed black smoke coming from the funnel. It seems to me likely that the CO2 had the effect of reducing the smoke being emitted from the funnel but that some smoke was still being emitted when the vessel was abandoned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The master said that he noted that the vessel was listing to port by about 5 degrees. He said he ordered two men to don fire suits and breathing apparatus so that they could enter the engine room and investigate the cause of the fire and the cause of the list. The two men in question were the third engineer and AB Gokce. The third engineer said in his statement dated 25 April 2013 that he and the AB proceeded to the engine room with the chief engineer. Upon opening the door there was dark smoke and very poor visibility. The third engineer said that the chief engineer ordered them not to enter the engine room. The AB in his statement dated 23 April 2014 said that someone behind him shouted “this was suicide” and he and the third engineer backed out of the entrance. The chief engineer in his statement taken on 3 April 2013 but signed on 25 April 2013 said that the third engineer and AB tried to enter but because of the dark smoke they closed the door. When cross-examined he denied that he had told the third engineer and AB not to enter the engine room when they were wearing fire suits and breathing gear. He suggested that he had given that instruction before they had donned fire suits and breathing gear and that it would be "ludicrous" to override an instruction given by the master. I am unable to accept this evidence of the chief engineer even though he had also suggested in his second statement that before the CO2 was activated he had stopped two crew members entering the engine room. There does not appear to be any reason to doubt the evidence of the third engineer that the instruction was given when they were wearing the necessary protective gear. When cross-examined the third engineer said that others were also present and that the chief engineer may not have been solely responsible for the order not to enter, but that the chief engineer was his superior and so it would have been the chief engineer who would have given the instruction. The chief officer said in his evidence that the crew in fire suits and wearing breathing apparatus were instructed by the master not to enter the engine room. He said in his oral evidence that the chief engineer said that it was not possible to enter, that he (the chief officer) said to the master that there was too much smoke and that the master said they must come back. Thus the decision appears to have been a decision of both the master and the chief engineer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The chief engineer said in his first statement that he then went to the bridge and explained to the master that the starboard diesel oil tank might explode if heated. In his third witness statement dated 7 April 2016 he said that he did not believe that he went up to the bridge but he accepted that he had told the master that the diesel oil tank might explode when recommending the release of CO2. The master, when cross-examined, denied that the chief engineer had come to the bridge and said that he did not remember the chief engineer telling him that the diesel oil tank might explode. The chief officer, the second officer, the AB and guard did not mention the chief engineer visiting the bridge but they were not on the bridge continuously. It seems to me more likely than not that the chief engineer did visit the bridge, because he said he did in his first statement. For the same reason it is more likely than not that he did so after the CO2 had been released. His evidence that he told the master that there was a risk of an explosion from the diesel oil before the CO2 had been released was inconsistent with his first statement. In his first statement he never claimed to have advised the master directly to activate the CO2 system. Rather, he said that he advised the chief officer of that and that it was the chief officer who spoke to the master, as the master confirmed in his statement. Mr. Thomas submitted that the chief engineer was dazed and confused when he made his first statement (the chief engineer had claimed to be “scared and shocked” having escaped from an “horrific experience, going between life and death”) but the statement was taken on 3 April 2013 after the crew had returned to Istanbul and was not signed until 25 April 2013. The fact that he went to the bridge and that he did so after the CO2 had been activated is so clearly stated in his first statement that I do not consider that it can be explained as mistaken and the result of being either dazed or confused. It is important to note that he did not expressly correct his evidence in his second statement. It was only in his third statement dated April 2016 that he first said that he did not “believe” that he went to the bridge.      </p>

Although he did not mention this in his first statement I accept his evidence that he saw something which looked to him like a crack and that he took a photograph of it. It was not suggested to him that he was lying about this or that he was mistaken. I did not consider that he was lying and whilst it is possible that after three years his recollection was mistaken this seems unlikely because he took the photograph and he is likely to have remembered why he took that photograph.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence given by both the master and Captain Toran on this issue was most unsatisfactory. The master, in his first statement dated 5 April 2013, made no reference to the change of course. In his second statement dated 19 November 2014 he said that his company recommended that he should not navigate close to the coast of Oman and that he chose a route parallel to the coast but well clear of it. He implied that he chose the route because of piracy considerations and he made no reference to a change of route. In his third statement dated 24 March 2016 he said, having been reminded of the email dated 25 March 2013 from the Owners in which he was requested to follow a series of way points, that he instructed the second officer to plot “the new route” on the chart and that he decided to follow it because he could see no problem with it. He accepted that he had not recommended the change of route. I have already given reasons for treating the master’s evidence with caution. I consider it most unlikely that the master had no recollection of the Owners’ email to him of 25 March 2013 when making his first two statements for at least two reasons. First, his vessel had been lost whilst he had been following a route which he had been directed to follow by an email from his Owners. A master would remember that. Second, he had also been given an explanation for that change of course by a further email which he had passed on to the charterers. Since he accepted that that explanation was untrue in suggesting that he had recommended the new route he would also have remembered that email. I consider that in his first and second statements he chose not to mention the email of 25 March 2013. He did not wish to state that the Owners had required him to change his route. By implying in his second statement that he had been concerned with piracy he was not telling the truth. For he made it plain when cross-examined that he was not concerned with the risk of piracy because he had two armed guards on board.      </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Captain Toran, in his statement dated 25 November 2014, said that the Owners did not provide their masters with specific routing orders and left such matters to the discretion of the master. (When he gave oral evidence he said in chief in answer to supplementary questions that on occasion the Owners did provide route planning to their masters and he gave as an example an email dated 20 April 2011 to the vessel Selin-M, which email he had found the week before giving evidence). He said that he relayed to the vessel on 28 March 2013 an email advising of a piracy attack on a fishing vessel in the Gulf of Aden (it was not in fact on the vessel’s route but was off the Horn of Africa) and expressed the opinion that “the route taken by the master on the day of the casualty was not unusual”. It is to be noted that the email which he said he had relayed to the vessel was recorded as having been sent by Mr. Ekinci, the Owners’ DPA (Designated Person Ashore). No reference was made by Captain Toran in his statement to any change of route or to the Owners’ email of 25 March 2013 which was also recorded as having been sent by Mr. Ekinci and which requested the vessel to follow the stated way points. I have already said that Captain Toran’s evidence must be treated with caution. His failure to mention the Owners' instruction to the master requiring him to alter course is a reason for doing so. His evidence in cross-examination in which he sought to justify the Owners’ email of 25 March 2013 was deeply improbable. When asked what justified the way points sent to the master on 25 March 2013, he replied that there was a “very simple explanation”, namely, that his colleagues in the office took into account the piracy incidents between 2011 and 2013 and that the 2011 map (sent on to the master by way of explanation for the charterers) was “the worst case scenario”. But, in circumstances where, as is common ground, the number of piracy incidents had fallen since 2011 and where there were maps available for 2012 and 2013 it makes no sense to send an out of date map, let alone only part of the map. When asked why his office had sent only that portion of the 2011 map which showed piracy attacks inshore and not those off-shore he initially said that the office had “zoomed” into that location but then said they could not make “a selection of the map”. I concluded that he had no coherent explanation for his office sending only that portion of the 2011 map which related to on-shore piracy attacks when the vessel was being directed to navigate further off shore.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that there were two piracy incidents close to Masirah Island in early 2013. They were identified by Captain Cleaver, the Owners’ piracy expert. One was reported on 14 March 2013 by Opintel, the US Navy’s information service, and the other was reported on 19 March 2013 by IMO. Thus, although it was accepted by Captain Cleaver that the number of piracy incidents had fallen since 2013, there was still a risk of piracy close to the coast of Oman in March 2013. However, Cargo has a cogent case for submitting that the routing change required by the Owners on 25 March 2013 was not justified by a risk of piracy for at least three reasons. First, the Owners’ email of 25 March 2013 did not state that fear of a piracy attack was the reason for the instruction. Second, the new route took the vessel within 10 miles of the piracy incident of 22 February 2013 which had been reported by UKMTO on 22 March 2013 (and which the master accepted was the only recent piracy information he had received.) Third, the Owners’ email of 27 March 2013 suggesting that the reason concerned the risk of piracy was supported by a partial copy of an out of date map of piracy incidents. That indicates that the Owners had no information regarding recent pirate attacks close to the coast of Oman.  </p>

That was not however the Owners’ policy and provides no support for a suggestion that the Owners' instruction was in fact motivated by a risk of piracy. Reliance was also placed on the two incidents close to the coast to which I have referred but there was no evidence that the Owners or the master were in fact aware of them. If the Owners had been aware of them they would surely have referred to them in their email of 27 March 2013, rather than refer to an out of date and partial map of 2011 incidents. If the master had been aware of them he would surely have advised the charterers of them.  </p>

This case was not supported by any evidence at all from either the master or Captain Toran (or indeed from any other person). It was first put forward in the Owners’ closing submissions, though the guidance had been mentioned at the very end of the cross-examination of Captain Meintanis.

Paragraph 2(b)(1)  required Turkish vessels “to arrive around 2000 Northern latitude to cruise from a minimum distance of 150 miles from coasts of Oman following their exit from the U/A recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC), and then to cruise close to Indian coast as much as possible”.  When this guidance was put to Captain Meintanis at the very end of his cross-examination he expressed the opinion that it applied to vessels navigating to India. This is a possible construction of the text. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Captain Toran did not suggest that this was the reason for the email. Yet he made a disclosure statement dated 14 May 2015 in which he disclosed four emails concerned with fleet navigation orders including the email dated 26 March 2013 sent from the office to the master to which was attached the Turkish Navy’s guidance. Thus he was aware of that guidance and nevertheless did not suggest in his evidence that that guidance was the reason why the Owners had given the revised way points to the master on 25 March 2013. By contrast he did refer in his statement to the email to the vessel on 28 March 2013 which notified the master of a fishing vessel under attack by pirates off the Horn of Africa. That email was also referred to in his disclosure statement. I infer that he did not consider the Turkish Navy's guidance had any connection with the change of route. The master’s third witness statement referred to the email of 25 March 2013 but yet made no suggestion that the email was consistent with, or based on, the Turkish Navy’s guidance which he received on 26 March 2013. He was aware of that email because the other attachment to the email required him to contact the Turkish naval vessel GOKOVA and the email gave him the contact details of that vessel. He contacted her on 26 March 2013. When the Owners’ office advised the master on 27 March 2013 how to explain the new route to the master no mention was made of the Turkish Navy’s guidance. These three failures (by Captain Toran, the master and the office) to rely upon the Turkish Navy’s guidance strongly suggest that the fact that the revised route corresponded with the Turkish Navy’s guidance was nothing more than a coincidence. If it had been the "obvious reason" for the change of route surely one of them would have mentioned it.  </p>

But he would surely have investigated with his colleagues why the new course had been required before sending the email and if the reason had been the Turkish Navy's advice he would surely have mentioned it. Mr. Inci also exhibited to the email a partial copy of an out of date map of piracy incidents. The Owners have suggested that Mr. Inci “took it upon himself to produce an explanation and supporting materials which he hoped would satisfy charterers. He drafted a message which stated, incorrectly, that the master himself had recommended the change of course………he also produced a printout of an out of date piracy map …….from 2011, which showed more pirate activity close to the coast of Oman than was the case in 2012 and 2013, and he cropped it in such a way as to not show pirate activity taking place further offshore. This print out was deliberately selected and cropped in this way, in order to mislead the Charterers as to the level and location of piracy activity in the area.” There is no evidence from Mr Inci confirming this to be the case and Captain Toran did not suggest that one of his colleagues in the office had “taken it upon himself” to do this. </p>

Whereas the inshore route would have taken the vessel into shallow water once the vessel had crossed the 200 metre contour off Juzur al Hallaniyat the offshore route took her into depths of over 3000 metres.

With regard to the seat of the fire in this case there are several pieces of evidence which point to it being in the store room. First, there is evidence from the photograph taken by the electrician after abandonment of the vessel of the fire damage to the starboard side shell plating in way of the store room. Second, there is the evidence of the chief officer that the deck inside the CO2 room was hot. The CO2 room was immediately above the store room. Third, there is the evidence from the chief engineer and the second engineer of their observation of the fire. They each referred to seeing flames in the starboard quarter or corner of the engine room (where the store room is) and each referred to the store room (although neither could say whether the flames were inside or outside the store room).

In essence the point made was that the evidence of the second engineer that the no. 1 generator could not be seen due to smoke was inconsistent with Dr. Kelman’s evidence that smoke would rise with little or no propensity to spread laterally until it reached the deckhead. Mr. Thomas pointed out that the store room had a solid bulkhead up to a height of 1.2m. which was about two-thirds of the height of the generators and so would stop smoke emerging below that level. The genesis of this point was an agreement between the fire experts in their joint memorandum in relation to an accidental fire that smoke obscuring the no.1 generator was “not entirely consistent with fire only in the store room as smoke likely to be emitted at a relatively high level.” Dr. Kelman did not agree that that observation applied also to a deliberate fire. He explained, when cross-examined, that a deliberate fire using oil will develop rapidly and generate much more smoke than an accidental fire but he accepted that low level smoke obscuring the no.1 generator was “extremely unlikely” to have been the result of a fire started in the store room. Mr. Charlton agreed with this in re-examination, though in cross-examination he had expressed the opinion that the observation of smoke across the engine room was probably consistent with both theories as to the cause of the fire. However, Dr. Kelman pointed out that the store room had a door and explained that in the early stages of a deliberately ignited diesel oil fire at the store room door large volumes of smoke would be generated at a low level which could have spread out of the store room through the door into the engine room and so obscure the generator “just around the corner”. Thus, he said, it was not “inconceivable” that no.1 generator could be obscured by smoke. At a later stage, as the fire in the store room burned at a higher level within the store room, air would tend to be drawn in through the door but at the early stages the smoke would tend to go out through the door. Mr. Thomas said (in his closing submissions) that smoke exiting through the store room door in the manner suggested by Dr. Kelman could not mask the no. 1 generator because the smoke would have to turn left and back on itself. However, Dr. Kelman had said when cross-examined that as the smoke progressed out of the door the flow up the funnel casing “will begin to draw that smoke around”. That explains, it seems to me, how the smoke might obscure the no.1 generator. I have borne in mind that this opinion was expressed for the first time in the witness box. But it was expressed in answer to the suggestion, put in cross-examination, that the fire experts’ agreement in their joint memorandum in relation to an accidental fire, that smoke obscuring the no.1 generator was not entirely consistent with a fire only in the store room, applied also to a deliberate fire. This was a point which, as Dr. Kelman said, had not been raised before. Mr. Thomas submitted that it was “the stuff of fancy” to suggest that smoke from a fire started deliberately in the store room could have led, in the early stages of the fire, to smoke exiting the store room through the store room door and obscuring the no.1 generator. However, I found Dr. Kelman’s opinion credible. He described an accidental fire in the store room and a deliberate fire at the store room door as “different mechanisms” which they appear to be. Dr. Kelman’s suggestion that the scuttler might spread oil in the doorway also appears to me to be plausible, notwithstanding Mr. Thomas’ arguments to the contrary. A scuttler might well wish to start the fire at the door to ensure that he gets away safely.  Thus it seems to me conceivable, as it did to Dr. Kelman and for the reasons he gave, that the smoke from such a deliberate fire could, at least initially, obscure the no.1 generator.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Thomas also relied upon the evidence of the third engineer that he saw black smoke at the bottom of the ladder to the engine room and suggested that this was inconsistent with Cargo's case. One would not expect the bulk of the black smoke to be at the bottom of the ladder on the portside of the engine room. Dr. Kelman accepted that most of the smoke would go upwards, but said that some could be dispersed laterally. It is difficult, it seems to me, to see why black smoke, whether generated deliberately by the spilling of oil at the entrance to the store room (as suggested by Cargo) or accidentally by the ignition of a pool of oil (from a failed pipe) in the save all beneath nos.1 and 2 generators (as suggested by the Owners) would reach the portside of the engine room, at any rate at the early stages of the fire before the smoke had reached the deckhead. Even when it did reach the deckhead it would tend to be drawn up the funnel. So the third engineer’s evidence poses a difficulty for either case. But it seems to me that too much reliance should not be placed on this evidence. He did not descend into the engine room and he could not see from the top of the ladder due to an internal bulkhead. Whilst I do not doubt that the third engineer saw some smoke that is as far as his evidence goes. Neither the chief engineer nor the second engineer referred to black smoke at the bottom of the ladder in such quantities that it deterred them from descending.    </p>

The evidence of the second engineer that no.1 generator could not be seen for smoke was not necessarily inconsistent with that deliberate mechanism.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Owners say that it is feasible to suggest that the fire accidentally started in the engine room with a leak of diesel oil from the no.2 generator. The leak was initially in the form of a spray to starboard towards the no.1 generator which caused diesel oil to run down the generator into the save-all below the generator. As the crack which gave rise to the spray developed the direction of the spray changed to port and it ignited on an exposed hot surface of the turbo charger of the no.2 generator. Thereafter the oil in the save-all ignited and the fire spread to the store room. The spray may again have turned to starboard such that oil reached the bulkhead between the engine room and the store room (part of which was in the form of mesh). In this manner the combustible material in the store room was ignited. Mr. Charlton considered that this suggestion is plausible. Dr. Kelman, the fire expert instructed by Cargo, considered that it is not. A number of matters have to be considered, in particular: (i) is a leak of fuel oil a possibility; (ii) is it possible that the spray would cause a pool of oil to form in the save-all between generators nos.1 and 2; (iii) is it possible that the direction of the spray changed to port towards the no.2 turbocharger; (iv) is ignition on a hot surface of the turbo charger a possibility; (v) is ignition of such a leak consistent with the description of the fire given by the chief engineer and the second engineer; and (vi) is it possible that the fire spread to the store room ? </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The suggestion is that a diesel oil pipe, either a low pressure or high pressure pipe, failed or cracked causing diesel to spray from the crack. It was common ground that oil leaks can occur. Although it was agreed that oil leaks can occur on both high and low pressure pipes the debate focused on high pressure pipes. In 2002 SOLAS regulations were implemented to reduce the risk of high pressure fuel leaks impinging on hot exhaust components and so causing fires. Thus all hot surfaces were to be fitted with insulation. In addition high pressure fuel lines were to be protected by a “jacketed piping system capable of containing fuel from a high-pressure line failure.” High pressure fuel pipes therefore contain an inner and an outer sheath. Any leak from the inner sheath is designed to be captured within the outer sheath and to drain into an alarm tank. The vessel was required to comply with SOLAS requirements and so Cargo say that a leak is most unlikely to have occurred in this case. Before considering that contention it is necessary to note what a leak from a high pressure oil pipe entails, given its design. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The effect of the design is that if the inner pipe fails oil will not leak out of the pipe because it will be contained within the outer pipe. The oil will leak into an alarm tank and cause an alarm to sound. Thus, in order for a leak to produce a spray of diesel oil such as is contemplated by the Owners' case (and without an alarm sounding) there must be a crack in both the inner and the outer pipe in the same place. Either the cracks in both inner and outer pipes in the same place must occur at the same time or, if the crack on the outer pipe develops first, a crack on the inner pipe must occur later in the same place.  These propositions were accepted by Mr. Chell, the Owners' marine engineering expert. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Chell explained that although oil at high pressure can lead to a fatigue fracture the outer pipe does not have oil at high pressure flowing through it. “It does not see the same amount of stress.” Mr. Hughes said that compared with the inner pipe, which had a small bore and a thick wall, the outer pipe was more ductile, though, as Mr. Chell thought, they were made of the same material. Thus a fracture caused by high pressure fuel oil flowing through the inner pipe is unlikely to have been the cause of the assumed failure because, although the flow of high pressure oil might cause a failure of the inner pipe, it is unlikely to cause a failure of the outer pipe.  In order for a fatigue fracture to occur in both pipes there has to be some event which raises the stress levels in the inner and outer pipes.  Mr. Chell suggested that an engineer, when refitting a fuel pipe following an overhaul, might refit the pipe in a defective manner. (There was a photograph from a sister ship which suggested that this had happened with a fuel oil pipe on that ship.) That could raise the stress levels in both the inner and the outer pipe though, if the outer pipe is more ductile than the inner pipe, it is unlikely that they would both fail at the same time. Mr. Chell suggested another mechanism which could result in a crack in the outer pipe followed by a crack in the inner pipe in the same place. If the outer pipe rested on a part of the generator which was subject to vibration such “chafing” might lead to the failure of the outer pipe. Mr. Hughes accepted that vibration was a cause of fatigue cracks. Such a failure would cause no leakage but would or might expose the inner pipe to the same chafing and vibration and so could cause a failure of the inner pipe in the same position as the failure on the outer pipe.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cargo say that either mechanism is most unlikely because the vessel appeared to be well-maintained (as accepted by Mr. Chell) and the Owners had very recently overhauled the generators in February 2013. The generators had been inspected by Class. It is said that it is improbable that they had been left with defective connections or that any part of a fuel pipe had been left in such a way that it rested on part of the generator and so was exposed to chafing and vibration. Of course, the intention of a Class survey is that the generators should be left in optimum condition and in one which complies with Class requirements but the photographs of the generators on the sister ship revealed, as the fire experts agreed, “unorthodox repairs …..on the outer sheath of at least one of the high pressure fuel oil pipes and on one engine it appeared that one of the high pressure fuel pipes was of a non-standard configuration.” In the course of the evidence it was agreed that the photographs revealed the sort of defective connections and exposure to chafing and vibration postulated by the Owners’ expert. Yet the sister ship must have been inspected by Class. Indeed I was told that the sister ship had been inspected by Class in September 2015 before the photographs were taken. This suggests that Class surveyors do not always spot matters which fail to meet Class requirements. Indeed, experience of shipping casualties suggests that some defects are not spotted by Class. This point was made by Hobhouse J.

Mistakes of this sort can occur, as the photographs of the sister ship suggest. However, since the defects are visible (unlike some locations for corrosion) one would expect Class surveyors to observe irregular fittings. So, although possible, the suggested defects are unlikely.  Mr. Jacobs went further and submitted that the possibility of chafing was inconsistent with the vessel’s maintenance history and with the evidence from the witnesses. I am unable to accept that submission. Such defects could have been missed by a Class (or any other) surveyor. Although the chief engineer said that the pipework complied with SOLAS his view was probably based upon the fact that the vessel had passed the appropriate survey.</p>

It seems to me that there probably were photographs and written reports from the attending superintendents (although I accept that no electronic documents were found by Mr. Aral when he applied search terms of “ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE” and “dry dock” in June 2016). It is therefore unsatisfactory that there was no evidence from the Owners’ superintendents regarding the dry docking in January and February 2013. I have considered following the approach of Roskill J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Medina Princess</span> [1965] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 361 at p. 399 to the effect that the court will not draw an inference of a fact where direct proof of the fact must have been readily available from a witness who is not called.

This seems improbable given that the third engineer accepted when cross-examined that their backs were towards the no 2 generator as they worked on the no.1 generator. Further, the piping on the no.2 generator was unlikely to have extended beyond the footprint of the starboard side of the generator. None of the persons working on the no.1 generator suggested in their evidence that anything like this either did or may have happened. The third engineer said when cross-examined that as far as he could remember neither he nor the others working on the no.1 generator caused damage to the no.2 generator. In those circumstances the possibility of such damage must, I think, be regarded as remote. At the end of his evidence Mr. Chell said that over-stressing caused by the way in which a pipe has been fixed on to the fuel pump and chafing and vibration were the only two likely causes. </p>

I was not persuaded by Mr. Parsons that this was something which must occur in the event of a fuel leak and so I accept that it is possible that there could have been a leak without a high temperature alarm sounding. Reference was also made by Mr. Parsons to a frequency or deviation alarm. However, Mr. Parsons had agreed with Mr. Chell that there was no deviation alarm and, when cross-examined, accepted that he had overlooked that and that there was no such alarm.

The Owners suggest that a pool of oil might have accumulated between generators nos. 1 and 2 which would, after ignition of oil on the turbocharger of no.2, ignite thereby facilitating the spread of the fire towards the store room. Cargo say that any oil which was sprayed to starboard from the no.2 generator would tend to run aft (because of the vessel’s stern trim) and into an oil bilge tank from drains in the save-all so that there would be no pool. However, the stern trim was slight and would be even less when the vessel was underway. Mention was also made by Mr. Chell of the curvature of the deck plating which might cause oil to flow towards the starboard side. The drain was at the aft end of the save-all and so some oil might not drain away. Further, it is possible that a drain might be blocked (because blocked drains were seen on the sister ship) but this is unlikely given the evidence of the third engineer that they were generally open and regularly cleaned by the oilers. Moreover, the drip trays on the second deck were painted in 29 March 2013 and the area around no.1 generator was cleaned on the same day (following the repair to the O ring). </p>

I suppose it might but it would first require a change in the direction of spray from starboard to upwards towards the deck head. The change of direction would, for the reasons I have given, be a matter of chance.  </p>

This could happen if there were a gap in the lagging or insulation around the turbo charger. Such gaps can occur. Photographs of such a gap were taken on board a sister ship. However, the generators on ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE had been inspected by Class in February 2013 and one would have expected there to be no gaps in the insulation. But the sister ship was also inspected by Class so a survey is no guarantee that the lagging will cover all the area it should. The chief engineer was cross-examined about this and said that when a generator is overhauled the insulation would be taken off and changed if it is not in very good condition. He considered that the vessel complied with SOLAS after the survey in January and February 2013.  If he had seen any exposed hot surfaces he said he would have ensured they were properly covered. </p>

Indeed, Mr. Charlton very fairly accepted when cross-examined that if there was fuel burning at the turbo charger when the chief engineer and second engineer went into the engine room he would reasonably expect there to be some sign of flame. It seems likely that the chief engineer and the second engineer reached the engine room within about 2 minutes of the fire alarm sounding. That sort of interval was accepted by the chief engineer to be possible and it was not challenged during the trial.

In his opinion such a fire would have been visible to the chief engineer and second engineer. His reasoning was that a fire on a generator creates a “very bright fire”. It was suggested to him in cross-examination that if there had been a fire low down on the no.2 generator, on the starboard side of the generator, the engineers who were on the portside of the engine room would not have seen such a fire. He disagreed. He explained that if there was a fire low down as suggested the flames would not have been so small that they would not rise above the turbocharger.

Dr. Kelman’s opinion was that observations concerning the location of flames were usually “pretty accurate”. I accept that the observations of the chief engineer and second engineer were made rapidly and in an emergency. However, both engineers described flames in the starboard quarter or corner of the engine room. It is unlikely that they are in error in this observation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The only explanation for a fire on the no.2 turbo charger which is consistent with the evidence of the chief engineer and the second engineer is that by the time the engineers arrived in the engine room the spray of oil was no longer directed to port towards the turbo charger on the no.2 generator but was now directed back to starboard towards the no.1 generator and the store room so that there was no fuel on the turbocharger to burn. However, given that the engineers arrived within about 2 minutes of the fire alarm this seems unlikely, though the possibility cannot be excluded. Moreover, a second change in the direction of the spray would seem a remote possibility because it would mean that the crack had developed twice so as to enable the direction of the spray to alter, once when it changed from starboard to port, and again when it changed from port to starboard. This would require the cracks in the inner and outer pipe to alter in the same location twice and retain their alignment twice.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(This would not be required were the leak from a low pressure pipe because such a pipe is not double walled.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion as to the origin of the fire based upon the evidence of the engineers as to what they saw and the expert technical evidence is as follows. The origin of a fire is usually where the seat of the fire is. Mr. Charlton accepted that this was a “fair proposition”. There is cogent evidence, when taken collectively, that the seat of the fire was in the storeroom. That suggests that the origin of the fire was in the storeroom. The evidence from the engineers who looked across the engine room is of flames in the starboard quarter or corner of the engine room. That is an apt description of the location of the store room. Indeed, the storeroom is mentioned by both the chief engineer and the second engineer. Each said that he could not say whether the flames were inside or outside the storeroom. That is a clear indication that the fire was located in the vicinity of the storeroom. Neither mentioned seeing a fire in way of the no.2 generator. Both fire experts were of the opinion that if there had been a fire in way of the no.2 generator it would have still have been burning when the engineers went down to the engine room. In my judgment, and having considered the evidence of the fire experts, it is likely that had there been such a fire when the engineers came down to the engine room they would have seen it and recalled it. Thus the Owners’ case is not supported by any evidence that a fire was seen on the no.2 generator. Although a leak from an oil pipe on the no.2 generator is a possibility, although oil could have been sprayed onto a hot surface of the turbocharger, although that could have led to the ignition of a pool of oil in the save all beneath the no.1 generator and although that fire together with a further spray of oil could have led to a fire in the store room each of those possibilities is at least unlikely for the reasons I have given. The aggregation of such unlikelihoods, coupled with the lack of support for a fire on the no.2 generator from the observations of the engineers, suggests that the possibility that the cause of the fire in the store room was a fire at the no.2 generator caused by an oil leak is no more than a remote possibility. It is, in my judgment, more likely than not that the origin of the fire in the vicinity of the store room was in the store room. Since an accidental cause of the fire in the store room cannot be identified there is a real and substantial possibility that the fire in the store room was started deliberately. Whether Cargo has established a deliberate fire on the balance of probabilities depends upon an assessment of the evidence as a whole.</p>

The chief engineer denied that he did, though he accepted that it was possible to disable the bilge alarm. The Owners’ case is that a crack could have developed in the starboard side shell plating as a result of thermal stresses caused by the fire in the store room. There is no direct evidence in support of Cargo's case. It can only been an inference drawn from the evidence as a whole. The Owners adduced expert evidence from Dr. King, a metallurgist, and from Mr. Colman, a naval architect. Dr. King identified two possible mechanisms which could have produced such a crack. Mr. Colman said that the evidence from the photographs of the vessel suggested that the rate of entry of water into the engine room increased, which was consistent with an opening at second deck level and not consistent with an entry of water from the sea chest.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr. King's opinion was expressed in less than positive terms. He said in his first report, having referred in general terms to how thermal stresses might cause a crack to develop, that “there is insufficient information available to say whether cracking is possible or not……I do not therefore believe that it is possible to exclude the possibility that a crack formed in the shell plating as a result of the fire.” In his second report he described two particular mechanisms which could, in theory, cause a crack in the shell plating. The first was entitled in his report “Cracking in the vicinity of deck 2” and involved expansion of the main deck as a result of the fire giving rise to forces of unknown magnitude with the potential to introduce longitudinal cracks in the shell plating. He accepted that it was no more than a theoretical possibility. The second was entitled “Buckling in way of the store room” and involved local panel buckling. This was also no more than a theoretical possibility. Each depended upon the thermal stresses caused by the fire which could not be quantified. Mr. Hughes, the metallurgist called by Cargo, accepted both mechanisms as a matter of theory but expressed a firm view that if either mechanism had operated so as to cause a crack in the shell plating below the water line there would have been evidence of the required thermal stresses in the photographs of the starboard side aft of the vessel after abandonment. With regard to the first possibility he said he would have expected to see evidence of deformation at the deck edge and he saw none. With regard to the second possibility he said he would have expected to see evidence of severe buckling above the waterline and there was none, only minimal buckling. Dr. King did not think that such conclusions could be drawn from the photographs. With regard to the first possibility he thought that the required thermal stresses could have caused deformation at the deck edge but as the structure cooled the structure could have reverted to its original shape. With regard to the second possibility he tended to agree with the language used by Mr. Hughes to describe the extent of the buckling but disagreed as to the significance of that buckling.</p>

Other topics introduced when Mr. Hughes was cross-examined included corrosion in the shell plating, defects in welds and pre-existing mechanical damage to shell plating though there was no evidence of such matters (apart from some peeling paint which Mr. Hughes thought might indicate corrosion). By contrast Mr. Hughes was of the firm view that if either of Dr. King’s two possibilities had occurred one would have expected to find support for them in the photographs of the fire damaged starboard side shell plating. In his view that support could not be seen.  </p>

Thus it can be said that there was a theoretical possibility that a crack could have been caused below the waterline by one or other of Dr. King’s theories. There was however no evidence that such a crack had developed. Nor was there any evidence to suggest that either of Dr. King’s possible mechanisms had in fact occurred. Indeed, Dr. King accepted that he could not say whether either was a realistic possibility or not. Mr. Hughes' opinion was that he would have expected to have seen evidence of deformation or buckling in the photographs consistent with the level of stresses required to bring about the assumed crack. I found that opinion persuasive and logical. He is an experienced metallurgist. I was not dissuaded from that view by Mr. Thomas’ point (and Dr. King’s point) that the suggested location of the crack was below the waterline and therefore not visible on the photographs. However, Dr. King is also an experienced metallurgist and, although he derived no support for his theories from the photographic evidence, he did not accept that the photographs excluded either of the two theoretical possibilities. In that state of the evidence, and notwithstanding that I found Mr. Hughes to be a more persuasive metallurgist than Dr. King, I accept that neither possibility can be discounted. But I am persuaded by Mr. Hughes' evidence that each possibility is no more than a remote possibility. The physical evidence, as revealed by the photographs, did not support either possibility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was one part of the naval architectural evidence which was particularly relevant to the possibility that a crack developed as a result of the fire. Mr. Colman was of the opinion that since his model indicated that the rate of flooding into the engine room increased that suggested that the source of entry was high in the engine room rather than low. There is no dispute that if there were a crack in way of the second deck the flooding rate would gradually increase whereas if there were ingress through the sea chest the flooding rate, though initially higher, would gradually decrease as the net head of water decreased. The naval architects illustrated the two different flooding rates by curves which were fitted to data points, namely, draft readings taken from some of the photographs. An S shape curve (known as a cubic curve) illustrated a rate of flooding which increased. A C shape curve (known as a quadratic curve) illustrated a rate of flooding which gradually decreased.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The debate between the naval architects centred upon whether it was appropriate to use in this context a particular photograph, that taken by the electrician at 0843 UTC on 30 March 2013 from a point some distance away from ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE. Other photographs used in the exercise were from a closer distance and therefore clearer. Mr. Colman had used the photograph timed at 0843 UTC on 30 March 2013. Use of this photograph dictated an S rather than a C curve. </p>

The photograph was taken from a long distance and even when zoomed in the quality was poor such that the transom deck line and water line were not accurately distinguishable. By contrast Mr. Colman considered that the waterline was clear and flat and that the location of the transom was also clear in the photograph. He used a computer measuring device, Rhino, to measure the draft. The Rhino model was created using the vessel’s GA plan (and, I was told, measurements scaled off from it) and data on the photograph to define and position the model. On the photograph in question, by zooming in, he was able to identify a particular fairlead on the portside aft of the vessel. The outline of the vessel could then be placed on the photograph by reference to that fairlead and by interrogation of the software the distance from the main deck at the centre line on the transom down to the waterline was ascertained. That is then subtracted from the distance between the keel of the ship up to the main deck at the centre of the transom. The difference is the draft. Mr. Colman considered that when his Rhino model was overlaid on the photograph it was “smack on” thereby indicating its reliability.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Jacobs has made submissions about the reliability of the 0843 photograph at paragraphs 22-28 of his submissions on naval architecture and Mr. Thomas has made submissions on the same topic at paragraph 116(c) – (d) and at paragraphs 137-147 of his submissions on naval architecture. Mr. Colman’s method is undoubtedly an ingenious way of deducing a draft from what looks like a distinctly unpromising photograph. However, I was troubled by two matters. First, it seemed to me that the reliability of the result of the exercise depended upon the clear delineation of the relevant features of the photograph, in particular the transom and the waterline. The delineation of such features was, it seemed to me, poor and zooming in did not really help because the resulting picture suffered from "pixellation". Second, although Mr. Colman thought that the Rhino model was “smack on” the photograph it did not on close inspection appear to be. There were slight differences both at the bow and at the transom, which Mr. Colman accepted during the course of cross-examination. (It is possible that this resulted from errors in the scaling off of measurements from the GA plan.) Having considered all that has been said on this topic I prefer the evidence of Mr. Burnay and consider that the 0843 photograph was taken at too great a distance away from the vessel to give reliable results. It seemed to me that Mr. Burnay's opinion as to the reliability of the 0843 photograph was realistic whilst Mr. Colman's opinion was unrealistically optimistic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Mr. Burnay eventually accepted that even without the use of the 0843 photograph the draft figures deduced from the photographs were consistent with both an S curve and a C curve, that is, consistent with either an entry of water at the second deck or an entry of water at the sea chest. Mr. Thomas submitted, based upon the evidence of Mr. Colman, that the “high” measurements used by Mr. Burnay to obtain his average draft reading for the early morning photographs of 0457 and 0501 were inaccurate and if excluded would result, and result only, in an S curve. However, I consider that Mr. Burnay’s method of taking an average of his low and high readings was a fair approach. His methods of scaling off the draft had produced a range of readings which had not been challenged by Mr. Colman at their meeting in February 2016 “allowing for a reasonable tolerance on the measurements.” Taking an average would therefore seem reasonable. There was considerable debate as to the respective merits of each expert’s reference points. Mr. Colman relied upon the width of the transom and Mr. Burnay relied upon the length of the pilot ladder and guard rail. In particular the debate as to the reliability of Mr. Colman’s measurement of the width of the transom continued after the end of the hearing, with Mr. Colman and Mr. Thomas insisting that his measurement from the GA plan was supported by measurements from the Shell Expansion plan and with Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Burnay insisting that much depended upon which copy of the GA plan was used and that reliable measurements could not be taken from the Shell Expansion plan, a proposition with which Mr. Colman firmly disagreed. In addition it was said by Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Burnay that the transom edge was not clear in the photographs. This debate appeared to me to confirm the desirability of taking an average of the readings, especially in circumstances where the experts had agreed at their meeting that each other’s measurements were within a “reasonable tolerance”.  (The late disclosure of plans also produced a debate about the height of the lettering of the ship’s name on the stern of the vessel. Mr. Jacobs said that Mr. Colman had used an incorrect figure which cast further doubt on Mr. Colman’s draft readings. However. Mr. Thomas said, whilst not denying that an incorrect height had been used, that the height of the lettering had not been used to “measure” the draft but had only been used as “a useful and simple tool for estimating the draft”. In any event, he said, the corrected figure would lead to no materially different conclusion. In the light of the experts’ agreement before the hearing I do not think that this debate about the height of the lettering can materially advance matters.) I therefore consider that the naval architectural evidence, based upon reading off drafts from the photographs and taking an average, is consistent with both an entry of water into the engine room at a high point and at a low point. It does not point clearly to one rather than to the other.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cargo’s case is that this was done deliberately by operating the ballast system. There is no direct evidence that had happened. The court is invited to infer that that happened from all the evidence in the case. The Owners’ case (which is set out at paragraphs 589-718 of Mr. Thomas’ submissions) is that as a result of a “flashover” from the fire in the store room, that is, the projection forward of burning and/or hot flammable gas along the underside of the deckhead in the engine room to a point above the cabinet containing the solenoid valves which control the ballast valves, the electrical cables which ran down the pillar from the deckhead to the solenoid valve cabinet could have been attacked by the fire with the result that the ballast valves to the nos. 4 and 5 ballast tanks could have been opened, as a result of an electrical fault, namely, a live short circuit of the solenoid valves, thereby causing the tanks to flood. Mr. Jacobs described this mechanism as “hot wiring” which I find to be a convenient shorthand description of a very complex event. Mr. Thomas objected to that shorthand description but he has not suggested another. It assists to have one and I hope that it will not cause offence if I use it, simply as a shorthand description of the mechanism which I have summarised above from Mr. Thomas’ closing submissions. At the end of the evidence it was common ground that hot wiring was a theoretical possibility but Mr. Kelman thought it most unlikely to have occurred.  Mr. Jacobs’s submitted that hot wiring was implausible for reasons set out at paragraphs 537-572 of his closing submissions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The chief officer’s evidence that the draft gauges did not work was relied upon as evidence that the fire had indeed spread further forward than the solenoid cabinet because the air supply for the draft gauges was forward of the solenoid cabinet and must have been damaged by fire. The instruction book to the draft gauges was produced during the cross-examination of Mr. Parsons. It had not previously been disclosed. Following its production Mr. Parsons analysed it and concluded that the air purge unit and/or its piping was inside the storeroom. He further considered that the fire in the store room could have damaged the unit and/or piping so rendering the draft gauging system inoperable. These matters were put to Mr. Chell. He did not accept that the unit would be in the store room but thought it would be below the upper or main deck. He suggested that it could have been on the portside of the vessel not on the starboard side. Mr. Parsons obviously thought it would have been on the starboard side and that seems likely given that other pipework was on the starboard side going to the ballast control room on the starboard side. Mr. Chell agreed that if the unit had been in the storeroom it would have been destroyed by the fire but doubted that this would affect all the draft gauges. In his closing submissions Mr. Thomas said that his instructions were that the unit was in the steering gear room. After the full set of drawings had been disclosed (after the end of the hearing) Mr. Jacobs submitted in writing that plan HJAW-E-14 shows the air purge unit for the aft draft gauge in the engine room and notes specifically that the pipework for the draft gauge system runs down the “ballast console side” (i.e. the starboard side). This, he submitted, was direct evidence that the pipework for the draft gauges passed from the purge head down the starboard side of the engine room and therefore almost certainly through the store room. He submitted that this provides the most plausible reason for the loss of air to the draft gauges rather than the spread of fire forward to the solenoid cabinet and its environs. I accept that it looks as if the pipework was on the starboard side but I do not follow why it “almost certainly” went through the store room. Mr. Thomas has informed me that Mr. Chell disagrees that the airlines pass though the store room. Having considered the various submissions made I do not consider that I can reach any clear findings on this issue. It would not appear safe to conclude that the fact that the draft gauges did not work was “irrefutable evidence” (Mr. Thomas’ phrase) that the fire must have extended forward to and beyond the solenoid cabinet. The position therefore appears to be, as Mr. Charlton accepted, that all that can be said is that the flashover could have extended to the cables to the solenoid cabinet.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> It was common ground that if the ballast console were switched off the “open” command conductors could not be energised. The chief officer of the sister ship, when interviewed by six experts in November 2015, said that after ballasting operations were complete the control system was shut down with all valves closed. Mr. Chell when cross-examined could not provide any reason for keeping it on at sea when ballast operations were not imminent. This evidence therefore suggests that it is likely that the ballast console was switched off. However, Mr. Thomas, in his closing submissions, relied upon the evidence of the chief officer of ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE that he checked the lights of the ballast console during a voyage as being consistent with the console being switched on. If that is so it is odd that Mr. Chell did not say that a reason for keeping the ballast console on during a voyage was in order to check the status of the ballast valves. On the other hand it is one Cargo’s criticisms of the master that he did not order the chief officer to check the ballast console before deciding to abandon ship which criticism assumes that the ballast console would be on. In this state of the evidence I am unable to make a firm finding one way or the other but I accept, based upon the chief officer’s evidence, that it is possible that the ballast console was switched on. </p>

He said that all means of flooding should be closed off. That was also the practice of the chief officer of the sister ship and seems to me a sensible policy.

He reported that when the power supply to the pumps is switched on an alarm sounds in the engine room. It is not, however, suggested that the alarm would sound throughout the ship. A scuttler could therefore switch the power pack on and, I assume, switch off the alarm.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a further matter which Mr. Chell reported from his visit in 2014, namely, that when power was switched off and four valves were being opened only one valve fully opened and the other valves only partially opened before pressure had dropped to zero. This was of significance because the master said in his first statement that all power had been lost at 0535 when the emergency generator started. The hydraulic power pack was not powered by the emergency generator and Mr. Charlton considered that the fire would have taken 10-15 minutes to spread to the cabling to the solenoid cabinet, that is, by about 0540-0545. Thus, on the master’s evidence that the emergency generator was on at 0535 (which he later changed, but for no reason which he could identify, to about 0550) it would be difficult for hot wiring to account for ballasting of double bottoms 4 and 5. However, it may be that the unit on the sister ship was defective and that the unit on ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE could have stored pressure for longer.  </p>

It is true that they did not flood but there might still have been damage to conductors relevant to the starboard side but not so as to cause the valves on the starboard side to open. It was also pointed out that if a “closed” conductor were affected by fire then the relevant valve would not open. Since the open and closed conductors were but millimetres apart the possibility that a closed conductor was not affected was remote. Similarly, if a return conductor were affected before the open conductor was affected there would be a hard short and the valve in question would not open.

That instruction calls for an explanation. The chief engineer said that in circumstances where he had tried and failed to ring the bridge he wanted the second engineer to warn the crew of the fire.

However, the chief officer (who was the officer of the watch on the bridge) said that he activated the general alarm, having heard the fire alarm and seen that it indicated a fire on the second deck of the engine room. The third engineer also said that after he had telephoned the chief officer the general alarm then sounded. The chief officer then made an announcement on the public address system.

His explanation for so doing is that he called the bridge but there was no immediate answer. There is no corroboration of this failed call. But even if he made the attempted call his own understanding was that the fire alarm activated the general alarm and so he would have understood that the general alarm would also be sounding throughout the vessel. Indeed, in his second statement he said that he heard the general alarm; but in his third statement he said this was a mistake and that he heard the fire alarm. (In his first statement he had referred to both). In his oral evidence he maintained that he had heard the fire alarm. He accepted that the general alarm might have been on but he said he did not hear it.</p>

Since the second engineer would have been of assistance to the chief engineer in investigating and possibly fighting the fire I would have expected the chief engineer to have wished to have the benefit of the services of the second engineer in the engine room. Mr. Chell accepted that the second engineer could have helped to fight the fire. The failed call to the bridge (assuming it took place) does not appear to me to be a good reason for sending the second engineer from the engine room. The chief engineer had only let the call ring two or three times. He does not appear to have been concerned that the bridge would be unaware of the alarm because he did not send the second engineer to the bridge but to the crew’s accommodation. (Although he referred in his oral evidence to wanting “the bridge” to be aware, he referred in his first statement to “the crew” and the second engineer also referred to being instructed to go to the “crew’s cabins”.) The chief engineer must have appreciated that the general alarm would be sounding, either because he thought it was activated by the fire alarm or because he would know that the officer of the watch would sound the general alarm. There does therefore appear to me to be force in the suggestion put to the chief engineer that he sent the second engineer out of the engine room because he wished to get on with the work of scuttling the vessel. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second matter which calls for an explanation is the decision of the chief engineer (supported by the master) to order the third engineer and the AB when they were wearing protective suits and breathing gear not to enter the engine room. I have already discussed the evidence on this issue. It was suggested that the order was given because the chief engineer did not wish any investigation of the fire or of the list to be made. This suggestion is to an extent supported by the chief engineer’s own (untrue) explanation that he gave the instruction when the third engineer and AB were not wearing protective suits and breathing gear and his view, expressed in evidence, that it would be “complete nonsense” for anyone to describe their attempt to enter the engine room wearing such gear as suicide. That suggests that he appreciated that the giving of such instruction when the third engineer and AB were wearing protective suits and breathing gear would be regarded as suspicious. Mr. Thomas submitted that the suggestion was wrong because the master himself ordered the inspection of the engine room and then ordered the abandonment of the inspection after the third engineer and AB had taken a few steps into the engine room. I accept that the master ordered the inspection and was involved in the order to abandon the inspection but I am unable to accept (because of the third engineer’s evidence) that the chief engineer was not also involved.  The fact that the master gave the initial instruction to enter the engine room is not suggestive of a scuttler anxious to ensure that the engine room is not inspected and for that reason this episode is not the strongest of Cargo’s points. However, the episode is consistent with Cargo’s case in that it shows the chief engineer, who on Cargo’s case had been taking steps to scuttle the vessel in the engine room, ordering the third engineer and AB, when wearing protective clothing and breathing apparatus, not to proceed with an inspection of the engine room.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third matter arising from the chief engineer’s evidence which calls for an explanation is his advice to the master that there was a risk of explosion from the starboard diesel oil tank. I have already discussed the evidence as to this. I have found, based on the chief engineer’s first statement, that the chief engineer went to the bridge after the CO2 had been injected into the engine room and that he told the master that there was a risk of explosion in the diesel oil tank on the starboard side. The diesel tank was between frames 27 and 34, that is, well forward of the store room and would have been cooled by seawater. Dr. Kelman expressed the opinion that it was highly unlikely that the tank would have sustained any significant heating. Further, by this time CO2 had been injected into the engine room and, as the chief engineer said in his first statement, he assumed the CO2 “was being effective” and, as he said in his second statement, “we did not think to activate more CO2 bottles”. That decision, not to activate more CO2, sits uneasily with the suggested risk of explosion in the starboard diesel tank. Mr. Jacobs described the chief officer’s observation to the master as “somewhat bizarre”. I consider it possible that the chief engineer did not actually believe that there was such a risk. His attempt to place his advice to the master on this topic before the CO2 was injected strongly suggests that he appreciated that such a risk was unlikely once CO2 had been injected into the engine room. Mr. Jacobs further suggested that the fear was expressed by the chief engineer to the master to prevent further investigation into the fire and to create panic so as to encourage abandonment. Mr. Thomas said that this makes no sense because the master is alleged to have been one of the scuttlers and there was no evidence that this fear was spread amongst the crew. That is true. But there may have been discussion about explosions because before abandonment a sound had been heard which was referred by more than one member of the crew as an “explosion” and after abandonment several of the crew referred to hearing an “explosion”. It is also to be noted that the second engineer (who is not said to have been a scuttler) expressed his concern as to the risk of an explosion from the diesel oil tanks at the very end of end of his statement. He did not give oral evidence and so the basis of his concern could not be explored. If it is possible that the chief engineer did not believe that there was no risk of an explosion it is also possible, it seems to me, that the chief engineer’s advice to the master was for the purpose indicated by Mr. Jacobs. The chief engineer said that after he had given the advice the master ordered the preparation of the lifeboats.  In his statement the master did not mention the advice but justified his decision to abandon by reference to the list and to the smoke. Yet the smoke must have reduced as a result of the injection of CO2. The chief engineer, when cross-examined, accepted that the smoke had, as a result of the injection of CO2, considerably reduced.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, he failed to advise his office of the emergency before be abandoned the vessel. There is no dispute that the vessel’s SMS (Safety Management System or standing orders) required him to inform the Fleet Manager, Captain Toran, in the event of a contingency. The master did not do so. Mr. Thomas has sought to explain this failure (at paragraph 257 of his closing submissions) but the master accepted when cross-examined that he could have sent a message to his office by Inmarsat. Captain Malhotra, a master mariner (though one who had never sailed as a master) gave expert evidence for the Owners to the effect that the master would have considered dealing with the emergency a higher priority. But the master had instructed the second officer to prepare a message to be sent to the office as the CO2 system was activated which was about 30 minutes after the fire alarm. I consider that there must have been time to instruct the second officer to send the message to the office. The vessel was abandoned one hour and three quarters after the fire alarm. Further, the first distress message was not sent until just before the decision to abandon. It was suggested to the master that the reason for this delay in sending such messages was that the master did not wish any assistance from other vessels because he wished to ensure that his vessel was a total loss. That appears to me to be possible, though it is also possible (as suggested by Mr. Thomas at paragraph 261 of his closing submissions) that the master delayed until he knew he had to abandon his ship.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the master noticed the vessel was listing to port “slightly, about 5 degrees”. He instructed two of the crew to don fire suits and breathing apparatus to enter the engine room to investigate the cause of the fire and of the list. In the event that order was countermanded by the master and chief engineer in circumstances which I have described.  No other steps were taken to investigate the cause of the list, either by taking soundings on the portside or by instructing the chief officer to examine the inclinometer (to get an accurate measurement of the list) or the ballast console (to see if any ballast valves were open) in the cargo control room. Captain Malhotra accepted that soundings could have been taken but that that was in “an ideal world”.  He also accepted that it would have been sensible to instruct the chief officer to look at the ballast console at the same time as he asked him to look at the draft gauges. It was suggested to the master that he did not take these steps because he did not wish anyone to find out that the ballast tanks had been deliberately filled. That appears to me to be possible, notwithstanding the master’s explanation and Mr. Thomas’s comment that there was also a fire and that criticism of this nature is based on hindsight; see paragraphs 258-259 of his closing submissions.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, although the master instructed the second officer to collect “the brief case holding the deck log, GPS log, movement book and crew passports” the vessel’s working chart was left on board. The explanation for the documents being in a brief case may be, as the second officer said in his statement, that one of his tasks was to stow such documents into a brief case. The deck log must have been on the bridge and so it is likely that the second officer went to the bridge where the master must have given him an instruction with regard to the collection of the ship’s documents. In his oral evidence the master said that he did give instructions to the second officer (“take what you can, especially the log book”). I think it is likely that he did give instructions but it is unlikely that in April 2016 he had a reliable recollection of precisely what those instructions were. The chart ought to have been taken as the SMS indicates and it must have been apparent to the master before he left the bridge that the chart was still there.  It is possible, notwithstanding Mr. Thomas’ submissions at paragraphs 273-5 of his closing submissions, that the master left the chart because he did not wish those investigating the loss of the vessel to see the alteration of course consequential upon receipt of the Owners’ way points on 25 March 2013. It is correct that the deck log and GPS log which were removed evidenced the course in fact navigated. But I was not referred to any entry in the logs which would evidence, as the working chart would, the difference between the original route and the amended route. It is also correct that the revised route would be apparent from the Owner’s email of 25 March 2013 and from the email exchanges with the charterers but these communications were not mentioned by either the master in his first or second witness statements or by Captain Toran in his witness statement. </p>

Captain Malhotra accepted that it was “wrong” for the master and chief engineer to go back on board. It seems that they first went back on board at about 1000 local time, more than two hours after they had abandoned their vessel. The master (who only acknowledged returning to the vessel once) gave the impression that it remained dangerous to be on board. “I remembered I had left money in the vessel’s safe approximately US$4,500 so I returned on board, collect the money and left <span style="font-style:italic">very quickly</span>” (emphasis added).

His statement sought to mislead the reader by suggesting that he only returned once, and then only for the purpose of recovering US$4500.

She had a low freeboard and modest speed and carried no guards. She herself was vulnerable to pirates. When she arrived on site her master asked the Omani patrol boat to remain because he was concerned about pirates. Moreover, an abandoned, disabled vessel whose situation was known to the authorities was an unlikely target for pirates. Captain Taner was unable to comment as to whether the vessel held any value for pirates. Captain Mahmut said that he envisaged pirates conducting a transhipment operation 150 miles out to sea off loading cargo from ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE. He cannot seriously have entertained this opinion.

What were these tools for ? Captain Taner referred in his statement to closing any openings to prevent further water ingress and Captain Mahmut referred in his statement to stabilising the flooding. But neither was able, when cross-examined, to identify what precisely they intended to do. Captain Taner said they did not have a “clear plan”. He suggested that any open doors might have been closed but accepted that he was “throwing options here as a possibility”. He said that “what could have been done would have become clear had we went on board.” Captain Mahmut said that he had “an opinion that the integrity of the ship had been compromised structurally.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Where there are two co-salvors it is in their interests to work together and keep each other informed of all relevant information. It is therefore unlikely that if Solar Salvage had been informed of the aerial survey contracted by the Owners they did not pass that information on to Smit Salvage. Smit Salvage’s first report sent on 31 March 2013 referred to the scarce availability of aircraft to perform an overflight. That email was sent to both Mr. Uzun and Mr. Dalyan. It was forwarded by Mr. Uzun to Captain Toran. The second and third reports which made the same point and were sent, respectively, late on 31 March and on 1 April were also sent to Captain Uzun and Mr. Dalyan. Yet neither of them, nor Captain Toran to whom they were copied, replied saying that the Owners had already found a suitable aircraft. If Mr. Uzun had informed Mr. Dalyan of the flight the Owners had sourced surely he would have told Smit Salvage that he had done so. Smit Salvage and, I consider, Solar Salvage only learnt of the Owners’ aerial survey when told of it by the P and I Club on 2 April 2013. Smit Salvage’s reply stating that they had been informed that day of the aerial survey was also sent to Mr. Uzun and Mr. Dalyan. Again, Mr. Uzun did not in his reply say that Solar Salvage had been informed of it much earlier. I consider that Mr. Uzun was mistaken in thinking that he had informed Solar Salvage of the aerial flight or of the despatch of HEATHER before 2 April 2013. </p>

In this case it is remarkable that although Smit Salvage informed the Owners through Mr. Uzun that the salvage team would arrive in Muscat in the early hours of 1 April 2013 the Owners did not inform Smit Salvage that HEATHER would be picking up two superintendents in Muscat later that day so that at least some of the salvage team could reach the casualty on board HEATHER earlier than they would otherwise have done. </p>

However, before any finding can be made as to this it is necessary to consider the evidence in the case as a whole. </p>

This process was assisted by other spaces having down flooded beforehand so that the vessel was deeper in the water.   The Owners did not accept that this was feasible and said that there was a realistic possibility that hold no.5 had flooded by reason of a damaged or corroded ballast pipe in hold no.5 </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cargo’s case was based upon the photographs. First, the photographs in the early morning of 1 April 2013 taken from a plane showed that water would be getting into the steering gear room via the mushroom vent and through the door of the steering gear room which had been left open. Portside air vents to various tanks were also submerged. Second, the photographs taken by Captain Taner on the morning of 2 April 2013 (when he arrived on board HEATHER) showed most of the poop deck submerged or awash, the portside of the vessel submerged in way of the hatch coaming to hold no.5, the door to the steering gear room awash and a wave running off the mezzanine deck (above the poop deck). The master of HEATHER reported in an email that there was a swell of 1.5 m. and wind force 4/5. Captain Mahmut described the vessel as “under water until the middle section”. Third, photographs on 3 April 2013 appear to suggest that the portside hatch coaming of no.5 hold was submerged and possibly also the port aft corner of the hatch top.  The master of HEATHER said the weather got worse over the night of 2/3 April 2013 but his log suggests the contrary. These photographs formed the basis of Cargo’s submission and Mr. Burnay’s evidence that by 0600 local time on 1 April 2013 there had been down flooding into the steering gear room, that between 1 and 3 April 2013 there had been further ingress into the steering gear room and accommodation and that on the morning of 3 April 2013 there was down flooding into the hold no.5.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Cargo had two principal difficulties with its case. The first difficulty was that no calculations had been carried out by Mr. Burnay to illustrate the possible rate of flooding suggested by the photographs as having taken place before and after 0600 on 1 April 2013 or the possible effect of such flooding on the draft of the vessel. Mr. Burnay based his opinion on the photographs and his experience as to “how such things would occur.” However, in the absence of calculations to show what was feasible or possible I found myself left in doubt as to what the consequence of the suggested down flooding would have been. Obviously it would cause the vessel to lie deeper in the water and increase her list but no attempt was made to suggest by how much. The second difficulty was a similar absence of calculations of the possible rate of flooding through the hatch cover, inspection hatch and air vent. I accept that little could be concluded from the photographs as to the draft of the vessel at this time (as the experts had agreed in the March 2016 meeting). But there were no calculations as to the amount of water which could in theory down flood through the suggested routes or at what rate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Jacobs relied upon Mr. Burnay’s evidence that down flooding into hold no.5 would have been inevitable at some stage that morning. But Mr. Colman was of the view that the extent of flooding required was unrealistic in the suggested timescale. He remarked that “if that could happen bulk carriers would be taking water in enormous quantities all over the world.” Mr. Colman was asked to consider the port list and the wind, waves and swell from the south west and to agree that in those circumstances with the vessel rolling to port the waves would sweep up from the portside and down flood into the hold. Mr. Colman replied that that was “fantasy. The ship won’t roll. Even though some water may run up the deck, all it will do is hit the hatch coaming and bounce back again. It won’t go in because there’s a weathertight seal around it. Imagine what this would be like in heavy weather when the ship is out in force 8/9 conditions. There will be big waves sweeping the decks ……. No water gets in because the weathertight seals work.” He said the access hatch was also sealed and that although the vent would be open for a steel cargo an incoming wave was likely to break before it got to the vent opening. Flooding would only take place when the hatch coaming was submerged. Even allowing for the enthusiasm and vigour with which Mr. Colman expressed these views it seemed to me that in this context it was Mr. Colman’s view that was realistic and Mr. Burnay’s view that was unrealistically optimistic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Owner’s case, that hold no. 5 had been flooding since 30 March 2013, required a hole in a ballast pipe in hold no.5 (so as to permit the entry of water into that hold once double bottom tank no.5 had been flooded). It was said that such a hole could have been caused by corrosion or by a fork lift truck during the loading of steel coils in the hold. I consider that a corrosion hole was unlikely because the vessel had passed a Class inspection in January and February 2013 which included checks on the piping. Mr. Chell accepted that the surveyor would have been within 0.5m. of the connecting pipe. I also consider that damage by a fork lift truck was unlikely because no such damage had been reported by the chief officer who would have supervised the loading. The master accepted that such damage would have been reported either by his crew or by the P and I surveyor. However, corrosion can be missed by Class and damage by stevedores can be missed by chief officers and P and I surveyors. So a hole, though unlikely, is possible. Moreover, entry of water into hold no.5 is consistent with the drafts extracted from the photographs for 30 March 2013 as was shown by Mr. Colman’s model. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion on this part of this case is that whilst it is likely that there was down flooding of the steering gear room and other spaces aft from a time before 0600 on 1 April 2013 it is unlikely that hold no.5 flooded solely as a result of down flooding. There is likely to have been some down flooding into hold no.5 when the coaming was submerged but I have no particular reason to believe that the amount of water that would flood into the hold at that time would be sufficient to sink the vessel. Whilst a hole in the ballast piping in hold no.5 is unlikely it seems to me that because the photographs of 30 March 2013 are consistent with the Owners’ case (as indicated by Mr. Colman’s model) there is a real possibility that water entered hold no.5 via a hole in the ballast piping in that hold once double bottom no.5 port had flooded, followed by down flooding on 3 April 2013 once the hatch seal was submerged.  </p>

A summary of the position of the various companies within the group, as established by Mr. King of Moore Stephens, will suffice. All the companies were “balance sheet insolvent” when account was taken, as the expert accountancy evidence said it should be, of the market value of the vessels. Thus Kairos’ liabilities exceeded its assets by over US$9m. Capella’s liabilities exceeded its assets by over US$14m. Amikos’ liabilities exceeded its assets by over US$9m. and White Funnel’s liabilities exceeded its assets by over US$6m. The two managers, Atlantik and Zigana, were also balance sheet insolvent. Each of the shipowning companies also had a deficit on its profit and loss account. Consistently with that position the Owners had to borrow from CEB in order to pay for the dry docking of ATLANTIK CONDENCE in January and February 2013. Only the two managers had a surplus on their profit and loss account. It is difficult to accept that Mr. Agaoglu had a genuine belief that the Atlantik group of companies was doing well in 2013. </p>

There was no evidence of such threat. But Mr. Jacobs submitted that this could be inferred from the extent of the Owners’ financial difficulties, Mr. Agaoglu’s untruthful evidence and the Owners’ approach to the disclosure of financial documents.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I shall first summarise the matters relied upon by Mr. Jacobs. In addition to Mr. King’s assessment of the financial position of Kairos and the other companies within the Atlantik group and the amounts outstanding under the loan agreement and due to be repaid Mr. King sought to assess the prospect of Kairos and Capella trading themselves out of their financial difficulties. For this purpose he assumed that CEB would have been willing to restructure the loan to Kairos in the same way as they did after the loss of the vessel. This is a favourable assumption for the Owners because the restructuring took place after the greater part of the insurance proceeds had been used to pay off part of the indebtedness. Pursuant to that restructuring there was a capital repayment moratorium from October 2013 until 2015. 3% of the loan was to be repaid in 2015, 5% in each of 2016-2019 with the final balloon payment of 78% in 2020. Using Mr. Agaoglu’s own operating figures in his third witness statement (but adjusted to take account of known actual costs) and using the Baltic Freight Forward Rates there was predicted to be a loss in each year save 2019 with a shortfall for CEB in 2020 of approximately US$11m. A similar exercise was done for Capella resulting in a shortfall of some US$28m. in 2020. These exercises are based on many assumptions which can be questioned but no competing exercises by another accountant were relied upon by the Owners. Even if one allows for the few criticisms of Mr. King’s analysis advanced in the limited cross-examination of him, they serve to illustrate the seriousness of Kairos’ and Capella’s position. They suggest that the Owners were unlikely to be able to trade themselves out of their poor financial position. However, any projections carried as far ahead as 2020 must be viewed with considerable caution.   </p>

One reason was that I found it very difficult to accept that Mr. Agaoglu did not know that part of the insurance proceeds had been used for the benefit of other owning companies within the Atlantik group when he made his statement. The unchallenged evidence of the accountant Mr. King was that some US$4.56m. of the insurance proceeds had been paid for the benefit of other companies in the group. </p>

The disclosed documents (which took up an entire lever arch file, F5 Volume 9) included two emails which evidenced or proposed an agreement between CEB and the Owners as to the application of the insurance proceeds. This late disclosure was remarkable. As I have already noted Mr. King of Moore Stephens LLP had expressed the view that not all of the insurance proceeds had been paid to the Owners. Mr. Agaoglu’s statement had been to the contrary effect. The two emails were from Mr. Tayfun of CEB (from whom the Owners had put in evidence a statement) to Mr. Agaoglu and were dated 8 and 9 April 2013. </p>

He must have discussed this with CEB. Consistently with that email some US$4.56m was in fact used for the benefit of other companies within the group. As the sole shareholder of the companies in the Atlantik group he must have known that. In his witness statement he claimed to have demonstrated “absolute transparency” throughout these proceedings.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is necessary to summarise the history of requests for documentation of this nature. On 2 February 2016 Cargo's solicitors had sought disclosure of documentation specifically relating to (inter alia) “the application of the insurance proceeds from the loss of ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE”.  The Owners’ solicitors responded on 17 February 2016 that there was “no correspondence documents between our clients and CEB”.   This statement was repeated on 1 March 2016.  On 1 April 2016 the Owners disclosed four bundles of correspondence with CEB but they did not contain documentation in relation to the insurance proceeds.  On 16 April 2016 Cargo's solicitors sought (inter alia) disclosure of “a full set of correspondence as between the Bank and Kairos/Atlantik for the time period 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2013.” It was not until the disclosure provided on 19 (or 24) May 2016 that the Owners disclosed any documentation in relation to the distribution of the insurance proceeds. </p>

Nevertheless there appears to be force in the submission made by Mr. Jacobs that the two emails disclosed are unlikely to be the only documentation in relation to the agreement between the Owners and CEB as to the distribution of the insurance proceeds. First, as Mr. Beriker stated when cross-examined any significant amendment to the Loan Agreement would be recorded in writing. This would apply to any variation of the agreed terms concerning CEB’s security both in the 2010 Loan Agreement and in the Deed of Assignment and Loss Payable Clause dated 11 February 2013 pursuant to which the insurance proceeds were payable to CEB. The agreement proposed in the email dated 8 April 2013 must have become an agreement (otherwise the US$4.56m. would not have been paid to other companies) and such agreement is likely to have been a variation of the existing security arrangements. No such variation has been disclosed. Second, US$1.55m. of the US$4.56m. consisted of unidentified transfers. There must be documents which identify who received such transfers. Yet none has been disclosed.    </p>

It would not, for example, extend to correspondence between the Owners and CEB concerning the Owners’ ability to pay the instalments due under the loan agreement and supplementary agreements. His evidence in this regard was improbable. He was advised throughout by Clyde and Co. who would have advised him of his disclosure obligations. Moreover, on 2 March 2015 HFW stated that the requested documents were relevant to the financial position of the First Claimant and to any concerns expressed by the First Claimant and their Bankers in relation to the First Claimants’ financial position. There could not therefore be any doubt as to the scope of the request. Captain Toran said he could not remember if he had seen that letter. But it is improbable that it was not drawn to his attention by Clyde and Co. who replied on 13 March 2015 saying there was no such correspondence. Mr. Thomas, in his closing submissions at paragraphs 382-385, has submitted that Captain Toran’s evidence as to his interpretation of the request should be accepted. I am unable to accept that that was his interpretation. When Captain Toran produced his disclosure statement on 14 May 2015 in which he stated that the Owners did not have any other correspondence or documents with CEB in relation to the Loan Agreement and other security arrangements he must have had his attention drawn by Clyde and Co. to the ambit of that request as made clear by HFW.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is improbable that there is no correspondence between the Owners and CEB in relation to the Owners’ ability to repay the loan at the time of the supplementary agreements. Shortly before the trial the Owners disclosed four lever arch files (the K bundles) which included some correspondence. Mr. Thomas, in his closing submissions at paragraph 321(a), submitted that this correspondence reflected a close and flexible relationship between the Owners and CEB. However, no particular documents in those four files were referred to by Mr. Thomas and I do not recall, though I may be mistaken, that Mr. Thomas referred to any during the trial. Instead he said the files contained nothing relevant to the issues in the case. I can only say that the disclosure of correspondence between the Owners and CEB which contains nothing about the second and third supplementary agreements does not persuade me to accept that there was in truth not a single document exchanged between the Owners and CEB concerning those agreements. If there was an exchange of information with regard to the employment of vessels, as one document from the K bundles put to Mr. Beriker suggests and he accepted, one would expect there to be an exchange of information about the performance of the loan at the time when the supplemental agreements were made. Indeed Mr. Beriker accepted that there would be a regular exchange of information about fleet earnings and fleet projections. It is also most improbable that cashflow projections or forecasts were not provided by the Owners at the time of the supplementary agreements notwithstanding that Mr. Beriker described the Owners as “not very financially literate” and suggested that CEB would have done its own cash flows. It is improbable that the Owners did not prepare their own cash flow forecasts because it is difficult to see how a shipping business could be run without such forecasts and Mr. Agaoglu appended an analysis of running costs for the year to 31 December 2013 to his third statement. Indeed, later in his evidence Mr. Beriker accepted that when Kairos wished to restructure a loan they must have prepared revised cash flow forecasts or projections so as to make sure that the repayment schedule could be afforded. In addition there was no disclosure of any document relating to the additional loan in 2013 for payment of the dry docking expenses. There must have been such documents. </p>

Mr. Thomas has submitted in paragraphs 362-380 and 386-395 of his closing submissions that the Owners have, belatedly, fully complied with their disclosure obligations.

He further said that CEB never considered the commencement of foreclosure proceedings in connection with the loan agreement. Neither statement is particularly cogent in the present context. The first does not say in terms that there was no correspondence or other documentation between the Owners and the Bank relating to the restructuring which in fact took place. The second says nothing about how CEB viewed the loan in early 2013 or whether the Bank had considered asking for further capital injections or security. No account is given of CEB’s response to Mr. Agaoglu’s request to renegotiate the loan in February 2013 or of the reasons why CEB wished to have a new assignment and loss payable clause in February 2013.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Having considered the matters relied upon by Mr. Jacobs as justifying the inference that Mr. Agaoglu had a motive to scuttle ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE and the matters relied upon by Mr. Thomas to dispel that suggestion I have concluded that it is more likely than not that Mr. Agaoglu felt under financial pressure from CEB in early 2013. It is impossible to say what form that pressure took because full disclosure has probably not been given and there has been very limited evidence in writing from Mr. Tayfun and no oral evidence from him. But it is, it seems to me, a reasonable inference to draw from the matters to which I have referred that the Owners were under some form of financial pressure from CEB in early 2013. I have asked myself what other reason could there be for their reluctance and probable failure to give full disclosure and for Mr. Agaoglu to lie about the disposal of the insurance proceeds other than that Mr. Agaoglu feared that the truth would support the suggestion that he was under pressure from CEB and so had a motive to scuttle ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE. I can think of no other credible explanation. The April emails are some evidence that the relationship had its difficulties at that time. Of course, it does not follow that he did scuttle the vessel. That can only be determined after considering all of the evidence in the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">ATLANTIK CONFIDENCE was lost at sea after suffering a fire in the store room on the second deck of the engine room. It is more likely than not that the origin of the fire was in the store room and there is a real and substantial possibility that that fire was started deliberately in the doorway of the store room by spilling oil and igniting it. There is no more than a remote possibility that it was caused accidentally by reason of a fire originating from a leak of fuel oil at the no.2 generator. The engine room flooded. That flooding could have been caused deliberately and there is no more than a remote or unlikely possibility that it was caused by a crack in the shell plating resulting from thermal stresses caused by the fire. At about the same time the ballast double bottom tanks nos. 4 and 5 on the portside were flooded. That flooding could have been caused deliberately and there is no more than a remote possibility that it could have been caused by a flashover from the fire affecting the cabling to the ballast valve solenoid cabinet forward of the store room. Whilst the improbable can happen it is difficult to accept that three improbable events (an accidental fire, an accidental flooding of the engine room caused by the fire and an accidental flooding of two double bottom tanks on the portside caused by the fire) may have occurred in rapid succession to each other. This reasoning is frequently used in alleged scuttling cases. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ioanna</span> (1922) 12 Lloyd’s List Reports 54 at p.58 Greer J. said:</p>

The Owners of the vessel had instructed the master to change the route of the vessel so that she sailed into deep water. The master and Captain Toran sought to hide that change of route. After it could no longer be hidden they said it was justified by a risk or piracy when it was not. These matters strongly suggest that the loss of the vessel was deliberate. There was also, consistently with a deliberate loss, an unscheduled abandon ship drill the day after the change of route had been directed. Mr. Thomas suggested a number of explanations for this (see paragraph 223 of his closing submissions) but, in the context of the evidence as a whole, it is more likely than not that, in circumstances where there had been a scheduled drill on 23 March 2013, the master was ensuring that the crew was well prepared for an abandon ship order.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The further matters of “cumulative suspicion” in this case are these.  The chief engineer showed himself as unwilling on two occasions to have others in the engine room. He sent the second engineer away from the engine room at a time when one would expect that he would have welcomed his assistance and he ordered the third engineer and the AB, when wearing fire fighting suits and breathing apparatus, to abandon the inspection of the engine room which had been ordered by the master. He also told the master on the bridge after the CO2 had been injected and shortly before the vessel was abandoned that there was a risk of explosion from diesel oil tanks when it is unlikely that he held that opinion. It is possible that he was attempting to provide support for the master’s decision to abandon the vessel. Further, the master delayed in sending a distress message and failed to alert his Owners to the casualty’s predicament before he abandoned ship. He failed to investigate the list to port by taking soundings or by asking the chief officer to inspect the ballast console and he failed to remove the chart from the bridge. After the vessel had been abandoned the master and chief engineer returned twice to the vessel. It is possible that the purpose of the visits was to see what could be done to further the sinking. Individually, these matters are not perhaps of great weight but, collectively, they are suggestive of a deliberate casualty.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is difficult to speculate as to the thought processes of a scuttler since scuttling is a rare activity. Whilst some engineers might appreciate that a bulk carrier will not sink if her engine room and ballast tanks 4 and 5 on the portside are flooded  it does not follow that all will. There is no primer or guide to scuttling. Although Mr. Chell expressed the opinion that a competent chief engineer would not anticipate that such actions would sink the vessel Mr. Colman said that it “would be difficult even for a technically competent scuttler to predict whether the flooding of the E[ngine] R[oom] together with any other space or spaces would sink the ship, because the ship’s stability books and computer do not provide the necessary data or input facilities”. However, neither Mr. Chell nor Mr. Colman is an expert on scuttling. I accept that incompetence in scuttling can be a factor weighing against a finding of scuttling but any such finding will of course depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. In the present case, the matters which I have summarised above so strongly indicate scuttling as the probable cause of the loss of the vessel that I am not dissuaded from finding scuttling because the chief engineer displayed an ignorance of the need to flood, in addition to the engine room, a further large space in order to sink the vessel or because he chose a method which only flooded the engine room slowly (see paragraphs 120-123 of Mr. Thomas’ closing submissions).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For very much the same reason I do not consider that the circumstance that Cargo has failed to establish that hold no.5 flooded as a result of down flooding in bad weather is fatal to its case. Cargo did not suggest that the flooding of hold no.5 (without which the vessel would not have sunk) was deliberate. It is plausible to suggest, as the Owners have done, that it came about, albeit improbably, as a result of a damaged or corroded ballast pipe (together with down flooding once the hatch cover was submerged). If that is what happened then the scuttler was fortunate to achieve his aim. But the circumstances of the case which I have summarised nevertheless cogently suggest that this was a case of scuttling. The flooding of the engine room and of the no. 4 and 5 port double bottom tanks was deliberate and such deliberate flooding was an effective cause of the sinking of the vessel. If hold no.5 flooded because of a damaged or corroded ballast pipe (and later down flooding) the deliberate actions of the scuttler nevertheless brought about the sinking of the vessel. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, Mr. Thomas (at paragraphs 99-114 of his closing submissions) made a similar point with regard to the circumstance that only a limited a number of ballast tanks on the portside were flooded . Why would a scuttler activate so few rather than all ballast valves, or at any rate all on the portside? A number of answers have been canvassed. Mr. Thomas objects that not all have been pleaded but I do not consider that this is the sort of matter that has to be pleaded. I consider it unlikely that the scuttler deliberately intended only to flood two double bottom tanks in order to avoid causing suspicions as to the deliberate nature of the casualty (described by Mr. Thomas the “cunning scuttler”). It is possible that the scuttler thought that flooding the engine room, two double bottom tanks on the portside and, on Cargo’s case, the aft peak would cause the vessel to sink (described by Mr. Thomas as the “incompetent scuttler”). Another, and more likely, possibility is that he intended to flood more tanks on the portside but in circumstances where he was also involved in setting a fire and flooding the engine room he failed to activate all the valves he intended to activate. Mr. Thomas submitted that it is far-fetched to think that such a simple task could have been bungled. I do not consider that possibility to be far-fetched. In any event so strong are the circumstances suggesting a deliberate sinking that doubts as to whether the scuttler was cunning or incompetent are not sufficient to overcome the evidential weight of those circumstances. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, it was said (particularly in Mr. Thomas’ oral closing submissions) that flooding the engine room by opening the lower sea chest was a danger to the scuttler. No doubt it was, though the danger could be reduced, as Mr. Colman suggested in his first report, either by loosening the cover rather than removing it or by closing the inlet valve first and then opening a valve to produce a relatively slow flow. In his oral evidence Mr. Colman said that if the flow was at the assumed rate of 400 tons per hour the scuttler would be in danger of being knocked over and being in deep water very quickly. (The chief engineer himself, when cross-examined, did not suggest there would be such a danger, but thought that there would be a danger of electric shocks from gushing water.) No doubt  there was a danger but, as the Earl of Birkenhead remarked in <span style="font-style:italic">The Olympia,</span> when a similar submission was made in that case (at p.525) that one would not choose to sink a ship by running her aground at full speed with every possibility of the bottom being ripped out of her causing her to sink immediately, “in these matters I suppose you must take some risks” (see p. 528). Although there was a risk to the scuttler, not only in flooding the engine room but also in setting a fire using oil as an accelerant, so strong are the circumstances  pointing to a deliberate sinking that they are not outweighed by consideration of the danger involved. </p>

Moreover, there are matters which suggest the involvement of senior employees in the Owners’ office in the deliberate loss of the vessel. First, there is the email of 25 March 2013 from the office instructing the master to follow a route which would take the vessel into deep water. Second, there is the telephone call between the master and Captain Mahmut on 25 March 2013 shortly after the master had been requested to change route and to ring the office.  It is likely that the master’s instructions to scuttle were then confirmed. There were further telephone calls with Captain Taner on 28 and 29 March 2013. Third, Captain Toran in his statement said nothing about the instruction from the office to the master to change the vessel’s route. It is likely that he did so deliberately in an attempt to avoid suspicion falling on the Owners. Fourth, Captain Taner and Captain Mahmut were sent to the casualty on board HEATHER. Although the purpose of sending HEATHER had been to provide a report and photographs neither superintendent provided a report and instead suggested that the purpose of sending HEATHER was to protect the casualty from piracy, which was most unlikely. The failure of the Owners to inform the salvors of HEATHER’s presence in Muscat at the same time as the salvage team is consistent with a desire that the superintendents reached the casualty before the salvors. When they approached the casualty in a small boat they did not take a camera with them but instead took with them some tools. This was an odd expedition to a vessel in distress. They had, they said, no particular plan. They did not tell the professional salvors who had been engaged to assist the vessel (and who were yet to arrive) that they were at the casualty and intended to board it. They did not seek advice from them as to what they might do if they boarded it. Having considered the likely purpose of their visit in the context of the case as a whole I consider it likely that they went to the casualty to do what they could to hasten the sinking of the vessel. Mr. Thomas said this is unlikely given that they would have been seen by the officers and crew of HEATHER. That they would have been seen boarding is clear but it is doubtful that it would have been possible for onlookers to see what they did. As Mr. Jacobs said, they could have said on their return that there was nothing they could do. I am unable to accept the evidence of Captains Toran, Taner and Mahmut that they were not involved in the deliberate loss of the vessel.  </p>

Those matters are sufficient to establish the involvement of Mr. Agaoglu. But in addition Mr. Agaoglu had a motive to arrange the sinking of the vessel. His companies were in real financial difficulty and it is likely that he was under pressure from his bank. He would alleviate both by his bank recovering the insurance proceeds of US$22m. There was no evidence as to when Mr. Agaoglu or those acting on his behalf asked the master and chief engineer to sink the vessel or why they agreed to do so but Mr. Agaoglu must have had the opportunity to make, or more likely arrange, such a request.

I do not consider that there is. The expert technical evidence has suggested possible mechanisms by which the fire could have started accidentally and by which the vessel could have been lost accidentally but an accidental fire and loss are, in my judgment, remote and can be excluded by the weight of the considerations which suggest a deliberate fire and a deliberate loss. This is a case where, in the language of Stuart-Smith LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ikarian Reefer,</span> “the balance tilts heavily and sufficiently far in favour of” a finding that the loss was deliberate. There may have been, albeit that it is unlikely, a hole in the ballast piping in hold no.5 which permitted ballast water to enter that hold from double bottom no.5 but if that is what happened the loss of the vessel was still caused by the deliberate actions of the master and chief engineer in flooding the engine room and the nos.4 and 5 double bottom tanks. Such actions were an effective cause of the loss of the vessel. I have asked myself whether, to use Colman J.s’ phrases in <span style="font-style:italic">The Grecia Express,</span> it is “highly improbable” that the vessel was lost accidentally such that I have “a high level of confidence” that the vessel was deliberately sunk and that the allegation made against Mr. Agaoglu is true. It is and I do. I have also asked myself whether, to use Aikens J.’s phrase in <span style="font-style:italic">The Milasan</span> the facts proved against Mr. Agaoglu are “sufficiently unambiguous” to establish that he was complicit in the casting away of his vessel. They are. Finally, I have asked myself, as <span style="font-style:italic">The Popi M</span> requires the court to do, whether this is a case where the court is left in doubt as to the cause of the loss of the vessel with the result that the court is unable to make a finding as to the cause. I am not left in doubt as to the cause of the loss.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The vessel was deliberately sunk by the master and chief engineer at the request of Mr. Agaoglu, the alter ego of the Owners. In those circumstances the loss of the cargo resulted from his personal act committed with the intent to cause such loss. The loss of the cargo was the natural consequence of his act as he must have appreciated. There can be no doubt that he intended the cargo to be lost just as much as he intended the vessel to be lost. It follows that the Owners’ claim for a limitation decree must be dismissed.</p>
