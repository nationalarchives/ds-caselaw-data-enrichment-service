Her guest carrying capacity appears to have been 2,388 and she was manned by a crew of 1,067. She is described as flagged in the Bahamas. She is one of the fleet of 12 ships apparently operated by an organisation trading as NCL or Norwegian Cruise Line (“NCL”).

However the brochure provided gives the impression that the fleet is intended to provide the type of shipboard experience which might be associated with a well known and respected maritime nation. The Defendant is named as a Bahamian company and, although it was clear that part of the operation was run from offices in Southampton and Hammersmith, is, for present purposes, to be treated as the owner or the managing operator of the ship. As such it was either the actual owner or, if it was acting as operating manager then it was the agent of the shipowner for the purposes of contracting to carry persons onboard the ship. I should make it clear that no issues as to the identity or operating capacity of the Defendant itself arose at the trial other than those related to the Athens Convention described below. </p>

The passengers were thus able to disembark directly to shore to explore that town. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span> July 2013 the ship called at Santorini, Greece. This island does not provide docking facilities so that the ship anchors off the island and the passengers are disembarked and reembarked by a tender boat or boats. At many such places the ship’s own boats will be used as tenders however at Santorini that did not occur and a tender or tenders operated by a local company were used. </p>

I say apparently because although there was no direct evidence on the subject of the tender and its operation a ‘computer download’ has been provided which appears to be a web site for the Union. That has provided the following particulars for that vessel. She was built in 2008 by Epsilon Marine for a diving centre in Crete, is 21.1 metres in length, has a beam of 5.05 metres, is fitted with two engine developing 650 hp which apparently give her a maximum speed of 24 knots. The specifications provided state that she was built by Santos Marine which contradicts the narrative referring to her having been built by Epsilon. However I was informed that this discrepancy is explained by the fact that Santos Marine was the company which had refurbished the tender in about 2010. She has a variety of electronic equipment including an announcement system and cameras monitoring the engine room, main and upper deck.</p>

Immediately forward of that is a portion of the main deck of the tender which has seating. At the forward end of that are steps leading to the upper deck which are shown to be a companionway to the port of the vessel’s centre line and just aft of a doorway or entrance leading through a bulkhead into the cabin which is situated forward of the aft part of the main deck. According to the Claimant and his wife they had intended to ascend the companionway to the open air seating on the upper deck but apparently information was given by someone that the upper deck seating was filled and they should move forward on the main deck. The Claimant alleges that he moved forward to the cabin area closely following those ahead of him, he was ahead of his wife, she was not pushing him but he felt under pressure to make his way to a seat.

With reference to the booking conditions at p.197 of the trial bundle she expressed the view that there had been a binding contract between NCL and the passenger. She also confirmed that NCL did not charge an additional fare for use of the tender. It was considered as a service provided within the fare paid by the Claimant to NCL. That evidence was in conflict with the witness statement of Ms. Jane Kilgour to the effect that the NCL had no contract with the Union which was the owner of the tender. However Ms. Kilgour was not called to give evidence.</p>

One of these is a view taken form aft which shows the seating area on the aft deck. That demonstrates the companionway leading to the upper deck. The wooden deck can be seen and also, to starboard of the companionway just referred to an ‘opening’ in a transverse bulkhead between the aft main deck and a cabin area. That opening has a door which is open against a longitudinal bulkhead to port and also a closed half door to the starboard (that this was also capable of being opened is shewn in other photos which were provided). The photograph also shews windows to port and starboard of the after main deck area. It was suggested by the Claimant that these had blinds or curtains which were closed at the material time. However the photograph in question does not indicate that the windows onto the aft deck had such blinds although other photographs indicate that the windows to the cabin area did have curtains. Some photographs shew the latter to be drawn and others undrawn. There is no reliable evidence from which it can be ascertained whether those curtains were drawn closed or undrawn at the material time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">The photographs in Group 3 at p.249 and 250 of the bundle demonstrate that the “raised area” is in fact a sill at the bottom of the door at the entrance into the cabin area from the aft deck. As the after deck is a weather deck it is not surprising that there is a sill at the door into the cabin area as it would be necessary to ensure that any water which might get on to the aft deck did not enter the cabin area. There is no evidence as to the precise height of the sill but using the photographs at pages 249 and 250 of the bundle it can be seen that the wooden aft deck ran up to the sill. These photographs indicate that the height of sill was not inconsiderable and may have been about half the height of the benches or seating. Again that height has not been measured but it is not unreasonable to suppose that the height of the seating was in the bracket of 16-18 inches. That would indicate that the height of the sill was about 8-9 inches. Furthermore using the photograph at p.80(n) of the bundle it is possible to compare the height of the sill with the rise between the steps of the companionway leading to the upper sundeck. In my view these appear to be similar although the height of the sill might have been a little greater. A not unusual rise for steps may be considered to be 6-7 inches. Bearing these factors in mind I think it probable that the height of the sill was between 6 and 9 inches high.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">There is a significant issue between the parties as to whether the sill was marked at the material time and, if so, how it was marked. A problem is that the precise date of the photographs is not known. Group 1 show that there were two thin strips of red and white tape. These mark the top of the sill but do not extend very far down it. It is most probable that the Group 1 photographs were taken in about 2010. It is known that the photographs in Group 3 were taken in October 2015. The date of the photographs in Group 2 is less certain but p.80(n) refers to the 70<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Anniversary of the Union 1945-2015 and it therefore probable that those photographs also date from about 2015. </p>

All that can be said is that it is probable that at some time between 2010 and 2015 the marking on the sill was changed from the two red and white strips seen in the photograph at p.259 to a set of black and yellow strips which are clearly shown on the photographs at pp. 249 and 250. The latter marking appears to be made up of 4 strips which takes up most of the height of the sill. As such it was clearly more visible than the earlier red and white stripes. </p>

The Claimant relied upon Mr. Vikas Vedi and the Defendant upon Mr. Michael Hook. In his report Mr. Vedi took the view that the Claimant has sustained a tear to the rotator cuff of the left shoulder and, as a result the Claimant was suffering from ongoing pain, discomfort and a limited function of the shoulder. His initial view was that this stemmed solely from the incident. However following discussion with Mr. Hook he accepted that there was a pre-existing degenerative condition the symptoms of which were accelerated by a period of about 1 year. Their evidence was provided on the first day of the trial. Mr. Vedi had modified his original view after sight of the evidence following a scan of the Claimant’s shoulder which demonstrated pre-existing degenerative changes in the area of the Claimant’s spine. He was an impressive witness who was readily prepared to modify his views in the light of further available evidence. He was not dogmatic and was clearly aware of his duty to assist the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr. Hook was likewise an impressive witness who was also prepared to modify his views in the light of further available evidence, was not dogmatic and was aware of his duty to assist the court. He had put forward three possible explanations for the Claimant’s symptoms. The first was that the accident accelerated the onset of the symptoms from a pre-existing degenerative changes by a period of about one year. The second was that the Claimant’s symptons in the shoulder had been caused by a pre-existing pathology to the cervical spine. The third was that the Claimant’s symptoms to the shoulder had been wholly caused by degenerative changes to the left shoulder. In evidence Mr. Hook stated that the second and third options could not be considered to be related to the incident. He also considered that the third option was less likely than the second and that he felt that the symptoms more probably indicated a problem with the neck and shoulder. His view as to the probability of the first approach being an appropriate consideration depended upon the extent to which the Claimant had complained of symptoms at a time which was proximate to the incident. The apparent lack of complaint about pain in his shoulder by the Claimant immediately after the incident had influenced his initial view that the first option was probably not an appropriate consideration. However he accepted that there had been no complaint of pain prior to the accident and that if there was credible evidence of the Claimant having complained of symptoms in his shoulder within a period of about 48 hours of the incident then the fall was a factor to be considered. In those circumstances he opined that an injury to the shoulder at the time of the fall could and probably had exacerbated a pre-existing condition. He considered that this acceleration of the symptoms becoming apparent would have been by about 12-18 months but said that there could be no certainty of the exact period by which it was accelerated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It appeared that the medical experts were in broad agreement that the Claimant was suffering from a degenerative condition in the cervical spine and/or the area of his shoulder and that would have given rise to symptoms within a period of about 12-18 months of the date of the incident regardless of whether the Claimant had suffered the fall or not.  There was an initial difference between them as to whether the fall had been a causative feature accelerating the condition but I think that there was broad agreement that a conclusion on this aspect depended upon whether there was credible evidence that the Claimant had complained of relevant symptoms, such as pain in the shoulder area, at or within a reasonable time of the incident occurring. From the foregoing it is apparent that there is an outstanding issue as to whether there is cogent evidence of complaint by the Claimant at the time of the incident or within a relatively short period thereafter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0.04in">The question is whether the period when the Claimant was onboard the tender is “carriage” included under Art.1.8 of the Convention. It is clear that carriage includes periods whilst the passenger is in the course of disembarkation and the period whilst the passenger is being transported from the ship to the land or vice versa. The Defendant submitted that where this is being done by means of water transport then it is only included as a period of carriage if the passenger <span style="text-decoration:underline">and his cabin luggage</span> are the subject of such transportation. In my view such a literal construction of the Article would be contrary to a purposive construction of the Convention as it would mean that only disembarkation at the beginning and end of the voyage would be included. Further, and in any event, Art.1.6 defines “<span style="font-style:italic">cabin luggage</span>” as not only including luggage which the passenger has in his cabin but also luggage which otherwise in his </p>

It is difficult to envisage any situation in which a passenger might wish to go ashore during the course of a cruise without taking any of his possessions with him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0.04in">It was also submitted that the article did not apply because NCL did not provide the services of the tender for the purposes of allowing passengers to disembark at Santorini. I cannot accept that contention. Both the Claimant and his wife denied that a specific fare was required or paid for their use of the tender and Ms. Mulligan confirmed that the Claimant did not, himself, pay for passage on the tender but that it was included in the overall price of the cruise. This begs the question as to how the Union was being paid. There was no evidence that the Union were providing their services voluntarily and it seems inherently unlikely that this would be the case. In my view there is a very strong inference that either NCL paid the Union directly for its tender services or the Union was paid by a third party such as the port authority. If NCL did not pay the Union directly then it is probable that the tender’s services were provided as part of the port services which would have been covered by the port dues payable by the Ship’s owners. It follows, on a balance of probabilities, that either the services of the tender at Santorini were organised and paid for directly by the NCL or it was supplied as part of the port facilities provided to the Ship. In either event I conclude that the tender was a vessel which was put at the disposal of the disembarking passengers by the carrier, namely NCL. </p>

Mr. Mcgrath asked the Claimant whether he was a knight. The Claimant responded that he was not a knight but a baronet. He subsequently informed the court that he did not know the date of the creation of his baronetcy but that it was associated with a piece of land in the channel islands which had been gifted to him by a person or persons whose identity he refused to disclose. As his demeanour on this subject was defensive and the explanation did not appear to be satisfactory, at the end of the hearing, the court invited the Claimant to produce any list or other documents which would support his claim to be a baronet.

This is a public document which is now kept in the Ministry of Justice and is maintained by the Standing Council of the Baronetage with the authority of the Lord Chancellor. A Royal Warrant of King Edward VII, dated 8th February 1910, directed that no person whose name is not entered on the Official Roll of Baronets (“the Official Roll”) shall be received as a Baronet, or shall be addressed or mentioned by that title in any civil or military Commission, Letters Patent or other official document. The up to date Official Roll may be inspected on the relevant web site which includes the fact of and reason behind the Royal Warrant. In my view the Official Roll may be relied upon for the purposes of the 1910 Royal Warrant, to determine if an individual should be officially accorded the title and precedence of a baronet.

The earlier photographs indicate that there was a red and white warning strip in place. That indicates that the owners of the tender appreciated that the sill was a potential hazard which needed to be marked. All the later photographs either come from the Santorini brochure which was dated 2015 or those taken on behalf of the Defendant in 2015. The fact that it had been improved indicates that the owners of the tender considered that an improvement needed to be made. The evidence does not indicate when the sill was re-marked with the black and yellow stripes which are deeper than the earlier ones. The Defendant caused the photographs to be taken in 2015 and it would have been relatively easy to ask the owners of the tender when the improvement was made. As the Defendant had introduced the marking as a matter of its defence I take the view that it had a burden to establish when the improvement was made. Mr. Wijeyaratne submitted that I must accept the evidence of the Claimant that the sill was wholly unmarked at the relevant time. In the light of the evidence of the earlier photographs I do not accept that submission but, given the evidential burden on the Defendant, there is an inference that the marking was improved after, and possibly because of, the incident involving the Claimant.  </p>

Although it is probable that the passengers were passing from bright light to an area in shadow the windows at the aft end of the vessel were large and the suggestion that the lighting was inadequate cannot be accepted. </p>

Even if the tender was crowded such a sign would have made it clear to persons entering the cabin that they should watch the area around their feet. In my view such a sign would probably have been seen by the Claimant who would have been better warned as to the hazard he was approaching. The failure to provide such a sign and the deficiencies in the marking of the sill were, I find, causative of the injury and was a fault by the owners of the tender who were performing carriers for whose faults NCL were directly responsible. </p>

This is a function which should be performed by the ship’s safety officer and if in this case he had done so he should, in my view, have recognised the potential hazard formed by the step or sill. Had he done so there is no reason why he should not have asked the owners of the tender to place a warning sign in the doorway to the cabin or, if they had proved unable or reluctant to do so to have provided a marker and board from the ship’s own stores to provide a warning. As a reasonable alternative there is no reason why he should not have insisted that one of the ship’s crew accompany the passengers to warn them of the relevant hazard.

Looking at the particulars of the ship provided in the documents it is noteworthy that she carries a very large crew. In the circumstances it cannot be argued the ship was insufficiently manned to carry out this simple task. What was needed was sufficient foresight to identify the hazzard and sufficient commonsense as to how to tackle it efficiently. </p>

He has given evidence that there were others ahead of him and, as there is no suggestion that others were injured, it follows that they managed to avoid tripping over the sill. Not only does this confirm that the conditions near the sill were not as bad as the Claimant has tried to convey it demonstrates that with an element of care being taken it was possible to avoid the danger posed by the sill. In my view a contributory reason for the fall was because the Claimant was probably proceeding too closely behind those ahead of him. In my view that is a matter emanating from his own failure of care rather than that of the Defendant. </p>

It is very unusual for such an application to be made, as in this case, immediately before or even during the trial itself although the rules do not preclude such an application. The object of this application was to seek to obtain the more advantageous costs result for the Defendant which may be allowed where such an order is made.  As I have found that the Claimant’s injuries did arise, at least in part, from the Defendant’s fault it is obvious that an order for summary judgment could not be made. However it seems to me that if this type of argument is to become common it will, as it did in this case, add significantly to the time spent on submissions. If the rules were clarified or altered so as to allow the court a wider discretion to make costs orders against a Claimant in favour of a Defendant in cases where it is obvious, having heard all the evidence, that the case should never have been commenced or continued a recurrence of this situation might be avoided. This is a matter which might be considered by the rules committee.  </p>

These attracted corrected awards of £4,850 and £4,814 respectively. However in the present case there was lessening of the symptoms attributable to the incident so that the Claimant was able to take up his hobbies of table tennis after 4 months and golf after 6 months. Insofar as his later and ongoing shoulder pains are concerned these are I think attributable to the degenerative nature of his pre-existing condition.
