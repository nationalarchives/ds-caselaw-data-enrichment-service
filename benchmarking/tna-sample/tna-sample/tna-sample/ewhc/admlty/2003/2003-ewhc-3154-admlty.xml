	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Brave class of vessel was designed and built as a fast naval attack vessel by way of evolvement from wartime MTBs.  Brave Challenger was a unique member of the class having been built by Vosper Thorneycroft (“Vospers”) for the shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos in 1962 as a one-off luxury yacht capable of 60 knots.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">WHB acquired the vessel in October 1978 and, over a period of some 10 years, put the vessel through a hugely expensive and elaborate rebuild.  Following re-launch and sea trials, the vessel was put on display at Southampton in a museum created by him which celebrated Rolls Royce Engineering.  At that time the museum was its registered owner.</p>

She is powered by 3 Rolls Royce Proteus gas turbines developing 12,750 h.p.  She is also fitted with twin GM diesels for harbour manoeuvring.  There is accommodation for the owner and eight guests, together with a captain and four crew.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the early 1990’s, WHB was both suffering from poor health and in financial difficulties.  His affairs were taken over by an accountant.  At some stage the accountant had arranged to transfer the ownership of Brave Challenger to a company called Victory Marine Ventures Ltd.  The vessel was then mortgaged to United Overseas Bank to secure a loan, the proceeds of which, WHB asserts, were embezzled by the accountant</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In due course WHB entered into a voluntary arrangement with his creditors.  As part of the subsequent realisation of his assets, the vessel was moved to Lymington in early 1997 and marketed by the mortgagee bank at an asking price of US $3,500,000.  No sale was achieved for a very considerable time.  Eventually, Indigo, an investment company owned by Mrs Nuria Planella, a national and resident of Andora, offered $750,000 for the vessel in the autumn of 1998.  This was accepted by the bank and the sale took place on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1998. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The bank appears to have granted power of attorney to the then chief engineer of the vessel, Mr Ian McDougall, to act for the owners in executing the Bill of Sale in favour of Indigo.  WHB was unaware of this transaction since by this time, as from September 1998, he had once again been admitted to the Churchill Priory hospital.  This reflected an excessive dependence on benzodiazepams and other sedatives. He remained as an in-patient until the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 1998. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Much earlier, sometime in the 1980’s, WHB had purchased Wentworth Woodhouse, a vast 300 roomed 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century property in South Yorkshire.  By November 1998, this too was on the market at the instance of mortgagees.  That month, shortly after the sale of the vessel, Mr Ian Stuart (“Mr Stuart”), the husband of Mrs Nuria Planella (“Mrs Stuart”), made telephone contact with WHB in hospital.  Mr Stuart was at that time a co-director of Indigo.  The primary topic of the conversation was the impending sale of Wentworth Woodhouse.  Whether the topic of the Brave Challenger was also discussed at the time (and in particular whether Mr Stuart encouraged WHB to buy back his former yacht and, with that in mind, indicated that he was contemplating that WHB should be given a form of preferential opportunity to do so) was a matter of some controversy.</p>

To this end Mr Stuart engaged a team to assist him.  It included:</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This team carried out a considerable amount of work on the vessel between January and August 1999, including the installation of a new generator, the inspection of the tailshafts and propellers, the fitting of water tanks and pumps, the provision of new electronics equipment, the replacement of anodes, the installation of new carpeting and other general refurbishment work.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Some of the major items were, however, contracted out, including the paintwork and the main engines.  As regards to the paintwork, quotations were sought from various yards.  In the event a quote from Vospers dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 1998 was accepted.  This covered both the painting of the topsides, superstructure and hull and the laying of a teak deck on the existing structure.  The agreed price was £100,000.  A part payment of £33,000 was made.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Initially Vospers embarked on the construction of a tent under which to carry out the painting work.  This proved to be unworkable.  Consequential delays led to the postponement of the installation of a teak deck (constituting some £58,000 of the total contract price) until the winter of 1999/2000.  In “compensation”, Vospers agreed to undertake all external varnish work for their own account. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The vessel was eventually moved into a shed at Vospers in April 1999 and the painting undertaken there.  The painting work proved highly unsatisfactory.  Mr Stuart instructed a surveyor to comment on the quality of the work.  He eventually reported in July 1999.  The surveyor drew attention to four major problems, namely shrinkage and movement of timber owing to change of moisture content, poor colour matching, suspect filling and faring associated with the incompatibility between the existing paint scheme and the new coatings and poor application.  In short, extensive repainting was required.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The problems must have been manifest much earlier since the publication of the report led to an immediate settlement agreement whereby the contract was terminated upon payment by Vospers of £125,000.  This settlement was expressly stated to be confidential.  The money appears to have been paid, not to Indigo, but to Mundial Investment SA, another company controlled by Mr Stuart and his wife, under the umbrella of which the work was being conducted.</p>

This company was apparently chosen on the recommendation of Ian McDougall.  Given his long association with the vessel, it was unquestionably a surprising choice given that the evidence clearly demonstrates that H.W. Turbines have an unsatisfactory record with regard to repair and maintenance of gas turbine engines in general and those formerly owned by WHB in particular.</p>

It would appear that engines 10170 and 12009 were sent to H.W. Turbines in November 1999.  The instruction was for a “bulk strip”.  A bulk strip consists of separating an engine into its separate large sections for inspection.  No details are available as to the defects found as a result of the bulk strip on these two engines or the work (if any) carried out as a result.  </p>

As regards engine 12009, this was apparently dismantled by H.W. Turbines but not re-assembled.  The sellers asserted that this was attributable to their termination of the contract by reason of their concern about an invoice from H.W. Turbines which contained a claim for wholly improbable hours allegedly worked over the Christmas period.  Despite this apparent fraud, HWT’s account, said to have been in the sum of £24,000, was apparently settled in full.  </p>

Indeed, Hoverspeed had contacted Mr Stuart within hours of hearing that Indigo had purchased the vessel with a view to buying any engine parts with an appropriate pedigree.  This was because gas turbines of this class were obsolescent and it was proving difficult to operate Hoverspeed’s passenger hovercraft to the rigorous requirements of Rolls Royce.  </p>

However, there was a problem.  Almost none of the individual engine maintenance logs had been handed over at the time of the sale.  It appears nonetheless that there was one log available (or at least a duplicate) but solely in respect of the turbine attached to 12009.  Hoverspeed accordingly agreed to buy this turbine.

In the result, even allowing for the cost incurred at HW Turbines of £24,000, the net cost to the sellers of all the work undertaken on the main engines amounted, on my reckoning, to a credit of £5,459.</p>

In a letter to Messrs. Deloitte &amp; Touche dated the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, Mr Briggs assessed the cost of meeting the MCA requirements as only some £10,000 and asserted that the requirements were approximately one third complete, with completion expected at the end of June.  </p>

In any event, by the time of the sale in April 2000, the necessary work had still not been completed (let alone certification granted).  Despite all this, even back in August, the sellers made arrangements with a firm called Something Different Leisure for advertising charters of Brave Challenger.  The brochure produced by that firm referred to the vessel as being “available for hire and charter” although it is not suggested that this brochure was provided to or seen by WHB.</p>

Indeed, on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2000, those brokers wrote to the Stuarts reporting on an interest that had been expressed for a two-week charter at the end June/early July for which they had quoted a figure of £84,000 plus delivery.

A Mr Eric Barrett was the predecessor to Dr Layton as co-trustee with WHB of the Succession Trust.  He was a partner at MacIntyres.

WHB accordingly pursued a claim for the surplus generated from the sale acting as litigant in person on behalf of the Succession Trust and recovered the sum of £936,000.  This was eventually paid to the Succession Trust in February 2000 although the likely outcome was probably known to WHB in late 1999.</p>

WHB alleges that the initial difficulties centred on the domestic water and sewage systems and the electrical control system.  Sometime in November 2000, after the end of the chartering season, WHB engaged Mr Graham Westbrook, a naval architect who had been involved in the rebuilding work on Brave Challenger in the ‘80s, to work on the electrical systems and circuits.  </p>

This necessarily affected his reliability.  Having lived with the claims at close quarters for over a year, WHB has in some respects come to believe in the truth of his evidence even when I suspect he is intelligent enough to recognise the weaknesses in it.  As will become apparent I have come to the conclusion that whilst much of the detail of WHB’s evidence was difficult to reconcile with the contemporary documents and the probabilities, nonetheless the broad thrust of his account was reliable.</p>

He claimed to have agreed terms for the purchase of the entire vessel as early as the end of 1998 at a price of £1.1 million. This figure, he explained, was based on the initial cost together with the anticipated cost of refurbishment (including MCA certification).  In due course, he managed to raise £550,000 for a half share.  As already noted he says that this sum was paid out in two tranches in the autumn.  Thus it would appear that no adjustment was sought to reflect the fact, for instance, that, quite apart from the general uncertainty as to how much had been spent on refurbishment work, some of the work had been postponed (e.g. MCA certification and the teak deck), some of the work was achieved at unexpectedly low cost (e.g. the main engines) and some of the work had led to a substantial refund (e.g. the painting).

Thus whilst the Stuart interests had more than recouped their outlay, Mr Briggs was left in the position where, on the face of it, he was out of pocket to the tune of nearly £400,000.  Despite this, he says that he transferred his shares in Urbane back to the Stuart interests shortly after the mortgage claim was instituted for a price of £75,000.  Whilst Mr Stuart’s evidence that a reconciliation of the retained VAT monies would be effected once the litigation was “successfully” completed may make sense, if it be true it flies in the face of Mr Briggs’ own evidence that he had no interest in the litigation.</p>

Nonetheless, I came to the firm conclusion that the driving force in the venture in which she had invested was her husband.  In the event her credibility stood or fell with him. </p>

He had moved on a permanent basis to Andorra in 1985, and by the time of the events with which the court is concerned, had taken Andorran nationality.  First impressions of Mr Stuart were that his apparent plausibility was undermined by a lack of straightforwardness.  These impressions were fortified during the course of his evidence.  He expended considerable energy in the witness box on the strange proposition that the truth would be revealed in the event that the content of his solicitors’ files were revealed, offering to exchange them for the buyers’ solicitor’s files.  More importantly as will emerge there was a striking inconsistency between his account about what he told WHB and the pleaded case. Overall I was left with the impression of a man who would be only too adept at gaining the confidence of a somewhat vulnerable and gullible figure such as WHB.  Furthermore, there was a tendency for his evidence to be more argumentative than direct.  This feature was particularly striking in the context of his evidence relating to the alleged visit by WHB and Mr Barrett to the vessel in March 2000, a topic I deal with in some detail hereafter.  </p>

The replacement turbine had been certified for 1000 hours.  Whilst the letter was put in evidence, Mr Hunt was not tendered as an oral witness.</p>

I reject the assertion that WHB never asked for the documents.  Whether they were destroyed or had been suppressed remains unknown.  I suspect the former but in either event it may be appropriate to resolve doubts in favour of WHB in respect of documentation that would have resolved matters.</p>

In the event the suggestion that no affirmative description of the work being effected on the vessel was ever given by the sellers was expressly contradicted by those witnesses called by the sellers and, in particular, Mr Stuart himself.  To the contrary, he claims to have kept WHB fully informed of all his plans and the progress of the work throughout.</p>

Thus there were, I find, discussions between them over the telephone as regards a possible sale of the yacht.  Those telephone discussions gave rise to the disclosure of an obvious enthusiasm for, bordering on an obsession with, the vessel on WHB’s part.  I find that this made Mr Stuart hopeful that WHB might be persuaded to become a potential purchaser and that accordingly, in pursuit of this aim, Mr Stuart, anxious to obtain WHB’s trust and confidence, sought to befriend him.  As an opening gambit, Mr Stuart gave him some kind of assurance that he would be given first call on the vessel.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The underlying theme of the seller’s case was that Mr Stuart had come to London simply out of interest in meeting WHB and that the meeting lasted 5 or 10 minutes.  The buyers contended that the meeting lasted an hour or more and focused primarily on the Brave Challenger.  The precise length of the meeting is probably of little consequence.  I have not forgotten Captain Allen’s recollection that Mr Stuart told him that the meeting had been brief on his return.  But I have no hesitation in preferring the buyer’s version that meeting occupied more in the region of an hour than five or ten minutes.  Mr Barratt was caught up in another meeting when both WHB (who had brought a wealth of documents with him) and, later, Ian Stuart arrived.  If the meeting that followed was only perfunctory, then both Mr Barrett and Ian Stuart would have had cause to remember that their time had been wasted.  In any event the concept of a brief meeting does not do justice to the volubility and pomposity of WHB.    </p>

In fact the probabilities overwhelmingly favour the conclusion that Brave Challenger was the primary, if not sole, topic of conversation.  The meeting was taking place against a background of an advanced state of the “refit” on Brave Challenger.  Indeed, the very same day Captain Allan records in his diary the transfer of the third engine 10168 to Hoverspeed.  Inquiries about certification had been raised with the MCA only 10 days earlier.  Captain Allan’s diary for the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January records a proposal by Mr Stuart to WHB for a three-month winter charter: this must have been made at the meeting.</p>

This was an ideal opportunity to enthuse a potential buyer who was believed to have funds secreted away somewhere.  In particular I accept the evidence of WHB at least to the extent that Ian Stuart emphasised (somewhat ambiguously) that the vessel was at Vosper’s yard undergoing a refit and that, as regards her engines, they were undergoing an overhaul at Hoverspeed.  (Although I rather doubt that Mr Stuart spoke of zero time in regard to the engines, WHB might readily have inferred that any overhaul of the engines would have led to a substantial and certificated running period prior to the next overhaul.)  I also accept WHB’s and Mr Barrett’s evidence that Mr Stuart emphasised the potential for chartering following the obtaining of MCA certification now scheduled for June.   </p>

I have come to the conclusion that, in accord with the evidence of WHB, it was sometime after the “sea trial” trips in August 1999 (being the time of an eclipse) and not shortly after the meeting in January as suggested by the Stuarts.  Whilst it is at least agreed that the lunch meeting took place, there is an enormous disparity between the accounts of what was discussed during it.  The material does not enable me to make any detailed findings.  Suffice it to say that, against the background of the work on the engines having then been completed (and allegedly satisfactory sea trials having been conducted) it is probable that the Stuarts did repeat the assurances set out above and did assert (as by then already expressed in the video, the brochure and the advertisement) that the vessel, and her engines, had been restored to prime/pristine/as new condition giving her a speed of 60 knots.  I also accept the evidence of WHB that the Stuarts exhorted him to try and buy the vessel, with the added carrot of MCA certification being put forward, in accord with the views of Mr Briggs, as “nearly complete”.  </p>

Quite when this offer was accepted remains obscure but it was of course subject to contract.  It was also subject to appropriate approval by the trustees of the Succession Trust, which was to fund the purchase and become owner of the vessel, either directly or through a wholly controlled corporate entity.</p>

Equally, as regards the chartering, it may well be that the assurance included an assertion that the vessel was indeed MCA certificated.  As I already indicated the sellers took a pretty cavalier attitude to the proposition that MCA approval was available (see for instance Mr Briggs’ assurances to Nat West).  In this latter context, the charter enquiry made to Messrs Archibald Reid is significant.  I accept WHB’s evidence that this was volunteered to him by Mr Stuart at about the same time as the visit.

Any chartering prospects (other than as a promotional rendezvous alongside the quay) would be dependent on the availability and reliability of her engines.

It is a concept that has significant nautical associations and means in its ordinary sense something much more substantial than routine maintenance.  As a matter of general language I agree with the evidence of Mr Bridges, the consultant engineer called by the buyers, that it means a thorough overhaul restoring it to a condition by necessary renewals and repairs fit for prolonged service.  (In that respect, Captain Allan’s observation in his witness statement, adopted in the particulars of defence, that “we carried out various repairs and maintenance work on the yacht for nearly a year” is rather revealing.)  Of course, the yacht had been rebuilt whilst in the ownership of WHB and had only been used for a few hours.

In this respect, the buyers relied upon the evidence of Mr Bridges, an engineer with particular experience with gas turbines.  (The sellers chose not to call their own expert Mr Alan Robinson.)  In his report, Mr Bridges emphasised it was necessary to have a complete record of service to enable “engine state and life expectancy to be defined”.   This was of particular importance with regard to time-limited parts such as blades and discs.  In his view it was unsafe to start the engines.  In order to operate Brave Challenger at its designed high speed it would be necessary to install replacement engines with a known service history (at a cost of about £500,000 per engine).</p>

Quite apart from the risk associated with starting the engines, there was only one occasion when all three engines operated and even then the speed achieved was only 49 knots (perhaps not surprising given the power limitations of some of the gearboxes which were equally uncertificated).  In any event, the trips in August could at best be described as a test, not a trial, and a fairly unsuccessful one at that.

It was noted that there was no sewage treatment plant fitted which would be expected of a vessel of this design and capability and is highly desirable for extended cruising.

Other items were premised on a failure to adopt developments introduced years after the vessel was originally built (e.g. the high rotational radar, CO2 or FM200 fire fighting gas, and facilities for shore discharge of sewage).  The remaining items were principally examples of unfinished work associated with the installation of replacement parts (e.g. the failure to connect the forward fire hydrant, the failure to replace the membrane in the water system and the failure to secure the sewage holding tank) or relatively minor aspects of design associated with the refit work (e.g. the fitting of water pumps low in the bilges, inadequate power in replacement batteries, the seawater suction for the diesel generator too far aft).</p>

Nonetheless the major impediment to certification and charter business related to the history and the maintenance record of the gas turbines.  As already explained the failure to conduct a proper overhaul of the engines is part and parcel of the overarching problem of the absence of any maintenance records and/or logs.  This not only rendered it unsafe to start the engines but equally rendered it impossible to comply with MCA requirements.  Thus any misrepresentation about MCA certification, even assuming such would have not have been readily apparent from the absence of an appropriate certificate, is no more that another way of putting the complaint about the status of the engines. </p>

The background to the offer and acceptance of a price of £2 million remains obscure.  I conclude that it is likely that Mr Stuart did, as contended by WHB, suggest to him that the price reflected “cost plus 10%” but I need not make any finding in that regard.  Furthermore, quite how Mr Stuart anticipated that WHB (or the Trust) would be able to meet his obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price given his parlous financial position, remains equally unclear.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless, having found that the status of the engines had been misrepresented by the sellers, I must go on to consider the further issue as to whether the trustees and/or the buyers had been influenced thereby to purchase the vessel.  In this connection I have well in mind that it is not necessary for the buyers to demonstrate that if the misrepresentation had not been made they would not have entered into the contract: it is sufficient to show that the misrepresentation was one of the inducing causes.</p>

But it is also not necessary for the sellers to demonstrate that the misrepresentation was material in the sense that it would have acted as an inducement to a reasonable man: the burden is on the buyer to show that he did rely on the misrepresentation.  It is no answer that a reasonable man would not have been so influenced if the representor ought to know that he is likely to rely on it..</p>

Thus the sellers asserted that WHB was determined to re-acquire the vessel regardless of its condition.  As they put it, he simply wanted somewhere to live, without any need for use of the main engines, so as to bring some sense of security into his troubled life.   They rely on three matters in particular that were said to reflect this attitude: </p>

I also reject the submission that he was simply relying on his own knowledge of the vessel and its engines derived from the period of his ownership.  The business plan gives the lie to that.  It may well be that he regarded the vessel as a potential home and, as regards income potential, had much in mind the possibility of static charters using the vessel as an unusual corporate conference and entertaining venue.  But the reality is that the only feature of the vessel differentiating it from any other luxury yacht was the main propulsion units.  Their condition inevitably formed a crucial ingredient in any decision to purchase.  </p>

Given the history of their relationship, Mr Stuart ought to have realised that WHB would rely on the representations.  In short, I find that WHB did rely on the representation relating to the engines as one of the material influences in entering into the contract.</p>

The oral and written representations made to WHB can properly be treated as having been made to Mr Barrett as well, being a person that the sellers must have expected them to have been passed on to.  But in any event, as I have already found, Mr Stuart repeated them all direct to Mr Barrett during the visit to Brave Challenger in March 2000.  I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Barrett relied them in according his approval to the purchase.</p>

This is perhaps scarcely surprising given the range of issues that arose on matters of liability and the lay representation of the buyers.  Suffice it to say for the moment that I find, at the least, that the sellers have not proved that they had reasonable grounds to believe (and did believe) at the time that the contracts were made that the facts represented with regard to the engines were true and thus the buyers are entitled to claim damages under the Misrepresentation Act 1967.  It may that the claim could have been advanced in deceit but I am not sure that such is pleaded (or pursued). It probably does not matter since the measure of damages would be the same.  </p>
