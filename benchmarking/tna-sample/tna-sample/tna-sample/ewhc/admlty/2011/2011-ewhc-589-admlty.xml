	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These proceedings arise from the dismissal of CPT’s services by Thor on 11 July 2007 and their replacement by another Chilean salvage company, Ultragas.  Following the settlement of the insurance claim, TF made a claim against CPT on the grounds that the damage sustained by ATHENA post the engagement of CPT was caused by the negligence of CPT in facilitating the re-ignition and spread of the fire.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To that end, TF commenced proceedings in Santiago, Chile in November 2008 giving rise to mandatory arbitration proceedings pursuant to Article 1203 of the Chilean Commercial Code (“the Code”).  The claim was in the amount of the entire repair costs.  These proceedings were formally served on CPT in August 2009.  In its written defence dated 9 October 2009, CPT contended that the services had been rendered under the terms of the BIMCO Wreckhire form which contained an English arbitration clause and that, accordingly, the Chilean arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to determine the claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the same basis, CPT sought and obtained an interim anti-suit injunction from Beatson J in November 2009.  The application was originally commenced ex parte before Blair J.  It was adjourned and at a subsequent ex parte hearing on notice before Beatson J TF made provisional submissions without prejudice to its entitlement to seek to set aside the order in the light of any fresh evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the grant of the anti-suit injunction, CPT sought a declaratory award on jurisdiction from Mr Simon Kverndal QC being one of the panel of arbitrators appointed to hear arbitrations under Lloyd’s Open Form.  He had been purportedly nominated by CPT under the provisions of Clause 18 of the BIMCO Wreckhire standard form of contract.  Before the publication of Mr Kverndal’s award, TF commenced this action pursuant to section 72 (1) of the Arbitration Act 1996 raising the question whether there was a valid arbitration agreement.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This hearing is not concerned with the merits of TF’s claim to damages but solely with the question whether or not there is an arbitration agreement between the parties as contained in clause 18 of the BIMCO Wreckhire terms.  It is common ground that, if the services were rendered on those terms, CPT is entitled to an order for a final injunction.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">"Speaking from my own experience, I have found it essential in cases of fraud, when considering the credibility of witnesses, always to test their veracity by reference to the objective facts proved independently of their testimony, in particular by reference to the documents in the case, and also to pay particular regard to their motives and to the overall probabilities. It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses' motives, and to the overall probabilities, can be of very great assistance to a Judge in ascertaining the truth."</p>

Whether there is a binding contract between the parties and, if so, upon what terms depends upon what they have agreed.

Even if certain terms of economic or other significance to the parties have not been finalised, an objective appraisal of their words and conduct may lead to the conclusion that they did not intend agreement of such terms to be a pre-condition to a concluded and legally binding agreement.</p>

This may be misleading, since the word 'essential' in that context is ambiguous. If by 'essential' one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true: the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract. If by 'essential' one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract, then the statement is tautologous. If by 'essential' one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail, the statement is untrue. It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant. It is the parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge [at page 611] 'the masters of their contractual fate'. Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. It happens every day when parties enter into so-called 'heads of agreement'.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"The real difficulty is to be found in the factual matrix of the transaction, and in particular the fact that the work was being done <span style="font-style:italic">pending </span>a formal sub-contract the terms of which were still in a state of negotiation. It is, of course, a notorious fact that, when a contract is made for the supply of goods on a scale and in circumstances such as the present, it will in all probability be subject to standard terms, usually the standard terms of the supplier. Such standard terms will frequently legislate, not only for the liability of the seller for defects, but also for the damages (if any) for which the seller will be liable in the event not only of defects in the goods but also of late delivery. It is a commonplace that a seller of goods may exclude liability for consequential loss, and may agree liquidated damages for delay. In the present case, an unresolved dispute broke out between the parties on the question whether CBE's or BSC's standard terms were to apply, the former providing no limit to the seller's liability for delay and the latter excluding such liability altogether. Accordingly, when, in a case such as the present, the parties are still in a state of negotiation, it is impossible to predicate what liability (if any) will be assumed by the seller for, eg defective goods or late delivery, if a formal contract should be entered into. In these circumstances, if the buyer asks the seller to commence work 'pending' the parties entering into a formal contract, it is difficult to infer from the [seller] acting on that request that he is assuming any responsibility for his performance, except such responsibility as will rest on him under the terms of the contract which both parties confidently anticipate they will shortly enter into. It would be an extraordinary result if, by acting on such a request in such circumstances, the [seller] were to assume an unlimited liability for his contractual performance, when he would never assume such liability under any contract which he entered into."</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“…. (1) English law generally adopts an objective theory of contract formation, ignoring the subjective expectations and the unexpressed mental reservations of the parties. Instead the governing criterion is the reasonable expectations of honest sensible businessmen. (2) Contracts may come into existence, not as a result of offer and acceptance, but during and as a result of performance. (3) The fact that the transaction is executed rather than executory can be very relevant. The fact that the transaction was performed on both sides will often make it unrealistic to argue that there was no intention to enter into legal relations and difficult to submit that the contract is void for vagueness or uncertainty. Specifically, the fact that the transaction is executed makes it easier to imply a term resolving any uncertainty, or, alternatively, it may make it possible to treat a matter not finalised in negotiations as inessential. This may be so in both fully executed and partly executed transactions. (4) If a contract only comes into existence during and as a result of performance it will frequently be possible to hold that the contract impliedly and retrospectively covers pre-contractual performance. ”</p>

It is commonplace in commercial life, particularly in markets where the use of standard forms of contract is common, for parties to agree on all the essential terms necessary to bring about the conclusion of an oral contract and for the oral contract then to be followed by a written document, often described as a confirmation or recap, which will not only set out the essential terms but other terms common in the market. If there is no comeback from the other party, it may be easy to infer assent. The situation would be very different if there was no prior oral contract. Where the oral contract is followed by a written confirmation setting out fuller terms to which the other party is judged by the fact finder to have assented, it is of no practical importance whether the situation is analysed as the parties as having entered into a partly oral and partly written contract or as having entered into a written contract. Probably the better analysis is that the written document fulfils a dual function; it both confirms evidentially the making of the oral agreement but also supersedes the oral agreement in that it provides a document to which the parties thereafter look as the expression of their bargain.”</p>

Indeed the quality and reputation of Chilean Courts in the minds of the parties can be inferred from the fact that it is the Chilean entity (CPT) which is seeking London Arbitration while it is the Faroese entity (TF) which is anxious to maintain Chilean jurisdiction.</p>

As regards the former point, quite apart from the fact that I do not accept that the applicable law would thereby alter as suggested, there is in any event no pleaded difference.

CPT was also faced with strong competition from Ultragas who had rendered assistance to one of ATHENA’s sister vessels earlier in the year.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the offer makes no reference to standard terms (in contrast to Ultragas’ offer) let alone a BIMCO form of agreement, Thor must have in any event contemplated (even absent express mention) that no assistance from any quarter would be forthcoming save on standard terms.  Ultragas were offering BIMCO Towhire (entitled “International Ocean Towage Agreement”).  Indeed, at the risk of repetition the evidence is overwhelming that the salvage industry will only undertake daily rate services on standard terms and Svitzer/CPT were no exception.  Such was the view of all the witnesses and in particular of Captain Reinigert a salvage consultant formerly with Smit Tak.  </p>

Thereafter Ultragas were engaged on BIMCO Towhire terms.  Later following the arrival of that vessel in Chile additional services from Ultragas were taken on BIMCO Wreckhire terms (albeit with an amended law and arbitration clause).  </p>

He completes the passage by saying: “<span style="font-style:italic">At no stage did CPT mention BIMCO terms.”</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that CPT/Svitzer in referring to a BIMCO contract thought that the relevant form was Wreckhire.   This is confirmed in Mr Hoogenstraaten’s e-mails to Mr Thalund on 6 and 7 July 2007.  What form Thor were expecting in the draft being prepared by CPT remains obscure.  Whilst it is correct that BIMCO Towhire was the basis of the contract earlier made with and later offered by Ultragas, it is striking that no comment was made by Thor to the status report at 1035 on 11 July which referred to “the agreed BIMCO Wreckhire contract” bearing in mind that the precise identity of the form is fundamental in that the then Towhire form had a completely different dispute resolution clause i.e. English law and jurisdiction and no arbitration.</p>
