	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the court is required to define the term ‘mother’ under the law of England and Wales. Down the centuries, no court has previously been required to determine the definition of ‘mother’ under English common law and, it seems, that there have been few comparable decisions made in other courts elsewhere in the Western World. Hitherto, a person who has given birth to a child has always been regarded as that child’s mother. The issue arises in modern times where an individual, who was born female, undergoes gender transition and becomes legally recognised as male before going on to conceive, carry and give birth to a child, with the result that the parent who has given birth is legally a man rather than a woman. The question posed to this court is: Is that man the ‘mother’ or the ‘father’ of his child? </p>

What, after all, to any child, to any parent, never mind to future generations and indeed to society at large, can be more important, emotionally, psychologically, socially and legally, than the answer to the question: Who is my parent?

In hearing the case, and now preparing this judgment, I have at all times been acutely aware of the importance of the case to the Claimant and to all those who are affected by issues relating to trans-gender in the wider community. The words of Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">R (C) v Secretary of State for Works and Pensions </span>[2017] UKSC 72 aptly encapsulate the impact on the lives of individuals who are affected by matters relating to transgender:</p>

	      <span style="font-size:13pt">“1. “We lead women’s lives: we have no choice”. Thus has the Chief Justice of Canada, the Rt Hon Beverley McLachlin, summed up the basic truth that women and men do indeed lead different lives. How much of this is down to unquestionable biological differences, how much to social conditioning, and how much to other people’s views of what it means to be a woman or a man, is all debateable and the accepted wisdom is perpetually changing. But what does not change is the importance, even the centrality, of gender in any individual’s sense of self. Over the centuries many people, but particularly women, have bitterly resented and fought against the roles which society has assigned to their gender. Genuine equality between the sexes is still a work in progress. But that does not mean that such women or men have not felt entirely confident that they are indeed a woman or a man. Gender dysphoria is something completely different - the overwhelming sense that one has been born into the wrong body, with the wrong anatomy and the wrong </span>

	      <span style="font-size:13pt">physiology. Those of us who, whatever our occasional frustrations with the expectations of society or our own biology, are nevertheless quite secure in the gender identities with which we were born, can scarcely begin to understand how it must be to grow up in the wrong body and then to go through the long and complex process of adapting that body to match the real self. But it does not take much imagination to understand that this is a deeply personal and private matter; that a person who has undergone gender reassignment will need the whole world to recognise and relate to her or to him in the reassigned gender; and will want to keep to an absolute minimum any unwanted disclosure of the history. This is not only because other people can be insensitive and even cruel; the evidence is that transphobic incidents are increasing and that transgender people experience high levels of anxiety about this. It is also because of their deep need to live successfully and peacefully in their reassigned gender, something which non-transgender people can take for granted.” </span>

He began medical transition with testosterone therapy in 2013, and in 2014, he underwent a double mastectomy. His passport and NHS records were amended to show his gender as male. TT states, and I readily accept, that his family came to accept the transition some years ago and that in the work environment his colleagues have never known him to be anything other than a male.</p>

The aim of the treatment was to achieve the fertilisation of one or more of TT’s eggs in his womb. Records from the clinic show that TT’s gender was registered as ‘M’ for male.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In January 2017 TT issued an application under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 [‘GRA 2004’] in order to obtain a ‘Gender Recognition Certificate’ confirming that he was male. Determination of an application for a Gender Recognition certificate [‘GR certificate’] is made by a panel constituted under the GRA 2004. The panel evaluates applications on paper and without a hearing. In addition to the application form and historical medical reports confirming diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the Claimant submitted a pro-forma declaration stating that he ‘intends to continue to live in the acquired gender until death’. The GRA panel granted TT’s application. A GR certificate confirming his gender as male was issued on 11 April 2017. The legal effect of a GR certificate is that the person to whom the certificate relates ‘becomes for all purposes the acquired gender (so that, if the acquired gender is the male gender, the person’s sex becomes that of a man …)’ [GRA 2004, s 9(1)]. </p>

It is of note, therefore, that HFEA legislation only permits the HFEA to license a clinic to provide services to assist ‘women to carry children’. The HFEA Code, and TT’s experience, demonstrate that clinics are currently providing treatment services to trans-men. Counsel for the government argued that, during the provision of treatment, trans-men are treated as ‘women’ in order to come within the provisions of the HFEA legislation. Counsel for TT and YY refuted that submission and argued that, under the Equality Act 2010, clinics must offer services to both women and men. These submissions were not developed as the legality of the treatment is not an issue in the present claim. It is, however, a point that the HFEA, the Government and those interested in these matters in Parliament may wish to consider further in the interests of legislative clarity. </p>

The issue in the case related to the manner in which JK’s relationship to each child was to be shown on their respective birth certificates. The first child had been born prior to gender transition and, following the birth, JK, who had not transitioned at that stage, had been registered as the father. Gender transition was in progress after the conception of the second child but before birth. A GR Certificate was issued after the second birth and prior to the hearing before Hickinbottom J.

She submitted that, as the registration Form 1 contained a category ‘father/parent’, the RG had a discretion whether to delete one of those two terms and the registrar’s decision in her case not to delete ‘father’ was arbitrary. In the alternative, JK argued that the RG had acted in a discriminatory manner in breach of Art 8 taken with Art 14 and the RG was required to justify that discrimination against her. </p>

Given the importance attached by the ECtHR to the recognition of a person’s chosen gender, the interference in Art 8 rights was a material one. The interference was, however, in accordance with the law and, although the format of Form 1 presented an apparent option between ‘father/parent’, these were, as a matter of law, two mutually exclusive terms. The term ‘parent’ is restricted in its use, under the HFEA 2008, to a second female who is to be treated as a parent to a child under the specific terms of that Act. </p>

The judge concluded, on the issue of proportionality and necessity, that a balance had to be struck between harm to the individual on the one hand, and the rights and interests of others (including the public interest) on the other. Within the balance, the public interest in having coherent administrative systems was an important consideration. Sexual identity and the choice of gender represented important elements of an individual’s identity. However, parentage was also a vital element in identity. The statutory registration scheme pursued the legitimate aim of respecting the right of the child to know, and have properly recognised, the identity of his or her biological father. Having regard to the relatively wide margin of appreciation that Hickinbottom J held would be applied by Strasbourg, he concluded that the UK government had been entitled to conclude that the interference with Art 8 rights inherent in the scheme was outweighed by the interference with the rights and interests of other individuals and the public interest that would be caused by not having such a restriction. </p>

Firstly, in <span style="font-style:italic">JK</span> the court had to have regard to the Art 8 interests of JK’s spouse, who was the mother of the two children; no similarly placed individual’s interests are relevant in the present case. Secondly, unlike JK, TT obtained legal recognition of his male identity through the grant of a GR certificate prior to YY’s birth. The challenge in <span style="font-style:italic">JK</span> was entirely based upon analysis under the ECHR, whereas TT’s primary challenge is based upon what are said to be the inevitable consequences of the issue of the GR Certificate and GRA 2004, ss 9 and 12 with the result, it is argued, that, as a matter of domestic law and irrespective of the ECHR, following the issue of a GR Certificate a parent is to be afforded the status of ‘mother’ or ‘father’ dependant upon their acquired gender, or at the very least is not to be afforded the contrary genderspecific status. It follows that, whilst the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">JK</span> may very well inform focussed analysis under the ECHR if that is necessary in the present case, the judgment will not be of direct relevance to the question of domestic statutory interpretation. </p>

The court was told that TT’s application for a GR certificate was supported by medical evidence relating to gender dysphoria (as required by GRA 2004, s 3) and a copy of the declaration (again as required by s 3) has been produced. The declaration, which is a tick-box template, has a tick by the following statement: </p>

During the hearing, through his counsel, TT told the court that the fact that he was at the time undergoing fertility treatment was not disclosed to the GR Panel. No relevant question was specifically asked as part of the application process before the panel and he had not volunteered the information. </p>

At a preliminary hearing, I enquired whether there was to be any challenge to the validity of the GR certificate in the light of the close chronological alignment of the GR certificate application with the Claimant’s IUI treatment. Having taken instructions, Ms Sarah Hannett, on that occasion acting both for the Secretaries of State and for the RG, confirmed that there was to be no such challenge and that the judicial review proceedings would proceed on the basis that the certificate was valid. This position was confirmed by Mr Ben Jaffey QC at the final hearing, although he reserved the right to refer to TT’s behaviour as part of any submissions on proportionality; in the event this, potentially striking, aspect of the factual background was not in fact referred to in submissions. I have therefore ignored it in my analysis of the issues. </p>

Further information indicated that the film was due to receive its world premiere at a film festival in New York in the coming weeks, and that that date would coincide with the publication in the UK of an article in a national newspaper describing TT as a transgender male who had given birth. </p>

The birth certificate could reflect this reality by either listing TT as ‘father’ or ‘parent’. Anything else gives the impression of something secretive or shameful.

Miss Markham’s case is that, provided a child’s birth occurs after the issue of a GR certificate, GRA 2004, s 12 relating to parenthood does not restrict or modify the effect of s 9 as, by the time of birth, the parent will have become the acquired gender and, by reason of s 9, their status as ‘mother’ or ‘father’ will be determined by reference to that acquired gender. TT’s case in this regard is therefore based upon the assumption that, for all purposes, the gender of a parent determines whether that parent is a ‘mother’ or a ‘father’, without exception, so that the terms ‘male parent’ and ‘father’ are entirely synonymous. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant’s secondary submission is that, if the case advanced by the RG and the Secretaries of State is correct, and TT must, under English law be registered as YY’s ‘mother’, that result is a clear breach of TT’s private and family life rights under ECHR, Art 8. In those circumstances TT would be regarded, under the law, as living in ‘an intermediate zone’, being regarded as male for all purposes save for parenthood when, as a ‘mother’, he would be regarded as female. That outcome would place TT, and those like him in similar circumstances, in an impossible dilemma of having to choose between either having a family or remaining childless but recognised fully in law and for all purposes in their acquired gender. </p>

In so far as it is argued that the European Court of Human Rights [‘ECtHR’] would afford the UK a ‘margin of appreciation’ on this issue, Miss Markham submits that any such margin would be construed narrowly in the light of the principle, which is said to be firmly established across Europe, that transgender people should be afforded full legal recognition in all areas of life. </p>

It is submitted that there is a profound incongruence with the child’s familial reality under the current system that has the potential to have a harmful impact on the children of transgender parents through the state’s inability to recognise the child’s parent appropriately. The Defendants’ expert, Peter Dunne, has previously stated, in an article published in <span style="font-style:italic">International Family Law</span> in 2015 that, under the current scheme, the children of transgender parents are ‘confronted with a system which is confused, unclear and incapable of catering for their specific family dynamics’ and furthermore, any solution proffered by the relevant decision makers must respect ‘the dignity, integrity and practical realities of transgender families’.

I have looked at that material. It is undoubtedly supportive in interpreting s 12 as being retrospective, but as that interpretation is clear from the wording of the section and is not in dispute, there is no need to refer directly to the underlying material for that purpose.

On the government’s case, the attribution of status is of mother determined by the person’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">biological role</span> in the process of conception, pregnancy and birth; on TT and YY’s case, the attribution of status is determined by reference to <span style="text-decoration:underline">a person’s gender</span> at the time of the child’s birth.

The Government’s case is that the ordinary meaning of the words in s 12 support the proposition that it applies to children born to a trans-parent both before and after the issue of a GR certificate.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst it is explicit in Mr Mylonas’ submissions that TT and YY’s circumstances fall outside the provisions of the HFEA 1990 and 2008, it is also implicitly accepted that GRA 2004, s 9 does not achieve the status of fatherhood for TT as Miss Markham submits is plainly the case. It is for this reason that YY’s case pursues a radically different route to that adopted on behalf of TT and why it is crucial to YY’s argument that the court moves first to make a declaration of parentage, with the High Court exercising a discretion which it is said that the court has, but which it is accepted the RG does not have, to hold that either TT is YY’s ‘father’ or ‘parent’, but not ‘mother’. When considering whether to make a declaration under s 55A, Mr Mylonas submits that it is the duty of the court to interpret the provisions of the HFEA 1990 in accordance with TT’s Convention rights and to read such legislation as though it refers to the treatment of ‘a person’, rather than ‘a woman’; it being submitted that any alternative reading of the 1990 Act would be direct discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment and would be prohibited by the Equality Act 2010. </p>

In the event that the court were to declare that TT was YY’s ‘parent’, but that he was neither his ‘father’ nor ‘mother’, then it is accepted that the current birth registration regime does not afford a mechanism to register TT as ‘parent’ and, in those circumstances, the court would be obliged to hold the RG’s decision to register TT as ‘mother’ to be unlawful and then to make declarations of incompatibility with respect to the relevant provisions of the HFEA 2008 and BDRA 1953 and the regulations. During the course of submissions, Miss Markham advanced the proposal that the Secretary of State could amend the registration regulations to permit the registration of a person in TT’s circumstances as ‘parent’; that submission was adopted on behalf of YY. If that outcome were accepted, it would obviate the need to register such a person as ‘mother’. </p>

If the primary case fails, Miss Markham submits that the BDRA 1953 makes it plain that the particulars to be prescribed on any form are within the discretion of the RG. BDRA 1953, s 1(1) requires a registrar to register a birth ‘by entering in a register … such particulars concerning the birth as may be prescribed…’. BDRA 1953, s 41 defines ‘prescribed’ as meaning prescribed by regulations made under BDRA 1953, s 39. The terms of BDRA 1953, s 39 provide that it is the RG who may, with the approval of the Minister, by statutory instrument make the relevant regulations prescribing anything which is required to be prescribed. Miss Markham points to occasions when the RG has, from time to time, made changes to the prescribed details that are to be set out in Form 1, in particular when the form was amended following HFEA 2008 to include reference to the second female legal parent. </p>

The circumstances of TT, and his role, as a male, in the conception and birth of his son YY, are not expressly provided for in either the legislation governing artificial insemination or that for gender recognition. Even though the HFEA 2008 was passed four years after the GRA 2004, the HFEA 2008 retains the basic definitions of ‘mother’ and ‘father’ that appeared in the HFEA 1990 and which are expressly tied to either ‘a woman’ or ‘a man’, respectively. The additional concept of a second ‘parent’ that was introduced by the 2008 Act is, as was accepted in submissions, restricted to a second female parent in the specific circumstances of HFEA 2008, ss 42 and 43 and has no application to the facts of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A further difficulty in understanding the operation of the domestic scheme arises from the fact that TT was artificially inseminated in a clinic licensed by the HFEA to provide treatment services under the HFEA’s 1990 and 2008 when the clinic knew that he was male and, indeed, recorded his gender as male in their records. Licences issued to clinics under the HFEA 1990 are limited to the provision of ‘treatment services’ as defined in s 2 of that Act and thereby limited to services ‘for the purpose of assisting <span style="font-style:italic">women</span> to carry children’ (emphasis added). Although the legality of the clinic’s actions, and the operation of the HFEA licensing regime in authorising clinics to provide treatment services to both women and men, are outside the precise focus of this case, it is both regrettable and surprising that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority declined the invitation of this court to engage in the proceedings in order to assist the court in understanding the operation of the statutory scheme in so far as it applies, if it does, to the provision of ‘treatment services’ to males who wish to conceive by artificial insemination in utero of their own eggs.  </p>

In that context, the lack of copious authority on the question does not, given the nature of the issue, indicate that there is any doubt as to the answer. In those times, at common law a person who became pregnant, through the insemination of an egg in their womb, and who subsequently gave birth to a child must have been that child’s mother. In this the law was doing no more than reflecting common sense, common experience and the basic facts of life; motherhood was established by the act of giving birth, or ‘parturition’ to use Lord Simon’s phrase, and a person who became pregnant and gave birth was a ‘mother’. </p>

If s 12 is purely retrospective, it would seem to be entirely otiose in the light of s 9(2) which is explicit in stating that the issue of a GR certificate ‘does not affect’ previous events. On an entirely retrospective reading of s 12, it adds nothing by saying that the acquisition of gender ‘does not affect the status of the person as the father or mother of a child’.

The consequence of this preliminary conclusion on the domestic law is that there is therefore likely to be a tension between the legal parentage and the social/psychological parentage in transgender cases such as the present.

Secondly, it would be unlawful under the EA 2010 for a licensed clinic to refuse to treat TT on grounds of gender reassignment. Thirdly, it would also be discriminatory for TT to be able to access treatment under the HFEA legislation, but for the treatment received to be unlawful.

It is suggested that a person biologically of the female sex, but who later transitioned but retained their ability to reproduce, might pass a genetic condition on to a child, but, if the full history of transition were not disclosed, where the child may be in ignorance of their true biological identity. </p>

The Court reiterates that although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see <span style="font-style:italic">X and Y v  the Netherlands</span>, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91). The boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests, and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation.” </p>

On the one hand, the child has a right to know its origins, that right being derived from the notion of private life (see paragraph 47 above). The child’s vital interest in its personal development is also widely recognised in the general scheme of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, <span style="font-style:italic">Johansen v Norway</span>, 7 August 1996, § 78, <span style="font-style:italic">Reports of Judgments and Decisions </span>1996-III; <span style="font-style:italic">Mikulić</span>, cited above, § 64; or <span style="font-style:italic">Kutzner v Germany</span>, no. </p>

The Court reiterates that the choice of the means calculated to secure compliance with Article 8 in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting States’ margin of appreciation. In this connection, there are different ways of ensuring respect for private life, and the nature of the State’s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is at issue (see <span style="font-style:italic">Odièvre</span>, cited above, § 46). The extent of the State’s margin of appreciation depends not only on the right or rights concerned but also, as regards each right, on the very nature of the interest concerned. The Court considers that the right to an identity, which includes the right to know one’s parentage, is an integral part of the notion of private life. In such cases, particularly rigorous scrutiny is called for when weighing up the competing interests. </p>

The finding in <span style="font-style:italic">Goodwin</span> requires to be read in the context that it applied narrowly to ‘fully achieved and post-operative transsexuals’, who would, by definition, not be capable of conceiving a child.

However, parentage is also a vital element in that identity. Mr Squires conceded that the identity of a person's mother fell into such a category – accepting that that justified (or may justify) a requirement that a person's biological mother be identified on a birth certificate – but he submitted that the position with regard to a person's father was different, with the registration scheme for the United Kingdom reflecting that fact by being less prescriptive in requiring the identification of a person's biological father in such a certificate. Of course, the position of a biological mother and a biological father are not identical – a mother carrying and delivering the child, and the father not – but I cannot agree with the proposition, insofar as Mr Squires suggested it, that the identity of a person's biological father is not an important element of his or her fundamental identity. It clearly is.” </p>

The Government concedes that if domestic law does, as they submit, require such registration then that outcome would interfere with the Art 8 rights of both parent and child. That concession is well made. The psychological and social reality for TT and YY is and will be that TT is YY’s male parent, his father. To require that TT be registered as ‘mother’ is plainly wholly contrary to TT’s view of himself, his gender and his role in his child’s life, and this, as he grows up, is also entirely likely to be the case for YY also.  </p>

For example, whilst the need for the child’s documentation to reflect the lived reality of TT being on a day to day basis in all ways his father points against registration as ‘mother’, the need for every child to know with certainty who gave birth to them and that they have a ‘mother’ draws the balancing scales in the opposite direction.  </p>

Following <span style="font-style:italic">Goodwin</span>, the United Kingdom Government was effectively obliged to construct a scheme whereby the rights of transsexual people were properly respected. Indeed, as I have explained (paragraph 70 above), the Claimant's challenge is to the scheme as a scheme. Simply because, in a particular case, the interests of the particular children would possibly be better served if their birth certificates were amended to show their father as "parent" rather than "father" does not make the scheme unlawful. As a scheme, it must cater for a wide variety of circumstances. It is clear that, in some cases, it will be regarded as in the relevant children's interests to have a birth certificate that reflects their biological parentage. Given the evidence that in most cases of gender change, unlike the case of the Claimant and KK, relationships between the relevant transsexual person and his or per spouse/partner are fatally disrupted, that is likely to apply to many (if not most) cases. A scheme that may assist the interests of some children, may be substantially damaging or harmful to the interests of others.” </p>

In doing so, it has afforded priority to the need for clarity as to parental status. There are, as I have recorded, sound child-focussed reasons in favour of striking the balance in that way.

The aim of the UK birth registration scheme, as the Government argue is the case, in requiring the identity of the person who gave birth to a child to be recorded as such is, therefore, entirely legitimate and of a high order of importance in the context of social policy.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal conclusion at the centre of this extensive judgment can be shortly stated. It is that there is a material difference between a person’s gender and their status as a parent. Being a ‘mother’, whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth. It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. Whilst that person’s gender is ‘male’, their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of ‘mother’. </p>
