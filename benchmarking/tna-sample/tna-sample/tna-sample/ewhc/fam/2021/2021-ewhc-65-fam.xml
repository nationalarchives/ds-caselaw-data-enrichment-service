	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is clearly established in English law that an adult (that is, someone who has reached the age of 18) is presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have capacity to decide whether or not to accept medical or surgical treatment. It is equally clear that a capacitous adult has an absolute right to accept or refuse treatment, for reasons good or bad or, indeed, for no reason at all, and even if the consequence of refusal is the certainty of very serious harm or even death. The decision of a capacitous adult is therefore determinative, in the strict sense in which I use the word. Subject only to being satisfied that the capacitous adult’s expressed decision is in fact his true decision and not vitiated by the undue pressure of either events or people (as to which see <span style="font-style:italic">In re T (Adult: Refusal of Treatment)</span> [1993] Fam 95) the only function of the court is to give effect to it, whether or not it might accord with his judicially-determined best interests. Indeed, the court is not concerned to evaluate, let alone to impose an outcome determined by, his best interests.  </p>

That conventional wisdom is founded on the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">In re R (A Minor) (Wardship: Consent to Treatment)</span> [1992] Fam 11 and in <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Minor) (Medical Treatment: Courts Jurisdiction)</span> [1993] Fam 64. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the present case that conventional wisdom has been challenged and put to the test. It is said that, whatever was or was not decided in those two cases, this is not the law. Times have changed, it is said. Views as to the proper balance between medical paternalism and patient autonomy have altered, with the balance, it is said, continuing to move against the former and in favour of the latter. The Human Rights Act 1998 has fundamentally changed the legal landscape as also, in this particular context, it is said, has the Mental Capacity Act 2005. And there have been other developments in the law; especial reliance is placed upon what is, on any footing, the very important decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <span style="font-style:italic">AC and Others v Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services) </span>2009 SCC 30, [2009] 2 SCR 181, [2009] 5 LRC 557. These are important arguments that require the most careful consideration, not just because of the consequences for X, the child with whom I am concerned, but because of their potential impact on the law generally. </p>

[She] is not refusing all medical treatment. She is exercising a choice about how she wishes to fight her disease, a choice that is grounded in her human dignity, self-determination, bodily autonomy, and religious conscience. The Applicant seeks to deny [X] her autonomy, requesting a twoyear “rolling order” which authorises doctors to repeatedly impose a medical procedure on [X] which she finds deeply repugnant. The Applicant further asks that the “rolling order” remain effective right up to the point [X] reaches the arbitrary chronological age of 18.   </p>

The medical reality is that X, unhappily, will, in the view of her treating clinicians, require blood transfusions again during the next few years. Unless, perish the thought, she were to die in the meantime, X would be celebrating her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday in January 2021. In these circumstances, she and her treating clinicians are entitled to know where they stand when the first crisis after her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday occurs. And, if the experience of the last two hearings is anything to go by, there will not be adequate time to consider this difficult legal question before urgent medical necessity intervenes. I have had full argument on the point. Moreover, although they are conceptually different, the issues in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent child and the 16-year-old child are, as we will see, closely intertwined in the authorities. </p>

Although a parent’s views and wishes as to the child’s religious upbringing are of great importance, and will always be seriously regarded by the court, just as the court will always pay great attention to the wishes of a child old enough to be able to express sensible views on the subject of religion, even if not old enough to take a mature decision, they will be given effect to by the court only if and so far as and in such manner as is in accordance with the child’s best interests. In matters of religion, as in all other aspects of a child’s upbringing, the interests of the child are the paramount consideration. 44  There are many examples of the working out of these principles in the family courts. Sometimes, as in the cases involving blood transfusions for the children of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the issue is literally one of life or death (using those words in the secular sense).

Put shortly, our objective must be to maximise the child’s opportunities in every sphere of life as they enter adulthood. And the corollary of this, where the decision has been devolved to a ‘judicial parent’', is that the judge must be cautious about approving a regime which may have the effect of foreclosing or unduly limiting the child’s ability to make such decisions in future. </p>

This, I emphasise, is not such a case. The point is very simple and profoundly important. This court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction in relation to children undoubtedly has power to authorise the use of restraint and physical force to compel a child to submit to a surgical procedure: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Detention: Medical Treatment) </span>[1997] 2 FLR 180 and <span style="font-style:italic">Re PS (Incapacitated or Vulnerable Adult) </span>[2007] EWHC 623 (Fam), [2007] 2 FLR 1083. I say nothing about how this power should appropriately be exercised in the case of other forms of medical or surgical intervention. In the case of the proposed termination of a pregnancy, however, the point surely is this. Only the most compelling arguments could possibly justify compelling a mother who wished to carry her child to term to submit to an unwanted termination. It would be unwise to be too prescriptive, for every case must be judged on its own unique facts, but I find it hard to conceive of any case where such a drastic form of order – such an immensely invasive procedure – could be appropriate in the case of a mother who does not want a termination, unless there was powerful evidence that allowing the pregnancy to continue would put the mother’s life or long-term health at very grave risk. Conversely, it would be a very strong thing indeed, if the mother wants a termination, to require her to continue with an unwanted pregnancy even though the conditions in s 1 of the 1967 Act are satisfied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">“The wording of subsection (1) shows quite clearly that it is addressed to the legal purpose and legal effect of consent to treatment, namely, to prevent such treatment constituting in law a trespass to the person, and that it does so by making the consent of a 16- or 17-year-old as effective as if he were “of full age.” No question of “<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competence” in common law terms arises. The 16- or 17-year-old is conclusively presumed to be “<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent” or, alternatively, the test of “<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competence” is bypassed and has no relevance. The argument that W, or any other 16- or 17-year-old, can by refusing to consent to treatment veto the treatment notwithstanding that the doctor has the consent of someone who has parental responsibilities, involves the proposition that section 8 has the further effect of depriving such a person of the power to consent. It certainly does not say so. Indeed if this were its intended effect, it is difficult to see why the subsection goes on to say that it is not <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> to obtain the parents’ consent, rather than providing that such consent, if obtained, should be ineffective. Furthermore such a construction does not sit easily with subsection (3) which preserves the common law as it existed immediately before the Act which undoubtedly gave parents an effective power of consent for all children up to the age of 21, the then existing age of consent …   </p>

First, her consent would be fully effective as such. Second, a failure or refusal to give consent would be fully effective as a veto, but only because no one else would be in a position to consent. If it is a possible view that section 8 is intended to put a 16- or 17-yearold in exactly the same position as an adult and there is thus some ambiguity, although I do not think that there is, it is a permissible aid to construction to seek to ascertain the mischief at which the section is directed.” </p>

The purpose of the section is clear: it is to enable a 16-year-old to consent to medical treatment which, in the absence of consent by the child or its parents, would constitute a trespass to the person. In other words, for this purpose, and for this purpose only, a minor was to be treated as if it were an adult.

They were not concerned with the jurisdiction of the court.

In giving effect to that consideration, the court is to have particular regard to the factors set out in section 1(3). This subsection … requires the court to have regard in particular to: (a) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding); (b) his physical, emotional and educational needs; (c) the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances; (d) his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant; (e) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering; (f) how capable each of his parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs; and (g) the range of powers available to the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">“Since Parliament has not conferred complete autonomy on a 16-year-old in the field of medical treatment, there is no overriding limitation to preclude the exercise by the court of its inherent jurisdiction and the matter becomes one for the exercise by the court of its discretion. Nevertheless the discretion is not to be exercised in a moral vacuum. Undoubtedly the philosophy behind section 8 of the Act of 1969, as well as behind the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick’s</span> case is that, as children approach the age of majority, they are increasingly able to take their own decisions concerning their medical treatment. In logic there can be no difference between an ability to consent to treatment and an ability to refuse treatment … Accordingly the older the child concerned the greater the weight the court should give to its wishes, certainly in the field of medical treatment. In a sense this is merely one aspect of the application of the test that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. It will normally be in the best interests of a child of sufficient age and understanding to make an informed decision that the court should respect its integrity as a human being and not lightly override its decision on such a personal matter as medical treatment, all the more so if that treatment is invasive. In my judgment, therefore, the court exercising the inherent jurisdiction in relation to a 16- or 17year-old child who is not mentally incompetent will, as a matter of course, ascertain the wishes of the child and will approach its decision with a strong predilection to give effect to the child’s wishes. (The case of a mentally incompetent child will present different considerations, although even there the child’s wishes, if known, must be a very material factor.) Nevertheless, if the court’s powers are to be meaningful, there must come a point at which the court, while not disregarding the child’s wishes, can override them in the child’s own best interests, objectively considered. Clearly such a point will have come if the child is seeking to refuse treatment in circumstances which will in all probability lead to the death of the child or to severe permanent injury. An example of such a case was [<span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Minor) (Wardship: Medical Treatment)</span> [1993] 1 FLR 386], which came before Ward J on 21 September 1990.

So far in this judgment I have been principally concerned to explain why, as it seems to me, the court has not only the power but the inescapable responsibility of deciding, in that specific context, what is to be done in the interests of her welfare. I am very far from asserting any general rule that the court should prefer its own view as to what is in the best interests of the child to those of the child itself. In considering the welfare of the child, the court must not only recognise but if necessary defend the right of the child, having sufficient understanding to take an informed decision, to make his or her own choice. In most areas of life it would be not only wrong in principle but also futile and counter-productive for the court to adopt any different approach. In the area of medical treatment, however, the court can and sometimes must intervene. </p>

The determination must always be that of the court. If one is then to try and specify the grounds upon which it would be right for the court to intervene I do not for my part find it particularly helpful to speak in terms of special or extraordinary cases as distinct from normal cases …  One must, I think, start from the general premise that the protection of the child’s welfare implies at least the protection of the child's life. I state this only as a general and not as an invariable premise because of the possibility of cases in which the court would not authorise treatment of a distressing nature which offered only a small hope of preserving life. In general terms, however, the present state of the law is that an individual who has reached the age of 18 is free to do with his life what he wishes, but it is the duty of the court to ensure so far as it can that children survive to attain that age. </p>

It makes no difference whether the risk arises from the action or inaction of others, or from the action or inaction of the child. Due weight must be given to the child’s wishes, but the court is not bound by them.” </p>

At the same time, in relation to medical treatment within the ambit of section 8 (I put the point this way because section 8 does not apply to all medical or surgical procedures: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Minor) (Medical Treatment: Courts Jurisdiction)</span> [1993] Fam 64), section 8 identifies the age of 16 as being crucial. How are the two to be reconciled? Lord Donaldson, in my judgment, provided the answer. I refer first, to his observation in <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Minor) (Medical Treatment: Courts Jurisdiction)</span> [1993] Fam 64 (page 77), that in relation to the medical treatment of 16- or 17-year- olds within the ambit of section 8: </p>

Thus, subject only to statute, a child, as such, lacks capacity at common law by reason of being a child and thus not having reached its majority – what was once referred to as incapacity by reason of non-age. Once upon a time the same applied in many ways to a married woman (feme covert) who, by reason of her coverture, was treated as lacking the capacity she had had as a spinster and only recovered as a widow or on divorce (feme sole).  </p>

Indeed, as we have seen, in <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Minor) (Medical Treatment: Courts Jurisdiction)</span> [1993] Fam 64, where the hearing spread over 3 days, the court deliberately reconsidered what it had previously said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re R (A Minor) (Wardship: Consent to Treatment)</span> [1992] Fam 11 because of the criticism to which it had been subjected. How sensibly can this be treated as mere obiter? I do not criticise counsel for taking the point, but I have to say that it is the kind of point which probably has more traction amongst the dreaming spires of the Academy than in the robust and ultimately pragmatic world of the court room. We have to remember that the common law developed over the centuries as a process by which practical lawyers sought pragmatic, if principled, solutions to the practical problems thrown up by the unpredictable process of litigation, and that at the root of the process was the system of oral adversarial argument. In <span style="font-style:italic">Cordell v Second Clanfield Properties Ltd</span> [1969] 2 Ch 9, 16, Megarry J, citing the venerable words of Hankford J in 1409, referred to the “purifying ordeal of skilled argument on the specific facts of a contested case” and observed that: </p>

There are exceptions to this. For example, the Court of Protection’s powers under section 16 in relation to P’s property and affairs are exercisable (see sections 2(6) and 18(3)) “even though P has not reached 16, if the court considers it likely that P will still lack capacity to make decisions in respect of that matter when he reaches 18.” In contrast (section 18(2)), the Court of Protection cannot make a statutory will until P has reached 18. And, more directly germane to the issues I have to consider, only a person who has reached the age of 18 can make an advance decision (section 24(1)) or a lasting power of attorney (section 9(2)(c)). </p>

This is known as the common law ‘mature minor’ doctrine … The doctrine addresses the concern that young people should not automatically be deprived of the right to make decisions affecting their medical treatment. It provides instead that the right to make those decisions varies in accordance with the young person’s level of maturity, with the degree to which maturity is scrutinised intensifying in accordance with the severity of the potential consequences of the treatment or of its refusal. </p>

However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others. Many established jurisdictions have examined the cases of Jehovah’s Witnesses who had refused a blood transfusion and found that, although the public interest in preserving the life or health of a patient was undoubtedly legitimate and very strong, it had to yield to the patient’s stronger interest in directing the course of his or her own life. It was emphasised that free choice and self-determination were themselves fundamental constituents of life and that, absent any indication of the need to protect third parties – for example, mandatory vaccination during an epidemic, the state must abstain from interfering with the individual freedom of choice in the sphere of health care, for such interference can only lessen and not enhance the value of life.” </p>

Accordingly, there was an objective and reasonable justification for any such difference in the treatment: “even assuming that there would be a difference in treatment between minors requiring containment and education and adults with the same requirements, any such difference in treatment would not be discriminatory stemming as it does from the protective regime which is applied through the courts to minors in the applicant’s position.

Thus it is now a commonplace that, in addressing the question of what is in a child’s best interests and required for the child’s welfare, the judge has to adopt the standards of 2021 and not those of 1989 (when the principle was enshrined in the Children Act 1989, let alone those of 1925 (when the principle first received statutory recognition in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925): see <span style="font-style:italic">Owens v Owens </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 182, [2017] 4 WLR 74, para 40: </p>

She also asserts that X will not resist the administration of a blood transfusion if authorised by the court and restraint will not be required. This is precisely the sort of case, she says, in which an anticipatory order should be made. It would be contrary to X’s best interests to defer an application until a further crisis develops, leading to the need to make a further urgent application to the court with the attendant risk that the court will have to reach a decision under pressure of time and without the advantage of proper representation. Such an order has the benefit of certainty and predictability and will avoid the need for further repeated applications to the court, potentially on an urgent basis if X’s condition deteriorates suddenly.      </p>

So far as concerns section 12(3A)(c), Mr Brady points to the additional cost and, more particularly, the additional delay to which X will be exposed in knowing what her rights are, if the matter has to go first to the Court of Appeal before reaching the Supreme Court. That is a powerful point, but it is, in my judgment, heavily outweighed by the considerable advantage the Supreme Court (assuming for this purpose that the case ever gets there) will derive from having the benefit of the Court of Appeal’s considered views. </p>

There is nothing in what I have said to suggest that the Court of Appeal would have “greater freedom … to overrule or clarify.” As to the second point, Mr Brady has been unable to identify anything in the Strasbourg jurisprudence which supports his proposition; quite the contrary.      </p>
