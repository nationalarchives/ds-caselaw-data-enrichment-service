	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This is an application by Somerset County Council (‘SCC’) for declaratory relief pursuant to Part 18 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  It relates to the lawfulness of placement orders made between 2017 and 2021 in respect of a group of ten children. Each had entered the care system as a result of the inability of their birth parents to provide adequate care for them within their respective families.  Each child affected by this litigation has been the subject of a care order.  Each has now been placed on the path to permanence and a secure future in the context of an adoptive placement as a result of placement orders approved by the court.  These orders having been made, extensive work has gone into the process of matching these children with prospective adopters.  In some cases, the ‘matching process’ has reached the stage of introductions and meetings between the children and their prospective adoptive parents.  In at least one case, the sibling group concerned has been told that their prospective adopters will be their new ‘forever’ parents.  This entire process has had to be halted temporarily as a result of the issue of these proceedings.  There is thus a risk that delay and/or the existence of this litigation may result in the loss to these children of the opportunity for a secure and settled home life, something which they have been denied thus far outwith the context of the interim care which has been provided by their temporary foster carers.  As SCC accepts, in several cases, and because of their ages or particular circumstances, the adoptive placement which has been identified for each of these children is their last chance to secure permanence.  The options for these children are limited outside the prospect of long-term foster care.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The issue in relation to the lawfulness of these placement orders flows from the discovery in April this year (2021) that SCC, in its role as an adoption agency, has failed to comply with aspects of its statutory duties under the Adoption Agency Regulations 2005 (AAR).  I shall come on to the circumstances in which this litigation arose and the steps which have been taken thus far in terms of case management to ensure a swift passage through the court for this initial ‘primary cohort’ of children.  However, it is important to state at the outset that the implications of SCC’s failings in this case go far beyond this primary cohort of children.  The court has been made aware that its long-standing failure over a considerable period to comply with specific aspects of the statutory framework laid down by the AAR which underpin its primary obligations under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 has raised issues in relation to a significant number of other placement and adoption orders.    Whilst none of the primary cohort of children is the subject of an adoption order, there are a great many children captured within the ‘wider cohort’ who have been living in established and loving homes where, as adopted children, they have had all the benefits which their adoptive status as a permanent member of their new family has brought.  Were their legal status as adopted children to be challenged as a result of any potentially defective placement orders which provided the legal platform for those adoptions, the implications for those children, their birth families and their adoptive families would be far-reaching.  I have been told that the wider cohort of children could number as many as three hundred.  As Mr Goodwin QC, counsel for SCC has acknowledged, many of the birth parents will be leading disordered, chaotic lives and ill-equipped to manage the emotional fall-out if hopes are falsely raised of a reunion with their child or children.  It is possible that some will have partners who may know nothing about previous placement or adoption proceedings.  Other older or younger children in the family may be adversely affected by knowledge of a previously unknown sibling.  The potential for fragile family dynamics to be disrupted, and vulnerabilities for a wide spectrum of children increased, are all too obvious to need articulation in this judgment.  Into this extremely concerning matrix has to be factored the acute vulnerabilities of the children’s adoptive parents and families. Some of those parents have cared for their adopted child or children over a number of years and often within the context of those children having been fully integrated into a loving family which now includes other children born to their parents before or after the making of the adoption orders.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Since this issue first came to light in April 2021, some five months ago, a very significant amount of work and resources have been devoted within SCC with a view to establishing the situation of each individual child within the primary and wider cohorts, including the histories of their journeys through the courts and their current circumstances.  As part of this process, twelve individual children were identified whose futures were ‘hanging in the balance’, as I have described above.  In the case of two children in one sibling group, their prospective adoptive placement has now been lost<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> The loss of that particular placement was unrelated to the delay caused by this litigation.</p>
	      </authorialNote> and thus the primary cohort of children has reduced to ten.</p>

SCC has not yet made any Part 18 applications for declarations in relation to the wider cohort of children since they wish to consider the extent to which this judgment in relation to the primary cohort assists in further consideration of the wider cohort cases.  Whilst my judgment is confined to these ten cases, the outcome for this smaller cohort of children may well have consequences in terms of the legality of earlier placement orders.  In respect of those wider cohort children who are now the subject of adoption orders, different considerations apply as a matter of law.  Further consideration will be given to how to proceed for these children at an early case management hearing which I intend to convene within a very short period after hand down of this judgment.  For present purposes, I make it clear that the focus of the court’s enquiry in the context of the existing Part 18 applications is the ten placement orders made in relation to each of the children who remain within the primary cohort.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">First, the legality or otherwise of these placement orders must be determined as a matter of law and established legal principles.  These are not applications in which I am exercising a welfare jurisdiction.  I am not charged with a consideration of which option is the most appropriate decision for any, or all, of these children. I must decide whether their placement orders were legally made in the light of the procedural deficiencies which have now come to light and which are admitted by SCC.  All parties potentially affected by the Part 18 declarations in this case urge me to navigate a safe route to legality for these children, including the Guardians who represent each of the ten children with whom I am concerned.  There is disagreement between SCC, the local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and the Guardians as to which route I should take. In terms of legal efficacy in the context of the desired destination and the soundness of the route proposed, CAFCASS Legal which appears through Ms Giz and Mr Niven-Phillips as advocate to the court, has identified issues with each road map which has been put before the court.  I shall need to analyse the legal submissions which I have heard and in due course I shall set out the law which must inform my findings and conclusions.  If these placement orders are found to have no legal basis or validity because of the procedural errors made by the adoption agency, it must start the entire process afresh by submitting fresh applications for placement orders.  I was told by Ms Perry QC, who appears for the Guardians, that such a course might take more than six months to complete given the fresh reports and investigations which would need to be completed. Further time would be needed for the court enquiry which would follow any fresh decision made by the agency decision maker in the light of the children’s welfare from the foot of those new facts.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Second, and the next point to make is that, just as the court is not carrying out a holistic welfare evaluation of these individual children’s circumstances, it is not acting as a rubber stamp to legitimise orders which otherwise lack essential legal validity or integrity merely because it would be expedient and potentially in the children’s interests to do so.  Whilst at first blush it might appear counter-intuitive to a judge exercising a Family jurisdiction to ignore core aspects of a child’s welfare, that is not an issue which falls for consideration in the context of the current applications for declaratory relief in these Part 18 proceedings.  As needs no restatement for the purposes of this judgment, judges sitting in each Division of the High Court exercise an equivalent jurisdiction and apply the same legal principles applicable to the subject matter before the court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Third, and finally by way of preliminary observation, each of the primary cohort’s birth parents (bar one) have been notified about these proceedings.  Despite my direction that SCC should meet the costs of any legal representation involved in a request by each or any of the birth parents of the primary cohort children who wished to apply for party status or to intervene in these proceedings, none has sought to make any representations at all.  In respect of two fathers whose whereabouts could not be traced after an extensive search, I made disclosure orders against the Department of Work and Pensions.  One could not be traced; the other was made aware of the proceedings but was not available for service.  The birth mothers in both cases were notified but wished to take no part.  In a number of the ten cases with which I am concerned, the birth parents did not oppose the making of placement orders for their child or children knowing, as they would have done, that adoption was considered by SCC’s agency decision maker to be the best outcome for their child.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Thus, in circumstances where there has been no legal argument advanced on behalf of the birth families of these children, it has been of overriding importance for the court to have had the assistance of CAFCASS Legal as advocate to the court.  An invitation was extended and accepted pursuant to CPR 1998 PD 3G.  In its current role, CAFCASS Legal does not seek to comment on individual welfare issues pertaining to any of the primary cohort children.  Its legal costs are properly being met by SCC.  I would wish at the outset to express my thanks to CAFCASS Legal for its assistance.  The burden which has fallen on each of the legal representatives in this case has been a heavy one.  The demands of preparing their respective cases against the time constraints imposed by the court have been considerable.  I would want each of them to know at the outset that I have been assisted by their efforts.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">At this stage of these proceedings, I am not determining what went wrong with a view to  some overarching enquiry into responsibility for these breaches.  As I shall explain, SCC has already accepted primary liability for the key operative failings of its officers and employees.  Whilst it is important to highlight these failures in this judgment so that urgent steps can be taken to ensure that further breaches do not occur which have the potential to jeopardise existing or future proceedings and the lives of the children who are the subject of those ongoing proceedings, I am concerned only with the ten cases before me.  After detailed submissions from counsel as to the way forward at a case management hearing on 13 and 16 July this year and a pre-trial review on 10 September 2021, it was decided that, at this stage, I would hear no oral evidence from individual actors in the piece.  I have extensive written evidence in the form of statements and exhibits filed on behalf of the individual professionals and decision-makers at the centre of this litigation.  On behalf of SCC, Mr Goodwin QC has prepared a document entitled <span style="font-style:italic">“Concessions Document for Primary Cohort”</span>. Whilst I heard submissions on some aspects of that document, the admissions within it will form the evidential basis for many, if not most, of the court’s findings in relation to the legality of the placement orders which are the subject of the declaratory relief which is sought.   I shall come to the detail of its contents shortly.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Having completed my pre-reading before the case started as I indicated I would, I have heard detailed oral submissions from all counsel over the course of the last week.  In addition to a substantial volume of case law and statutory material, I have also had lengthy written submissions from each of the parties and CAFCASS Legal.  Representatives from the press and media have been in attendance at various hearings since this litigation commenced.  I understand entirely why the concerns raised in this case should have attracted the interest of the press.  Transparency is essential in a case such as this where there appears to have been such long-standing failure on the part of an organ of the state in an area where Parliament has approved a strict framework of regulation. Whilst I have made reporting restriction orders which prevent the naming of the local authority concerned <span style="font-style:italic">at this stage of the proceedings</span>, I have made it plain that I intend to review that position once my judgment has been handed down.  SCC accepts that it should be named as the responsible adoption agency but seeks to preserve its anonymity only for long enough to consider the next steps in terms of both the primary and the wider cohort of children affected by its failings.  Those next steps will require a careful consideration of the consequences of this judgment for those children.  It is only because I have determined that, at this point in time, the interests and article 8 rights of those children and the families who care for them, or have given birth to them, outweigh the article 10 rights of the press that I have sanctioned anonymity for the time being.  That anonymity is unlikely to survive the hand down of this judgment.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">These irregularities appear to have been discovered as a result of the diligence of a barrister who was instructed in the context of different proceedings involving care and placement orders sought by SCC.  At the end of December last year (2020), a circuit judge made a placement order in the context of a different set of care proceedings commenced by SCC during the course of which a decision had been made to place a child for adoption.  The mother, acting in person, applied for permission to appeal that order.  The single ground of her appeal against the placement order was that the judge had not demonstrated in his judgment that adoption was the only option for one of two siblings.  Both the local authority (SCC) and the Guardian contested that ground.  However, it was subsequently agreed that the placement order should be set aside.  The reason which underpinned this consensus was recorded in a short judgment delivered by Peter Jackson LJ sitting with Males and Simler LJJ in the Court of Appeal on 21 May 2021: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Children) </span>[2021] EWCA Civ 785.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“It has transpired that there was a breach of the Adoption Agency Regulations 2005.  At the time she made her decision in this case, the Agency Decision Maker (“ADM”) did not have a health report from the medical adviser as required by Regulation 15, or advice that no such report was required.  Furthermore, the Child Permanence Report did not include a medical summary prepared by the medical adviser as required by Regulation 17.  The local authority therefore intends to present M’s case again to the ADM and thereafter to issue a new application for a placement order if the plan for adoption is approved.  We were told by [counsel for SCC] that it is content to withdraw its previous application for a placement order on the basis that any fresh application was likely to be made in about six weeks’ time.  Bearing in mind the unfortunate history and the pressing need for a decision to be made about M’s future, any longer period would be concerning.  For her part, the mother is concerned that she was not told about this issue sooner.”</p>

It was made clear at that hearing that nine out of the twelve children who were the subject of the Part 18 applications did not have any health issues at all at the time of the ADM’s decision to approve their adoptive care plans.  I made provision for the filing of evidence and notification of the birth parents affected by the primary cohort applications. In relation to the wider cohort of children I also required SCC to file further evidence in schedule form outlining its compliance with AAR 2005.

That process was undertaken in circumstances where the birth parent(s) agreed, or where such placement had been authorised as part of a care plan in a care order, or under the authority of a court order freeing a child for adoption.  Sections 18 to 41 of the 2002 Act now provide a statutory code or framework which regulates the circumstances in which a child can be placed for adoption.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“[72]<marker name="tab"/>The 2002 Act reformed the law of adoption.  It is not, I think, controversial to say that the 2002 Act had four main objectives.  The first was to simplify the process.  The second was to enable a crucial element of the decision making process to be undertaken at an earlier stage.  The third was to shift the emphasis to a concentration on the welfare of the child; and the fourth was to avoid delay.  Thus, in the same way that good practice in planning for the future of children within the care system discourages parents and relatives from putting themselves forward at the last moment to care for a child, the 2002 Act seeks to facilitate the adoption process once the critical stages of care and placement orders – court proceedings in which parents are entitled fully to participate and in which the relevant decisions are taken by a judge – have been passed.”</p>

The procedure is governed by Part 14 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. Rule 14.11 makes provision for reports to be provided in a form prescribed by PD14C which builds in the provisions of the AAR.  Very often the application for a placement order will be made in the context of ongoing care proceedings.  Section 24 provides for the revocation of placement orders.  Section 24(2) prohibits a birth parent from applying to revoke an order unless he or she has the court’s prior permission to make the application or the child has not yet been placed for adoption.  Before permission can be given, a court has to be satisfied that there has been a change in circumstances since the placement order was made: section 24(3).  Since none of the birth parents of the primary cohort children has sought to make representations at this hearing, and none has sought to revoke the original placement orders, I need not say any more about this aspect of the statutory code.</p>

For these purposes, the Regulations apply whether an adoption agency is a local authority or a registered adoption society (i.e. a voluntary organisation which is registered as an adoption agency under Part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000: see section 2(1) of the ACA 2002).</p>

For the purposes of this case, the key provisions are regulations 8 (appointment of an agency adviser and a medical adviser), 15 (requirement to obtain information about the child) and 17 (requirement to prepare a child’s permanence report).  The AAR provide a substantial regulatory framework as to how an adoption agency is to conduct its business in terms of its statutory functions under the ACA 2002.  It runs to 47 separate regulatory provisions divided into eight separate parts including five lengthy schedules.

Not only does the Act require the court to finalise the adoption process through the making of an adoption order (if that is the right decision for the child), but AAR 19 also requires the local authority’s decision maker to decide whether the child should be placed for adoption after the procedures set out in AAR 12 – 18 have been complied with.  A decision at the child’s statutory review that adoption should be the plan for the child is therefore only the first of many steps in the adoption process, which will lead – subject to the scrutiny of the plan in accordance with the AAR – to a formal ratification of the plan for adoption under AAR 19.</p>

Ms Winter also accepts that she was unaware of the requirement in regulation 17 for the medical adviser to prepare a separate health summary for inclusion in the CPR.  She had assumed, wrongly, that the initial health assessments (IHAs) on each child’s file prepared on their reception into care were sufficient for these purposes.  Where the individual child had no discernible health conditions and appeared to be perfectly healthy, she did not seek the advice of Dr Smith in relation to the need for further reports.  She confirms in her written evidence that she believed, wrongly, that if Dr Smith had any concerns that the information contained in the previous health assessments was inadequate, the doctor would have alerted her prior to the ADM decision.  It is accepted by SCC as the adoption agency that, after 2018, there were no formal requests made to Dr Smith to prepare medical summaries despite the fact that the job description for the medical adviser from 2019 onwards included the provision of medical summary reports.</p>

Delay in commissioning any necessary examination and further report could make it impossible to comply with the timescales for the completion of the CPR.  If the agency does not have parental responsibility for the child, and the child is too young to consent on their own behalf to a health assessment, the consent of a parent or guardian will be needed.  The cooperation of parents will also be needed to obtain the fullest possible information about the health history of the child (including prenatal and neo-natal health) and family.

For the purposes of the declaratory relief in relation to the lawfulness of the placement orders which is the subject of these Part 18 proceedings, Mr Goodwin QC submits on behalf of SCC that the two paragraphs which I have set out above from the 2013 statutory guidance place the emphasis on the <span style="font-style:italic">sufficiency </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> substance </span>of the information in the reports available to an agency decision maker rather than the form of those reports. It is not suggested that medical evidence is irrelevant to the exercise of its functions since this constitutes an integral part of the child’s background.  SCC does assert that the absence of aspects of the medical evidence would not in itself prevent the ADM from deciding that a child should have the opportunity to be placed for adoption given that any potential adopters would be provided with a full and complete picture of the child’s health in the form of the pre-adoption medical report which would be available prior to matching.</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> Adoption and Fostering role</p>
	      </authorialNote> role”.  Ms Winter confirms that Dr Smith’s new role would be reflected in her annual job plan from that time onwards in accordance with standard NHS practice.  It was not usual or necessary for a formal letter of appointment to be issued.  The job plan produced in 2014 is not available to the court because of what is referred to as “a change in HR IT systems since the appointment was made”.  The chronology suggests that Dr Smith’s appointment to the role of AMA was confirmed by 4 March 2014 even though she did not take up the post until some five months later.  In the run of contemporaneous emails which I have seen, there is specific confirmation that she was to take over from Dr Kelly with effect from August 2014 (<span style="font-style:italic">“Yes Carol is taking this part over from Sarah – plan away !”</span>).  Within the material provided to the court is a letter dated 30 June 2014 requesting from Dr Smith the information required for completion of the ‘Disclosure and Barring Service form’.</p>

It seems to me that this course of conduct on the part of Ms Winter in the context of her wider role as Director of Children’s Services is reliable evidence of a formal appointment of Dr Smith to her new role.  One has to ask why any of these steps would have been taken if she had not been appointed to the role?</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The obvious advantages for a child of adoption as opposed to long-term fostering have long been recognised by both child care professionals and the courts.  It provides a child with the security and permanence of a family of his own with parents who are in parental control.  The commitment of an adoptive placement is very different from that of a local authority foster carer (however good his or her proven track record).  The ‘permanence’ of a child who is subject to a local authority care order is at risk in the event of an application by parents for the discharge of that order.  In contrast, once an adoption order is made, it is made for all time.  Once an adoption has been sanctioned by the court, routine life is fundamentally different for a child.  He or she is a child in a new family just like any other child.  The rhythm of his or her daily life no longer includes statutory medical and other reviews and social workers are likely to disappear from view.  Perhaps of greatest importance is the fact that the child achieves an enduring sense of ‘belonging’ which is unlikely to be achieved in the context of long term fostering.  Thus permanency, predictability and the enduring quality of an adoptive placement are all important features to be weighed in the balance:  see <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Adoption: Parental Agreement) </span>(1982) 3 FLR 386 per Ormrod LJ at 388, <span style="font-style:italic">Re V (Children) </span>[2014] 1 FLR 1009 per Black LJ at para 96, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re LRP (Care Proceedings: Placement Order) </span>[2014] 2 FLR 399 per Pauffley J at para 39.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">However, because adoption represents such a fundamental step in any child’s life, proper scrutiny of the process of decision making is an essential and elementary safeguard not only for the child concerned and his or her birth parents but also for society at large.  It is also vitally important that prospective adopters have full confidence in the system and know that they can rely on the information which they are given about a child to be accurate and complete.  The decision to adopt and the commitment which adoptive parents make to a child or children whom they propose to make their own is very significant.  Adoption creates a legal and lifelong bond between a child and his adoptive parents:  it is a decision which needs to be fully informed for reasons which are too obvious to state.  Since the making of a placement order operates as a legal platform for the move to matching and placing a child with an adoptive family, the lens of scrutiny must fall equally on that stage of the process.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The appellate courts have not shied away from setting aside placement orders where serious errors have been identified in this field of decision making for children.  <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Placement Order) </span>[2008] EWCA Civ 835, [2008] 2 FLR 1404 (cited above) was one such case.  It concerned the failure of the adoption agency to ensure that important information in the form of three expert reports was factored into the decision making process of an adoption panel.  In that case decisions were being taken in relation to three children aged 9, 7 and 4 years old.  The local authority’s final care plan was for adoption or, if this was not possible for the two elder children, care outside the birth family.  The three expert reports had been prepared by a consultant paediatrician, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist who was responsible for assessing the parents who wished to keep their children.  Not only were these reports withheld from the adoption panel but the adoption agency failed to provide even a proper summary of the detailed information contained within them in breach of the requirements of the 2002 Act and the AAR 2005.  To make matters worse, a number of views were incorrectly ascribed to the child and adolescent psychiatrist.  In particular, the adoption panel had been informed that he explicitly supported the separation of the sibling group in separate placements.  As a result, the panel supported the making of a placement order with a view to adoption for the youngest child.  That recommendation was accepted by the local authority decision maker in what was described as “a brief unminuted meeting”.   The application for the placement order was listed before a recorder.  He was told about the failure to provide what was obviously crucial information to the panel and the manner in which they were misled in relation to the expert evidence.  The recorder heard oral evidence from the three experts and determined that, although there had undoubtedly been procedural irregularities, they had been remedied during the hearing.  He made care orders in respect of all three children and a placement order in respect of the youngest.  In the context of a subsequent appeal by the parents, the local authority conceded it had made “a serious error” but argued that it was in the children’s best interests for the adoption to proceed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Wall LJ delivered the leading judgment.  The appeal against the care orders was dismissed but the placement order was set aside notwithstanding that the youngest child whom it affected had by this stage been matched and placed with prospective adopters.  During the course of argument, the Court of Appeal had received submissions from both CAFCASS and BAAF<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span>British Association for Adoption and Fostering</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  The court accepted that the local authority and its decision maker had not acted in bad faith in recommending adoption but had made a serious error of omission.  The absence of the three expert reports was not only a material error: it was crucial in the process of decision making.  The reports contained important information which was vital to that process.  The recommendation which resulted was fundamentally flawed and could not be rectified retrospectively by that evidence being heard in a different forensic process such as that undertaken by the recorder.  At paragraph 10 of his judgment Wall LJ stressed the need for compliance with the statutory process which provided the framework designed by Parliament to ensure that errors were not made. His Lordship said this:</p>

It has also served to highlight the critical importance of good practice in the legal processes leading to the institution and hearing of such proceedings, and the necessity of ensuring that the integrity of the process is respected.  To put the matter in a slightly different way: Parliament, in the 2002 Act and the consequential Regulations has laid down a careful process which has to be followed before placement and adoption orders can be made.  That process must be respected and scrupulously implemented.  In the instant case, it was not.”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>contains essential guidance as to the fundamental importance of ensuring that the fullest possible information is available during the decision making process in respect of each child who makes the journey through public law proceedings into the permanence which adoption delivers.  The regulations underpin the need for accurate reports and information precisely because this is the information which will inform the vital stage of decision making by the ADM.  It is also information which will subsequently inform the adopted child who seeks to understand his background and family circumstances in the future.  It is information which will inform the matching process and upon which potential adopters will rely both to inform their decision as to whether or not to proceed and in reaching an understanding of the particular needs of their child as he or she develops physically, emotionally and psychologically in their care.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>Wall LJ concluded that the decision which was taken was no more than a “simple rubber stamp” exercise imposed by the Director of Social Services who had no real knowledge of the case and who made the decision on the basis of inaccurate information which was supplied to the panel.  His Lordship made important recommendations which were designed to ensure that material information concerning a child’s health for the purposes of compliance with Regulation 17 should be properly disseminated to panel members in advance of a panel meeting.

It will plainly be a matter of judgment for the local authority medical adviser to the panel in each case to decide whether or not panel members need to read any expert report, or whether or not a summary of it will suffice.  There is, however, a clear duty on the local authority which is conducting the care proceedings to ensure both that all relevant material is available to the Panel, and that the material placed before it is accurate.  As important, it seems to me, is the proposition that the decision to proceed to apply for a placement order is properly made, and minuted.”</p>

In this context, sufficiency and materiality are key because without those elements any decision reached is likely to be flawed and unreliable.  It is not difficult to see why the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>found itself unable to uphold the placement order given that it was made on a fundamentally flawed basis in ignorance of important information which was likely to be highly material to the decision making process.</p>

Some options were completely ignored and others insufficiently considered.  These serious deficiencies had led to questions being raised about the qualifications of the author of the report (paragraph 94).  Furthermore the agency decision maker in that case was found to have made her decision from the foot of incomplete information based on “manifest failures”.  There had been a fundamental lack of analysis in the decision making process itself.  As the judgment records in paragraph 107, the ADM had failed to identify any arguments for or against adoption or long-term foster care and gave as the reason for her decision nothing more than the child’s age.  The sole reason for that decision was said to be based upon “an orthodoxy or set policy based on age alone” and showed the local authority had failed even to consider alternative options.  None of the other factors in the welfare check list had been considered, nor the value to the child of any continuing relationship with her siblings or wider family members.</p>

Ryder LJ remarked that there was no reason in that case why the local authority could not have obtained such a decision so as to enable placement proceedings to run concurrently with the care proceedings.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“A concurrent hearing of care and placement order applications also helps to prevent the error of linear decision making because the court has all of the evidence about the welfare options before it.  Indeed, I would go further: in order for the agency decision maker to make a lawful decision that the children be placed for adoption, the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005 (as amended) must be complied with.  For that purpose, the agency decision maker has a detailed “permanence report” which describes the realistic placement options for the child including extended family and friends.  The report describes the local authority’s assessment of those options.  When a decision is then made by the agency decision maker it is based on a holistic non-linear evaluation of those options.  That decision leads to evidence being filed in placement order proceedings.  It is good practice for that evidence to include the permanence report used by the agency decision maker, the record or minute of the decision made and a report known as an “annex A” report which is a statutory construct which summarises the options and gives information to the court on the suitability of the adoptive Applicants.  All of this permits the court to properly evaluate the adoption placement proposal by comparison with the other welfare options.”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I shall need to return to aspects of the law in the context of the specific submissions made by counsel on behalf of the parties.  Before considering those submissions, it is important to set out precisely what the court is being asked to do in the context of this particular hearing.  First and foremost, I am being asked to determine the applications for declaratory relief in respect of the ten children who now fall within the primary cohort category.  Their cases are all urgent given the stage of the pathway to permanence which they have reached.  Decisions for them cannot wait for the time it will inevitably take to consider the significantly greater number of children who fall within the wider cohort of those affected by SCC’s admitted failings.  A decision in relation to the legality of the primary cohort children’s placement orders will involve a determination of the legal approach or route to determining whether the declarations sought can lawfully be made.  In the light of the jurisprudence to which I have referred, I shall need to consider whether those breaches were material and impacted upon the decisions reached by the ADM in each of the ten cases so as to render them, or any of them, materially flawed and unlawful.  For these purposes I have been provided with the complete files of material provided to the relevant agency decision maker for each child.  Depending on the approach which I determine to be the correct route to lawfulness in this case, it may prove necessary to analyse that material in the context of each decision before I can declare the placement decisions and the orders which flowed from those decisions lawful or unlawful.  In the light of the concessions which are now made by SCC, there is no need for an analysis or findings by the court as to whether the local authority has breached regulations 15 and 17 AAR: those breaches are admitted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Because I have not had the time within the context of this hearing to expand the scope of the court’s enquiry into oral evidence which would be needed to establish how the breaches occurred, why they occurred, and who was responsible for them, I cannot in the scope of this judgment apportion responsibility for the situation in which we find ourselves.  I have already indicated that lessons must be learned from this wholesale systematic failure.  In order to put right past wrongs, there has to be a full understanding of why those wrongs arose.  There is no overall consensus between the various professionals whose evidence is before the court in relation to that issue.  I indicated at the pretrial review in September this year that I would need to provide within my ‘primary cohort judgment’ a context for the reasons why declaratory relief was being sought for these children.  That I have done from the foot of the concessions which SCC properly makes.  Put simply, those failings represent a failure on the part of the adoption agency to understand and apply its regulatory obligations.  In this context, the failure may well be properly described as institutional failure rather than failure by any one individual within that institution.  What all parties are agreed upon is the need for an approach which does not further prejudice these particular children in relation to their path to permanence.  As I emphasised during the course of submissions, neither expediency nor welfare-driven determinations can play any part in deciding what are essentially questions of law.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Mr Goodwin QC on behalf of SCC acknowledges that there are no statutory or regulatory criteria to assist the court in determining the correct approach to the Part 18 applications.  Relying on the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>(per Wall LJ), <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>(per Ryder LJ) and <span style="font-style:italic">Re N </span>(per Peter Jackson LJ), he starts from a position that not every regulatory breach requires the resulting placement order to be set aside.  He submits that the critical consideration in this context is whether there has been a material error in the ADM’s decision making.  He points to the submission in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>made by BAAF, accepted and adopted by Wall LJ, that the validity of any decision to place a child for adoption could be called into question “depending on the importance of that information in the context of the particular case”.  Thus, whilst he accepts that the AAR irregularities are established in this case because of a lack of form, he submits that the lawfulness of the resulting placement orders will depend upon an analysis of substance.  In support, he draws upon the distinction in <span style="font-style:italic">Halsbury’s Laws </span>between statutory or regulatory schemes which, on the one hand, require strict and total compliance and those, on the other hand, which permit substantial compliance.  He invites me to find that, given the pervading ethos of ACA 2002 and the need for robust, early decision-making for permanency, Parliament cannot have intended a breach of the regulations per se to invalidate a placement decision in circumstances where the irregularity had no material impact upon the decision.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In support of this approach, Mr Goodwin QC maintains that there are strong public policy reasons for upholding adoption orders once made.  Whilst none of the primary cohort children has yet been formally adopted, they are all significantly far advanced along their respective routes to permanence.  In the context of procedural irregularity and materiality, he points to the observations of Swinton Thomas LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re B (Adoption: Jurisdiction to Set Aside) </span>[1995] Fam 239 at 245 F to 246A:</p>
	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“There are cases where an adoption order has been set aside by reason of what is known as a procedural irregularity: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re F. (R.) (An Infant) </span>[1970] 1 Q.B. 385, <span style="font-style:italic">In Re R.A. (Minors) </span>(1974) 4 Fam Law 182 and <span style="font-style:italic">In re F. (Infants) (Adoption Order: Validity) </span>[1977] Fam 165.  Those cases concern a failure to effect proper service of the adoption proceedings on a natural parent or ignorance of the parent of the existence of the adoption proceedings.  In each case the application to set aside the order was made reasonably expeditiously.  It is fundamental to the making of an adoption order that the natural parent should be informed of the application so that she can give or withhold her consent.  If she has no knowledge at all of the application then, obviously, a fundamental injustice is perpetrated.  I would prefer myself to regard those cases not as cases where the order has been set aside by a procedural irregularity, although that has certainly occurred, but as cases where natural justice has been denied because the parent who may wish to challenge the adoption has never been told that it is going to happen.”</p>

However, he points to the fact that the rules of natural justice embrace more widely the presumption that when any administrative decision is taken, it must be taken fairly.  He relies on an extract from <span style="font-style:italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England </span>(Vol. 61A (2018) Chapter 2(3)(iv)(A)(30)):</p>

The court may also intervene where a body has reached a decision which is based on a material mistake as to an established fact.  Although the general rule is that a judicial review is determined on the basis of the material that was before the decision-maker where it is alleged that there has been a mistake of fact fresh evidence may be admitted.”</p>

Applying this reasoning, he proposes that the test which this court should apply is whether there was <span style="font-style:italic">“no evidence, or no sufficient evidence, available to the decision-maker on which, properly directing [herself] as to the law, [she] could reasonably have formed that view”</span>.</p>

Whilst the Part 18 applications are directed towards the lawfulness of the placement orders approved by the court, and not the ADM’s decision, the relationship between the two and the ADM’s decision to advance a care plan for adoption is obvious.  I have not heard specific submissions from anyone on the point but it appears to be accepted that, in each case, the court proceeded in ignorance of the procedural irregularities.  This is not a point which I can determine in respect of each of the ten cases with which I am dealing in this judgment and I have not been asked to do so.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">“The consequences of a failure to comply with a statutory procedure are now said to depend not on prior classification of the statutory provision as either mandatory or directory, but on an analysis of what Parliament had intended those consequences to be, and in particular whether Parliament can be taken to have intended the outcome of non-compliance to be total invalidity.  Courts determine the consequences of non-compliance as an ordinary question of statutory interpretation.”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">“In determining the consequences of a breach of a requirement, the court must look to the words and objects of the statute in which the requirement appears, the purpose of the requirement and its relationship with the scheme, the degree and seriousness of the non-compliance, and its actual or possible effect on the parties.  The court must attempt to assess the importance attached to the requirement by Parliament.  If, in the opinion of the court, a procedural code laid down by a statute is intended to be exhaustive and strictly enforced, its provisions will be regarded as invalidating an action taken in breach, but even a mandatory procedural requirement may be held to be susceptible of waiver by a person having an interest in securing strict compliance. Courts have been asked whether that statutory requirement can be fulfilled by substantial compliance and, if so, whether on the facts there has been substantial compliance even if not strict compliance.”</p>

They submit that, as <span style="font-style:italic">Halsbury’s Laws </span>confirm, some aspects of procedural rules are always likely to be regarded as mandatory (for example, whether or not a panel is quorate; whether a decision maker is properly qualified; the obligation to give reasons for a decision and to provide a framework for rights of appeal; the unauthorised sub-delegation of power; and breach of rules of natural justice).  Whilst this is not an exhaustive list, they submit that it highlights the very different considerations which arise in this case where non-compliance involves a failure to compile and present information in a prescribed form.  In this situation they submit that the court’s focus needs to be on the <span style="font-style:italic">sufficiency </span>of the information before the decision maker and the extent to which the underlying substance of that information, viewed in the round, met the procedural requirements of the relevant rule or regulation.  If that information provided the decision maker with details of all, or a sufficiently substantial part, of the facts and matters which the regulations specify as material to the decision in question (here, whether to recommend that a child should be placed for adoption), the absence of ‘form’ may be immaterial to the validity of that decision. </p>

Thus, Mr Goodwin QC and Mr Garrido QC invite me to consider whether the Initial Health Assessments (IHAs) and the Newborn and Infant  Physical Examination reports (NIPEs) for the primary cohort children which <span style="font-style:italic">were </span>in front of the ADM in respect of each of these primary cohort children contained sufficient information for the purposes of substantial compliance with the regulations.</p>

In terms of the parents’ and children’s Article 6 rights, they make the point that the admitted breaches of regulations 15 and 17 have not, within an Article 6 framework, affected the essential fairness of the ADM’s decision-making.  The parents’ and children’s views (where they were old enough to express them) were made known to the ADM through the volume of social work statements and reports from the experts and the children’s Guardians.  The Article 8 rights of the parents are clearly engaged in any decision to place a child for adoption.  They submit that there will have been no Article 8 breach in any of the ten cases before the court if the court reaches the conclusion that the procedural irregularities would not have affected either the substance of the adoption agency’s planning or the court’s determination that a placement order was in that child’s best interests.</p>

	      </authorialNote> amounts to a breach of substance rather than form.  He developed his argument in this way.  This requirement is designed to provide the ADM with more than a mechanical précis of all the health information available at that point in time in relation to a child.  Rather it is intended to ensure that the ADM has an independent medical opinion by a doctor who has a greater degree of experience and (if required) professional specialism than the doctor who undertook the initial IHA or NIPE reports.  In order to comply with the regulations, the summary in the child’s permanence report should include a developmental assessment of the child.  That exercise is clearly the subject of an expert opinion, together with a prognosis of what the child’s individual health needs are likely to be, not only now but in the future.  Mr Garrido QC described this requirement as “an exercise which joins together the dots between all the independent pieces of information in order to draw for the ADM a complete picture of the health needs of that particular child”.  That is a description which I accept as accurately depicting the nature and purpose of this particular exercise.</p>

He submits that this is a permissible course given that these pre-adoption reports were written within a short period of weeks (in some cases months) after the ADM decision.  In these circumstances it is highly unlikely that the agency medical adviser would have formed a different view following a regulation 15 request or in a regulation 17(1)(b) summary from that which she expressed in the pre-adoption medical report.  In none of the ten cases with which I am dealing is there a contra-indicator to adoption based upon a health reason.  Mr Garrido QC invites me to accept the evidence of Dr Smith and the pre-adoption medical reports themselves to reach a conclusion that those pieces of work provide a comprehensive overview of each individual child’s health needs.  In particular, they included all the relevant information which would have been placed before the ADM had regulations 15 and 17 been complied with, including the focus on the child’s <span style="font-style:italic">future</span> health care needs which are central to the regulation 17 health care summary.  There is evidence in the written statement of Sarah Ashe, the designated nurse for looked after children, which confirms the comprehensive list of health information which was available to the ADM together with her own clinical records in respect of each child.  She further confirms that the pre-adoption medical review for each child was completed with reference to all the available health information including, specifically, that which is required pursuant to regulations 15 and 17.</p>

As I have said, within these proceedings SCC has disclosed the children’s permanency reports and records of the decisions for each child.  Each decision record appears to indicate that the CPR and the medical records have been considered (through the insertion of an ‘x’ in the designated box).  There are no indications on the face of these records which, without disclosure and scrutiny of internal minutes, indicate that SCC as an adoption agency was in breach of the regulations.  There was thus nothing which would appear to have alerted the court to the existence of these procedural issues when it approved and sanctioned the placement orders for the primary cohort children.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">As to the issue of whether the non-compliance in this case goes to the root of the process (which is another way of asking the ‘materiality’ question, in my view), Ms Perry QC seeks to draw a distinction between the irregularities in this case and the gateway errors in <span style="font-style:italic">ZH v HS </span>(cited above) which persuaded Theis J to set aside an adoption order.  In that case the entire process was contaminated by fundamental failures to observe the rules of natural justice (including a failure to give notice of the adoption application to the birth family and seek parental consent).  Ms Perry QC also relies on the earlier decision of Bodey J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W </span>[2013] EWHC 1957 (Fam).  That case involved an application to revoke an adoption order on the basis of the court’s inherent jurisdiction.  The application was refused on the basis of the potential consequences of reopening a process which could have profound implications in terms of “potential problems at the human level”, the court taking the view that opening such a “Pandora’s box” should only be contemplated if the process appeared proportionate, necessary and reasonably likely to succeed.  None of those pre-requisites was fulfilled in that case.  Ms Perry QC submits that these considerations are highly relevant to the question of disposal or outcome in this case.  In response to that submission I would merely observe, and I so direct myself, that outcome here is a matter of law in the context of the Part 18 applications which are currently before the court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Ms Perry QC turns next to the question of the means by which the court can remedy the breaches of regulations 15 and 17.  In this context, she relies on the decision of Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A and Others </span>[2015] EWHC 2602 (Fam), [2016] 1 WLR 1325.  That was a case which concerned the legality of parental orders made in pursuance to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008.  The statutory regulator of clinics offering services under the 2008 Act is the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).  Two fundamental prerequisites to the acquisition of parenthood by the partner of a woman receiving fertilisation treatment are (i) consents must be given in writing before the treatment, both by the woman and her partner; and (ii) each must have been given adequate information and offered counselling.  In relation to (i), the HFEA regulations were prescriptive about the contents of the appropriate form.  An earlier judgment delivered by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">AB v CD and the Z Fertility Clinic </span>[2013] EWHC 1418 (Fam), [2013] 2 FLR 1357 had identified what were described by the judge as “lamentable shortcomings” on the failure of a clinic which had failed to comply with the conditions of the licence granted to it by the HFEA.  </p>

In that case the court had to determine a number of factual questions which drilled down into the issue of whether there had been essential compliance with section 37(1) of the 2008 Act.  Theis J was able to reach conclusions on the facts that it was more likely than not that the appropriate forms had been signed but were subsequently mislaid by the clinic thereby avoiding a finding of regulatory breach.  Such a finding would have invalidated the clinic’s licence and put in jeopardy the parenthood of the child in question. </p>

Having considered each individual case from the foot of the evidence available to the court, his Lordship was able to make findings that the deficits in the strict procedural requirements could be corrected or rectified by a finding that those requirements in their various elements were met even if not recorded and maintained as records on the correct forms.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">“47.<marker name="tab"/>I start with rectification.  As a matter of general principle, I can see no reason at all why a Form WP or a Form PP should be said to be, of its nature, a document which cannot be rectified.  The fact that it is a document required by statute to be in a particular form (that is, “in writing” and “signed by the person giving it”) is, in my judgment, neither here nor there: compare the many cases where rectification has been decreed of conveyancing or trust documents similarly required by various provisions of the Law of Property Act 1925 to be in a particular form.  Nor does it matter, in my judgment, that a Form WP or a Form PP is used as part of, and, indeed, in order to comply with the requirements of, a statutory scheme.  There is, for example, nothing in the language of any of the relevant provisions of Part 2 of the 2008 Act to suggest that rectification is impermissible. Contrast, for example, the well established rule that the Articles of Association of a company will not be rectified because rectification would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Acts: see <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Frank F Scott (London) Ltd </span>[1940] Ch 794.  So, in my judgment, if the criteria for rectification are otherwise established, a Form WP or a Form PP can be rectified.</p>

In this context, she asserts that whilst a failure to comply is undoubtedly a serious matter, it cannot have been Parliament’s intention that a lack of compliance with this aspect of the regulations, in the broader context of the available medical evidence, would render a placement order unlawful.  She submits that, by a process of construction, the court can analyse the evidence it has (where there is no factual dispute as to that evidence) and reach a conclusion that the relevant medical evidence was available at the relevant time, if not from the correct source.  In other words, provided that the breaches of the regulations are confronted ‘head on’ and remedied, either by way of evidence or correction on the basis of the evidence, then it is open to the court to make a declaration of lawfulness in respect of each placement order in respect of which declarations are sought in this case.  On this basis, she submits that the declaration that the placement order was lawfully made is merely declaratory of an existing legal right or entitlement:  see <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of TT) v Registrar General for England and Wales (AIRE Centre intervening) </span>[2019] EWHC 2384 (Fam), per Sir Andrew McFarlane P<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">

In particular, Ms Giz reminds the court that compliance with the AAR is expressed to be mandatory:  <span style="font-style:italic">Re P-B (Placement Order) </span>[2006] EWCA Civ 1016<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>per Thorpe LJ<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>(per Ryder LJ) (above).  Ms Giz invites the court to consider the extent to which, as a matter of law, substantial compliance surmounts the high hurdles of “scrupulous implementation” (per Wall LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>).  It will be recalled that, in that case, the court held that it was not open to the recorder to rectify the breaches by reconstituting what was essentially an ex post facto welfare investigation in the form of a wide-ranging process of fresh oral evidence.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Dealing first with the breach of regulation 15, Ms Giz submits that, whilst the IHAs and NIPE assessments available to the ADM would undoubtedly have provided valuable information about a child’s health and needs, they will have been commissioned or received at the time when the child became a looked after child on entering the care system or, where parental responsibility was not shared, as a result of parental agreement.  They will not have been commissioned by the local authority in its role as an adoption agency which is what is required by the AAR.  In this case, there is significant reliance by SCC on the existence of IHA reports for ten of the original primary cohort of children, a NIPE report for one and a paediatric assessment for another.  In due course I shall need to examine, in each case, precisely what information the ADM had in relation to each child at the time decisions to place for adoption were made.  The point, however, is well made by Ms Giz that the provision of this information, however full in its content at the time, does not absolve a local authority of its obligation to consult with the agency medical adviser in order to seek a health assessment and a written report.  It is only when an AMA confirms that a regulation 15(2) assessment or examination is not required in respect of a particular child that compliance is achieved.  As Ms Giz puts it succinctly, this is an expert medical decision and not a decision for a social worker who prepares the child permanence report or for Ms Winter in her role as ADM on reviewing the documents placed before her.  Whilst the opportunity to seek further assessment or tests as provided by regulation 15(2) may have been lost as a result of the admitted breaches in each case, Ms Giz submits that the court can nevertheless go on to consider whether it can legitimately be said that there would not have been any need for further tests or assessment had the agency medical adviser been asked to assess the children and provide a report.</p>

In this context she invites the court to consider the extent to which the IHA and NIPE reports, together with the other assessments available in each individual case, can be said to amount to “substantial compliance” with the regulations.  She highlights the fact that the 2013 Statutory Guidance emphasises the central importance of the <span style="font-style:italic">accuracy </span>of the child’s permanence report for the reasons to which I have already alluded in paragraph 63 above. She draws the attention of the court to the document setting out the National Minimum Standards for Adoption published by the Department of Education in July 2014 which stresses the need for compliance with the two regulations (15 and 17) in order to ensure that a number of different factors are taken into account in the context of decision making.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In the context of the children’s position through their respective Guardians, Ms Giz makes the point that the rectification or correction route involves (potentially) the rectification of a court order.  She submits that it is conceptually difficult to rectify a situation or a document such as a court order on the basis of something which did not happen.  In terms, she accepts that the “substantial materiality” route to legality of the placement orders may be the more palatable route if it is based upon an overview of the granular detail of the information available to the ADM at the time she made her decisions.  That route requires caution in terms of the extent to which that information, whatever it amount to, was properly evaluated and open to the birth parents, the children’s Guardians and, ultimately, to the court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Whether the court is looking at the issue of legality through the lens of “substantial compliance” or “materiality to decision making”, Ms Giz submits that the failures in relation to regulations 15 and 17 were substantial.  In this context she points to the fundamental failure of the ADM to engage in an overview at the time of the decision making; the displacement by the ADM of the onus to seek that expert medical review on the basis that she would exercise that discretion; and the apparent ‘policy’ or value system which may have informed the ADM’s decision making that the permanence achieved by adoption should be open to all but the most extreme cases where a child’s health issues were likely to be life-limiting.  In relation to materiality, Ms Giz highlights the significant distance between that approach and the non-linear analytical approach demanded by <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span>.</p>

Whilst it is outside the remit of this first stage judgment in this case to identify exactly what has gone wrong in the wider context of systemic failure, the court has received an assurance that the wider regulatory framework of the AAR informs the adoption process and procedure in Somerset.  Mr Goodwin QC told me that what is likely to lie at the heart of these issues is a lack of training and a consequent failure to understand what was required.  He reminds me that in relation to <span style="font-style:italic">each</span> of the ten primary cohort children, by the time of the issue of each placement application, the ADM had before her a child permanence report which contained an internal analysis of the realistic placement options for the children which was <span style="font-style:italic">B-S </span>compliant.  Furthermore, by the time of each ADM decision to recommend placement for adoption as the appropriate outcome for each child, there was professional unanimity that rehabilitation with the birth family was not a viable option for any of these children.</p>

A further seven children await the outcome of various matching panels.  Whilst adopters have been identified, matters can go no further until it is known whether their placement orders are legal.  A further six children are placed with foster carers who wish to proceed with an adoption application.  The balance of the wider cohort (some 200 odd children) are the subject of adoption orders.  They stand in a different legal position.  Many have been settled within their adoptive families for a significant period of time, and in some cases for a number of years.  Nonetheless, this illustrates the scale of the underlying problem and the potential consequences of this local authority’s failures for each of these children and their families.  For the purposes of this judgment, I am looking at institutional rather than individual responsibility for the admitted breaches.  In order to go further, as all counsel accept, the court would need to hear oral evidence from a number of witnesses.</p>

It is framed to ensure that no child is placed on the route to a permanent separation from his or her birth family without the fullest appreciation of whether that irreversible step accords with that child’s best interests, not only now but for the rest of his or her lifetime. It is a decision which is fundamental to that child’s future and Parliament has determined that a decision maker should be required to approach his or her task with a full understanding of all the information which shapes and informs that vital decision.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">That said, it is clear from the consensus which emerges from the appellate authorities to which I have referred that a breach of the regulations <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> will not automatically invalidate, or render illegal, a placement order which flows from a decision which has been reached in circumstances where there has been a breach of, or non-compliance with, the regulations.  The court retains the ability in these circumstances to look at the nature of the breach in order to determine whether the essential quality of the decision-making process has been critically or materially undermined when viewed through the lens of the statutory objective of the regulations.  In this context I agree with the submission made by Ms Perry QC on behalf of the Guardians that it cannot have been the intention of Parliament that a lack of compliance with the regulations in the broader context of the totality of the medical and other information available to the decision maker would <span style="font-style:italic">automatically</span> render any resulting placement order unlawful.  Whilst compliance is framed throughout the AAR as mandatory, the sanction for non-compliance is not specified.  The underlying policy considerations which informed the formulation of regulations 15 and 17 were clearly designed to ensure, as Parliament provided, that all relevant information was available to the decision maker so as to ensure a solid evidential basis for welfare determinations.  As the preface to the 2013 Statutory Guidance makes clear, non-compliance was contemplated as an exception (in terms, <span style="font-style:italic">guidance must be complied with “unless there are exceptional reasons which justify a departure”</span>).  That same Statutory Guidance also stresses the importance which was attached by the policy framers of avoiding a situation where compliance led to “unnecessary delay in securing the child’s future”: see paragraph 2.16.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In terms of the difference in approach in relation to the legal test as between counsel, I accept that we are all proceeding from the basis of the same evidential landscape.  In distinguishing between the different approaches adopted, on the one hand, by Mr Goodwin QC and Mr Garrido QC and by Ms Perry QC and Ms Willsteed, on the other, I accept that each provides the court with a potential route to legality if the underlying facts support such an outcome.  However, in my judgment there is a conceptual difficulty with the route of correction and/or rectification in this case.  In <span style="font-style:italic">A &amp; Others</span> (cited above) the former President of the Family Division was able to correct or rectify the mistake of recording consent on the wrong form because it was clear that, in each case which he considered “informed consent”, both as a fact and as a legal pre-requirement, existed and had been voluntarily given as required by the HFEA regulatory framework.  The errors in that case were fundamentally errors of pure form and it was clear and obvious from the face of the forms which had been signed in each case what was being provided and what was intended. In my judgment this is a materially different situation from a potential failure to provide relevant information which is prescribed as necessary for a fully informed exercise of judgment on the part of a decision maker.  There is no ‘mistake’ here which can be corrected by an approach which was deployed in <span style="font-style:italic">A &amp; Others</span>.  This much is clear from what Sir James Munby P said at paragraph 59: “What one is looking for is compliance with the substance not slavish adherence to a form”.  What we have in this case is a series of admitted breaches which go beyond the simple rectification of a form.  The absence of a health report as required by regulation 15(2) over and above the IHAs and initial paediatric reports is an omission which in my judgment is not capable of rectification in the manner proposed by Ms Perry QC.  In conceptual terms it is an omission which goes beyond a failure of form and extends potentially into the realms of substance.  Whether in all the circumstances such failure is fatal to the legality of the ten individual placement orders which are the subject of the Part 18 applications which I am considering is something to which I shall turn shortly.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I fully appreciate that Ms Perry QC adopts this more nuanced approach because it avoids the need to confront head on what even Mr Goodwin QC accepts is a fundamental and systemic failure on the part of SCC to comply with regulations 15 and 17.  In my judgment that exercise cannot be avoided by the adoption of an approach which strains the limits of legal interpretation.  What <span style="font-style:italic">A &amp; Others </span>does provide is a clear steer to the court that (i) its focus must be on substance and materiality rather than on form, and (ii) that it is permissible, in appropriate circumstances, for the court to look at the evidence which was available from sources outside the prescribed forms in order to reach a conclusion about the actual prevailing circumstances at the relevant time.  To that extent, the decision of the former President is an essential part of the judicial road map in determining the questions which have to be answered in this case.   However, as the authorities make clear, it is impermissible for the reviewing court to look to information obtained <span style="font-style:italic">subsequent</span> to the decision under scrutiny (and thus missing at the point of decision-making) to provide retrospective legality for an otherwise unlawful decision.  In this context, it is important to focus upon the nature of the declarations which are sought by SCC.  The declarations of lawfulness relate to the placement orders which flowed in each case from a judicial decision. Each of those judicial decisions was based upon the evidence which was put before the court which included, importantly, the decision of the ADM as to outcome for each of these children and the evidential basis for that decision.  That is why the form of the draft declarations before the court includes a recital to the effect that the court has determined in each case that “the Agency Decision Maker’s decision that [the child in question] ought to be placed for adoption was not … vitiated by any material error or misunderstanding”.   Thus whilst the full pre-adoption medical reports obtained <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the decision to place for adoption will have provided the court making the placement order in each case with information which the judge needed to exercise an independent judicial function in the context of Ms Winter’s/the ADM’s original decision, they cannot in my judgment be used retrospectively and without more to justify or, in this context, give legal currency or validity to an otherwise illegal decision.  The court must consider whether, and to what extent, information available in the context of those reports was also available to Ms Winter in whatever form at the point when she, or another ADM, decided that adoption was the appropriate outcome for any one of the ten children with whom I am presently dealing.  To that extent I depart from this aspect of Mr Garrido QC’s submissions.  I do not consider that the pre-adoption medical reports and the information contained within them are irrelevant to the court’s survey of the evidence.  However, I do not think they can be used to cure any substantial or material defects in the ADM’s decision making process if indeed there were such errors in any of the cases I am considering.  Whilst this course and his proposed solution would have provided the court with a clear route out of the dilemma with which it is confronted, I do not consider it to be a route which I can properly take.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I agree with Ms Giz that an evaluation of “substantial compliance” involves an analysis of the decision maker’s state of knowledge at the relevant time.  I accept without reservation that there are conceptual difficulties in aspects of adopting that test.  For example, in circumstances where the overview of the agency medical adviser was never sought by Ms Winter because she was unaware of that requirement, how can it be said that there was substantial compliance with regulation 15(2) which requires medical input?  Notwithstanding those difficulties, I regard it as essential for this court to conduct a factual analysis of the circumstances of each of the ten primary cohort children’s cases in order to reach conclusions about the circumstances in which decisions for them were made and thereafter whether each of those decisions was lawfully made on the basis of substantial compliance with the regulations.  Put another way in the circumstances of this case, was there sufficient information available to the decision maker at the time of his or her decision to represent material or substantial compliance with the regulations?  Did the agency decision maker have available at the relevant time sufficient information, including medical information in relation to each child, so as to enable a fully informed decision to be made ?  It is in this context that I accept and adopt the relevance of the questions posed by Mr Garrido QC as set out in paragraph 88 above.  It is that evaluation to which I shall shortly turn.  Before doing so, I propose to set out aspects of the local authority’s evidence (which is not challenged) in order to provide a context for that specific evaluation.  </p>

It was only in April 2021 when these issues came to light that she became aware of this state of affairs.  Ms Ashe states that she worked closely with Dr Smith in her role as agency medical adviser since her appointment in 2019 to ensure that the requirement to provide an AAR 17 compliant health summary as part of a child’s CPR was, and is, included in the job description for the agency medical adviser.  She has explained in her statement that the use of NIPE reports in place of the statutory IHAs, specifically for new-born infants who were subject to care orders from birth and moved immediately to foster placements, was commonplace in Somerset until these events came to light in April 2021.  In relation to the breaches of regulations 15 and 17 in the ten cases of the primary cohort children, she confirms that, in all but two cases, the initial health assessment was completed by either a paediatric registrar (for seven of the children) or a consultant community paediatrician (in one of the cases).  The agency medical adviser provided the initial health assessment in only two of the cases.  Several of the primary cohort children were not physically examined as part of this process because of the restrictions flowing from an acute stage of the Covid-19 crisis although their assessments were delivered virtually using either telephone or video conference facilities.  Furthermore, as Ms Ashe confirms, there were some gaps in the initial health assessments which were provided to Ms Winter in terms of those which were prepared before 2019.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In respect of the ten primary cohort children with whom the court is concerned, Ms Ashe has conducted a thorough review of all the information which was available to the agency decision maker, Ms Winter.  She has confirmed that in respect of each of them, relevant health information was available to Ms Winter including paediatric reports, unscheduled care attendances, health visitor records and therapy assessments which in some cases predate the IHAs.  The regulation 17 breach meant that none of this information was reviewed by Dr Smith in her role as the agency medical adviser and thus there was no specific consideration of “any need for health care which may arise in the future”.  Ms Ashe further confirms that all the information which would have been provided in compliance with regulations 15 and 17 was subsequently included in the pre-adoption medical reports, each of which did include a specific focus on the child’s future health care needs. All of that information was available to the judge who made the placement orders for each of these children.</p>

It was part of Ms Poore’s function to review all the child permanence reports prepared by the relevant social worker.

She explains that when she was appointed as agency adviser, her ability to list matching panels was being dictated by Dr Smith’s capacity as opposed to assessment time scales.  She further confirms that, before her appointment in 2016, a policy or practice appeared to have been approved whereby the initial health assessment (IHA) prepared in respect of a looked after child could be used in place of a full medical report for the purposes of the ADM’s decision whether to approve a placement for adoption.  Ms Poore explains that this policy was informed by the fact that Dr Smith saw all the children in her role as the lead paediatrician at the hospital where she worked and it was she who wrote the majority of the IHAs.  She confirms that “we never had a case where there was no medical information submitted”.</p>

I propose to say no more at this stage since I have not heard any oral evidence and have only the information given to me by SCC’s adoption agency adviser that such a policy or practice was in place, although it appears to be confirmed on the face of one of the child permanence reports to which I shall shortly come.  What is not clear to me from the narrative accounts of procedure provided by both Ms Winter and Ms Poore is how that practice was reflected in the chronology of the individual cases which make up the primary cohort of children.

SD then moved to a foster to adopt placement but that broke down very swiftly.  She was then matched with potential adopters. The pre-adoption medical in February 2021 identified a maternal genetic risk of mitochondrial disease which might have a significant impact on her future medical needs and which may be life-limiting.  As a result of that report, those potential adopters decided not to proceed. New adopters have now been identified who are keen to proceed notwithstanding SD’s health issues, about which they have been fully informed.  With the court’s permission, she has now moved to live with her prospective adopters in the context of a foster to adopt placement.  That move coincided with the need to move this child as a result of her current foster carers’ intention to retire at the end of this month and the notice they have given to SCC.</p>

There is no formal maternal diagnosis in this case, far less any evidence which confirms that SD herself has any genetic defect.  The ADM was aware of these issues at the time of her decision from the medical and other evidence which was put before her.  She concluded that SD’s health risk (if indeed it existed) should not deprive her of the opportunity of the security which adoption would bring.  She considered that option in the context of a holistic evaluation of all other options available for this child including a placement with the mother’s partner/extended family.  The viability assessment in respect of those options was negative and SD’s own mother accepted that she was not in a position to provide her daughter with the consistent and appropriate care she was entitled to receive throughout the course of her minority.

There were long-standing concerns about poor parenting and the use within the home by the mother of both alcohol and cannabis.  R’s mother had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder and had been supported by the community mental health team since 2015 when she was referred as a result of acute depression.  The relationship between R’s parents was described as “volatile” and characterised by frequent incidents of domestic violence requiring police intervention.  R’s two elder half-siblings, who had been the subject of child protection plans since 2016, were taken into local authority care after that incident.  R was born very shortly thereafter and was immediately placed with foster carers following her discharge from hospital.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>The separate psychological and parenting assessments of her parents concluded that “neither … has the capacity to engage in the intensive support necessary in order for the children to return to their care”.  Neither was able to offer “safe, child focussed, stable and predictable parenting”.  Viability assessments of the maternal aunt and her partner were negative.  A special guardianship assessment of the maternal grandparents prepared by an independent social worker was also negative.  An experienced CAFCASS Guardian had prepared a detailed analysis which supported the plan for adoption of R.</p>

It sets out in some considerable detail the medical chronology and the various surgical interventions which R had by then undergone.  It deals with R’s educational progress and her likely needs in the future.  The social work analysis at paragraph 13 constitutes an in-depth examination of all this small child’s complex medical and other needs including the lifelong care which she will need “through the community, local hospitals and specialist hospitals”.  It projects those needs into the future in terms of the specialist equipment she will need and her likely trajectory through education.  The CPR explores in some detail the history of R’s parents’ relationship from the age of sixteen when her mother was pregnant with her first child, R’s half-sibling.  It contains a careful analysis of the options for R and her two half-siblings.  In terms of R’s very particular needs, it concludes that in circumstances where neither of her parents can provide the consistent care she will need and there are no viable alternatives, adoption is the appropriate route to security and permanence for this child.</p>

When combined with the concerns about parents’ understanding of the significance of their substance misuse in its effect on their parenting ability, the prospect of [SH] returning to their care is untenable.

An updated report from Dr Smith on 11 June 2020 confirmed that the child had made very good progress since moving to live with her foster carers.  Her development had accelerated and “there is no specific concern with her gross motor skills or fine motor skills”.

That report had been prepared by the allocated social worker on 1 October 2020.  Paragraph 10 of that report (<span style="font-style:italic">‘Summary report from the agency medical adviser’</span>) had been completed “to follow”.  The social work analysis in paragraph 13 is full and contains a detailed exposition of both parents’ childhoods and backgrounds and the family circumstances at the time of SH’s birth.  It tracks the chronology of events thereafter.  It records the parents’ inability to cope following the removal of two older children and their ongoing use of heroin and other substances even during periods when there was a high level of external support in place to support the family.  It addressed the number of parenting assessments which had been conducted since January 2019 including the six week period in a residential assessment specialist unit.  It included a careful <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S </span>compliant analysis of all the available options for SH including rehabilitation to her parents, long-term foster care subject to a care order, and adoption.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In this case there was plainly a failure on the part of the adoption agency to make a specific request for a specific medical examination of the child or to seek advice that a medical report was unnecessary (regulation 15).  In addition, there was no medical summary from the agency medical adviser within the body of the CPR (regulation 17).  However, Ms Winter did have access to the report prepared by the agency medical adviser, Dr Smith, which had been prepared by her in May 2019 and updated the following month in June.  SH’s health did not change and there were no contraindicators between June and October 2019 when Ms Winter made her decision to place for adoption.  Following her independent evaluation of SH’s welfare, the Guardian supported that decision.  Ms Winter was required to consider whether SH could safely return to her parents’ care.  On the basis of the evidence before her at the time, she plainly concluded that she could not.  Neither parent opposed her placement for adoption and neither has sought to make representations in the context of these Part 18 applications despite being given notice and the opportunity of legal funding.</p>

In this case it is difficult to see what more compliance would have achieved in terms of the provision of information for the decision maker.  That does not mean that compliance was unnecessary: it plainly was and the regulations should have been complied with.  However, on the basis of my analysis of the information available to Ms Winter in October 2020 and the circumstances in which she made her decision, I am satisfied that, notwithstanding the breaches of regulations 15 and 17, the decision which Ms Winter took on 12 October 2020 and the placement order made in respect of SH on 14 December 2020 were lawfully made and SCC is entitled to the declaration sought in respect of this child.</p>

As a result, these plans have been put on hold.  The impact on everyone involved is not difficult to imagine and cannot be underestimated.  It is no part of my function in the context of this judgment to conduct any form of welfare evaluation now and I do not do so.

No other family members or potential carers known to the family had put their names forward as alternative carers.  The only realistic options at the time for TM were therefore long-term foster care or adoption.  Ms Hopkins confirms in her written witness statement that her decision to place TM for adoption would not have been different had she had access to a report prepared by the medical adviser.  I bear well in mind the submission which Ms Giz has impressed upon the court that this was not her decision, with her social work background, to make.  Nevertheless, she was clearly sighted in relation to all TM’s medical conditions and the ongoing concerns about his development.  That medical information had no doubt informed her recommendation for a full paediatric and autism assessment in due course (see paragraph 185 above).  Whilst neither the IHA nor the CPR made specific reference to a chromosome disorder, Ms Hopkins has recorded as part of her written decision to place for adoption that she had reached her decision based upon an awareness of “more potential complex health needs for [TB]” and it was this which had informed her recommendation for a full paediatric assessment in the future.</p>

I further find that it is unlikely that Dr Smith would have expressed an opinion in any regulation 17(1)(b) health summary that would have undermined the decision to place TM for adoption.

These potential carers have been provisionally assessed as capable of meeting his needs and it appears that they remain willing to proceed on the basis of all the information which is now available.  The next steps are not a matter for me since I am not determining welfare issues but, in terms of legal hurdles, there is now no reason why those next steps should not proceed swiftly provided that the current welfare analysis continues to support adoption as the best outcome for this child.</p>

There were no changes in the health of either child between the ADM’s decisions for each on 20 May 2020 and the placement orders approved by the court on 12 October later that same year.  The placements for adoption were supported by their mother and not opposed by their father.</p>

I further find that it is unlikely that Dr Smith would have expressed an opinion in any regulation 17(1)(b) health summary that would have undermined the decision to place either of MM or HM for adoption.  I am satisfied that, notwithstanding these admitted breaches, the decision which Ms Winter took on 20 May 2020 and the placement orders made in respect of each child on 12 October 2020 were lawfully made and SCC is entitled to the declaration sought in respect of these children.</p>

The father was fully aware of these proceedings, although not formally served, and did not respond to the invitation which was extended to him for these purposes.  The Guardian in each case gave her full support to the making of those orders as being in the children’s best interests.</p>

A further health assessment prepared by Dr M on 18 June 2020 following an examination at Yeovil District Hospital confirmed that there were no health issues arising out of his examination of HP and no significant past medical history.

That report confirmed that there were no health concerns for the child who was described by her foster carer as “a gorgeous, cute and delightful baby”.  When MP had come to her, she was behind in more or less every aspect of her development but that presentation had changed dramatically over the course of the first five weeks of the placement.  All MP’s immunisation and other records were confirmed to be up to date and blood tests taken shortly after her birth had confirmed that there were no concerns in relation to any other conditions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In addition to the medical evidence for each of these siblings, Ms Winter had a full range of expert psychological and other reports and information which had been compiled in relation to the parents.  A special guardianship assessment had been prepared in relation to the option of placement with the paternal uncle and his partner.  That report was negative and there were no other family members who were able to offer either of these children a home.  Ms Winter subsequently reviewed her original decision on 21 December 2020 some four months after her original decision for both children to be placed for adoption and about a month before the final court hearing.  There was additional information available to her at that stage in relation to a medical report about what was considered to be a non-accidental injury to HP whilst he was living in the care of his uncle his partner.  I place no reliance on that subsequent information for the purposes of determining the legality of the current placement orders nor have I taken any account of the very full pre-adoption medical report prepared by Dr H on 7 April 2021.  There is a full child permanence report in respect of each child in the material placed before the court.  Whilst the team leader/social worker compiling those reports has signed them, they remain undated and it is therefore not clear to me whether or not they were available to Ms Winter on 13 August 2020 when she made her decision to place for adoption.  From the evidence of Ms Poore and what appears to have happened in relation to the other primary cohort children, it seems reasonable to assume that these reports were provided to her before 13 August 2020.  Given the options at that time, it appears that these children were either looking at long-term foster care or an adoptive placement.  There were no other options given the fact that neither parent had engaged in the proceedings for the purposes of the final hearing and there was no offer of an alternative from members of the extended family.</p>

The mother has been served with notice of these proceedings and has chosen not to respond and/or make any representations.  The whereabouts of the children’s father are unknown.  He disengaged from the care proceedings at a very early stage.  I made separate disclosure orders against the Department of Work and Pensions in order to ascertain whether there was any official record of his current address.  That has produced a nil return and thus he has not been given notice of these Part 18 proceedings.  To the best of my knowledge, the mother has no contact with the father and cannot assist in this respect.  Despite the lack of service on this particular father, I have given leave for the Part 18 application in respect of these two children to proceed since their cases as members of the primary cohort require urgent resolution.</p>

Her daughter, the children’s maternal aunt, had also applied for a special guardianship order but the court rejected that option following a negative assessment of her capacity to care for them.

The only concerns to emerge from the medical report in relation to SR was a failure by the mother to ensure that he was up to date with his immunisations and a poor dental health record.

Thus the options which confronted Ms Winter in this case were either long term foster care or placement for adoption.

Despite the fact that I am only dealing here with ten of the primary cohort children affected by SCC’s failures, I realise that there is the wider cohort whose cases will need to be considered in due course.  That exercise is likely to be materially different from this in that many of those children have been placed with permanent families on the basis of post-matching adoption orders.  The majority are living in happy and settled homes where they have achieved permanence and, I hope, happiness and security after what will have been a very difficult start in their lives.</p>

Because counsel did not have an opportunity to read this statement, far less address its contents, I do not propose to say any more about it in this judgment.  There may well be issues which need to be addressed going forward and, as I have indicated, I intend that there should be an early case management hearing within the next three weeks to consider what happens next.</p>

It is clear to me from the particular factual matrices and the analysis of the options which were potentially available and viable for each of these primary cohort children that the judgments reached by Ms Winter and her fellow ADMs were both considered and based on an evaluation of the totality of the evidence available at the time.  To the extent that it is permissible for this court to look backwards with the benefit of hindsight at those decisions from the perspective of the much fuller evidence which was available to the court for the purposes of subsequent judicial decision making, I am satisfied that each of the decisions taken in relation to the primary cohort children was reached from the foot of an evidence base which was sufficient in terms of its material compliance in substance, if not in form, with Parliament’s expressed intentions as reflected in the AAR.</p>
