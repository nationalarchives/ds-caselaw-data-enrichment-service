These allegations were the subject of a fact-finding hearing before HHJ Rundell, the then Designated Family Judge of Hereford and Worcester in 2013. In his judgment of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 he did not find the children’s allegations established on the balance of probabilities, but he did find that the children had been exposed to sexual activity when they had been living with their parents. </p>

They each held increasingly entrenched negative views of their mother, their father and the wider family. Mr and Mrs XX adopted the stance of believing the children. In consequence, the mother and the father have not seen the children since late 2012 and the maternal grandmother has seen them on just two occasions in 2017. </p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration".

Whilst I may not necessarily agree with the precise way that jurisdictional issues have been approached or expressed in these very difficult cases, what is clear is that there is a cohort of cases where the common theme is that a party (whether it be a local authority or, often, an NHS Trust) has sought to bring an issue before the court, believing it to be of too great a magnitude to be determined without the guidance of the court, and without all those with parental responsibility having an opportunity to express their view as a part of the decision making process.  </p>

They were not advised by the local authority that the children’s adoption of their surname is contrary to s.33(7) of the 1989 Act nor that the children calling them ‘mum’ and ‘dad’ was wholly contrary to good social work and fostering practice. I accept that they took these steps out of the best of motives.

The statement of Janet Watkins goes on to record that Mrs XX told Janet Watkins that Child A had been clear to her that she didn’t want to see the family and that Mrs XX was adamant that she would not have stopped her doing so if she said she wanted to see them and reminded the workers that she had been supportive of contact with the birth parents.  </p>

Child C’s death was recorded at 11.54.  Although the mother accepts that the local authority was entitled to treat the views expressed by her over the telephone as indicative of consent it is accepted by the local authority that forward planning would have reduced stress and the sense that the process was rushed.  It is accepted that the social worker was notified by the hospital at 08.39 that the hospital was seeking consent to remove life support and that an hour passed before the mother was asked for her consent.  It is not asserted that this was a deliberate or callous delay, however it is accepted consent should have been sought more promptly. </p>

The need to plan goodbye visits was first mooted on 29 May 2019 . Ultimately Child C’s life support was withdrawn before her mother reached the hospital. This could and should have been avoided The local authority should have gained greater clarity from the hospital and offered greater clarity to the mother around the timing of the removal of life support and the possibilities available, if Child C’s clinical situation allowed for this, for the delay of such step until such time as all desired appropriate goodbye visits could be made. Whilst team manager Vicky Leader raised with Margaret Farley in a call at 11.22 whether it would be possible to delay the procedure, as mother was close to arriving at the hospital, Margaret Farley advised that she would struggle from a health perspective to do so, the team manager was not able to press the point. When the social worker had discussed consent with the mother at 09.34 it was clear that she wanted to say goodbye to Child C before she died. Chris Baird has acknowledged that “<span style="font-style:italic">the request to move to palliative care could have been delayed, to enable M more time to travel to Birmingham Children’s Hospital from Hereford</span>” and that any future protocol should require the local authority to work with the hospital to allow the parent time to attend unless the delay would cause the child to suffer unduly.  </p>

The record also indicated that the local authority did not propose any changes to the care plan at this time. The recommendations included the need for the social worker to update the child and family assessment and to review the suitability of permanency options including adoption (although the social worker had expressed the view that this may not necessarily be appropriate given the children’s links to their birth family).

The assessment included concern about loss of birth identity, concern that once SGO was made birth contact would not be promoted, that the SGO assessment would need to include work and support around family contact. </p>

MGM repeatedly stated that the foster carers had done an ‘amazing job’ and that the children had come into a loving family and that the foster carers had given the children stability. She added that the children need to have ‘the positives about their past remembered…to bring out good memories so that they can integrate them’ and she pointed out that no life story work had been done with the children about the time before they came into foster care. At the end of the meeting - which lasted about 100 minutes - there was a collaborative conversation which resulted in Mrs XX suggesting that, with regard to the life story work, she would be willing to meet with MGM in the presence of a third party such as the children's Guardian.

There was no deliberate ‘overstepping’ of fostering boundaries.  The foster-carers were new carers. Neither was imposed or encouraged by the foster-carers. Neither was stopped or discouraged by social workers or therapeutic professionals.  To the contrary, professionals endorsed promotion of the children’s wishes and the concept of ‘security’ and belonging.  In 2019, FSW Suzanne Musgrove noted that “<span style="font-style:italic">the fostering service had not supported [MRS XX] to understand the boundaries that need to remain intact so that she understood the fostering role</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.  </span>The delegated authority paperwork is unsatisfactory and does not seem to have been renewed until 2019, despite it being an action point in 2017 and 2018<span style="font-weight:bold">. </span></p>
