With apologies to Tolstoy, the Akhmedov family is one of the unhappiest ever to have appeared in my courtroom. Though this case concerns wealth of which most can only dream, it is - at its core - a straightforward case in which, following their divorce, a wife seeks to recover that which is owed to her from a husband and his proxies who, it is alleged, have done all they can to put monies beyond her reach. Nevertheless, it is a case not without legal and factual complexity though much of that stems from the details of dishonest schemes instigated by Farkhad Akhmedov and put into effect by his advisors and his eldest son, Temur Akhmedov.  </p>

This judgment will endeavour to provide a clear context for the claims brought by Tatiana Akhmedova [“the Wife”] against some of the Respondents, and will then analyse and determine those claims, having taken account of a mass of documentary and oral evidence. This judgment is necessarily lengthy as it concerns separate claims against three Respondents. At the conclusion of this judgment is a glossary which (a) identifies the principal actors, orders, and claims and (b) contains a list of every reported judgment in this case with a brief description. I have also appended a chronology for ease of reference. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">relief following their divorce on the Husband’s terms, there would be no assets left for her to enforce against. Their eldest son, Temur, confirmed in his oral evidence that the Husband would rather have seen the money burnt than for the Wife to receive a penny of it. Regrettably, those schemes were carried out with Temur’s knowledge and active assistance. I reject his case that he was a mere gobetween for his father: the evidence indicated otherwise. Temur told me in his evidence that he had helped his father protect his assets from his mother’s claims. He was, indeed, his father’s lieutenant. Temur has learned well from his father’s past conduct and has done and said all he could to prevent his mother receiving a penny of the matrimonial assets. He lied to this court on numerous occasions; breached court orders; and failed to provide full disclosure of his assets. I find that he is a dishonest individual who will do anything to assist his father, no doubt because he is utterly dependent on his father for financial support. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The transfers of very large sums of money to Temur in 2015 and 2016 were driven by the Husband’s overarching desire to keep his assets from the Wife. The transfer of $50 million in August 2015 took place only because there was an urgent need to move all Cotor’s available cash in circumstances where the transfer of Cotor’s entire portfolio of assets to Emirates NBD had to be put on hold due to market volatility. Temur understood his father’s purpose at the relevant times and worked with him to achieve the aim of preserving assets for the family by keeping them out of the Wife’s hands.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The transfer of funds to Borderedge was a necessary part of the scheme to strip everything from Cotor. The intention was to ensure that the funds which had been <span style="font-style:italic">“blocked”</span> as cash collateral for the UBS loans would never become available for enforcement of a judgment against Cotor. No one has been able suggest any other purpose for the transfer of that cash from Cotor to Borderedge in November 2016. The arrangements to transfer that cash were orchestrated by Kerman &amp; Co, on behalf of the Husband, and that firm provided the instructions to Borderedge’s nominee director. I reject Borderedge’s claim that it acted in good faith. </p>

I reject the legal arguments advanced by the Liechtenstein Trusts, most of which I had already rejected in my judgment handed down on 14 August 2020. An application by the Liechtenstein Trusts for permission to appeal my August 2020 decision was refused by the Court of Appeal on 27 November 2020. </p>

I reject Temur’s case that the Husband was engaged in some form of <span style="font-style:italic">“estate planning”</span>. Once the Wife commenced her claim against Temur in late 2019, Temur quickly arranged with his father to move ownership of the Moscow Property back to his father to frustrate his mother’s claim in these proceedings. </p>

Temur cannot claim confidentiality or privacy in documents which were provided to the Wife’s lawyers and which revealed serious wrongdoing by Temur and his father. Moreover, by my judgment handed down in November 2019, the Wife was expressly permitted to use those documents as if they had been disclosed in these proceedings. In any event, Temur has been unable to demonstrate that he has suffered loss.  </p>

This was because there had been large losses in the UBS portfolio on the day the transfer was due to take place consequential upon a Chinese stock market crash. As a result of market volatility, only US$50 million was available in Cotor’s portfolio at the time. The full amount of this US$50 million was transferred to Temur personally instead of being transferred into the UAE structures. That sum of money is the subject of one of the Wife’s claims, but it was noteworthy that the Husband had transferred all available cash in Cotor to Temur immediately after his plan to hide assets in the UAE had to be put on hold. </p>

Following that meeting, Mr Kerman recorded that <span style="font-style:italic">“Mirabaud appears to cater for just the kind of situation [the Husband] is in”</span>. The Husband and Temur were actively exploring the possibility of opening an account at Mirabaud. It was clear that Mirabaud was being asked to participate in the same schemes as previously outlined: for example, Mr Devlin explained that <span style="font-style:italic">“if the boat is charged to Mirabaud and Tatiana tries to enforce an English court judgment against it, Mirabaud would formally protest and say that they have a security interest in the boat, and that Tatiana could not therefore enforce her judgment against this asset”</span>. In so far as can be discerned from the contemporaneous documents, the Husband did not proceed with Mirabaud in 2015 because of its much higher fees.

As was common ground, it is effectively impossible to enforce English judgements in Liechtenstein if enforcement is opposed by the judgment debtor. This is because Liechtenstein is not a party to any enforcement convention with the UK and, by filing a disallowance claim, the judgment debtor therefore has a right to insist on re-litigating the underlying dispute on the merits before the Liechtenstein courts. </p>

The Wife recently obtained a file note from the Liechtenstein criminal files concerning a meeting between Mr Kerman (representing the Husband) and Dr Schurti and Dr Blasy held on 20 July 2016. This seems to have been the first meeting between them relating to the Husband’s assets. The topic was described as <span style="font-style:italic">“moving the [Bermudan Trust] to Liechtenstein”</span>. There was an emphasis on the need for <span style="font-style:italic">“asset protection”</span>, although, if the note is accurate, Mr Kerman made out that the Husband’s concern was <span style="font-style:italic">“former business partners and former opponents in litigation”</span> rather than the Wife’s pending financial remedies claims. </p>

The State Prosecutor opened judicial investigations before the Liechtenstein court. Since then, the investigation has been extended to the more serious offences of fraudulent bankruptcy contrary to paragraph 156 StGB, and money laundering contrary to paragraph 165 StGB, as well as extended to further suspects including Qubo 1, Dr Schurti and Dr Blasy. The Liechtenstein court has granted various protective measures, including asset freezes and document seizures. As regards Qubo 1, the Wife has been granted private party status pursuant to a judgment dated 21 February 2020, in which the Liechtenstein court concluded that the evidence revealed a suspicion of fraudulent bankruptcy and money laundering, leading to the Wife suffering damage from the non-fulfilment of her claims. Whilst the Liechtenstein State Prosecutor and the Liechtenstein courts (first instance, appellate and constitutional) have all concluded that there is a concrete suspicion that the Liechtenstein structures participated in the crimes of fraudulent bankruptcy and money laundering, the criminal investigation is ongoing, and no suspects have been charged to date. </p>

She contended that she was entitled to relief in respect of that transfer pursuant to s.423 IA because this transaction took place at an undervalue (because Temur did not pay anything for the shares and/or they were in any event worth significantly more than the alleged purchase price of RUB 50 million) and for the purpose of putting the value of the Moscow Property beyond her reach. </p>

However, in around May 2020, Temur transferred the Solyanka Servis shares to Sunningdale. He says this was done to compromise a claim against him, while the Wife says that it was a dissipation of assets designed to defeat her entitlements. The Solyanka Servis shares were subsequently transferred to the Husband in around June 2020.

The Wife was therefore entitled to relief against Borderedge because it was a subsequent transferee of part of the funds received by the Genus Trust, in circumstances where Borderedge was not a bona fide purchaser for value. Her alternative claim was that the transfer from Cotor to the Genus Trust and on to Borderedge was part of a single <span style="font-style:italic">“transaction”</span> falling within s.423 IA and/or s.37 MCA because it was part of a scheme to strip all the assets out of Cotor.  </p>

It contended that the Borderedge Transfer was made for good consideration pursuant to the terms of a loan agreement between the Genus Trust and Borderedge concluded in November 2016 and in consideration of Borderedge becoming party to a security arrangement with UBS Switzerland. Borderedge said that the transfer itself was in good faith and without notice of any intention to defeat the Wife’s entitlements. Borderedge also contended that it would be oppressive and unreasonable for the court to grant a remedy against it as it had changed its position since receiving the Borderedge Transfer. The Wife disputed these defences. </p>

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Inland Revenue Commissioners v Hashmi</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 981, the Court of Appeal held that, in order for a claimant to demonstrate that the debtor had the requisite statutory purpose of defrauding creditors as set out in s.423(3), it was not necessary to establish that such was his sole or dominant purpose and it was sufficient for the claimant to establish that such was a substantial purpose and, in this respect, two or more purposes may coexist (see [23]-[25] per Arden LJ). The description of the requisite purpose as a <span style="font-style:italic">“substantial”</span> purpose was not essential to the decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hashmi</span> and the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 116 at [8]-[16] held that the use of the word <span style="font-style:italic">“substantial”</span> introduced an additional requirement which made the test in s.423(3) stricter than Parliament had intended given that the word itself was not found in s.423. Thus, it was sufficient simply to ask whether the transaction was entered into by the debtor for the prohibited purpose. If it was, then the transaction fell within s. 423(3), even if it was also entered into for one or more other purposes.  As Leggatt LJ said in [14] of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Ablyazov</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“the test is no more complicated than that”</span>. </p>

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hashmi</span>, the judge found that a father had transferred his business to his son for the purpose of securing his son’s future. However, the father knew that he had been defrauding the Inland Revenue and that, should his dishonesty have been discovered, he would have become liable to pay a substantial sum to the Revenue. The judge concluded that, notwithstanding the father’s genuine desire to provide for his child, the prohibited purpose was the dominant one because the father could not be sure, given the risky way in which his tax affairs were conducted, that he would be able to provide for his son later on. </p>

Those matters may be relevant however to fashioning the relief to be granted. In that regard, the mental state of the respondent and the degree of their involvement in the scheme will be relevant factors (see <span style="text-decoration:underline">4Eng</span> at [13]). The reasons are obvious: if a recipient further dissipates assets as part of a joint scheme to put them beyond the reach of the judgment creditor, the recipient cannot rely on his own further wrongdoing to excuse him from having to restore the victim’s position; and, equally, if a person chooses to engage in risky ventures with assets which they know have been improperly transferred away by the debtor, they do so at their own risk and not at the victim’s risk. </p>

The  first limb of the s 423 purpose - putting assets beyond the  reach of a person who  is making or may at some time make a claim against him - has inherent in it the  assumption that following the transaction, the person does not have sufficient  funds remaining with him to satisfy the actual or potential claim made  against him. If a person or a  company has plenty of assets left with which to meet  the claim, then however many additional assets are gifted to people, he or it  cannot have the s 423 purpose. This must be inherent in the wording of section  423(3)(a) and is confirmed by the second limb which refers to action “otherwise  prejudicing the interests of” the claimant, implying that the transaction in the first  limb must prejudice those interests too.” </span>

The answer to this  point is that the judge had to do the best he could with the evidence available.  It is accepted that Mr Ghauri’s assets included Shadwell Road and the bank  accounts, but Mr Cadwallader says that the judge did not  take into account the  ongoing profit; that he clearly did so because he refers to the sums admitted in  respect of under-declared profits in the  period 1983 to 1989. On the liability  side, it is accepted that the tax liabilities were £86.000-odd at the date of the  declaration of trust, to  which there would have to be added penalties and interest,  although we are told that the amount of penalties is a discretionary matter.  Mr  Cadwallader argues that the judge should have taken into account the lease of the property. He accepts, however, that the lease may have been merged into the freehold after it was acquired and that the judge was entitled to  take that view. Certainly no rent was paid by Mr Ghauri after the date of the purchase. Mr Cadwallader also submits that the judge failed to take into account the value of the business. But the judge did take into account the prospect of future profits with, of course, their concomitant tax liabilities.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Gourgey QC submitted that the authorities made clear that s.423 is drafted in broad terms with a degree of inbuilt elasticity. In the words of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">BAT Industries plc v Sequana SA</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 112, section 423 is <span style="font-style:italic">“a wide-ranging provision designed to protect actual and potential creditors where a debtor takes steps falling within the section for the purpose of putting assets beyond their reach or otherwise prejudicing their interests”</span> (at [29]). Applying a hard-edged balance sheet test, as the Respondents proposed, would deprive that section of its flexibility, and create gaps in which the court would be powerless to remedy action which it had found was intended to prejudice the interests of creditors and where it had found that the victim was either prejudiced or capable of being prejudiced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">To illustrate his submission, Mr Gourgey QC gave the following examples. First, D (the debtor) has assets of £10 million and owes C (the creditor) £5 million. With the intention of prejudicing his creditors, D decides to transfer all his assets away. Thus, on Monday morning, D transfers £5 million to his wife and, on Monday afternoon, D transfers £5 million into an offshore trust. On the interpretation of s.423 contended for by Mr Levy QC, the court would be unable to set aside the transaction entered into on Monday morning because, even though D had the relevant purpose, he still had sufficient assets after that transfer. This would be the case, even if it were impossible to set aside the offshore trust under the governing law. Such a conclusion would be illogical and contrary to the purpose of the statute. Second, D holds £5 million in an English bank account and £5 million in a bank account in a foreign country where enforcement is impossible. To ensure that C, the creditor, cannot enforce its liability, D transfers £5 million from the English bank account into a discretionary trust. On the approach contended for by Mr Levy QC, that transfer would not be caught by s.423 even if D had the necessary subjective purpose, because D still held sufficient assets abroad after the transaction. Mr Gourgey QC submitted that this conclusion was illogical and contrary to the purpose of statute, as the transfer of monies into a discretionary trust was made with the prohibited subjective purpose and, therefore, should be capable of being set aside. </p>

The right approach in my judgment is  to apply the statutory wording. It is enough if the  transaction sought to be impugned was entered into with the requisite purpose. It  is entry into the transaction, not the transaction itself, which has to have the necessary purpose.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">In reliance on those passages, Mr Gourgey QC submitted that, first, there was no requirement to prove that the transaction had in effect prevented enforcement. That proposition was inconsistent with Mr Levy QC’s submission that it was necessary for the court to assess whether the transaction in fact left the debtor with insufficient assets to meet his liabilities. Second, the proper approach was simply to apply the words of the statute, by asking whether the debtor had the prohibited purpose when entering into the transaction. Third, contrary to Mr Levy QC’s submission, a debtor can subjectively have the prohibited purpose even if it were impossible for the transaction actually to achieve that purpose. Fourth, a person can have a prohibited purpose if, taking the relevant transaction with the happening of some other event, the creditor will be prejudiced. A debtor can therefore have the prohibited purpose in circumstances where he makes a transfer of some of his assets which does not, in and of itself, render him unable to pay his debts, but in the expectation that he will transfer his other assets subsequently, such that taken together, those steps will defeat his creditors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, Mr Gourgey QC submitted that Mr Levy QC’s argument was contrary to both the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hashmi</span> and the first instance decision of Rose J in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sequana</span>. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hashmi</span>, the challenge on appeal was a challenge to findings of fact and not a challenge on the law. There was no legal argument that there was a defence of law because the gateway posited by Mr Levy QC had not been satisfied. There was no basis for suggesting that Arden LJ was tacitly considering, let alone deciding, that there was some additional statutory precondition, namely that a claimant must prove that the debtor had insufficient assets following the transaction. The Court of Appeal was simply considering whether the factual case was supported by the evidence. Likewise, the relevant passage in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sequana</span> relied on by Mr Levy QC was taken from a section of the judgment in which Rose LJ was considering whether the s.423 purpose was satisfied. In [516], Rose LJ stated the following: </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“The Claimants rely on the very particular circumstances of this case. AWA  was a non-trading company and a wholly-owned subsidiary. Its only function  was a containment vehicle for the Fox River liability. There is clear evidence  that the purpose of the declaration of the May Dividend and the sale of AWA to  TMW clearly was to remove from Sequana the risk that the Maris Policy plus the  insurance proceeds might not be enough to meet the indemnity. Such evidence  of the subjective intention of those in control of the company when making the  decision to pay the dividend will distinguish this case from other cases where  directors declared dividends  for their shareholders for the usual reasons for which  dividends are paid, without turning their minds to whether this leaves enough  money for  potential creditors. Here there is no doubt that the subjective intention  of the directors at the time of the May Dividend and the sale was to prevent  AWA  having any legal or moral call upon its parent company to meet its creditors’  claims. After the declaration of the dividend and the sale to TMW, the creditors  were prejudiced because the assets of AWA had been depleted and it no longer had  any call on Sequana to that extent.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in">  In this passage, Rose J was recording the claimant’s argument about subjective  intention. It is in that context that [517] was stated. Paragraph 517 dealt with  subjective purpose and Rose J explained that if, a person had an intention to  move assets beyond their creditors but did not intend to prejudice them, that  person did not have the requisite intent for the  purpose of s.423 because it was  implicit within s.423 that the intention was to prejudice creditors. Mr Gourgey  QC submitted that all Rose J was emphasising was the necessity of having an  intention to prejudice  creditors or future creditors. Her words went no further  than that. </p>

Second, Mr Levy QC’s gateway condition would have the effect of prejudicing creditors’ interests in circumstances where the debtor’s purpose was entirely consistent with s.423(3). The examples given by Mr Gourgey QC illustrated that anomaly quite clearly.

It is the transferor’s state of mind which requires investigation by the court, not the consequence of his acts. In those circumstances, the court is necessarily thrown back on inference as it will be a rare case where the spouse declares his state of mind in advance. In determining whether a spouse has the requisite state of mind, the court may have regard to the natural consequences of his act. The natural consequence of the disposition would certainly be a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether or not to draw the inference of intention in any given case (1326E, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Kemmis</span>). Finally, it is clear that the intention of the transferor does not have to be his sole or dominant intention, but it is enough if it played a substantial part in his intentions as a whole (1331A, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Kemmis</span>). </p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the accounts. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person hearing accounts given by others.

Temur’s explanation that he communicated with Ms Sagadeeva and representatives of Sunningdale using the Signal and Telegram messaging services, such that communications were automatically deleted, did not account for the breach of my order to preserve documents. He could easily have disabled the option to delete messages automatically on those services. The inference was that he was either concealing communications relating to the Moscow Property or had chosen to communicate using a method intended to ensure that all evidence of his dealings was destroyed. </p>

First, he failed to comply with the order for production of his electronic devices. The devices allegedly sent from France in July 2020 mysteriously disappeared prior to reaching DHL’s warehouse and, in consequence, DHL initiated a police investigation in France. Second, he claimed to be unable to remember the password or recovery details for any of his four Google-hosted email accounts which he had been ordered to permit Aon to access. Aon is a company experienced in investigating and retrieving electronic data held on both devices and in cyber accounts and was appointed pursuant to the Forensic Examination Order. Aon’s efforts to access his accounts revealed that Temur had deleted an account in August 2020, that is, after the making of the Forensic Examination Order and at a time when he claimed to have been unable to access that account at all. Furthermore, he failed to disclose an email address, or the Apple account associated with that email address, both of which were associated with his iPhone XS.  </p>

No such statements were provided and, instead on 19 October 2020, Temur’s solicitors asserted that the bank account belonged to a cousin of the same name.

Further, there was no explanation as to why Temur’s cousin would be making a payment to a company in which Temur had an interest.

Though he sought to persuade me that his breaches were not intended to affect the fairness of the proceedings, I reject that explanation for his behaviour. He advanced concerns about invasion of his privacy to justify his behaviour but those made no sense. Had he given proper disclosure initially, he would have been searching his own devices rather than sharing them with anyone else. The Forensic Examination Order, to which he consented, contained careful safeguards (including those proposed by his own legal team), to ensure that no irrelevant, private information was disseminated. His claims that he was not informed about what was going on in the proceedings or the reasons for the orders made were utter nonsense given that he was assisted by very experienced solicitors and counsel at all relevant times. I regard the timing of his admissions - once the trial had begun and as he was about to give oral evidence - as entirely of a piece with his unscrupulous litigation conduct in the months before trial. </p>

The disclosure statement was signed by Temur rather than by a director of Borderedge: Temur’s own violation of his disclosure obligations did not inspire confidence in the contents of Borderedge’s disclosure statement. Additionally, I regard it as concerning that, on 6 November 2020, Borderedge’s professional director was unable to put its name to a statement confirming that proper searches had been performed. That disclosure statement was also unsatisfactory because it did not identify what searches for relevant material had been undertaken. No note, email or other communication with the director discussing the transaction, by which Borderedge received €27.5 million and took over the security granted by Cotor to UBS, was produced. It seemed to me simply incredible that a professional director would have entered into such a transaction without instructions from the shareholders and/or an explanation of the transaction. The only records produced by Borderedge were the formal transaction documents with UBS. </p>

By late on 30 November 2020, there remained problems in securing the mortgage funding and Temur’s solicitors felt unable to act for him.

I do not need to do so as, viewed from every angle, the court was faced with a deeply unattractive scenario for the impending trial. This was complex litigation where the stakes were high for all those involved. Temur would have to have been extremely well organised to represent himself and, on my reading of the papers, that discipline would not have come easily to him. Faced with a stellar legal team on behalf of the Wife, he would have floundered and disadvantaged his own case. I could also easily foresee the need for adjournment during the hearing to allow Temur more time to prepare, thereby prolonging the proceedings, increasing the financial costs of the proceedings, and disadvantaging the interests of the other parties. That struck me as wholly contrary to the interests of justice and I indicated to Mr Gourgey QC that a solution could be found by (a) varying the conditions in the 10 August 2020 order and (b) coupling that with a fresh order requiring disclosure from Temur by 9 am on 6 December 2020 as to those matters raised in correspondence on 1 December 2020. Additionally, I required Temur to return to this jurisdiction before any funds would be released to his solicitors. Following some time for discussion, this solution was agreed between the parties present in court and Temur’s former legal team. Temur confirmed to me that he was content with the court’s orders and confirmed he would return to the jurisdiction to attend the trial. I adjourned the Wife’s application with respect to the evidence of Ms Van Engelen to 7 December 2020 and gave Temur permission to withdraw the application to adjourn the proceedings made on 27 November 2020. Temur returned to the jurisdiction the following day and, by reason of the completed mortgage on his London flat, his previous legal team were able to continue to represent him at the trial.  </p>

I gave a separate ruling on that issue, admitting Ms van Engelen’s statement but prohibiting cross-examination about her involvement with - on Temur’s instructions - the concealment of Temur’s electronic devices from the court. Her statement contained material relevant to Temur’s disclosure obligations, but it was not necessary to cross-examine her about the electronic devices given that Temur had conceded her account about how those devices came to be <span style="font-style:italic">“lost”</span> en route from France to this jurisdiction was accurate.

The circumstances in which she found herself were acutely awkward as she had to give evidence against one of her own children in the glare of significant media interest. On one or two occasions, she struck me as being very close to tears, for example, when Mr Levy QC drew her attention to the fact that her other son, Edgar, (a) had had sight of an email from his father which made plain the Husband’s intention to withhold any of his money from her and (b) that Edgar had gone with the Husband and Temur to Qatar in 2015 in pursuit of the Husband’s scheme to evade compliance with an English court order in the divorce proceedings. She told me that this was the first time she had realised Edgar had had some involvement in the Husband’s schemes. Though the material to which she was referred by Mr Levy QC formed part of her disclosure, I did not think she had previously grasped the significance of that detail as far as Edgar was concerned.  </p>

I found her account that Temur had concealed the payment by the Husband of $8.975 million to Edgar to be both contrary to the contemporaneous evidence and unsupported by any evidence at all. However, I was not surprised that the Wife might have formed a very negative view of Temur’s behaviour from about 2015 onwards. Their relationship became strained in the aftermath of the breakdown of her relationship with the Husband when the Wife told me that they only discussed matters other than those relating to the Husband. Temur agreed in his evidence that his relationship with his mother became strained at about that time. By the time Temur gave a statement in the financial remedies proceedings supportive of the Husband in September 2016, the Wife had reason to be suspicious of his behaviour.   </p>

The message suggested that the Wife wanted Edgar to know that she did not want/would not take his flat and that she wanted Edgar to keep away from the litigation by taking as neutral a stance as possible. The message continued by saying that she knew Temur wanted to involve Edgar in his wrongdoing and wanted to convince Edgar that his mother would go after him as well. It ended by saying that it was a choice for Edgar but that <span style="font-style:italic">“most definitely on Temur’s example you can see it’s not going to get you anywhere good”</span>. The Wife told me that Edgar was under pressure to take sides in this litigation and she wrote this message to reassure him that she had no intention of bringing a claim against him because he had not engaged in wrongdoing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Much of Mr Levy QC’s cross-examination focussed on the Wife’s knowledge of Temur’s trading activities. She told me that she saw Temur using trading terminals after he moved into his flat in about July 2014 but assumed this was for the purpose of simulated trading in connection with his studies. Given the strained relationship between mother and son, I doubt that Temur told her he was trading significant sums of money gifted to him by his father and I also doubt that she enquired into the nature of Temur’s activities by asking him about them. I note there was no contemporaneous evidence that the Wife was told about the sums of money given to Temur by his father in early 2014 though she was copied into emails about the significant sums spent on Temur’s flat. She seems to have discovered later - in either 2014 or 2015 - that Temur was engaged in real time trading. The Wife always accepted that Temur had told her he suffered stock market losses in late 2015 for which she consoled him and she disclosed a WhatsApp message Temur had sent her telling her about his losses.  Her memory of what she was told in 2015 was poor but I am not persuaded that she only belatedly revealed she knew of the amount lost by Temur because she expected to be <span style="font-style:italic">“caught out”</span> when Temur delivered up his devices pursuant to the Forensic Examination Order. In fact, by the date her witness statement was signed in August 2020, Temur’s devices were said to have been <span style="font-style:italic">“lost”</span> by DHL and Aon was only going to be examining an image of a recent iPhone which Temur said had already been searched.  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic"> [45] The modification to which I have referred concerns the drawing of adverse inferences in claims for ancillary financial relief in matrimonial proceedings, which have some important distinctive features. There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband, especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a substantial inquisitorial element. The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. These considerations are not a license to engage in pure speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is.” </span>

His evidence about Cotor’s financial position in August 2015 would have been irrelevant to the payment Temur received on 25 August 2015 as he had been sacked the day before and, on Temur’s own case, he did not discuss a further investment by his father in his trading venture until late on 24/25 August 2015.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I have spent some time examining the contemporaneous documents dating from 2015. The picture with respect to Mr Henderson’s knowledge of the Husband’s intentions was more than a little unclear. Though he was copied into some of the email traffic, he was excluded from some of the important emails from Mr Kerman to Temur, such as that on 14 July 2015, which set out the latest iteration of the strategy to put the Husband’s assets out of the Wife’s reach (see paragraph 31(d) above). He was also not included in the distribution list for the email on 6 November 2014 when the scheme to move the Husband’s assets to the UAE to escape enforcement by the Wife was still at an embryonic stage. He only had access to the email sent on 9 June 2015 (see paragraph 31(b)) in which Mr Kerman spelled out the efforts to implement the strategy to Temur because the Husband forwarded it to him with a question mark. Noticeably he was not on the distribution list for an email from Mr Kerman to Temur on 10 June 2015 in which Mr Kerman sought to persuade Temur of the steps his father needed to take to protect his assets (the Husband having lost patience with the situation in Qatar). Mr Henderson only received a copy of that email later on 10 June 2015 because it was forwarded to him by a lawyer at Reed Smith <span style="font-style:italic">“to keep you in the loop”</span>. He was not sent an email on 22 June 2015 in which Mr Kerman answered the Husband’s questions about the UAE scheme in the context of the ongoing financial remedies proceedings. The overall impression I formed was that Mr Henderson was not privy to the strategic discussions about the Husband’s schemes but was trusted - as a money man - to implement the steps necessary on the ground with the relevant financial institutions in the UAE and elsewhere. For that he required some knowledge of what was intended, but he could not be said to know from moment to moment what was in the Husband’s mind during this period. The only person with a real handle on that was Temur.  </p>

However, [the Husband] has had the unfortunate experience of Gazprom simply failing to abide by a settlement, which, in the case in question, was concluded in 2005.

Though not binding on these respondents, Haddon-Cave J concluded in his April 2018 judgment, in relation to other transfers to Liechtenstein, that <span style="font-style:italic">“sufficient connection is established in this case by the fact that the transfers were deliberately effected to evade an English claim brought by the spouse of the transferor who was resident in England”</span>. The Trusts asserted that there was no connection to this jurisdiction because (a) Counselor and Sobaldo were not resident in England, (b) conducted no business in England, (c) none of their directors was resident in England, (d) the Monetary Assets were not in England and had never been in England, and (e) the transfer of the Monetary Assets took place outside England and between foreign corporations. The essence of their case was that sufficient connection needed to be demonstrated between the defendant and this jurisdiction before the court could consider whether to exercise its jurisdiction. In that regard they relied on <span style="text-decoration:underline">In re Paramount Airways Ltd</span> [1993] Ch. 223 at [239]-[240] per Sir Donald Nicholls VC and <span style="text-decoration:underline">AWH Fund v ZCM Asset</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Holding</span> [2019] UKPC 37 at [41] and [55].  </p>

The importance to be attached to these factors will vary from case to case. By taking into account and weighing these and any other relevant circumstances, the court will ensure that it does not seek to exercise oppressively or unreasonably the very wide jurisdiction conferred by the sections.” </span>

The test set out in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Paramount Airways</span> when applied to the circumstances of this case readily led to the conclusion that there was a sufficient connection between Counselor and Sobaldo and this jurisdiction. First, the facts demonstrated that the Trusts dealt with assets in the knowledge of pending proceedings in this jurisdiction. Second, the Trusts could not rely on the fact that they had no connection with England given that the transfer of assets to Liechtenstein was an inherent part of a wrongful scheme.

That applied in this case too. Third, the Trusts did not advance a plausible good faith defence. </p>

Fourth, the Trusts have not identified a single case where a court has declined to grant a money judgment because the respondent’s assets were located abroad. This is because there is no principle that an English court cannot adjudicate upon a liability, arising under English law, against a defendant over whom it has personal jurisdiction and who has submitted to the jurisdiction simply because that defendant’s assets are abroad. A money judgment does not in and of itself affect any asset. However, whether and how any particular asset can be seized to satisfy that liability only arises at a later stage. This trial was concerned the first and not the latter stage. </p>

The cases relied upon by the Trusts in [112] of their skeleton argument were misplaced. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Goyal v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Goyal (No 2)</span> [2016] 4 WLR 170 concerned a pension adjustment order, that is an order purporting to vary the terms of a foreign pension trust. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hamlin v Hamlin</span> [1986] Fam 11 was a case concerned with foreign real property and, therein, the proposition that, as a matter of discretion, the court will not make an order which depends for its effectiveness on recognition abroad, may well be relevant if the court was seeking to order the transfer of particular property located abroad. It had no application to a money judgment. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Goldstone v Goldstone</span> [2011] 1 FLR 1926, the court reminded itself to pause before exercising extra-territorial jurisdiction and then made an order where there was a clear prima facie case that the foreign party was an asset manager complicit with a husband whose financial affairs were before the court in financial remedy proceedings. </p>

At [13], the President (Sir James Munby) restated the long established principle that <span style="font-style:italic">“the starting point is that the courts expect and assume that their orders will be obeyed and will not normally refuse an injunction because of the respondent’s likely disobedience” </span>and that<span style="font-style:italic"> “the normal approach of the court when asked to grant an injunction is not to bandy words with the respondent if the respondent says it cannot be performed or will not be performed. The normal response of the court is to say: the order which should be made will be made and we will test on some future occasion, if the order which has been made is not complied with, whether it really is the case that it was impossible for the respondent to comply with it”</span>. He noted that there was a sound practical reason why the court should adopt that approach, as otherwise the court would simply be giving the potentially obdurate an opportunity to escape penalties for contempt by persuading the court not to make the order in the first place. I accept the submission made by Mr Willan that the court does not simply throw its hands up in the face of a determined <span style="font-style:italic">“asset protection”</span> strategy and accept that a fraud on its processes has been successful. Instead, it makes whatever orders it can and gives the applicant the best opportunity to try to enforce its judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">In any event, the order sought by the Wife would not be futile but would be extremely useful to her. First, an order from this court would entitle the Wife to a payment order in summary proceedings in Liechtenstein. The Trusts may file a disallowance claim, though that is not inevitable because the trustees will have to consider (a) the reasoning in this court’s judgment and (b) whether a Liechtenstein court would be likely to reach a different decision. By obtaining a payment order, the Wife would avoid paying a deposit of up to perhaps CHF 3 million. That would be a significant practical benefit, not least because the requirement to fund up to CHF 3 million for several years represents a severe hurdle to the Wife’s ability to litigate in Liechtenstein. Thus, a judgment, yielding a significant practical benefit, cannot be described as futile. As Arden LJ said in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Dadourian Group International Inc v Simms and others (Practice Note)</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 399, <span style="font-style:italic">“the court must be astute to see that there is a real prospect that something will be gained”</span> (at [35]).

Whilst that injunction might not be enforceable in Liechtenstein, it would be enforceable by committal in England. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Masri (No. 3)</span> [2009] QB 503, a respondent had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the English court but then sought to commence foreign proceedings to relitigate the merits to block enforcement of the resulting judgment. The Court of Appeal, whilst observing that caution was required before granting an injunction which involved an indirect interference with the foreign court, upheld the decision by the judge at first instance to grant the anti-suit injunction. The Court of Appeal held that this was a case in which the defendants were seeking to relitigate abroad the merits of a case which, after a long trial, they had lost in England. This was a classic case of vexation and oppression and of conduct designed to interfere with the process of the English court in litigation to which the defendants had submitted (at[94]-[95]). Those observations by the Court of Appeal may be thought to have some resonance in these proceedings. </p>

The Trusts are bound by that finding against which Moylan LJ refused permission to appeal. I note that, when previously giving guidance to the trustees, the Lichtenstein District Court made clear in November 2019 that its guidance was <span style="font-style:italic">“with the proviso that compliance with this by the trustees is accepted by the English court”</span>. It also made clear that, merely because an English judgment was not enforceable in Liechtenstein, it did not follow that it had no importance and could simply be ignored by the trustees. In my view, that guidance demonstrates that, in accordance with comity, the Liechtenstein court will consider this court’s judgements and orders. In accordance with the evidence of Dr Wenaweser set out in my August 2020 judgment, the Liechtenstein trustees may go back to the Liechtenstein District Court for new advice based on new facts if I order them to pay the Wife substantial sums. </p>

He  agreed with Mr  Willan that, if a director received a foreign judgment, what they had to do  was  to consider it and decide whether, as a prudent man of business, the sensible  course was to fight the judgment and relitigate the issues (taking into account  the prospects of success and the  risks to which they would expose the  establishment by not complying with the order), or whether to accept it and   pay it. Given that the Liechtenstein legal system did not recognise and  enforce foreign judgments, Dr Wenaweser noted that the prudent man of  business would consider whether the outcome of the litigation in Liechtenstein  would be the same if the matter was relitigated in that jurisdiction. If that were  the conclusion,  it would make no sense to force relitigation in Liechtenstein as  this would  incur unnecessary costs. The key issue was not whether the liability  was  enforceable in Liechtenstein but whether a prudent man of business would  pay, this being the question of judgment for the directors. The business  judgment rules undoubtedly applied to establishments according to Professor Dr  Brandstetter. Although Professor Dr Zollner told me that this rule would not  apply to a decision to transfer assets to the Wife because this was a matter of  law rather than judgment, I prefer the evidence of Professor Dr Brandstetter and  Dr Wenaweser on this issue given the former’s knowledge of the relevant criminal  law and the latter’s experience as a practising lawyer in Liechtenstein. </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In January 2017, the Wife sought to enforce the award against Cotor in Switzerland so far as the maintenance element was concerned. The Supreme Court in Switzerland in 2019 found that the financial remedies order was, in principle, enforceable, at least in part, under the Lugano Convention. It remitted some issues to the Zurich Court of Appeal for further determination. On 3 March </p>

It held that Cotor had not been properly served when it was joined to the English proceedings and was deprived of making its own representations to dispute the finding by Haddon-Cave J that it was the Husband’s alter ego. Because there had been no effective service of the proceedings on Cotor, the judgment against Cotor violated procedural <span style="font-style:italic">ordre public</span> and therefore could not be recognised under the Lugano Convention. I note that, under that Convention, the Wife could only ever have been entitled to enforce in Switzerland the maintenance part of the award (at most £224 million) rather than the property consequences of the divorce. I was told by Mr Willan that there was an ongoing appeal in relation to the decision by the Zurich Court of Appeal and so it was simply unknown whether the order would or would not be enforceable in Switzerland. </p>

Had that case been pleaded, it was submitted that the Wife would have put forward evidence of the other routes through which she could have enforced against the Monetary Assets in Cotor’s possession. The Trust’s Defence was lodged on 21 February 2020 and, notwithstanding the decision of the Swiss Court of Appeal in March 2020, the Trusts had chosen not to amend their defence to take the point in these proceedings. Leaving aside this pleading point, it seemed to me that the case advanced by Counselor and Sobaldo lacked merit for more substantive reasons. </p>

Second, it was not necessary for the court to restore the precise nature of the status quo ante before it could grant relief. Though s.423 directed the court to the purpose of the relief sought, the court has a very broad discretion as to remedy which must be fashioned by reference to the facts on the ground and subsequent developments with a view to achieving a just outcome consistent with the purpose of the Act. The very fact that s.425(1)(d) contains the power to order a direct payment to the creditor undermined the submission made by the Trusts that the literal restoration of the status quo ante was required before relief could be granted to the Wife.  </p>

After the transactions, Cotor had compromised its ability to pay and therefore was unable to pay, whatever its directors might subsequently have decided to do. Thus, the transaction was clearly capable of prejudicing a person if it converted the respondent from an entity at least capable of paying its liabilities to an empty shell which was hopelessly insolvent.

Mirabaud was willing to hold the Husband’s assets to put them beyond enforcement of an English judgment and was also willing to enter into charges over his other assets as part of the security scheme. In that context, Temur played a pivotal role in making arrangements with Mirabaud. Thus, together with Mr Kerman and Mr Devlin, he met with representatives of Mirabaud on 29 June 2015 apparently without his father being present. He was also one of four people on the small distribution list (the others being Mr Kerman, Mr Devlin and Mr Henderson) trusted to receive information relating to the Mirabaud scheme. Such information was regarded as being of <span style="font-style:italic">“the utmost confidence”</span> because <span style="font-style:italic">“disclosure could put the whole operation in jeopardy”</span>. Temur was trusted to represent his father’s interests without the emails even being copied to the Husband.

A further meeting took place with Mirabaud in or around December 2015 when Mr Devlin reported to Mirabaud that <span style="font-style:italic">“however our client’s (first) son [Temur] was sadly unable to attend our meeting as planned, meaning that the father would not make a final decision”</span>.

That statement made obvious that, despite his protestations, Temur knew that schemes were dishonest or at the very least that he acted in bad faith since there was no other reason why he would be providing false explanations for the transfers. </p>

The payments made were part of the Husband’s strategy of protecting his assets for the benefit of the family (excluding the Wife). The submission on Temur’s behalf that transferring assets to him made them more accessible to the Wife because Temur was resident in England did not reflect either the Husband’s or Temur’s thinking at the time. Both assumed that the Wife would not commence proceedings against her son, such that assets held by him were effectively safe from enforcement. Temur told me in his oral evidence that <span style="font-style:italic">“I did not ever conceive that my mother could start proceedings against me for money”</span>. Furthermore, in the context of the Moscow Property, Temur did consider that if assets were transferred to him, then his mother would not be able to take them because they would be in his name: <span style="font-style:italic">“… I still stick to the case that if my father wanted to put assets out of her reach, wouldn’t it have been much easier for me just to complete this purchase of Solyanka, have it under my name and my mother wouldn’t be able to take it”</span>.

Her case was that it was at least part of the Husband’s purpose to put the assets given to Temur beyond her reach. Pursuant to either s.423 IA or s.37 MCA, it was not necessary to show that the funds remained available to the Husband after their transfer to Temur. Had the assets remained under the Husband’s control after the transfer, there would be no need for a claim against Temur because he would hold the assets as a nominee for his father. However, a claim can be brought where a debtor transfers his assets to a child because he would rather that his child had the benefit of those assets than his creditor. In those circumstances, even though there may be a genuine desire to benefit the child, part of the purpose of the transfer was still to put the assets beyond the reach of the creditor.

If the Wife had accepted Temur’s position in respect of these payments, then she should logically and consistently accept his position in respect of other transfers. However, Mr Gourgey QC pointed out that the sums paid in July 2015 and December 2016 had not been claimed by the Wife because those sums were not obviously derived from the Monetary Assets held by Cotor and were made by the Husband from his personal bank account. The distinction between payments made from the Husband’s personal bank account with those made from Cotor’s account was an important one. Thus, I reject the submission made by Mr Levy QC that there was any inconsistency of approach by the Wife as to the sums claimed from Temur. In any event, the fact that she had not claimed particular sums said nothing about the validity of her claim in respect of other sums. </p>

The Husband and Temur had been making considerable efforts to be ready to transfer all the Husband’s assets (including the Monetary Assets, the Yacht and the Artwork) to the UAE in July and August 2015, spurred on by the settlement meeting with the Wife’s lawyers which was to be held at the end of July 2015. Temur told me in his oral evidence that he and his father were seeking to have arrangements in place by the time of the settlement meeting. They did not intend to implement those arrangements until after the meeting as there would be no need to transfer assets if a settlement had been reached. After the Husband failed to reach a settlement with the Wife at that meeting, Temur confirmed that the Husband decided to move his assets. Accordingly, on 17 August 2015, Temur gave instructions urgently to transfer all the Monetary Assets in Cotor to the UAE, telling the Husband’s lawyers: <span style="font-style:italic">“Father says to move all ASAP”</span>. He accepted in cross examination that, if that instruction had been executed, Cotor would have had a zero balance and that this was part of the plan to protect the assets from his mother as she did not want to settle with his father. On 24 August 2015, the transfer was stopped due to market volatility and the employment of Mr Henderson was terminated on this or the following day. The documents demonstrated, and Temur accepted, that Cotor had US$50 million of cash available and that there remained an urgent need to move that cash. On 25 August 2015, Cotor transferred US$50 million to Temur.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Temur’s case that he was also given additional money due to initial trading successes in early 2014/2015 was untrue. His tax returns showed that he had made substantial losses in the years ending April 2014 and April 2015. In an attempt to account for this inconsistency, Temur told me that he had asked his father to help him out because he had made some mistakes in his investments and his father had agreed to give him another chance. That case was the polar opposite of his pleaded case. Further, in his oral evidence, Temur claimed that he had a specific conversation on 24 August 2015 in which his father had said that his only intention was to provide sufficient capital for Temur to make investments. That alleged statement by the Husband was wholly inconsistent with the Husband’s other communications (telling his sons to preserve capital against a <span style="font-style:italic">“mam attack”</span>). It also struck me as unlikely that the Husband would be receptive to such a request from Temur when the Husband was having to deal with a market crisis and the collapse of his scheme to transfer his assets to Emirates NBD. The only plausible explanation was that the transfer of US$50 million to Temur was devised as a solution to provide protection for the available cash in Cotor’s portfolio. Such a transfer provided a degree of protection (a) because the money would no longer be in the name of the Husband or one of his companies and therefore liable to be frozen by the Wife and (b) because the Husband and Temur assumed that the Wife would not sue Temur even if she discovered the transfer. </p>

The fact that he had not told his mother of the transfer until the money had been lost supported the case that it was being concealed from her. The fact that the Wife did not take legal action against Temur at the time was neither here nor there. Whilst she may have had suspicions about Temur’s role from late 2014 and more concrete concerns after Temur filed a witness statement in the financial remedy proceedings in September 2016, the Wife did not know about his involvement in the Husband’s schemes (or of the existence of the Middle East schemes in 2015) until Mr Henderson provided information and documents to her and her lawyers much later. Any claim she might have brought based on Temur taking his father’s side in the divorce proceedings and his loss of US$50 million would have been bound to fail as it would have been impossible to prove the Husband’s purpose and Temur’s bad faith without evidence of the schemes being undertaken and of Temur’s role in them.  </p>

The fact that assets were transferred to Temur and then invested by him was consistent with that objective.

The Trusts also engaged in aggressive investment strategies with losses of just under £300 million being suffered since March 2018.

There was no credible explanation for that transfer other than that the Husband was seeking to move ownership of the Moscow Property from Sunningdale (that is, a Cypriot company, against which enforcement would have been comparatively straightforward) into Temur’s hands. That conclusion was reinforced by the fact that the transfer took place at a time when the Wife had obtained funding from Burford Capital and was taking active steps to enforce her judgment in foreign jurisdictions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">First, unsurprisingly given the deficiencies in his written evidence on this point, Temur could not provide a consistent or coherent explanation for how the transaction had occurred. Initially he claimed that the discussion with his father about the Moscow Property and the conclusion of the contract all happened during the Moscow World Cup. He explained that <span style="font-style:italic">“when I was there, the World Cup, he [the Husband] said he wanted it done and he told his representative, his PA, or whatever, he said just get it done, I want my son to have this stake…”</span>. When this was challenged, Temur changed his evidence and said that <span style="font-style:italic">“we talked about it before, but I was not so keen on it and that’s it”</span> before claiming that he had talked to his father about it at the end of 2017 on many occasions. When referred to his witness statement which asserted that, in or around March or April 2018, representatives from Sunningdale had approached him, Temur said that in March or April 2018 <span style="font-style:italic">“a lot of people with my father”,</span> whose names he did not remember but who were probably lawyers or directors, spoke to him to say, “I want you again to have this office”. The approach apparently took place in France. It struck me as wholly unlikely that a group of representatives sought to persuade Temur to acquire the Moscow Property. If the Husband had wanted Temur to take the property, he would simply have told him so. The evidence was also inconsistent with the impression given by his witness statement that his father had not been involved in the initial approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, Temur’s oral evidence was inconsistent with the evidence in his witness statement as to a formal negotiation process with Ms Abashkina commencing in early June 2018. Temur stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“this doesn’t work like … a commercial transaction … My father just simply gave his instructions, what he wanted to get done, and it happened, with whoever his lawyers were, or representatives, move together, he gave the order and things got done”</span>. When reminded about the reference to a formal negotiation process in his witness statement, Temur said <span style="font-style:italic">“… We weren’t talking commercial terms, do this, do that, due diligence, et cetera. It was as a family thing”</span>. He claimed that the discussions with his father </p>

In contrast to the formal negotiations described in his witness statement, Temur claimed that there was a lot of family planning involved. This evidence was at odds with his Response in which he claimed that he negotiated with Ms Abashkina with nobody else present. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, Temur was unable to provide a credible explanation as to why he was purchasing the Moscow Property at all. He explained it was effectively his father’s office, although he said it was largely unused and empty by 2018. When asked about what he would do with the Moscow Property after purchasing it, Temur suggested that he would go and sit at his desk and work on his computer, doing business and making money. It struck me as rather unlikely that he would do so in the middle of a large but essentially vacant office building. Initially he did not mention any intention to live in the Moscow Property. However, after being shown his Response stating that the plan was that he would live there, Temur suddenly claimed that the plan was to convert the Moscow Property into a residential dwelling.  I observe that there was no reliable evidence that the Moscow Property was capable of being lived in. Nor did Temur mention living there in his witness statement or prior to being shown his Response. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, Temur could not explain the purchase price of RUB 50 million. Initially, he claimed that it was a market price. Then he said that Ms Abashkina had come up with the price and he had agreed to it. On the following day, for the first time, Temur asserted that the purchase price was RUB 50 million because that was under the threshold of RUB 60 million which, at the time, would trigger a tax liability in Russia. I regard Temur’s evidence on the purchase price as wholly unreliable.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifth, Temur’s evidence about the reasons for non-payment was inconsistent. Having originally suggested that he failed to pay due to lack of funds, this explanation was abandoned by him. Instead, he advanced a claim that he had cold feet about the purchase. In his oral evidence Temur said his change of heart occurred in September 2018 which was well after the deadline for payment. Later in his oral evidence, Temur proffered the excuse that <span style="font-style:italic">“… this transaction had to be paid in Russia from a Russian bank account, which I had to open, and I didn’t have the correct visa and requirements, et cetera, to do this…”</span>. This excuse which made no sense given that the purchase price had to be paid to a Cypriot company was unsupported by any evidence and wholly inconsistent with his witness statement which was that he would have had the money to pay if he had wanted to go ahead. When trying to make sense of this evidence, it seemed to me that the reason he did not pay the purchase price for the Moscow Property was because it was never intended that he should do so. The purchase agreement was mere window dressing for a transfer between family members. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">I am fortified in the above conclusion because it became clear that Temur saw the Moscow Property as nothing more than a gift from his father. When pressed as to details of the transaction, he said <span style="font-style:italic">“It was simply as I mentioned, my father wanted to do some estate planning and put assets in Russia, his house, office, into his children’s hands, as he is getting to the age, which I think is normal, for a parent to think about their family, because we are not immortal”</span>. As Temur later conceded in his evidence, the purchase agreement was only concluded because Russian lawyers said this was required. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Standing back and looking at this transaction in the round, the transfer of the Moscow Property happened because the Husband said it should happen and his representatives then implemented those instructions. There were no negotiations, and the purchase agreement was concluded simply to satisfy the formalities of Russian law. A price was included to make it appear to be a sale but there was no intention that that price would ever be paid. I reject the reason advanced by Temur at the trial that the reason for this transfer was estate planning. If that had been the true explanation there would have been no need for him to have made up the series of unconvincing and inconsistent stories about this transaction. On the contrary, Temur could easily have explained the position and supported that case with evidence from the Russian lawyers involved. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">At one point during his oral evidence, Temur appeared to admit that the transfer of the shares from Sunningdale to him did put those shares out of the Wife’s reach: <span style="font-style:italic">“… I still stick to the case that if my father wanted to put assets out of her reach, wouldn’t it have been much easier for me just to complete this purchase of Solyanka, have it under my name and my mother wouldn’t be able to take it”</span>. I have concluded that, at least in part, the reason for the transfer was to put the Moscow Property beyond any potential enforcement action. By early 2018, the Wife had commenced enforcement proceedings in new jurisdictions in addition to those jurisdictions where enforcement was already ongoing. The Husband would have feared that Cyprus could well be next on the list and he therefore needed to remove the shares in Solyanka Servis from the existing structure based in Cyprus where they were obviously exposed to enforcement of the English judgment. The transfer of the Moscow Property to Temur made good sense since it enabled the family to retain the use and control of the Husband’s office whilst offering protection from enforcement since it was assumed that the Wife was very unlikely to commence proceedings against her son. As a result of the transfer, the Wife was prejudiced since she could no longer realise the value of the Moscow Property by enforcing against the shares in Sunningdale. The requirements of s.423 IA were satisfied. </p>

However, he did not sign any notarised agreement until after these proceedings had commenced in 2020. Temur claimed that he thought his written consent would be sufficient but that made little sense in the light of Sunningdale’s demand and his reply, and it would not explain why Sunningdale - represented by a lawyer who would certainly have known the correct position in law - did nothing to follow up on its purported threat to commence proceedings. When asked about this in his oral evidence, Temur was wholly unable to provide a coherent explanation for why he did not execute the termination agreement. He gave a variety of excuses such as claiming to not have a Russian visa (though he had previously given evidence that he did have a tourist visa which would have allowed him to travel to Russia) and stating that he did not want to travel to Russia at that time. Further, if Sunningdale had really threatened to commence proceedings unless Temur executed the termination agreement by 31 December 2018, it seems likely that there would have been some communications during 2019 chasing him to do what he had promised.

The Termination Agreement falsely recorded that the shares were not the subject of a dispute. Temur failed to provide any disclosure relating to the negotiation or execution of the Termination Agreement or indeed a copy of the Termination Agreement itself. He did not inform this court or the Wife of his intention to enter into an agreement to transfer the very shares which were the subject matter of the present claim before it occurred. There was no mention of the Termination Agreement in his Response to the Wife’s Request for Further Information in July 2020.

On any view, that letter was an extraordinarily misleading document. By that time, the Termination Agreement had been executed; the shares had already been transferred to Sunningdale; and Sunningdale had agreed to withdraw the Termination Claim.

Temur’s dealings with the Moscow Property were deliberately concealed from this court and I infer that this was done to defeat the Wife’s claim and to minimise her opportunity to prevent him divesting himself of the ownership of the Moscow Property.

S. 423 is engaged because the Husband, as a person, arranged the transfer of Sunningdale’s shares in Solyanka Servis, which is a transaction for the prohibited purpose. This reading of s.423 is plainly correct because, otherwise the protective purpose of the statute could easily be sidestepped by a sophisticated debtor simply causing companies he owned to transfer their assets away. </p>

She did precisely that, but she was too late because the Husband and Temur had already managed to move the assets again. By causing Sunningdale to divest itself of its interest in Solyanka Servis, and therefore rendering his interest in Sunningdale worthless, the Husband intentionally prejudiced the Wife’s ability to enforce her judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The transfer of the shares to Temur was at an undervalue, either for no consideration or for far less than the value of the property. The Husband’s purpose was a prohibited purpose because the transfers took place at a time when the Wife was actively engaged in seeking to enforce against foreign assets with the benefit of funding which Burford Capital had agreed to provide in January 2018. The ownership of Solyanka Servis and the Moscow Property was held through a relatively vulnerable structure because Sunningdale was a Cypriot company. Haddon-Cave J had ordered the return of the shares in Sunningdale to the Husband and the Wife could enforce that order in Cyprus. The vulnerability of Sunningdale’s assets was demonstrated by the fact that the Wife was able to obtain a charging order over Sunningdale and the appointment of a receiver over its assets in 2020. In that context and given the Husband’s concerted effort to ensure that his assets were kept beyond the reach of the Wife’s enforcement, it was overwhelmingly likely that his purpose in moving assets out of Sunningdale was at least in part, to put them into safer hands (Temur’s). The fact that Temur was not a judgment debtor did not assist as it is likely that the Husband thought that the Wife would not bring proceedings against her son. </p>

His inability to pay did not affect the validity of the 2018 Agreement or his ownership of those shares. He became the sole owner of the shares in Solyanka Servis, worth in excess of RUB 500 million, subject only to his liability to pay RUB 50 million.

UBS Monaco satisfied the loan by calling on the guarantee from UBS Switzerland, which in turn appropriated €17,280,673 from the cash collateral held in Borderedge’s bank account. Borderedge admitted that this entitled it to claim the sum of €17,280,673 from SCI VLC which now holds unencumbered title to Villa Le Cottage. Borderedge still remains subject to its undertaking to UBS Switzerland for a sum of €6.7 million to secure repayment of the VPP Mortgage by SCI VPP and Borderedge’s assets are pledged to UBS accordingly. </p>

Where there were multiple steps in a series of linked dealings, the identification of the relevant <span style="font-style:italic">“transaction”</span> would turn on the facts of each case and the court must look at the transaction as a whole. In this case, the fact that the money was transferred through the medium of the Genus Trust did not mean that the transaction by which Cotor transferred €27.5 million (and the associated undertaking to UBS Switzerland) to Borderedge was not a single transaction. The two transfers - from Cotor to the Genus Trust and from the Genus Trust to Borderedge - were separately connected as part of a preordained plan. It was obvious that UBS Switzerland would not have released the cash (and transferred Cotor’s undertaking) without Borderedge receiving the equivalent cash (and agreeing to accept the transfer of Cotor’s undertaking). The clear understanding of everyone involved was that the cash and undertakings would be transferred from Cotor to Borderedge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">If this analysis was correct, then Cotor entered into a transaction with Borderedge and, further, this transaction was at an undervalue for the purpose of s.423(1)(c) IA. Thus, Cotor gave Borderedge €27.5 million in cash and in return, Borderedge took over and secured Cotor’s release from the undertakings given to UBS Switzerland in respect of the VLC and VPP Mortgages. However, this was not worth anything like €27.5 million for the following reasons. First, Cotor only had a contingent liability to UBS Switzerland. The undertakings functioned as a security which might never be called upon. However, by transferring the cash to Borderedge, Cotor guaranteed that it lost €27.5 million. Second, even if the undertakings had been called upon and Cotor had paid some of the €27.5 million to UBS Switzerland, Cotor would have gained claims of equivalent value against SCI VLC and/or SCI VPP, both property owning companies which would have been able to satisfy those claims. Therefore, even if UBS Switzerland had called upon its security, Cotor would have been able to recover the equivalent sums from SCI VLC and/or SCI VPP and would not have suffered any diminution in the value of its assets. Instead, by transferring the €27.5 million to Borderedge, Cotor reduced its assets by €27.5 million. Third, and in any event, the amount transferred by Cotor exceeded even the maximum theoretically possible liability under the undertakings to UBS Switzerland (€19.135 million and €6.7 million, that is a total of €25.835 million) such that Borderedge was guaranteed to be worse off from a cash perspective by at least €1.6 million. </p>

There was no reason to move money from Cotor to Borderedge other than to complete the asset stripping of Cotor. The transfer also took place at precisely the same time when all the other Monetary Assets were being removed from Cotor. </p>

A WhatsApp message from Temur to Ms van Engelen on 7 September 2020 and attachment showed that this document was only signed in September 2020.

The fact that the money remained in Switzerland missed the point that the money remained there but under different ownership in circumstances (a) where the Wife had no preexisting claim against Borderedge; (b) where Borderedge was not obviously the Husband’s nominee or alter ego; and (c) where the Wife would not know that Borderedge had received part of the Monetary Assets.

Ms Hitchens suggested that the circumstances set out in paragraph 342 above in which there would be an asset amenable to enforcement by the Wife were hypothetical.

In my view, the Wife was certainly capable of being prejudiced by the Husband’s actions in transferring the Monetary Assets to other entities, whether in Liechtenstein or elsewhere. Further, the Mortgages would not have continued forever - the 2014 loan to SCI VLC was granted until June 2019 with a maximum possible extension of five years - so their discharge would have rendered the cash then available to Cotor an unencumbered asset over which the Wife could have enforced. Finally, the 2017 default on the VLC Mortgage meant that Borderedge rather than Cotor had a claim against SCI VLC (which was liable to Borderedge for the amount deducted by UBS Switzerland in satisfaction of its first demand guarantee). Borderedge had admitted the existence of that claim. Thus, were it not for the Borderedge Transfer, the Wife could have attacked Cotor’s claim against SCI VLC to enforce her judgment. </p>

Following the transfer and with full knowledge, it chose to enter into an apparent loan agreement with the Genus Trust. I find it cannot rely on its own act with that knowledge to give it a basis for saying there should be no grant of relief. In any event, it appears that Borderedge is better off as a result of the Transfer because there is more money sitting in its account after the first guarantee had been called upon than the amount of the guarantee liability. </p>

I cannot see how that was relevant in this context. If the Transfer had not occurred, Cotor would have remained in place as the guarantor. If the mortgage had been called upon and Cotor had lost €25 million, the Wife would be able to enforce against the balance and then to stand in Cotor’s shoes to enforce against the owners of the French properties. </p>

The remainder of the monies in Borderedge’s account were pledged and were not available to satisfy any claim and it would be unfair and inequitable to order that these monies should be returned to the Wife. However, the reality was that Borderedge has not lost out because, having paid up under the guarantee, it had an entitlement to an indemnity from the SCI companies and that could be enforced against them and against the properties they owned. This was admitted by Borderedge in its Defence. I note that Borderedge holds nearly €10 million in cash as well as having a claim against SCI VLC worth €17.4 million and that its contingent liability to UBS Switzerland is for no more than €6.7 million. The figures speak for themselves. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">I put the counterclaim in context as follows. First, the Wife identified that there were only six documents concerning non-public information relating to Temur’s own personal, financial, or business affairs in the “Reviewable Documents” provided by Mr Henderson. No further documents disclosed by the Wife have been identified by Temur as containing similar non-public information. One document was a Declaration of Trust dated 25 January 2013 relating to Temur’s London flat. The Wife knew that Temur was the beneficial owner of his flat and the legal ownership of the flat is a matter of public record on the Land Register so this document would not have told her anything which she did not already know. In any event Temur would have been required to disclose it to the Wife pursuant to the Part 71 Order in these proceedings. Three documents related to the incorporation of STE Capital and it is a matter of public record that Temur is the founder of STE Capital. He would also have been required to disclose documents demonstrating his ownership of STE Capital under the Part 71 Order in these proceedings. Two documents (one bank statement and one payment instruction) evidenced payments of US$7.5 million and US$50 million from Cotor to Temur. These were documents which Temur would have been required to disclose in these proceedings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the Wife did not receive or review those documents herself but instead they were provided to her lawyers. The documents were not used in proceedings until this court’s permission had been obtained in November 2019. The use of the Reviewable Documents was permitted to the Wife as if they had been disclosed to her by the Husband in these proceedings. Temur did not apply to set aside or vary that order. It was thus difficult to see how Temur could have suffered any loss (before the court’s approval was given) or could obtain any relief (for example, to prevent the Wife using documents which she was expressly entitled to use under a court order). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, Temur sought an order precluding the Wife from relying on such documents with respect to the present proceedings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to the substance of the Counterclaim, the Wife did not dispute that the six documents were, in principle, of both a confidential and private nature. However, both confidence and privacy are subject to exceptions. I analysed the law with respect to confidence in paragraphs 20-23 of my judgment in this case under neutral citation [2019] EWHC 3140 (Fam). In summary, there is a defence where the material discloses iniquity or misconduct such that disclosure is in the public interest; and/or ordinary equitable principles apply, such that a lack of <span style="font-style:italic">“clean hands”</span> may prevent a person from obtaining relief in equity. As to privacy, the English tort of privacy derives from Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 8(2) expressly recognises that the right to a private life is subject to an exception for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Wife has rights pursuant to Article 6 to pursue civil proceedings and to enforce her judgment and Article 1 Protocol 1 (to the protection of her property, which includes a judgment debt). A balancing exercise between the competing rights is required, the outcome of which is determined principally by considerations of proportionality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">The circumstances of this case demonstrated that the Wife has been the victim of an elaborate and contumacious campaign to evade and frustrate the enforcement of the judgment debt and thus, in my view, the exceptions as to confidence and privacy are engaged. The information provided by Mr Henderson was intended to assist in unravelling that campaign. Some documents relating to Temur were included precisely because he has been a knowing participant in, and recipient of some of the proceeds of, that dishonest campaign. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">The disclosure by Mr Henderson was part of a collection of documents revealing iniquity and misconduct such that disclosure was in the public interest to assist the Wife to unravel the Husband’s schemes and enforce her judgment. Temur was directly involved in his father’s schemes and so cannot properly expect the assistance of the court to keep documents secret from the Wife which may reveal his involvement and/or personal benefit. The Wife’s legitimate interest in using this material plainly outweighed Temur’s rights to privacy. Accordingly, he had no claim against the Wife through her lawyers receiving and using those documents up to the point when the court granted its order on 4 November 2019. </p>
