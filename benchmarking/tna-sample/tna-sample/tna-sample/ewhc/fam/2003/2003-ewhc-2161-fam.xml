In her case, however, because three of the embryos created from the gametes provided by herself and Mr. Hadley had, on a previous occasion, been unsuccessfully transferred into her (and thus used), it was argued that the remaining two embryos in storage had also been used. Accordingly, since paragraph 4(2)(a) of Schedule 3 to the Act prevents any withdrawal of consent to treatment once an embryo has been used in providing treatment services, it was argued that Mr. Hadley was prevented by the Act from withdrawing his consent. The argument was initially limited to Mrs. Hadley’s case, but in their closing submissions Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn sought to include Ms Evans within it. I will deal with the argument under the heading <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Second Point of Law</span> in paragraphs 150 to 165 below. </p>

Both have withdrawn their consent to the continued storage of the embryos, and both wish the embryos to be allowed to perish. Both say, quite simply, that the Act gives them (and the claimants) an unequivocal and unconditional right to withdraw their consent to treatment and to continued storage of the embryos up until the moment the embryo is used. The stored embryos, they say, have not been “used”, since in the context of this case, “use” means the transfer of the embryo into a woman.  In so far as Convention Rights under HRA 1998 are concerned, both men say they are either not engaged, or, if engaged, are not breached. Article 8 in particular, they say, gives each of the four adults the right to respect for their private lives, and the State’s “interference” under Article 8(2) with those rights, by allowing them to withdraw their consent and thus prevent the transfer of the embryos into the claimants is, they say, necessary to prevent a breach of their Article 8 rights, and thus both justified and proportionate.  </p>

I was particularly impressed by the evidence of Dr. Nicholas Sharp, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist specialising in reproductive medicine at the Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust, who was responsible for Ms Evans’ treatment; and by the evidence of Dr. Gillian Lockwood, obstetrician / gynaecologist at the clinic attended by Mrs. Hadley. I also heard from Mrs. Pamela Spearman, a fertility sister at Ms Evans’ clinic, and from Ms Susan Lowbridge, a fertility nursing sister at the clinic attended by Mrs. Hadley. I was generally impressed by the overall quality of the care which each of the claimants had received; and it was in my judgment quite appropriate in each case for Mr. Tolson to preface his cross-examination of the clinics’ witnesses by stressing how grateful each of the claimants was for the treatment they had received. </p>

The merits of this solution are not a matter for the House in its judicial capacity.

But that is not to say that attention should be confined and a literal interpretation given to the particular provisions which give rise to difficulty. Such an approach not only encourages immense prolixity in drafting, since the draftsman will feel obliged to provide expressly for every contingency which may possibly arise. It may also (under the banner of loyalty to the will of Parliament) lead to the frustration of that will, because undue concentration on the minutiae of the enactment may lead the court to neglect the purpose which Parliament intended to achieve when it enacted the statute. Every statute other than a pure consolidating statute is, after all, enacted to make some change, or address some problem, or remove some blemish, or effect some improvement in the national life. The court’s task, within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. So the controversial provisions should be read in the context of the statute as a whole, and the statute as a whole should be read in the historical context of the situation which led to its enactment.</p>

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it.”</span>

At that point, she and her husband had been trying to achieve a pregnancy for two years without success. Ms Evans had an irregular menstrual cycle with borderline serum progesterone suggestive of defective ovulation.  She was prescribed Clomid, a drug used to stimulate ovulation. </p>

According to his statement in the proceedings, he suggested IVF treatment to Ms Evans and her then husband on 2 July 1997. This did not occur due to the subsequent breakdown of her marriage, and the clinic did not see Ms Evans again until 12 July 2000, when she attended with Mr. Johnston.  However, I accept Ms Evans’ evidence that she had always wanted to conceive a child, and was bitterly disappointed when all her attempts at doing so failed.</p>

She did not, however, become pregnant. In April 2001 she had a hysterosalpingogram, an examination of the uterus and fallopian tubes, which demonstrated that both fallopian tubes were clear. She was, however, recommended for a laparoscopy, which took place on 13 September 2001.  That examination gave rise to concern over the condition of her ovaries, and on 27 September 2001, she underwent a laparatomy, or surgical incision into the peritoneal cavity. The findings were, in summary, of serious borderline tumours present in both ovaries. </p>

The contents of the consent forms were explained to us. Indeed, we were taken through the consent forms on a paragraph by paragraph basis. It was obviously made clear to us that the consent of both myself and (Ms Evans) would be required before anything could be done. It was also explained to us that the continued storage of the embryos would be considered on an annual basis so as to ensure that both myself and (Ms Evans) wanted the storage to continue. In addition, it was clear that upon the termination of our relationship the storage and use of the embryos would need to be reviewed. It was therefore clear that we would still maintain freedom to choose either whether we wanted to start a family together or when we would start a family together. I suppose I was reassured by the fact that I would still maintain the same control regarding this decision as I would had these unfortunate events not occurred. Having said that, I would estimate that the entire consultation lasted approximately 90 minutes. This was from the diagnosis being given to (Ms Evans) and us embarking on a course of IVF treatment. As outlined above, the circumstances were far from ideal. (Ms Evans) and I certainly had no opportunity to discuss matters in details privately. In fact, the only time we had time to discuss matters alone was when we talked in whispers for about 60 seconds whilst staff went to obtain an IVF kit.</p>

Certainly, I did not enter into any form of legally binding agreement with (Ms Evans). I would have only provided (Ms Evans) with assurances, the nature of which are frequently given on a daily basis in any relationship. As far as I am concerned, both myself and (Ms Evans) were fully aware of the basis upon which the embryos would be stored and used, namely in accordance with the consent forms which were fully explained to us, and which were signed by both of us. </p>

Had such a query arisen regarding treatment, I would have referred the couple back to Mr. Sharp and the wider team for further discussion and consultation. This is because if oocyte freezing had been raised, it would have suggested to me that there was some doubt about them seeking treatment as a couple.

Ms Evans accepted that Mr. Johnston was not telling her in terms that she could always use the embryos but seeking to reassure her that they were not going to split up. Equally, when Mrs. Spearman gave evidence, the slightly defensive dogmatism of her statements softened. She was clear that there had not been a discussion with her about freezing eggs, but she accepted that it had quite possibly arisen as a question which was not followed up. She would have told Ms Evans that it was something the clinic did not do, and that Ms Evans would have to discuss it with Mr. Sharp.</p>

However, he regarded single person egg freezing as very much in its infancy and far removed from standard medical practice. The Clinic did not have a licence for it, and as far as he was aware, there were no reported pregnancies in the UK resulting from it.</p>

It had been a very emotional meeting He had not given an unequivocal assurance about the embryos, but he had done his best to be supportive. In a skilful cross-examination by Mr. Robin Tolson QC for Ms Evans he said that he was very much in love with Ms Evans. It had not crossed his mind that they might want to go their separate ways, although he knew the relationship would have ended if he had told her that he was not going to give her the child she so desperately wanted. He could not remember what he had said but he accepted that she had said words to the effect of  “what if we split up” and that he had replied “we are not going to split up”. He saw no reason at that point why they should.</p>

Despite errors in her initial statement (notably, of course, the date of the conversation) and despite the fact that – as Dr. Stern for the Clinics pointed out – Ms Evans was at points unable to recall important aspects of her treatment  - I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that during the session with Mrs. Spearman Ms Evans did raise, as a general enquiry, the possibility of freezing her eggs as opposed to freezing fertilised embryos. I am satisfied that Mrs. Spearman told her simply and shortly that this was something which the Clinic did not do. I also find, on the balance of probabilities,that she added that if Ms Evans wished to pursue this aspect, she would have to go back to Mr Sharp.  </p>

On 16 October 2001 Ms Evans and Mr. Johnston signed the “Welfare of the Child: Consent to Release of Information about Me” form consenting to their general practitioner, Dr. Slack, providing information about them to the Clinic. They declared that they had read and understood the contents of the Authority’s leaflet on the Welfare of the Child. On 17 October 2001 Dr. Slack completed the welfare of the child information and declaration for GPs declaring that she knew of no reason why treatment should not proceed.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">From the evidence both Ms Evans and Mr. Johnston gave, it was plainly a tense and difficult time. On the morning of 12 November 2001, the day they were to attend the clinic together for Ms Evans’ eggs to be harvested and fertilised, there was an argument between them. Ms Evans says Mr. Johnston told her he was not going through with the treatment. Mr. Johnston says that Ms Evans initially refused to have her last injection, and told him that the whole thing was a waste of time, although she changed her mind shortly afterwards.  </p>

On this point, however, having heard both of them, I accept Mr. Johnston’s version of this argument. I do not think for a moment that Ms Evans meant it when she said that the whole thing was a waste of time. It is, however, an indication of the tension under which both she and Mr. Johnston were operating, and may have some relevance in relation to the issue of estoppel.   </p>

Eleven eggs were harvested and fertilised. From these, six embryos were created and on the following day these were duly placed in storage by the clinic. On 26 November 2001, Ms Evans underwent a successful bilateral oophorectomy for high-grade multiple tumours of borderline malignant potential. The positive news is that, although Ms Evans cannot now conceive a child spontaneously, the latest ultrasound scans were normal, and she has been given the “all clear”. Since the cancer did not spread to her uterus, it is the opinion of Professor Ledger, the independent expert brought in to advise pursuant to the order of the President of 19 September 2002 that Ms Evans should be able to carry a pregnancy normally, although if she is unable to use the six frozen embryos fertilised on 12 November 2001, there is no prospect of her bearing a child which is genetically hers.</p>

However, on 27 May 2002 the relationship between Ms. Evans and Mr. Johnston came to an end.  The causes of the breakdown of the relationship are irrelevant for my purposes.  </p>

Mr. Johnson denies that any such agreement was reached. The furthest it went, he said, was her suggestion that she should set up a meeting with a solicitor to enable an agreement to be discussed and drawn up. He accepts that he agreed to attend such a meeting to discuss the possibilities, but Ms Evans did not arrange it. She agreed that this was the case, and attributed her failure to progress the matter by the serious emotional effect which the breakdown of the relationship had on her.</p>

The clinic then advised Ms Evans that Mr. Johnston had withdrawn his consent to their further storage. On 11 September 2002 Ms Evans instituted proceedings, and at a directions hearing before the President on 19 September 2002 the clinic undertook not to make any arrangements for the embryos to perish or be otherwise altered or destroyed until agreement between the parties or the final determination of these proceedings. </p>

Ms. Evans does not seek to say – nor could she – that the consents she signed were invalid or that she did not know what she was signing.  </p>

For example, I have already accepted Ms Evans’ and Mr. Johnston’s evidence that they were not sent an information pack prior to 10 October 2001. Mr. Sharp agreed that this sometimes happened. Mrs. Spearman should not have been so unequivocal about it. </p>

In the intervening period, there were discussions between them about Mrs. Hadley being able to have the remaining embryos transferred into her on the basis that a resulting pregnancy would have no financial or other consequences for Mr. Hadley. Mrs. Hadley’s case is that Mr. Hadley agreed to this. Mr. Hadley denies it.  Mrs. Hadley then suggests that Mr. Hadley agreed she could use the embryos provided that Mr. Hadley was registered as a semen donor and thus avoided financial responsibility for any subsequently born child.  Mr. Hadley’s case is that the agreement between them was that the embryos should be allowed to perish at the end of the storage period (five years in their case).</p>

Mrs. Hadley says that she was very unhappy about the prospect of having to sit down with Mr. Hadley’s new partner, who was pregnant by him, to ask for her permission to use the embryos.

By this time his new partner had given birth to their child. The clinic then contacted Mrs. Hadley to tell her that it had no alternative but to allow the embryos to perish at the end of the five year period. However, in August 2002 Mrs. Hadley read about Ms Evans’ case in the newspaper. She contacted the newspaper, which ran a story about her on its front page. Mr. Hadley’s reaction, she says, was to contact the clinic and to inform them in writing that he wished the embryos destroyed. After taking legal advice, Mrs. Hadley instituted proceedings on 11 September 2002. Similar directions were given in her case as in the case of Ms Evans and Mr. Johnston. </p>

His version that there was no sex after 1989, possibly not even a meeting in 1990, and then an agreement merely as a casual favour to give sperm in the summer of 1991, makes no sense at all and I reject it. I do not find he donated as though he was an anonymous donor doing a favour which could have no repercussions for him. On the contrary, he was playing his essential role in aiding the applicant to achieve what both had been trying for, namely a pregnancy.</p>

The facts are unusual. The couple had undergone IVF treatment, unsuccessfully, in England. The man’s sperm was weak. They went to Rome, where a particular doctor had developed a particular technique for implanting embryos into the uterus with a laser. The couple wanted to use the man’s sperm, but when it came to the point of insertion, the doctor told them that he had fertilised 12 of the woman’s eggs but that only one of them had been fertilised with the man’s sperm. The couple were told that the chances of the single embryo developing successfully if implanted on its own were negligible. The couple asked for time to reflect overnight, and on the following morning agreed that the treatment should proceed using six of the embryos, one of which, of course, was from the man.  The man signed a form acknowledging paternity of the unborn child. Insertion then occurred. </p>

Thus the embryos cannot be used to treat either woman within the terms of the original consents, regardless of whether such consents have been or can be varied or withdrawn. Effective consent must mean consent effective at the point at which the embryos are transferred into Ms. Evans and Mrs. Hadley.

As an ongoing series of events over time, treatment together must be something which can change and, in particular, come to an end in different ways.  Thus, I have no doubt that on 22 September 1999, when three fertilised embryos were placed in Mrs. Hadley, that constituted treatment together within the terms of Mr. Hadley’s consent. They were together as a couple and were so treated. Even if they had separated after the transfer of the embryos into Mrs. Hadley and before the birth of the child.

It equally gives too little weight to the fact that treatment designed to enable a woman to give birth to a child can only be provided in accordance with the strict terms of a clinic’s licence, and requires the clinic to take account of the welfare of the unborn child.  The need for the clinic to have an effective, continuing consent of both gamete providers pursuant to paragraph 6(3) of Schedule 3 at all times up to the transfer of the embryo into the woman is thus critical. It is not a matter of the clinic being protected by a bright line, non-fact sensitive approach. Without effective consents, the clinic cannot lawfully use the embryos. </p>

Dr. Lockwood told me that what was required was, as she put it,  “the ongoing valid consent of both parties”. In the instant case what she had was consent for treatment with a named partner. Treatment of Mrs. Hadley without Mr. Hadley’s effective, ongoing consent would render her in breach of her licence. </p>

However, she only had one or two separations every year out of some 1500 treatments.  </p>

Dr. Lockwood could not imagine a married couple wanting this.  She would have very real concerns about asking a couple what would happen if they separated: if they wanted to discuss that option she would want to counsel them and they would have to come back for further discussion if separation occurred. In such a situation she would have to go to the Authority for guidance, as it would require a whole new process: it was not possible to build it in as a contingency.</p>

To treat in those circumstances, however, the clinic, in my judgment, would not only have to be positively satisfied of the man’s continuing consent to the treatment, but would have to give particular attention to section 13(5). This, however, is not the situation with which I am faced. </p>

That is what has happened in the instant case. They are thus entitled to argue  (because the point is being considered irrespective of whether or not the consents have in reality been withdrawn) that we are positing a consent which has not been withdrawn, and which therefore remains in existence. The point, however, remains whether or not the consent is still effective. This is, essentially, an issue of fact. The facts here are that both couples have separated, and no longer have any form of relationship with each other. In these circumstances, in my judgment, it cannot be said, as a matter of fact, that either couple in this case is still being treated together.  </p>

As I have already stated, for there to be continuing “treatment together” in circumstances in which a couple have separated, the clinic, in my judgment, would need to be satisfied that the man’s consent remained effective.   I accept that this places a burden on clinics, but it is one, in my judgment, which it is appropriate for them to bear. I did not get the impression that either Dr. Sharp or Dr. Lockwood thought such a burden inappropriate. Indeed, their evidence seemed to me to be entirely consistent with the argument being advanced by the Authority and the Secretary of State. The twin pillars of the Act are effective consent to treatment and the welfare of the unborn child. Schedule 3 is critical to the operation of the Act and the process of regulation.  Mr. Tolson’s and Miss Freeborn’s interpretation of paragraph 6(3) of Schedule 3 to the Act would, I think, undermine its operation. </p>

On the facts of this case, however, it is clear to me that there is no effective consent by Mr. Johnston and Mr. Hadley to the continuing treatment of either Ms Evans or Mrs. Hadley on their own. The only consent is for treatment together, and for the reasons I have attempted to give, I do not think either couple can now be said to being treated together.  I am therefore satisfied that, on this point, the argument of the Authority and the Secretary of State is correct, and that the claim in each case falls at this hurdle.</p>

The essence of the argument, however, was that the stored embryos in Mrs. Hadley’s case were likely to have been the subject of a selection process by which they were rejected from the first attempt at implantation.

In Ms Evans’s case they had then been stored, and in Mrs. Hadley’s case, three had been selected and then used: the remainder had been stored. Creation, selection, freezing and storage were not use: they were acts which were preparatory to, and necessary for use.  The stored embryos had accordingly not been used. </p>

It would simply not be possible for a gamete provider to withdraw consent. Such a construction runs so counter to the consent provisions of the Act that I would only be able to contemplate it if the statutory language drove me to it.

The argument on Article 8 ranged very widely, principally, I think, because Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn sought to set up a positive obligation on the State to allow Ms Evans to have the embryos created by her and Mr. Johnston released from storage and transferred into her. This led Mr. Coppel, for the Secretary of State to set out in considerable detail the law on positive and negative obligations, as well as providing, with the assistance of Mr. Webb (an official in the Department of Health whose evidence I record at paragraphs 186 to 188 below) a comprehensive rationale of the policy considerations underlying the Act. Inevitably, in dealing with these arguments I will be selective of the points which most impressed me. I will, however, need to set out the material in some detail.</p>

The first nine words of Article 2 read: “Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law”. Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn accepted that an embryo is not a human life. They submitted, however, that it has a sufficiently “special” status to attract what they describe as a “qualified” right to life.  Two aspects of that limited, qualified right were (1) to continue in being whilst one or other of the gamete providers wished; and (2) to be available for implantation if its mother wished.</p>

There is no direct authority on the point in relation to embryos, but there is abundant domestic authority, binding on me, that a fetus, at whatever stage of its development, has no existence independent of its mother. If a fetus has no right to life under Article 2, it is difficult to see how an embryo can have such a right.  </p>

An embryo created by IVF exists initially outside the womb, and so far as the Act governs the creation of an embryo, it applies only to embryos created outside the human body – see section 1(2). There is no property in an embryo, but in contrast to a fetus, both gamete donors have an interest in, and rights over, the embryos they have created. Those rights are governed by the Act. The embryo, however, cannot be considered a person, or to have a “qualified” right to life.

To the contrary, it is one of the most important questions posed by the Act.  It is simply that Article 2 is the wrong medium to address it. Embryos created through IVF self-evidently contain life in an embryonic form. The questions are how those embryos should be treated; when and in what circumstances they can be stored; when for what purposes they can be used; and when they should be allowed to perish. The fact that they have no independent right to life does not either diminish the importance of these questions or mean that they are not fully addressed by the Act.</p>

An unfettered right on the claimants’ part to have the embryos transferred into them would, by parity of reasoning, constitute an interference with respect of the men’s Article 8 rights, in the same way that any attempt on their part to insist that the claimants have the embryos transferred into them against their will would undoubtedly constitute an interference both with the claimants’ right to autonomy over their own bodies, and with respect for their private lives.</p>

Therefore, it was considered appropriate to permit male partners to withdraw their consent to treatment services prior to the use of an embryo in all cases, rather than to make that permission dependent upon the facts of the individual case: the circumstances, financial and otherwise, of the male, and of his partner or ex-partner, whether she was already a mother, whether she would be able to have recourse to IVF in the future, etc. A fact-sensitive rule would, in this situation, give rise only to uncertainty and to litigation. The fact that the present cases are perhaps the first major example of litigation between parties to IVF treatment (in contrast to the US, where there are several examples) demonstrates the success of the Act in regulating this very sensitive area. The position of the claimants is undoubtedly deserving of sympathy, but the consequences of Schedule 3 in an individual case cannot, in the Secretary of State’s view, negate the legitimacy and the legality of the policy of adopting clear rules which can govern all cases.</p>

In the alternative, they argued that until the point at which the partners withdraw consent, the State has permitted both claimants to develop their private and family lives as they, and their partners, saw fit.   The State had licensed (and not banned) an assisted conception regime which met the claimants’ needs.  Accordingly, there had been no interference. However, interference occurred when the State <span style="text-decoration:underline">required</span> the clinics not to treat on the withdrawal of consent by the male partners.</p>

The State might also choose to limit the ‘age’ of the embryo – both ‘fresh’ (in the United Kingdom by the 14 day primitive streak period) and ‘frozen’ (in the United Kingdom by the 10 year storage period).

The first point was “the female right of self-determination in pregnancy”.  They agreed that the biological and social reality which lies behind the science, or which the science attempts to mimic, was important as a guide to the nature of the public interest and any balance.  However, it pointed, they argued, to a different conclusion.  During sexual intercourse, the male will have a role in fertilising the egg (and a free choice as to whether to attempt to do so or not), and a role in raising any child born.  But in between, the fate of the embryo lies with the female.  Before IVF, no male had ever been able by lawful means to prevent a female from developing and in due course giving birth to her embryo if she wished to do so.   In any event, the Act did not promote “the right of the male to withdraw consent…at the point of transfer” as Mr Webb claimed: moreover  “use” of an embryo in providing treatment services could occur well before this point, as <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Quintavalle (tissue typing) </span>demonstrated.</p>

But it was important not to refuse him the power to do anything else.  If a man wished to reassure a woman whom he loved that her embryos would always be available for her then why should he not be free to do so because of the “primacy of consent”?   Mr. Webb argued that it would be undesirable and unfair to insist on holding a male to his consent.

Whilst it could be argued that a child may have a right not to be born (for example a severely congenitally disabled embryo) no such argument applied here.  The State was permitted to interfere in situations which were “potentially damaging” for the living child only in strictly defined circumstances  - see Part IV of the Children Act 1989.  Was it to be suggested that the State has a policy to prevent a child being born because its father did not wish it where there is no suggestion that that child is likely to suffer (at least) significant harm?  </p>

The more important argument, they submitted, was the following.  A man should be free to withdraw his consent if he wished for the reasons advanced by Mr Webb.  But if he, at least, can give an irrevocable consent he should be free to do so.  It will always be apparent to the man that in doing so, there could be no quid pro quo from the woman because it will be impossible to require her to submit to the medical treatment necessary for implantation.

It was an area in which individual circumstances will vary greatly and where any policy in the law should, at the very least, be capable of admitting of exceptions.  In any event a number of points in particular should be made.  First, a freedom to agree an irrevocable consent is clear and “bright line” enough.  Secondly (to anticipate the argument on “storage”) a rule which provided that there should be continued storage of embryos already created with consent unless both gamete providers determined otherwise was every bit as “bright line” as the present law.  Thirdly, however “bright line” a law may be, if it contravenes any individual’s human rights then it cannot be maintained.  Fourthly, certainty did not make a bad law better.  </p>

It appeared to make no allowance for irrevocable consent even in this context.

Counsel submitted that it was a bad law which would permit a donor to deprive a young cancer victim from bearing a child from an embryo fertilised with his sperm when he might do so for no good reason, or no reason at all and perhaps years after he had made the donation (for which he might have been paid).   </p>

Just because there may be a pressing social need in other cases to prevent implantation without consent did not mean that Ms Evans’ human rights have not been infringed. Consequently, it was not necessary, counsel submitted, for the State to prevent the clinic treating Ms Evans by implanting the embryos.  </p>

Embryos were on any view ‘special’ and deserved special protection under the law.  That was the rationale of the Act. They are different from mere property.  ‘Specialness’ alone would be a good reason not to give a veto over continued storage to one gamete provider alone. There were, however, other reasons.  Mr. Johnston and Mr. Hadley had already changed their mind once.  They may do so again.  If the status quo is continued they would be able to do so.  If the embryos have been permitted to perish, they will not. </p>

The emotions of the party against storage on contemplating the continued existence of the embryos, though valid, must be weighed against the emotions of the party who did not want to see the demise of the embryos. Permitting the embryos to perish was offensive to the claimants, as it would no doubt be offensive to the pro-life lobby.  </p>

Firstly, positive obligations arose under Article 8(1), and if they had been breached, there was no question of justification under Article 8(2) although the factors enumerated in relation to justification under Article 8(2) would be relevant to the question of whether any positive obligations arise at all.  </p>

Thus, he submitted, the female right of self-determination in pregnancy dictated that the point at which an embryo is implanted in a woman (which will be the point of “use” in the vast majority of cases) is, in practice, the last possible moment at which consent to transfer could be withdrawn. No later point could be chosen.  The claimants, he noted, did not dispute that but argued that the same rule should be applied to a frozen embryo stored outside the womb. However, that argument did not address the fundamental point that a woman who becomes pregnant following IVF treatment is in the same position as a woman who becomes pregnant following sexual intercourse only once she is pregnant.  </p>

Schedule 3 recognised the reality that people’s situations can change over the course of a period of years, perhaps quite unexpectedly; and, in the Secretary of State’s view, it would be undesirable and unfair to hold people (both men and women, since the rules apply equally to both) to consents which they may have given several years earlier.</p>

The claimants’ argument that this was merely an imbalance which was created by nature which the law should not seek to correct did not meet the point. The law must strive to avoid sex discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights (Article 14 of the Convention) regardless of its underlying cause.  The regime contended for by the Claimants, whereby a frozen embryo would be treated as belonging to a woman who would have the sole power to determine its future would, he submitted, amount to a very serious form of sex discrimination, which it would not be open to the Court to countenance as result of its own duties under HRA 1998 section 6(1).</p>

He accepted that this was not an argument for fixing the “point of no return” in any particular place, but rather for making it a firm line wherever it is fixed, and which did not depend upon the facts of individual cases.  As already noted, it was fundamental to the intention of Parliament when passing the Act to instigate a system of firm and clear statutory regulation in preference to a “free for all” governed only by the common law and equitable rules.  The instant cases were, he submitted, very good examples of the difficulties which could arise both for the parties to IVF treatment and for licence holders providing treatment, if the fate of frozen embryos had to be decided on grounds of fairness in the particular case. .  The need for certainty in this particular context answered the submission made by the claimants that a policy is <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> disproportionate if it does not admit of exceptions.  Everything depended upon the context:  there may be a very good reason in a particular case for a “bright line” rule.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, Mr. Coppel submitted, the need for certainty in the law was the main reason why the policy objectives identified by Mr Webb were not outweighed by the facts of these particular cases. In each case there was an unwilling male former partner who did not want the interference with his right to respect for private life which use of the embryos would entail.  Moreover, the effect of Schedule 3 was not to deny parenthood to the claimants.  In Ms Evans’ case, a prohibition on the use of the embryos deprived her of a less than 30% chance of conception, and a possibly lower chance of a live birth. However, she also had the possibility of becoming a parent in other ways, by conception using donor eggs, and / or by adoption.  In Mrs. Hadley’s case, the claimant was already a parent, and had a far greater prospect of conceiving another child of her own through the use of other techniques not involving the disputed embryos. </p>

If the parties did not consent to continued storage of embryos created with their gametes, then, in the Secretary of State’s view, that should not be imposed upon them.  There were considerable benefits for a non-consenting party in resolving the situation once and for all, by removing the embryos from storage.  This would put an end to any lingering doubts as to their fate, and obviate the possibility of pressure to change his / her mind being brought to bear upon the non-consenting party during the remainder of the storage period  (for example, as had occurred in this case, through the media).</p>

Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn frequently referred to the “male veto”. In my judgment, as I pointed out in paragraph 184, that is an incomplete analysis. As Mr. Johnson and Mr. Hadley pointed out, each of the four parties has a veto. I have no doubt – indeed Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn accept - that were there a provision in the Act which permitted either of the men to insist that either of the women had the embryos transferred into them against their will, both Ms Evans and Mrs Hadley would regard that as a gross interference with their right to respect for their private lives, and that they would be correct to so to regard it. By like token, it seems to me that a regime which permitted the women to override the men’s withdrawal of consent (which is what the claimants seek) would be a clear interference with the men’s right to respect for their private lives. </p>

But the policy behind it is surely sound – or, to put the matter at its lowest, one which the State is entitled to promote.  Since the object of consensual IVF treatment is to produce a child for a couple, it is in my judgment not unreasonable, where the couple has separated prior to the transfer of the embryos, for each to be able to say that they wish the treatment to be discontinued because any child born as a result of the treatment will not be brought up by the couple. To put the matter another way, it is not unreasonable for either Mr. Johnston or Mr. Hadley to say, given the break-up of their respective relationships, that they do not wish to be the father of a child by a woman with whom they no longer have anything in common; by whom they would not wish now to have a child; and in circumstances in which, once any such child was born, they would not be in a position to play a full or proper paternal role, whilst at the same time remaining financially liable to maintain the child. </p>

I also agree with Mr. Coppel that it is not open to parents - whether married or not - to contract out of the Child Support Act 1991 (the 1991 Act). Mr. Johnston and Mr. Hadley would be the fathers of any children born consequent upon the transfer of embryos in this case, and under section 1(1) of the 1991 Act each would be responsible for maintaining his child. Were either of the claimants to be in receipt of benefit, the Secretary of State would be entitled to require her to authorise him to take action to recover child support maintenance from the child’s father – see section 6 of the 1991 Act – irrespective of any agreement between the parents. It is for these reasons that I stated in paragraphs 90 and 98 above that any agreement between the parties in this case would not be binding.</p>

In these circumstances it is, once again, entirely appropriate, in my judgment, that the licensing system created by Parliament should provide clear and non-fact specific rules for any clinic which the Authority licences, which stand to lose its licence if it breaches its terms.</p>

They do not challenge the lawfulness of a scheme of treatment which requires consent. Their argument, it seems to me, boils down to the proposition that it should be possible for the male gamete provider, if he wishes, to give an irrevocable consent to the use of the embryos created with his gametes, and that there is no legitimate public interest in permitting embryos created in these circumstances to be allowed to perish.  For the policy reasons set out by Mr. Webb and elaborated by Mr. Coppel I am unable to accept this approach. </p>

The question which counsel pose at the conclusion of paragraph 203 seems to me the wrong one. The correct question, in my view, is whether or not it is legitimate for the State to allow gamete providers to withdraw their consent to the use / continued storage of subsequently created embryos In a regime based on mutual consent and section 13(5) the answer to this question must be “yes”. </p>

The right to found a family through IVF can only, put at its highest, amount to the right to have access to IVF treatment. Self-evidently, it cannot be a right to be treated successfully. Furthermore, it is a right which is qualified by availability, suitability for treatment and cost. Once it is clear, as in my judgment it is, that the consensual scheme for IVF treatment contained in the Act (and to which both claimants have had access) is lawful and does not breach Article 8 of the Convention, it must follow that there is no breach of Article 12. </p>

They submitted that this was not a proportionate response to the (real) differences between the naturally conceiving woman and the woman receiving IVF treatment, or to the differences between an embryo in the woman’s body and an embryo outside the body. Permitting a unilateral withdrawal of consent without regard to the circumstances not only failed to reflect nature and the ‘veto’ which the female has, but did not attempt to address any balance of interest in the embryos. </p>

It distinguishes between men and women whose partners have changed their minds about undergoing IVF treatment based on whether or not that change occurred before or after the relevant use of an embryo. That, however was not the burden of the complaint under Article 14.  The fact that a woman who is disabled may suffer adversely as a result of the provisions of the Act (and not all women undergoing IVF treatment are disabled – see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Quintavalle (tissue typing)</span>) did not mean that they have been discriminated against on grounds of their disability. </p>

He submitted that the Act prevented any such relationship from arising. In particular, of course, there was no “property” in the embryos created and as Mr Webb explained, the Act embodied a conscious decision by Parliament to impose statutory regulation in this area, in preference to leaving matters to be determined by the terms of contracts between individuals – see section 29 of the Act.</p>

It was, rather, that the Clinic was only permitted to store and use the embryos if Mr. Johnston consented, which consent was contingent up until the point at which the embryos were used in the material sense. It should be noted, Mr. Coppel argued, that in this context consent must be given to the licence holder, and could only be withdrawn by notice to the licence holder, regardless of what had passed between the participants themselves.  The scheme of the Act therefore removed one of the essential pre-requisites for promissory estoppel.</p>

If there is a wider interest in upholding the statutory provisions, estoppel cannot operate. There was, he argued, as might perhaps be expected, a strong identity between this rule, and the rule which applied to the issue of whether a party may waive statutory rights by <span style="font-style:italic">contract</span> (as opposed to conduct).  The question in that context is whether the right conferred is exclusively personal (in which case waiver will be permitted) or is designed to serve other, broader public purposes and so, compendiously, whether to permit a waiver would undermine or frustrate the purposes of the statute:  see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Johnson v Moreton</span> [1980] AC 37, 51F, 58B-D, 68D.</p>

In so arguing, they ignored the evidence of Mr Webb who identified a number of such policies.  The most relevant in the present context was that of promoting clarity and certainty in relations between parties in this field: see paragraph 186 above.  Against the background that IVF and other techniques were being practised in this country before the Act, the enactment of the Act constituted in itself a recognition that common law and equitable rules were inadequate to regulate this field.   </p>

Certainty was an important policy in the general public interest.  The effect of the claimants’ estoppel argument would be to superimpose a fact-sensitive rule, the operation of which would depend upon the contents of unminuted discussions between participants in IVF treatment, occurring perhaps at a time of great stress, and upon the whole range of factors which affect whether the courts will recognise an “equity” (fairness, clean hands etc.). </p>

The bright line rule obviously enabled licence holders to be sure about what they could and could not do.  If estoppel could operate so as to overlay the provisions of paragraph 4 of Schedule 3, licence holders would be placed in the invidious position of having to investigate and make findings of fact in relation to what was said between male and female partners, and whether it was equitable to permit consent to be withdrawn.  The livelihood of those working on behalf of licence holders would be at risk if their judgment of the facts was found by the courts to have been incorrect.</p>

The clinics were protected from patient / clinic estoppels by the consent regime itself. Clinics obtained effective consent, relied on it and maintained it until written notice of withdrawal. They were not bound by any equities purely between third parties on the usual principles.  Thus if the notice of withdrawal may be avoided as a result of undue influence, duress or estoppel between the gamete providers, that did not affect the clinics in any way. They could carry on regardless unless and until they received notice. At that point they did not have to do anything other than continue to store the embryos. </p>

I am particularly impressed by the consequences of Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn’s argument for the clinics. Neither the gamete providers nor the clinics can opt out of the statutory scheme.  The clinics depend both for their livelihoods and their reputations on strict compliance with the terms of the licences granted to them. The importance of fulfilling the terms of the licence was at the forefront of the evidence of both Dr. Sharp and Dr. Lockwood and, in my judgment, rightly so. </p>

The Act gives Mr. Johnston an unequivocal right to vary or withdraw his consent both to treatment and the storage of the embryos at any point prior to their use.   That right must be seen in its context, namely the structure of the scheme of licensed treatment operated under the Act, and as part of the policy of mutual consent discussed earlier under Article 8 of the Convention.  The Statutory scheme is clear and, as I have found, Convention compliant.  It exists for the benefit of all gamete providers. In such circumstances it seems to me that Mr. Coppel must be right to submit that there is a wider interest in upholding the provisions of Schedule 3, and that they cannot be waived for the benefit of an individual. These include, of course, the welfare of the unborn child. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.02in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the difficulties I have in this area is in defining the parameters of equitable or promissory estoppel, and distinguishing it (where it is necessary to do so) from proprietary and other forms of estoppel.  Thus, for example, although the legal rights between the person making the representation and the person who acts on it frequently arise out of a contract between them, in some circumstances it does not seem to be fatal to the existence of an estoppel for there to be no legal relationship between representor and representee.  </p>

She had also promised him that she would “see him right”.  The judge decided that the claimant had believed he was going to receive all or part of the deceased’s property on her death; that he acted to his detriment in caring for her unpaid; and that it would be unconscionable for the deceased to go back on her assurances to him. The judge awarded him £200,000 out of a net estate of £1.285 million. The case in the Court of Appeal was concerned with the extent of the relief to which the claimant was entitled having established the estoppel. There was no appeal against the judge’s finding that the claimant had established a claim. </p>

But it is unlikely to be a short or simple search, because (as appears from both the English and the Australian authorities) proprietary estoppel can apply in a wide variety of factual situations, and any summary formula is likely to prove to be an over-simplification. The cases show a wide range of variation in both of the main elements, that is the quality of the assurances which give rise to the claimant’s expectations and the extent of the claimant’s detrimental reliance on the assurances. The doctrine applies only if these elements, in combination, make it unconscionable for the person giving the assurances (whom I will call the benefactor, although that may not always be an appropriate label) to go back on them.</p>

The question in that case was whether a lessor could obtain an order of ejectment against a lessee when work under a notice of repair to leasehold premises was suspended following the lessee instituting negotiations for the lessor to purchase the lessee’s interest in the premises.

In that case, a divorced wife relied on a promise by her former husband to pay her maintenance of £100 a year. He did not pay. She did not apply for maintenance in the divorce proceedings, but issued a writ several years later relying on her former husband’s promise to pay, and arguing (inter alia) that it would be inequitable for the court to relieve him of his obligations.

He was sued for some other cause, for example, a pension or a breach of contract, or possession, and the promise, assurance, or assertion only played a supplementary role, though, no doubt, an important one. That is, I think, its true function. It may be part of a cause of action, but not a cause of action in itself. The principle, as I understand it, is that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his word. </p>

The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind. Its ill effects have been largely mitigated of late, but it still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract, although not of its modification or discharge. I fear that it was my failure to make this clear in<span style="font-style:italic"> Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd</span> which misled Byrne J in the present case. He held that the wife could sue on the husband’s promise as a separate and independent cause of action by itself, although, as he held, there was no consideration for it. That is not correct. The wife can only enforce the promise if there was consideration for it. That is, therefore, the real question in the case: Was there sufficient consideration to support the promise? </p>

Firstly, there must be a legal relationship between the parties. Secondly, the estoppel is not, of itself, the cause of action, although it may be an element in it. Thirdly, there must be a clear and unequivocal promise or representation which is designed to affect the legal relationship between the parties.  Fourthly, there must be reliance on that promise or representation by the other party and, fifthly, it must be unconscionable for the person making the representation to be allowed to resile from it. </p>

That said, however, it does not seem to me that the absence of any one or more of these elements is necessarily fatal to an equitable estoppel. The essence of the doctrine, as Robert Walker LJ comments in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Jennings v Rice</span> [2003] 1 FCR at 518f is to do what it necessary to avoid an unconscionable result.  However, it does seem to me that in the instant case, the three critical elements which must be present are (1) a clear representation by Mr. Johnston; (2) reliance on that representation by Ms Evans to her detriment, and (3) a finding that it would be unconscionable to allow Mr. Johnston to allow Mr. Johnston to go back on the representation.</p>

On 10 October 2001, Mr. Johnson was doing his best to reassure Ms Evans that he loved her and that he wanted to be the father of her children. He was giving what I have no doubt was a truthful expression of his feelings at the time. He was not – nor could he be- committing himself for all time. In the field of personal relationships endearments and reassurances of this kind are commonplace, but they do not – nor can they – have any permanent, legal effect. They certainly cannot bind Mr. Johnston in what were totally changed circumstances, namely his separation from Ms Evans.</p>

In these changed circumstances, he no longer wishes to have a child by her. Were it not for the existence of the embryos, Ms Evans would not choose to have a child by him.   </p>

Ms Evans had very little time. She was given the news on 10 October 2001.Harvesting of her eggs and fertilisation of them took place on 12 November 2001. Ms Evans underwent an oophorectomy on 26 November 2001.  The reality was that egg freezing was not a option, nor, I think, was the use of donor sperm. The clinic would not undertake the former. I think it highly unlikely, in the light of the evidence of Dr. Sharp and Dr. Lockwood that Ms Evans would have found a clinic which undertook it, even if she had had more time, and been able to afford it. Furthermore, both egg freezing and AID would have opened up the question of the durability of her relationship with Mr. Johnston. The alternative clinic would have been bound to enquire into why Ms Evans wanted egg freezing or to use donor sperm; and, despite her personal circumstances, might have felt unable to provide either when Ms Evans had a partner who was capable of providing the gametes to fertilise her embryos.</p>

She was naturally in a highly anxious state of mind. She was, I think, by undergoing IVF with Mr. Johnston taking the only realistic course which was open to her. She was, I think, both aware that it was the only course, and it was one she was content to adopt. No doubt Mr. Johnston’s assurances played a part in what she did, but I do not think they were critical.  Had Mr. Johnston not given her the assurances I have found he did give her, I think she would have gone ahead with the treatment in any event. However, even if I am wrong about that, and even if an estoppel is capable of existing in the face of the Act, I do not, for the reasons I have given, think it would be unconscionable to allow Mr. Johnston to withdraw his consent. It is a right which the Statute gives him within the clear scheme operated by Parliament. It was the basis upon which he gave his consent on 10 October 2001. It is perfectly reasonable for him, in the changed circumstances which appertain, not to want to father a child by Ms Evans.  </p>

The Act places great emphasis on considerations relating to the position of the unborn child.

The statutory provisions, like Convention Rights, apply to men and to women equally. </p>

	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">However, I cannot allow my sympathy for Ms Evans to take precedence over the clear terms of the Act. In so far as medical science can alleviate infertility, the message of this case has to be, firstly, that IVF is governed by the Act, and subject to its careful regulation; and secondly, that it requires the consent of both parties throughout. Couples who embark on IVF treatment under the Act must appreciate that until the fertilised embryo is used (in this case transferred into the woman) the ongoing consent of both parties to the treatment is required and that either can withdraw. Furthermore, if the relationship breaks down, the clinic may well not be able to continue to treat the woman because she and the man are no longer being treated together. </span>

	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">It would be easy to criticise men in the position of Mr Johnston and Mr. Hadley in this case. But such criticisms would, in my judgment, be unfair. The Act entitles a man in the position of these men to say that he does not want to become the father of a child by a woman from whom he has separated, and with whom he now no longer has anything in common apart from the frozen embryos. In section 13(5) the Act places great emphasis on considerations relating to the position of the unborn child. Mr. Johnston and Mr. Hadley would be the biological fathers of children for whom they would be financially responsible, but with whom they could not enjoy any form of natural paternal relationship. </span>

	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">Furthermore, it is not difficult to reverse the dilemma. A man has testicular cancer; his sperm is preserved prior to treatment and used to create embryos with his partner. The couple then separate before the embryos are transferred into the woman. Nobody would suggest that the woman could not withdraw her consent to treatment and refuse to have the embryos transferred into her. The statutory provisions, like Convention Rights, apply to both men and to women. </span>

	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">Finally, this is an area where Parliament has legislated very clearly and fully, following an expert report (that of the Warnock Committee) a consultation process and a White Paper. If the law is to be changed in this area, it is in my view for Parliament to do so, not the judiciary. </span>
