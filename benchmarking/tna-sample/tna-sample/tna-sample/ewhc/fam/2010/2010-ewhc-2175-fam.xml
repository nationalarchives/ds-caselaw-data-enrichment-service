For the purposes of this judgment a so-called “honour killing” [I shall hereafter simply refer to these as “honour killing” death threats, dropping the pre-fix “so called”] can be defined as a threat to kill someone for carrying out some act or acts, or perceived act or acts, which bring dishonour to the family.  They are frequently, but not exclusively, carried out against women.  In this case the threats have been allegedly issued by, amongst others, the father, members of his family, and it is said by members of the mother’s own family, as well as by her “second husband”.  It is almost artificial in this context to refer to “his”, and “her” family, because this mother and father are cousins (his father and her mother being full siblings), and members of the same tribe, although the cartographer’s exercise historically severed the family into two nationalities, the mother’s family living in Iran, and the father’s in Iraq.  Both are of Kurdish stock.</p>

At those times his communication with his lawyers was perforce limited to periods of adjournment (either the short adjournment or overnight), and in the event of the necessity to give urgent instructions on the mother’s evidence, an arrangement was made with my consent for him to indicate to his legal team via e-mail or text messages so that they would be on notice of his request.</p>

The giving of evidence by telephone link brings its own problems: frequent interruptions of service; uncertainty as to who else, if anyone, was in the room with the witness when they were giving their evidence; basic problems of identification; problems relating to their commenting upon documents to which they were from time-to-time referred (the court having to rely upon them being given full and clear descriptions of the necessary documents to which they were being referred); and the all-too obvious disadvantage of not being able to see the witnesses and how they comported themselves under questioning.</p>

For a variety of reasons, many to do with her own behaviour, she has had to be moved from one safe house to another on many occasions.  Her identity has been changed on a number of occasions.  To some extent her appearance has changed by her own wish.  I shall consider this part of the story again later, (see “Osman Warnings” referred to in paragraphs 288 to 327 below).</p>

The Kurdish community in the United Kingdom is a small one in its cohesion despite geographical distances.  Thus, the mother is, for the most part, severed from her former national community, and lives a socially and culturally isolated life.  She is lonely, although she has begun the process of educating herself so that she may, in due course, seek employment, and thus gain access to a different community from her ethnic one.  At the moment she is severely hampered by being illiterate in both Kurdish and English, and although her English is improving beyond all expectations given that she spoke none in 2005, she needs the services, as have been provided to her by the MPS throughout these proceedings, of a Kurdish Sorani speaker.  I was surprised, given that her written statements make much of her inability to speak English, that she wished to give evidence in that language.  She did so for the most part with an obviously high level of comprehension, only rarely calling upon the interpreter to aid her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The view of the MPS as to the seriousness with which the mother’s allegations should be taken is heightened because, in this case, as is well-known to all of the parties, and is known on a national level from newspaper and broadcast recordings of approximately some four years ago, a cousin of both this mother and this father (BM) was the subject of an act or acts of rape and then an “honour killing” by her brother and her father who were convicted of murder in 2007.  The father, and a number of his supporting witnesses, take umbrage with the MPS approach to the death of BM, and what they assert is a bald exercise in prejudice by the MPS in assuming that, because BM was murdered in this way, the father and/or others would likewise subscribe to the view that an “honour killing” was acceptable.  A member of the MPS (see below for more detail of this witness’ part) did state unequivocally in his oral evidence that the MPS had no specific evidence to link the father, or his near family, to the killing of BM, but could not in carrying out their risk assessment ignore the connection.  The MPS has also carried out a wider risk assessment in respect of events which, they say, suggests that there is a risk of a high order to the mother – again, see   “Osman Warnings” – paragraphs 288 - 327 below.</p>

Quite what the reason is for this disparity was not ostensibly revealed until the mother’s statement of May 2010 gave her version accounting for the difference.  She holds firmly to the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1982 as the day of her birth, making her now 28.  She says that she was instructed by the father to give as her date of birth the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 1976 because it was more consistent with the information he had long since provided to the United Kingdom authorities in pursuit of his asylum claim in the year 2000 (see paragraphs 34 - 37 below).  She points to an “Identity Certificate” issued by the Ministry of The Interior in the Islamic Republic of Iran on about 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2008 (see volume 1 C9).  That document also asserts that the parties married on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 1998, when in fact, as is agreed by them, they married in April 2004.  She says that the wrong date of birth was given to the compiler of that document so that the impression would be created that she was 22 years old at the time of her marriage, whereas, if her true date of birth had been given, she would only have been 16 years old on that purported, but erroneous, date of marriage.  She was wholly unaware of these changes until the father informed her of them in the course of a telephone call following their marriage (he by now being back in England, and she having to obtain an entry visa for the United Kingdom).  She alleges that he further told her that he had paid a great deal of money for the change of her birth date to be effected on her Iranian identity documents.</p>

He certainly does not think she was born in 1976 either, because he believes her to be approximately 2 – 3 years younger than himself.  He produces a photograph purportedly showing them side-by-side when youngsters to support this.  In her oral evidence the mother identified the three sitters in this picture.  She was the smallest; one of her older brothers was standing next to her, and one of the father’s younger brothers next to him.  The father made no appearance in it.

He adds in Delphic fashion that “this is because all of the documentation states this” (concerning, I now believe, his asylum application, although no documentation of significance in that matter is available for scrutiny).  He did not amend in his second Children Act statement what he now says is a mistake, and adds that the misunderstanding may have arisen when his last solicitor read him that statement (containing what he now says is the above error) without the use of an interpreter.  Whilst his United Kingdom passport gives 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 1970 as his date of birth, he wonders if, in common with many immigrants on arriving in the country, there was a mis-recording of his date of birth because he did not speak English well.  He is seeking an Iraqi birth certificate.  Even at the time of the making of this recent second statement he does not give a specific date in 1976.  No such documentation has been produced.</p>

Notification of his grant of asylum status was made by letter on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2000, the status of a refugee was afforded to him, that status being recognised under the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees as set out in its 1967 protocol.  As I understand the evidence, his claim to that status was based on, amongst other things, fear for his health, safety and indeed life should he remain in Iraq by virtue of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">then</span> political climate.  I note, however, that for a number of years he has gone backwards and forwards to Iraq and Iran, perhaps giving rise to the suspicion that his fears for his safety and life were not as high as he might have led the U.K. Border Agency to believe initially.  However, such comings and goings may simply be attributable to the existence of a new political regime, and a significant diminishment in the risks to him from such travel.  When being cross-examined about this issue he said, amongst other things, “I wanted to come here for a better life”.  This may well suggest to a cynical observer that he was an economic migrant of some sort.  I remind myself at this point of the problems of selective credibility – see paragraph 115 below relating to “Lucas Warnings”.</p>

Common to those two accounts was that he had an interpreter at the time who did not speak his dialect.  In his first version he went on to say that, despite the difficulties of language, he had been advised by that interpreter, who purported to have assisted in many such applications, that he should lie as to his marital status for reasons the father could not now recollect nor explain.  In the second version he said that such were the language problems between himself and the interpreter that the latter must have made up the whole account himself, for the father did not know of this lie.  I need not set out in further elaborate detail the nature of his oral evidence on this subject.  It is sufficient to record that I did not believe a word of any of his accounts save that he may have been advised by the interpreter to lie about this subject, but in any event he did so voluntarily to mislead the English authorities, quite clear in his own mind that he was, for tactical reasons, so lying.</p>

Furthermore, for such a bogus account to be valid, he had to create a false impression of her age, as well as his own.  I accept her evidence on this subject.</p>

The father asserts that it was the mother (and her brother J) who made this application in Iran.  Accordingly, he says, any errors or lies in the application should be attributed to her.  Following the period when she perforce had to continue living in Iran pending the grant of immigration status, she was given a spousal visa on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2005, but only for a period of two years.  During his cross-examination the father frequently emphasised that he had nothing to do with this application; had no idea what details she had provided to the authorities in Tehran; and assumed, as he asserted many in his community do, that once she had a visa it was for unlimited leave to remain.  He claims never to have asked her the period of her visa, and never to have looked at her passport, even though on his own evidence it was kept in a box to which both had access at their flat in Croydon.  I did not believe a word of his account on this subject.  She later acquired indefinite leave to remain, as I shall set out below in paragraphs 267 - 269.</p>

In making this finding I have taken account of the fact that she was then illiterate.  She nevertheless was supported throughout the application by her brother J, who is not.  At the very least he could be expected to draw these woeful anomalies to her attention before committing them to paper on her behalf.  In making that finding I have also taken into account that this is essentially a culture where the men are in charge of official matters, but it stretches the bounds of credulity to assume that J would not have raised with his sister the fact of proffering the birth certificate and a marriage certificate both bearing demonstrably false dates.</p>

Indeed, he took elaborate pains in his oral evidence to persuade me that he regarded physical violence as abhorrent, and that whilst he recognised that some of his tribe (numbering approximately 20, 000) did indeed subscribe to the old views about honour killing and the use of violence generally, he was now living in the United Kingdom, and that this was the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> century, and that the use of violence was alien to him.

Whilst I am accordingly suspicious as to his account of his activities in Iran/Iraq as a justification for asylum, I can do no more than record that suspicion.  Since it is suspicion and does not achieve the necessary standard of proof to qualify as a probability I shall put that aspect of the matter firmly out of my mind.

The village in which they live, which once had some 15 families in it is now down to three, although the father’s family evidence says only two, and is supplemented by a workforce of outsiders who do manual work.  There was no access to education for young women there.  Following the oral evidence of in particular the maternal grandfather, I was left with some slight hesitation as to this picture.  The maternal grandfather told me that the only reason his daughter did not go to school was because the maternal grandmother had had an operation and was unwell, and inferentially that the mother, as an only daughter, was required to stay at home and look after her.  I accept that evidence.  Neither the grandmother, nor the mother, nor indeed any of their other female relatives (save the youngest of the new generation) has had any basic schooling let alone higher education.  The father, in his oral evidence, (the suggestion never having appeared anywhere in the paper material, nor in  any aspect of the oral evidence prior to his, including cross-examination of the mother on his behalf) told me that she could read and write in a very simple way in her own language, having learned that at home.  He went on to produce a number of sheets of paper showing how the mother had been able to write in Kurdish Sorani and then, once enrolled at an English language academy on arrival in the United Kingdom, she had learned basic translations of the words and a few phrases. Given the lateness of the production of these documents I have no way of knowing whether the Kurdish Sorani words were indeed written out by the mother as part of her exercises.  My overall conclusion on this narrow aspect is that in all probability the mother was indeed truly illiterate in her own language.</p>

I have no doubt her life was not at all happy as a child, and that even though at times, as the only girl, she may have been modestly indulged, overall it was a harsh life for her, that she was indeed beaten, and that she was made aware from a very early age that, culturally, she must follow the dictates of the men.  Despite the men’s denials, and her own mother’s denial, I have no doubt at all that this young woman was, as a child, treated in the way she describes, even to the extent of receiving beatings from both her father and her brothers.

There is an English manuscript note of that telephone call at volume 15 pages 26 – 27, and 28 – 36.  The tone of the father and of his daughter is, for the most part, affectionate and concerned, and it is thus submitted that anything the mother says to the detriment of her own father, either concerning his historical behaviour of more recent behaviour, is to be regarded with considerable suspicion when she seeks to denigrate him.  Yet elsewhere in the documentation is a report of the mother saying to a professional that she was pleased that, by virtue of her marriage, she had escaped both Iran and her father.  It is of note, I consider, that she isolated him in particular rather than simply referring to her family in general, or her father and brothers.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I was told by both leading counsel in the course of the evidence that it was agreed that there are three stages to a traditional wedding in their culture.  The first is an engagement celebration.  The second is the formal ceremony presided over by a mullah, that being part and parcel of the Nikkah dinner/party.  The third part takes the form of the bride being received into the home of the groom.  It is only after that stage that a bride and groom may sleep together and have sexual intercourse.  The mother explained one aspect of this tradition to me in clear terms: if the couple sleep together before that last stage of entry into the home of the father, and then for some reason that last part of the proceedings does not occur, she will be unmarriageable, for she would not be a virgin.  In this case she gave, as an example, the possibility that after the Nikkah the father might have returned to England and failed thereafter to take her into his home.  She would, in their cultural tradition, not be re-admitted to her own family either.  In other words she would be lost.  This has relevance for some of the material I heard in this case relating the period following the Nikkah dinner and the consummation of their marriage, (see paragraphs 75 to 81 below).  This account of hers was supported by a number of witnesses from both sides of the family: but I emphasise that it does reflect the traditional approach, and not necessarily represent the practice in all households in that part of the world.  It was the evidence of the paternal grandfather that from about 1985 onwards the stages were an engagement party (attended by the mullah), a signing of the legal register, followed by the entry into the father’s home and consummation.  He did, in cross-examination, agree that in this case the father’s home for these purposes was unquestionably the flat in Croydon.</p>

It was his evidence that he felt so familiar with and comfortable in the home of one of his paternal aunts that he and his wife had consummated their marriage there, and had not even waited until they arrived at his own parents’ home.  I prefer the evidence of the mother, his sister (HMAAA), aunt (NAA) and the paternal grandfather and others as to the third stage, and find that the father was lying to me in order to give credence to his account of the consummation of the marriage rather than accept the mother’s account (see paragraphs 75 to 81 below).</p>

Although both in print and orally, the maternal grandmother of R made it clear that she did not regard this as a good marriage, she said that her own husband always stuck by a bargain once made.

He says that it was during this period (when they were both children) that there was a “so-called ‘agreement’” as to the future marriage between this husband and this wife.  He attributes “the arrangement” to a romantic notion on the part of the maternal grandmother that the two small children would marry when of sufficient age.

He thinks she was in her mid-teens at that time.  The third time he saw her, prior to the marriage, was in 1998 when he was in his early 20’s.  He spent two nights in the neighbourhood seeing quite a lot of the mother and her family.  They then spoke at the telephone on a number of occasions between that visit and the marriage in 2004, and in the course of 2003 there was a significant increase in such calls, in the course of which she was asking questions of him about his life in England.  He reports telling her that he did not have much money, and was living in bed and breakfast accommodation.

In her oral evidence the mother gave a very vivid account of the sort of photographs she had been shown, which were of a very substantial house with an attractive garden.  She has no idea now what she was being shown, but it was unquestionably not the accommodation to which she was taken on arrival in England.  I accept her evidence on this.  Was this trick by the father just a man bragging about his worldly wealth in the sure and certain knowledge that it would not be questioned, and that even when his wife discovered the reality she would not report back the sorry reality?  Or was there some other reason?  If there was, I could not fathom it, but have come to the clear conclusion that on this subject of the photographs he was lying to me.   In retrospect, he acknowledges that he might have done more to prepare her better for the huge differences in the way of living between her childhood and adolescence and her future life (once marriage was agreed) in England.</p>

The mother took a significant part in planning the celebrations many details of which had been organised in the preceding months, he agreeing them over the telephone, and that she was very excited about it.  There seems to me to be some consensus that there were perhaps quite a small number of people at the engagement party in the morning, amounting to perhaps no more than 20 – 30 people.  Even if I am wrong about that it matters little.  The evening party strikes me as an altogether more significant affair, although not as elaborate as the mother had been led to believe it would be.  I cannot guess at how many people attended, but it was certainly larger than the morning group. Whilst all the arrangements were made by her family he paid for it.  He describes the nature of the celebration and orally told me it was where he gave the mother rings and jewellery.  He produces a selection of photographs of the day showing, he says, the happiness of the mother at this event.  This all took place in Iran in April 2004.</p>

I shall only summarise this part of her version of events.  She felt under enormous pressure to enter into a marriage both from her own family and from his as I have found to be the case.  She says that the formal proposal (as opposed to the much earlier “agreement”) was in fact made in about February 2004 by the father’s mother and his brother the father being abroad, although it followed on from that “agreement” made when she was a child.  That proposal was accepted by her own family, and the ceremony described above took place only two months later.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the above ceremony there was, she says, a great deal of pressure placed on her by both families to appear to be happy and enjoying the occasion.  This “happiness” is said by the father to be manifest in the photographs and a video of the day.  The mother says she was very sad and unhappy.  One of the inconsistencies in her account of this period is that when carefully cross-examined by Mrs. Crowley she seemed to me to be accepting that she was trusting of her husband, after the numerous affectionate telephone calls described above, and was persuaded that he was indeed something of a romantic, and that she was pleased to be escaping her birth family who, with the exception of her mother in the immediate household and a number of female relatives more distantly located in the village, treated her very badly.  Thus, despite her assertion that she was in effect forced to look happy, it seemed to me that overall her oral evidence described above is the more accurate picture, and that those attending the celebration would be entitled to take away the impression that she was a happy enough bride.  I have found this part of the evidence particularly nuanced, and the oral evidence of the mother invaluable in coming to my conclusions.  I have no doubt this was an agreed marriage in the sense described above, that she faced pressure to go through with it, but that overall she was persuaded that it was no bad thing to enter into it and was reasonably happy to do so, as noted above escaping Iran and her father in the process.  I find her attempt to portray it much more darkly as a young woman entering a marriage wholly against her will to be a re-writing of history in order to create a bleak picture of herself as a victim.  The reality, I find, is much more complex than that, although I also make it clear that I find that had she changed her mind at the last minute and announced that she was not going through with the marriage, I have no doubt at all that the men on both sides of the family would have refused to respect that autonomy, and that she would at best be forced into the marriage, and at worst a graver fate would have befallen her.  Whether or not that darker fate would include her death must abide my findings on the subject of death threats, and their potential for being carried out.  I have to add a cautionary note: having looked at the photographs produced by the father, I see for the most part a very solemn face when looking at her.</p>

Although it comes out of chronological sequence I mention it at this point.  I have described above the wedding carried out in conformity with one version of cultural and religious tradition.  Some weeks after the wedding and the period which followed it (see immediately below) the father returned to England, but had, allegedly to his irritation, to return to Iran to sign a document relating to the marriage necessary for the purposes of obtaining a visa for his wife.  It is not clear to me, the document never having been produced, whether this was a signing of the register (see the reference in paragraph 59 above), and/or was a separate civil ceremony.  Whichever of the two, it is clear that it was a formal part of the administrative process of getting married (even if only the signing of a register) and thus this couple were married not only in religious law but also in civil law.  That there are some such formalities in Iran is made clear by a reference in one of the earlier Iranian official documents to which I have referred (1:C:9) where there is an entry relating to the registration number of the bogus marriage relating to his asylum claim at the Notary Public’s office.</p>

It follows, however, that there is a distinct possibility that, even if I were to find that the father had pronounced a Talaq, that may not have dissolved the marriage between them, unless Iranian law provides for the pronouncement of a Talaq to achieve, without more, that end.</p>

She describes the consummation as a violent episode involving anal and vaginal rape and considerable brutality on the part of the father.  Such was his unbridled sexual appetite that she was taken many times during the night.  Unhappily, a number of her accounts give different periods after the marriage before the commencement of this allegedly brutal behaviour.  For example, in her Criminal Justice Act section 9 statement dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2008, made when she had the advantage of an interpreter, she stated that the father had been very nice to her for the first three months of the marriage.  To a doctor she has suggested the period was four months.  In a further statement in these proceedings dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2009 she said that he was nice to her for a week.  In her statement of May 2010 she suggests he was nice to her for a period of three days.  It was never clarified whether these periods followed the marriage ceremonies in April 2004, or related to the period once she had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2005.  He has certainly said to have been unhappy some few months after the marriage ceremonies when he had, unexpectedly, to fly to Tehran to sign the document referred to in paragraph 59 above, but there is no suggestion that he had been truly unpleasant to her in the period up to her arrival in February 2005.

It was only in his oral testimony, the mother not having been cross-examined to this effect, that he gave evidence that there were two other families staying at this aunt’s home, they only had one air-conditioning machine, and that for this logistical reason only it was both not possible, and rather indelicate even if possible, for the couple to have withdrawn to their own quarters and had further sexual relations.</p>

She says the mother was much more lively than when she had been in Iran, visibly showing her love for her husband, and speaking of it.  I accept this evidence.  It is consistent with her being happy to escape Iran.  She describes intimate public behaviour by the mother, for example taking off the father’s socks, kissing his feet and massaging his legs.  She says “we found this display of affection a bit odd but we did not really say much”.  They privately clearly rather disapproved of it is the impression I am being asked to accept, and she says “we would not have shown affection in this way, especially not as the marriage had not yet taken place”.  In her oral evidence the mother absolutely denied showing affectionate behaviour in this way.  She regards the example given by the aunt of showing intimate behaviour in public to be a figment of NAA’s imagination.  I accept the evidence of NAA on this point.  Once again the mother is re-writing history.  It appears that this witness (NAA), in common with some of the others (see above), is of the view that there had been an engagement party and Nikkah dinner but no more.  The marriage was yet to take place once there was a formal entry into the father’s home.  She is quite clearly of the view that there should have been no consummation prior to that last event.  Had there been a consummation at the couple’s stay with aunt M, the mother would not be the first young woman to have engaged in intimate sexual behaviour including full sexual intercourse with her husband, even though protocol prohibited it, a point properly made by Mrs. Crowley.

The overwhelming weight of evidence, I find, is against the father on this subject, bearing in mind in particular his own family’s rejection of his evidence that entering into the familiar home of his aunt on arrival in Iraq was sufficient to satisfy the traditional rules prevalent even in his family in Iraq.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">His account suggests the contrary: whilst he accepts that the flat was small, he had tidied it, put flowers around for her, and that he had a king-size bed in the bedroom.  He produced photographs to me to support this.  There was clean bed linen, etc.  The sitting room was suitably furnished.  There was fruit and food stuffs in the refrigerator.  She counters by suggesting that these photographs are of a much later period after she had made the flat clean (asserting that that job took her up to a month) and that the furniture came later.  In a particularly compelling passage of the oral evidence she described to me what it felt like to be pregnant and sleeping on a hard floor with three thin blankets.  She described how she would wake in the night and feel constrained in moving, partly by virtue of the pregnancy and partly by not wishing to wake him.  She was distressed by the recollection of what she thought she might be doing to her unborn baby by lying in this way.  I accept that evidence, and thus I find it follows that I prefer her version of the basic condition of the flat to his, even though I think she exaggerates a little as to the dirtiness of it.  Once again the father’s credibility is damaged.  Was he just being prideful in relation to worldly goods, or does this further finding that he is an incredible witness infect other parts of his testimony?</p>

They never had intercourse more than once in any one evening.  Once the pregnancy with R was at the six-month stage they ceased, and did not re-commence having intercourse for two months after the removal of her stitches.

She is, I fear, once again an hopeless historian on the subject of frequency of sexual activity.  In her ABE interviews she spoke of periods of many hours of sexual activity, with the husband having many ejaculations in the course of any one period.  The nature of their sexual behaviour together (as alleged by her) is set out below.  But at this point I simply note that her evidence to me was that he was frequently cruel, and enjoyed watching her suffering during intercourse and/or sexual activity of other kinds.  In describing her misery she was obviously distressed in the witness box, and I have no doubt she was giving me a true account as to how it felt for her as he took his pleasures, paying no regard to her comfort and feelings. Such a finding does not, however, amount to findings accepting the totality of her evidence of his sexual appetites and the manifestation of them.</p>

There is indeed a reference in the vast quantity of paper generated by this case to the possibility of her having genital surgery.  She first spoke of this to a nurse in about June 2008, and when she raised it again with her G.P. she was referred to a hospital for examination and advice.  She was told that it was too late for any surgery to occur.  She accounts for the fact that at no point in the relevant notes is it suggested by her that she was damaged by virtue of the above alleged acts by saying that she felt so uncomfortable with both the G.P. and the doctor to whom she spoke at the specialist clinic.  She felt they were not friendly towards her, and she did not feel able to give an explanation of how her problem had come about, and that on a number of occasions he was the sole interpreter, and even when not there had made his views clear that these matters were not to be published abroad, and that she was too embarrassed and afraid to do so.</p>

The physical damage to her noted in the records relates to the injuries suffered after the birth of R.  She required repairs to tears in the vaginal region, and a torn clitoris.

Often, when listening to such experts, I have heard evidence of the ability of both the vagina and the anal sphincter muscles to accommodate the insertion, even with significant degrees of force, of large objects including a penis, without leaving signs of obvious damage.

On his account she appeared not to hear him come into the room and he watched her transfixed by an explicit pornographic image on the television.  He goes on to describe in some considerable detail the film she appeared to have been watching including a woman having vaginal and anal sexual intercourse with two men at the same time.  He adds much detail, appearing to think the film was of Eastern European origin given the accents of the participants, although he says there was not very much dialogue.  He purported to be shocked.

Curiously, she told me when being cross-examined about this issue that the father had said to her that he had deleted all such channels before she came to the United Kingdom.

As far as the father is concerned I find that he has been indicted by his own very detailed account of what he would expect to find on such channels, etc.  He shows, in my judgment, considerable familiarity with the channels, and the nature of the material, and particularly tellingly, his evidence about the default position of the channels in the daytime reverting to a chat-line.  He is clearly very familiar with such material, and not by being told about it.  This comes from personal experience of watching it.  Whether or not they watched it together, or whether this was a part of his entertainment in her absence and he spoke to her about it, I am not entirely sure, but I am sure that she had access to it and did watch, whether in his company or not.</p>

This condition was that he suffered from enlarged testes, and that these inhibited his sexual performance, limiting him to one ejaculation per period of sexual activity, and pain to his enlarged testes during the act of sexual intercourse.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not know whether or not this behaviour began on their first night together in the flat in Croydon, but I doubt it, and accordingly it is possible to ask why I have not regarded the rest of her evidence on this subject (she being firm in her account that it did begin on that first night) as less than credible.  The simple answer is that I believed her account on the subject of the nature of the assaults, its narrative flow, and its compelling and congruent detail, but that her conflicting evidence as to the length of a number of the period when he was kind to her at the start of their marriage, one of which would take this young couple beyond the time of that first night, contradict her evidence on this point.  I suspect, but cannot come to any concluded view, that her evidence on the date of commencement may be designed to emphasise and exaggerate his brutishness.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">This sexual behaviour may well have followed on from her making her views clear about the nature of the accommodation, and how far they fell short of what she had been led to expect, as well as her increasing withdrawal from him as she became more depressed (see below for my conclusions as to the state of her mental health).  There is reference in the papers to him being sexually frustrated over a long period prior to his marriage, and this, too, may well have led to what she, subjectively, regarded as excessive demands for intercourse and sexual play.  There may well have been other reasons.  I shall not speculate further.</p>

I find at times that he has carried out such acts, and I was, in particular, persuaded that he went so far as to punch her by her compelling oral evidence of one example when he left her with a swollen and bloody lip after such an assault.  Although she was intermittently seeing others at this time, there were other times when she was not, sufficient for such an injury to repair itself without visible sign.  I was unimpressed by the line of questioning best illustrated by the enquiry into why doctors/nurses/midwives had not seen any injuries at ante-natal clinics.  It seemed to me that her straightforward answer that she only bared her stomach for such examinations was entirely credible, and more likely than not to have been the case.  I do not forget that this young woman comes from a culture which has a greater respect for physical modesty than is currently fashionable in the West.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am further reinforced in my view that the mother has been exaggerating her allegations (in part) having heard the evidence of a number of the family’s neighbours in the accommodation in Croydon, and of the mother’s cousin K (a young man who stayed with the mother and father during the summer of 2005).  None of them heard the sort of levels of noise (crying out, screaming and crying) which the mother alleges took place, and which they would have been likely to hear if the assaults had taken place as frequently as she claims.  Given the nature of the accommodation they were occupying, and given that at one stage her cousin K was sleeping in the next room, it is simply not credible that she was making these sorts of sounds at the level and frequency she asserts.  A partial answer to this, accounting for some periods when others might well not have heard her, is to be found in her evidence that when she was crying out in the course of such activities he would stuff her mouth with a sock or his boxer shorts, or put a hand over it to diminish the sound levels.  This sounds all-too credible, and I find it to be a compelling detail despite his denials.  Overall I find she is exaggerating.  However, I do not find the absence of complaint by her to others to be surprising.  These are deeply private matters, and she would have had to trust someone to take her seriously and not report back to the father that she had complained.  There was no such person to whom she could turn, for with the exception of K to whom it would have been wholly inappropriate to complain, she had no relatives or friends.</p>

After a short while she did not wear Moslem dress, and did not speak so frequently of returning to Iran.  He spoke of all the domestic burdens falling on his shoulders because she was frequently unwell and requiring visits to the General Practitioner, and that despite his encouragement and attempts to take her out of their home she always wished to remain there, or, if persuaded to venture forth, to return to it almost immediately.  He goes on to describe her deteriorating mental condition which ultimately led to her admission to the Maudsley Hospital (see below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What is the mother’s version of these early days?  I have given a brief flavour of her account earlier, but here flesh it out a little.   Following her arrival in the United Kingdom in February 2005 she was taken by him to the flat he had previously been living in, and which was to be their marital home.  He had given her a wholly false account of his accommodation, and that the reality was equivalent to a sordid squat, and dirty.  He controlled her, only permitted her to go out when accompanied by him or his brother A and his wife F, and in effect all-but kept her prisoner in the home.  She was not allowed to meet with anyone other than those authorised by him.  On occasions when visitors came to the home (for example his male friends) she would not be allowed to meet them.  She was constantly criticised, belittled, and found herself victim of what she describes as his religious and cultural views which are, she asserts, typical of orthodox Moslem households in the countries from which each of them came (see above for my summary of her evidence on this subject).  His behaviour towards her (including sexual abuse and domestic violence) did indeed lead her to feel depressed (not in a clinical sense) and unhappy, particularly prior to, and following immediately on from, the birth of R.  I accept her evidence on this subject save as to her actual mental state.  Although I have been shown photographs of outings and of her wearing (at times) western clothes and make-up, she is also seen in many of those photographs wearing traditional Kurdish garments.  I have no doubt that by virtue of her sheltered background, lack of education, and inability to speak English, she was indeed lost in this culture, and very isolated, reliant on the opportunities her husband and relations brought her to go out.  She remained, essentially, profoundly isolated and lonely.  In addition, as Mrs. Crowley reminded me, she was not only a young wife in an alien landscape, she fell pregnant within weeks of her arrival, and had a bad time during her pregnancy.  She frequently suffered from morning sickness, and developed gestational diabetes.  The birth of R was a difficult and painful one, leading to the physical consequences described above.  It is not surprising she felt beleaguered.</p>

Nevertheless the material had been made available by the department of the London Borough of Croydon, which was investigating these matters, and was unquestionably relevant to credibility as I also noted at that earlier directions hearing.  I do not criticise the father, or his legal team, for not dealing with these matters in detail in any of his written material in the light of the above indication.  Nor do I criticise them for not asking permission to deal with these matters in evidence in chief.  However, I did permit Miss Theis Q.C. (leading counsel for the mother) to ask questions which essentially went to credibility.  I gave the father a clear and appropriate warning before he answered any of these questions, but he did not exercise what is sometimes mistakenly referred to as “the right to silence”.  Such was the nature of his evidence that I have felt able to come to certain conclusions as to his credibility.  The London Borough of Croydon social services department is a party to these proceedings, although not, quite rightly, represented at this fact-finding hearing.  I emphasise that I do <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> give permission for the social services department to divulge my findings in respect of these financial matters to the department of the local authority which is considering whether or not to prosecute him.</p>

At other times in this country he appears to have had various forms of employment and self-employment including the ownership of a general provisions store.  By virtue of an order I made on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2010 the material prepared by that department for the purposes of considering a prosecution was, with their consent, made available to the MPS initially for the purposes of redacting any information which might lead to knowledge of the whereabouts of the mother, and then, once vetted, to all parties.  At the conclusion of this hearing I do not know what that department has decided in respect of prosecution.  </p>

It is sufficient here to record that he has lied to the Housing Benefit Department; and to the Department of Works &amp; Pensions as to his work, and/or lack of it; he has lied to them about his child-care duties in relation to R, and where R was residing at the time of one particular claim to give but one example; he has lied in respect of obtaining child benefit.  At one point in cross-examination he told me that he had problems with the benefits agency, not knowing how to ring them up to stop the benefit being paid to him.  He has grossly misled his bankers by providing false information as to his income and employer; and, in responding in cross-examination to all of these questions, was patently lying to the court.  To give a further example, he claimed in cross-examination, that his banker had just told him to sign a loan application form and that he, the banker, would make up all the relevant details.  The father spoke of his inability to read English in this context.  At one point in this part of his testimony he told me with a straight face “I don’t know how to lie”: a preposterous claim given the weight and detail of the contrary evidence on this subject.  I have not by any means given a full account of the nature and extent of his duplicity on this subject.  I remind myself that selective credibility is a slippery eel, and that it is perfectly possible for a person to lie at every turn in relation to, for example, the obtaining of unlawful financial reward, and yet be telling the truth in relation to other matters.  I have thus approached issues of credibility (no matter whom the witness) on the basis of the authority of R v Lucas (R) [1981] QB720 73 Cr. App R159.</p>

She began to neglect herself, did not change her clothes and was careless with her personal hygiene.  She was listless.  Her behaviour towards him deteriorated, and when he refused her requests she would from time-to-time hit him, shout at him and swear at him.  She would wake up in the night suffering from nightmares, and would at times hear voices.  She had visual hallucinations as well, for example mistaking a hanging dress for a person in the room.</p>

It is his view that, possibly because of her deteriorating mental health, she did not bond with R.  There was, at the outset, a problem with feeding, she suffering from mastitis; yet she did not know how to use a steriliser, despite frequently being told of the necessity to do so by the midwives, and thus feeding R fell to the father.  She did not care to bathe the boy, nor change his diapers.  She appeared to be frightened of holding him.  It is the father’s case that she liked R when he was asleep, enjoying the idea of a baby without the reality of having to care for him, and she liked taking photographs of him, but his crying and daily needs were not something she could cope with.  In closing written submissions Mrs. Crowley gives many examples of observations by professionals (social workers, health visitors, and others) who speak of a mother who was “detached” from R, who appeared not to have any insight into his needs, nor meet even basic needs for care and attention.  A number of them speak of the father being the parent with whom R had the greater attachment, and who provided nurture for his son.  See references in paragraphs 191 to 199 for contrary evidence from others, and in this context I note that the father himself has given contradictory accounts in which he suggests that the mother does indeed love her son.</p>

One further advantage of this consultation was that, by the time of it, Dr. Wilkins had had access to the mother’s medical records charting her history in considerable detail.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have seen no documents concerning her history in Iran prior to her arrival in this country in February 2005.  However, when seen at the A &amp; E Department of the Mayday Hospital in Croydon on or about 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 (with her husband inferentially acting as her interpreter – for there is no reference to an independent interpreter in the report) she spoke of contact with the Iranian Mental Health Services when she became depressed in Iran in approximately 2003.  Her version of events changes from time-to-time in relation to this period, but it is certainly part of the father’s case that he now knows that the mother’s family were aware that she had mental health problems when she lived in Iran, and had thought that she might improve once living in Europe.  The doctor seeing her in September 2005 was informed that she had no apparent precipitating factors for that earlier referral, but that she had seen a psychiatrist five times, had been given anti-depressants, but did not comply with the medication.  She described her depression as continuing since 2003, but becoming worse since February 2005.  She felt angry and had lashed out at family members in the past.  She spoke of having wanted to commit suicide on four different occasions when in Iran but was prevented from doing so by her mother.  Or so at least the doctor was told by the husband acting as interpreter.  She now asserts that at no time in her life in Iran was she ever ill in this way, and that she had no dealings with the mental health services there.  Her mother, father and brothers support her in this denial.  In addition, they state that no other member of their immediate family (including her brother J) was involved with the mental health services in that country, despite the father’s allegation to the contrary.</p>

The senior charge nurse pointed out accommodation was not in his gift and so was asked for a letter of support for the Housing Department which he supplied.  After giving such a letter reporting the consultation “they assured me that [the mother] would be able to maintain her own safety and would not act on ideas of suicide”.  Two points arise from this last passage:</p>

How could they be so sure given the mother’s alleged history in particular?  It is again part of the mother’s case that her reported and purported behaviour/symptoms were in fact the fruit of her husband’s imagination, and that he told her what to say to the doctors for the same purposes as described in sub-paragraph (i) above.  He had suggested that a reference to mental health problems in Iran would “beef-up” their claims about current problems.</p>

This appointment was set up by the senior charge nurse referred to above.  She was still described as being low in mood.  Although she was “expressing suicidation” (sic) she assured the doctor she had no plan or intent, and that there was no past history of suicide (sic).  One oddity of this report (but it may simply be a question of the different reporting styles of the charge nurse and the doctor) is that in this doctor’s report dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 the mother had allegedly said that “she had been admitted in Iran for depression”.  There is no reference to psychiatric admission in the first report.  On this occasion the doctor describes her mood as “subjectively and objectively low”.  There was no evidence of auditory or visual hallucination, thought disorder, paranoia or delusional ideation.  He referred her to the community mental health team.  On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 she was seen by a consultant psychiatrist (FM) at an outpatient clinic at the Tamworth Road Resource Centre.  Her husband accompanied her but only joined her for the later part of the interview.  She was throughout accompanied by a Farsi speaking interpreter.  Having described being depressed for some two years, she went on to talk of a difficult relationship with her parents and at times feeling suicidal when in Iran.  She described two occasions to him (one involving a knife and another her father’s gun) but she had been prevented by her mother from carrying out these acts.  She described her husband as “generally supportive but she is difficult at times with him”.  She wanted her own space.  She had occasional current suicidal ideation.    On joining the consultation the father spoke of being unaware of her psychiatric problems prior to marriage, but hoped to be advised by the mental health services on how to manage her feelings.  The doctor noted that she appeared depressed.  He further noted her report of occasional auditory hallucinations (mainly of her mother).  It was her view that she suffered from depression and that, post the birth of R, she should have a trial of anti-depressant medication.</p>

She described being increasingly depressed following the birth of R, a self-diagnosis with which the doctor agreed, he recommending anti-depressant medication.

The appointment had been brought forward as there were worries expressed by the clinical psychologist who was seeing her regularly because the mother reported feeling increasingly unwell and that she had, on occasion, “hit the baby”.  The mother had agreed with the psychologist to a Child in Need referral to social services but had misunderstood the instruction and had attended on her own rather than with her husband.  To the doctor she said she continued to feel depressed and had nightmares both about her mother and her baby.  She admitted to continuing to hear voices on occasions, sometimes those voices talking to her about her mother and sometimes about herself.  She indicated that similar nightmares and voices had occurred when she lived in Iran prior to her marriage.  She described the first month with her husband in the U.K. as being very happy and she was pleased to leave Iran and particularly her father of whom she was afraid.  With pregnancy, however, came the above symptoms.  She reported that, to some extent, her husband reminded her of her father, although she admitted that “he [her own father] was aggressive towards her and her husband is generally kind and caring”, although she did not feel he was the right person for her and didn’t get on with him.  She spoke of her irritability with the baby but denied hitting him.  She continued to report auditory hallucinations.</p>

I believe the answer to be self-evident: the mother is, in many respects, an inconsistent reporter of events in her life, both historical and more recently as appears from the above material.  She has changed her position even in the period covered by the letters let alone later, particularly in relation to the nature of her marriage to, and relationship with, her husband as can be seen.  It is said by the father that the mother’s credibility is highly suspect, that she was historically, unquestionably, mentally unwell during a significant period (or periods), and that her presentation (described above to the various professionals in the mental health field with whom she came into contact) was not only consistent with, but also supportive of, a proper diagnosis of mental ill-health, rather than a woman engaging in an elaborate subterfuge at the behest of her husband (see paragraphs 163 – 171 below).

She also told Dr. Wilkins that she had “even been threatened with physical and sexual violence and even (sic) killing by one of her brothers” (probably J – see below), although the context of this allegation is not altogether clear from his report.  In her statement in these proceedings of April 2009 she speaks of the period before her marriage when she tried to persuade her family that she should not marry the father.  She alleges that her brother J said that “it is either death or you belong to him”.  She suggests that she took J’s threat very seriously.  In a more recent context, following the murder of BM in 2006, that murder allegedly being carried out because BM had divorced her first husband and tried to marry another man, she speaks of J’s response when she spoke to him by telephone following her separation from the father and her establishing a relationship with the Afghan male to whom I make further reference elsewhere.  J allegedly said to her on this occasion “if I am only in the U.K. for one day I will use that day to fuck you and then I will kill you”.</p>

She was told to say that she had visual and auditory hallucinations; that she had tried to commit suicide in Iran; that her mother had prevented her from so doing, etc.  She was told to select another member of her family as also suffering from mental health problems, and accordingly she chose her brother J with whom she did not get on.  She was told to lie about having had a doctor in Iran.  She was further told to say that she found herself incapable of controlling her temper, and that she was not able to look after R.  She was required, by him, to indicate to the doctor that she hit the father, that she broke things in the home, and that after such events she would forget that they had ever occurred.  It is thus that she accounts for what the doctors have considered to be her lack of insight into her “mental illness”.

Although she did not claim to have been seriously injured in any of his assaults, she spoke of being pushed to the floor, kicked and punched, and that on occasions he would use a slipper or a hose-pipe to assault her, there being some act of violence on a daily basis.

They informed her that the father was going to divorce her.  When he arrived he indicated that he did not want to be married to her and, she says, a Talaq was pronounced.

There was a meeting between both families.  Her brother (not named but undoubtedly J) threatened the father, but also said that her brother would kill her if something was wrong in the relationship” (see below).  It was her belief that in fact they had not been formally divorced, and in describing the dispute between the two families about how to proceed, there is a suggestion (noted by Dr. Wilkins) that her family was, at that stage, being supportive of her with the exception of one brother.  I shall consider this period again in much more detail below.</p>

One night they were staying in an hotel.  It is the mother’s account to Dr. Wilkins that, during that evening, she was drugged, possibly with medication that she had been prescribed on her discharge from hospital in 2006.  Since she has elsewhere claimed that she did not take any of that medication for she received none, it is a puzzle to me that she was carrying it on this occasion.  She describes awakening from her drugged state and found herself restrained (tied to the bed) and her husband and child missing.  She pursued them to Iraq but was prevented by his family from having any contact with them.  She has never seen the child again.  For other more detailed versions of these events see below.</p>

She was also unable to speak English.  It is understandable therefore that she may have felt subservient to her husband and easily coerced by him.

At no stage does Dr. (FM) appear to have considered that the account given by Ms.B might have been influenced by her husband. ….. there appeared to be no particular difference in her presentation when the interviews were conducted through her husband than through an interpreter …. there is nothing in the notes to suggest that staff at any stage suspected Mr. A being a malign influence and housing benefit issues are hardly mentioned.  Ms. B did not imply or reveal information to suggest this and did not take the opportunities that were given when she was seen alone and with the benefit of an interpreter to declare the true situation ….. Ms B’s suggestion now that she presented the clinical information that she did simply to obtain benefits or accommodation preferentially at the behest of her husband does not fit easily with the amount of contact she really had with mental health services during that period.  It also has to be emphasised that the services responsible for Ms. B’s care during this period are amongst the best in the country if not the best.  Whilst accepting entirely that no-one is infallible, it seems unlikely that Ms. B would have been able to effectively dupe these services consistently over the period of time concerned to the extent that it was not even suspected that she might be presenting genuine clinical information”.</p>

Does her apparent recovery noted above support her account that the depressive episode and psychotic symptoms were false accounts?

He suggested to her that the notes recorded her as being depressed and suicidal, and she acknowledged that she had said that but that it had been untrue.  All of the alleged symptoms and problems related “to her husband’s pressure to present symptoms in that way in order to obtain an advantage in relation to housing and benefits” (in other words maintaining her earlier explanations).  The more Dr. Wilkins pressed her about the old records relating to herself, her family, her life in Iran etc., the more she repeated the above explanation.  She maintained that she had been threatened by her husband even when he was not present at any interviews with medical staff, and he had told her that he might go to prison if she failed to keep up the pretence.  She had not reported the truth because she thought there was no sufficient confidentiality and that everything she said would get back to him.</p>

I touched earlier on the medication she said she thought she had been required to take when drugged by her husband and abandoned in her hotel room in Meriwan; but at this interview she said she had taken no such medication with her, and had simply been given “headache tablets” which had made her sleepy.  In her recent substantial statement in these proceedings she said that she had in fact been given a tablet for a headache by her husband, but that in fact it must have been a sleeping tablet of some kind.  Thus the account recorded in this paragraph is more consistent with her current explanation set out in her June 2010 affidavit.

In so finding, I do recognise that her own immediate family have a significant personal and social investment in not admitting that there was any such problem with her.  Had there been any such problems, and were they now to admit them, they would, at the least, be accused by the paternal side of the family of deception in presenting her as a young marriageable woman with no blemish in her background, for mental ill-health is indeed regarded as shameful in their culture.

The first is that the circumstances of her early home life are to some extent a pre-figuring of her early married life in Croydon: unstimulated educationally, very restricted in her social life, and kept at home.  The second factor is the evidence of the father’s uncle AB, who is roughly her equivalent in age and grew up in the same village as her.  He described her being taken to the hospital on occasions by her father, and although he was not told, and did not ask, and did not speculate upon, her condition, there is nothing in the maternal family’s evidence to suggest that she was suffering from any medical condition requiring hospital treatment on more than one occasion.  I believe that she did indeed have a very hard life in her parent’s home, and that it is more probable than not that she did indeed suffer from some condition the precise diagnosis for which is not being divulged by the family.  I should note that AB struck me as one of the few witnesses called by either side of the family as not speaking from a script.

In other words, crudely put, he was trading on her real mental health problems in an attempt to exact financial advantage from the local authority and the State.  This is not to diminish the fact that I also find (apparently – but not in reality - contradictorily) that he was at times genuinely worried about her mental health.  I think that worry was more likely than not based on two features: the social consequences in his culture of having a wife so suffering; and his own wish that she would recover from this illness and be the sort of wife to him which he had anticipated.  It cannot be underestimated, in my view, that the social forces operating within his world were profoundly antagonistic both to mental health problems and dissolution of marriage.</p>

In other words, such was her own pre-marital history, his behaviour towards her, and her response to that behaviour, that she did suffer from the above mental health difficulties, and has now, being separated from his behaviour and those pressures surrounding it, recovered.</p>

The evidence persuades me that at times her mental health problems were such that they did indeed impair her ability to look after R.  Although I have not heard any independent witnesses from the period of her time in the mental health unit and in her dealings overall with the specialist mental health services, social services and health services, and thus their opinions have not been tested in cross-examination.  I am persuaded by the significant number of independent entries throughout the medical records, and particularly when she was on that mother and baby unit with R, to find that there were serious worries about her abilities.  </p>

I should emphasise, however, that the evidence of her ability to look after R is not a one-way street when under such observation.  There are a number of entries in the nursing notes for this period of her admission to the unit to establish that, on occasions, she was a very attentive, caring and loving mother.</p>

There are times when the nursing notes record that she behaved lovingly and entirely appropriately towards R.  I heard evidence from the father’s aunt (NAA) and her daughter (HA) to the effect that whilst they did have worries at various times about her child care, at other times she behaved entirely properly.  These two last identified witnesses were not the only ones to speak in this way about her.  Her sister-in-law (F) also said that when she was well she was a good mother, and no-one doubts her love for R, save for the father in his current stance, and his mother.</p>

There is one dispute in particular relating to a burn on his bottom.  Apparently he came into contact with an oil drum (part of a heating system common to those parts of Iran and Iraq where these families lived).  It is the father’s case that the mother caused this burn when she pushed R and he fell against the drum, and the mother’s that the injury was sustained whilst in the care of the father’s family.  Although a number of witnesses spoke about it, I am unable to come to any finding as to which household had the care of the boy when this injury was sustained.  The only finding I feel entitled to make on this subject is that I do not consider it probable that, whichever household this occurred in, the injury was deliberately and cruelly inflicted.  It is more likely than not to have been the result of inattentive care rather than positive assault.  I do not make findings in respect of other allegations of injury to the boy.  The evidence does not to my satisfaction entitle me to come to any conclusion on the balance of probabilities, or even on the basis of levels of suspicion which would be insufficient in any event, in respect of any of them.</p>

In the early stages when the mother and father were apart, any contact between her and R was to be supervised.  In addition the father was to seek help and support from family and friends, including the provision of respite care.  There were to be announced and unannounced visits to R by social services, including late night and early calls by members of the emergency duty team.  The mother was not a formal signatory to that document.</p>

She did not realise that this was unacceptable in terms of this culture’s approach to child care.  She has denied leaving R in her oral evidence, but I was impressed by the evidence of the neighbour (Mrs. ST) referred to above, who told me that she had met the mother when the latter was coming home, and discovered that R had been left.  The mother lied to her by saying that she had just been to the doctor’s surgery, although that establishment lay in the opposite direction from which the mother had come.   It follows that the mother also lied to me in order to protect herself, or her image of herself as a faultless mother.</p>

He tells me that family members have told him to divorce his wife but this is not an option for him.  He feels that he is responsible for her as he brought her to the United Kingdom”.  (2:D:7).  I have already given my view earlier that cultural pressures on the father militated against a divorce.  I do not accept Mrs. Crowley’s submission that the weight of the evidence suggests that whatever may be the cultural position in Iran, in Iraq there is less stigma attaching to divorce, and as long as both parties walk away from the table with honour it is not a major issue.  Both of these families, in their different ways, are deeply enmeshed in traditional views of what is proper and what is not.  There are examples of this applicable to the paternal family littered throughout this judgment.  See immediately below for what the father says was the mother’s position shortly after this interview.</p>

In the course of his oral evidence the father distanced himself from any notion that he was contemplating a divorce at this stage, but I do not believe him.  For whatever reason I believe he was by this time thoroughly disenchanted with his married life, and had decided that it should end whenever he could properly bring that about.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept his evidence that it was his wife who raised first the question of divorce.  He speaks of her so doing in the presence of his older brother A and that man’s wife F, and a third person O, in about October 2006.  He suggests that she was so disenchanted with his failure to obtain larger council accommodation and large quantities of money for her family that when she realised he was not going to be able to provide any for her she started lobbying for a divorce.  He says that he did not wish to have one and loved her.  This purported conversation in October 2006 is not long after the interview referred to above taking place on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006.  The reasons given for continuing with the marriage are quite different in each one.  I find that if anything was driving him at this stage it was some sense of family duty, and he was far from love.  The overall weight of his evidence to me is that by this stage life with her was insupportable.  I find that the impulse to divorce came from him.  I shall say more of this later.</p>

He says he had wanted her to receive love and support from her own family as well as to visit his.  She says it was for a three month holiday and nothing to do with a mental health problem from which she did not suffer.  It is a further oddity of his case that if he believed, as he purports to have done, that the mother was a real danger to R, and could not be left unsupervised with him (see his agreement with the local authority dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2006), that he put the mother and R on an aeroplane unaccompanied for a four hour flight. It was his evidence to me that he took her to the airport, that she was to be met at the other end, and that in his experience he had seen cabin crew assist in the care of children where mothers were unwell.  Notably absent from this part of his evidence was any suggestion that he had drawn any potential problem (if indeed one ever existed) to the attention of the airline and/or staff so that they could keep an eye on this mother.  I do, however, find that he was indeed concerned about her mental health at this time, and am so persuaded in particular by the evidence of Mrs. ST who told me that he had expressed his concerns to her about the mother’s mental health problems, and particularly at this time of the mother’s return to Iran.  I found, as I have made clear above, Mrs. ST to be a thoroughly honest and compelling witness.  This concern may be attributable to his worry about her having any part in the care of R and the need for her to be supervised when back in Iran.  It may have been borne of his anxiety to ship her back to Iran, and that he was worried that she would not be allowed on the aeroplane.  This area was not explored in detail in evidence, and I make no finding as to why he expressed his worry to Mrs. ST.</p>

It is her case that this was a “put-up” job, the paternal grandfather and the doctor being old friends, and the doctor being persuaded by the father-in-law to give a false diagnosis of mental health problems.  The paternal grandfather told me that whilst he knew this man and respected him in a professional context, they were not old friends, and no such request had been made of the doctor.  The advice from the medic was that electro-convulsive therapy be administered.  It was a suggestion rejected by the maternal family when they were consulted by the paternal grandfather.  I prefer the paternal grandfather’s account of this visit and accept that he raised it with the maternal family in the way he described.

I am satisfied, and do not feel the need to go beyond this, that the father had an opportunity to present his litany of complaints which included the mother’s failure to look after him, and their home properly, and that she was a bad mother to R, failing in her practical and emotional duties to their son, but, as noted above, made no reference to her mental health.  I so find in the face of the mother’s denial that issues arose relating to her child-care.  It is clear from his evidence (accepted by me) that he went carefully prepared for this meeting, although elsewhere in his evidence he says that the meeting had not been a long-planned one.  His preparations included taking a broken remote control device for a television set, broken he asserts by her in a spasm of temper when she could not get her own way, and also a copy of the agreement reached by him with Social Services which in summary provided that he would not leave the mother alone with R.</p>

This incensed both the mother’s father and her brother J.  That last-named individual is, as I noted above, described in the papers as being hot-tempered, unstable, and given to making threats including threats of violence.  I am satisfied that at this meeting he initially threatened his own sister and at the conclusion of the meeting threatened to kill the father.  It is abundantly clear from the mother’s father’s evidence that her side of the family considered (initially at least) that she was at fault for the marital tribulations.  Her father-in-law wanted her to go to Iran and leave R with them in Iraq.  Her father rejected this proposal.  He wanted her and R to go with him to Iran, and he would then send her and the child back to England.  For whatever reason, which remains opaque to me, the father did not pronounce a Talaq at that time.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This meeting seems to have been about the practical arrangements concerning where the mother and R should live.  It was quite clear that the father did not want the mother to return to the United Kingdom, that his own family still wanted her and R to remain under their eye in Iraq, and that she and her father were extremely keen that she returned to the United Kingdom with R and her husband.  There was also some talk about a divorce although nothing was concluded.  Both the father and his aunt NAA spoke of this, both in print and orally.  Overall my sense of it is that the father was indeed questioning how the mother could return to the United Kingdom if they were divorced, but in the context of a discussion about giving her a period to recover her health for family pressure was still in favour of struggling on, against his clear wishes.    Was this duplicitous on his part, for I have already noted that by January 2007 it seems to me that he was unhappy within this marriage.   I find that he had decided to end his marriage but had at this point taken no formal steps, because of that family’s pressures.  The mother in her statement of May 2010 says this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following that meeting she and R stayed on in the father’s family home in Iraq.  After a period she left and went back to Iran, but without R who remained in Iraq at the insistence of the father’s father.  She says, and I accept, that she gave her parents a comparatively full account (but without mentioning sexual assaults to them) of her life in England, it being a taboo in her culture to speak of these things.  She had told her mother of some of her allegations, but her mother had quietened her informing her that these were private matters between her and her husband.  She also says that, at this stage, she told her parents about what the father had required her to do in lying to the English authorities concerning her mental health problems.  Her father was absolutely furious with her for what he regarded as her incredible stupidity in joining with the father in what he thinks was a huge deception on the authorities.  Her father said he would nevertheless  help her financially and attempt to get her a visa, so she could return to England once she had collected R from Iraq.  He insisted, however, that she report the father’s behaviour to the police once she was back in England.  Having heard her and her father I accept this part of their evidence.  She returned to Iraq some two weeks later at about the end of May 2007, collected R and went back to Iran.  There are once again conflicting accounts of how it came about that she was allowed to remove R from the paternal grandparents’ home.  I make no finding either way in respect of this matter.</p>

In what I found to be a telling and compelling part of her evidence she told me that her plight was a stark one.  She could not return to her own family who would have rejected her whether divorced or not, and could not live alone in either Iran or Iraq without any means.  Nor could she remain, divorced or otherwise, in the father’s family home in Iraq.  Thus her only option was to go back to him.  Furthermore, she was, as noted above, pregnant by him and carrying his second child.  Her father had no investment in her remaining in Iran with them.  He wanted her to go back to her husband.  She had no choice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother had been fitted with a coil as prophylaxis.  This had been done in 2006, but was subsequently removed because she believed that she had suffered ill-health as a result of this device.  Having established that she was not pregnant she sought an alternative form of prophylaxis and was fitted with an implant to prevent unwanted pregnancies.  Her brother K’s wife then suggested that the ill-health which followed this procedure might be because she was pregnant, and so she had the implant removed.  A doctor carried out the removal.  She was indeed pregnant following sexual intercourse with the father probably in early 2007.  There is a dispute as to whether or not that pregnancy was terminated with her consent.  She says she did not agree and he says the contrary.  At one stage of her account she told me that he had promised to punch her in the stomach if she did not consent to a termination.  The documents from the Marie Stopes clinic which carried out the procedure do not reveal very much detail on this subject.  Thus I have to determine the issue on the basis of the oral evidence.  The mother had just returned from Iran to a husband who, on the face of it, did not want her to be there.  I shall describe in a moment what she says was a surprising change in his behaviour shortly after her return, but at this stage note that within days of her returning she had an appointment at the general practitioner to discuss options including a termination.  Thereafter she was very swiftly referred to the Marie Stopes clinic, and attended it with the father.  There was no independent interpreter.  Thus, this young woman, still unable to speak the language with any facility, if at all, had to discuss as best she could these intimate issues involving fine points of consent in the presence of the father who, I find, did not want a second child by this mother.   I have no doubt at all that this pregnancy was terminated as a result of the father’s decision imposed upon the mother.  I have no doubt at all that he had set his face against such a further responsibility and commitment.  Accordingly, I reject his evidence that the mother told him that she had had such a bad time during the first pregnancy, and at the time of the birth of R, that she did not want another child.  In the witness box he was wholly unconvincing as he tried to persuade me that he had taken no real part in the discussion, had not assisted the mother in filling out the relevant forms, and indeed had barely entered the front door of the building save to deposit her at reception.  I did not believe a word of his account.  I have no doubt at all that he was the interpreter, and that she was under enormous pressure from him.  He, by this stage, was anxious to break ties with her, and I find he did not want the complication of a further child, and the obligations both to the child and to her which would come with it.</p>

On the first day of his oral evidence he seemed to agree that there had been a sea-change in their relationship and that they were both trying hard to be nice to each other.  However, on the second day of his evidence, when asked to confirm that the above was accurate, he changed tack altogether and described the mother as “difficult, critical and argumentative” almost from the start.  This, unhappily, is not the only example of a change of evidence relating to this period, for in her ABE interview the mother had described the father as being ill-tempered and badly behaved towards her at this time, clearly not wanting her back.  Neither party is entirely credible as to the temperature between them at this period, but overall I am inclined to think that the father was acting deviously and putting on a good show for her in order to facilitate what I find followed.  Nevertheless he did agree that he had attempted to arrange a holiday in Germany as part of his attempt to keep the marriage alive.</p>

He continued giving evidence on a third day, having had ample opportunity to make his enquiries overnight.  He did not proffer any information in relation to this family or any of the above details.

There is a passage in the affidavit of the mother’s solicitor (Ms. Anne-Marie Hutchinson) where, based on her instructions from the mother, the mother asserts that on or about 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2007 the father <span style="text-decoration:underline">forced</span> the mother and R to travel to Iran.  There is contradictory evidence from the mother about this period, for she told me, as I noted above, that the father was being surprisingly pleasant to her on her return to the United Kingdom, once he had got over his shock.  After the failure of the German trip he then suggested that he would take her on a surprise trip to Iran to show her some of the beauties of that country which she had not hitherto seen.  He wanted her to keep it secret between themselves so that her own family and indeed his were not informed of this journey.  She went along with him although she wondered if he was plotting something when he made many telephone calls to what she believed were members of her family en route to the airport.  Her account about this trip is not that she was forced to go to Iran at all, but that she went consensually for what she hoped would be a holiday.  I have, after considering this change of tone, finally come to the conclusion that there was a mis-understanding as between her and Ms. Hutchinson when the latter was drafting the first affidavit, and that this was not a fundamental change of account by the mother.  </p>

He gave, in my view, wholly inconsistent evidence about their discussions leading to a return.  He told me in his oral evidence that the mother had been extremely argumentative before they left London following the failure of the German holiday (as she perceived it to be).  She had taunted him, complained about his inability to provide a greater standard of living, etc.  They had agreed to divorce.  As for the care of R, he told me that it was at this stage that she ceded R to the care of the father and his family because she did not wish to be encumbered with the child.  It was his latter evidence that they were still discussing the care of R as an undecided question following their return, for he told me of conversations which he said had occurred in the hotel in Meriwan.  I did not believe him as to either set of conversations, the internal inconsistency being too great, as well as finding his presentation of this evidence in the witness box completely unconvincing.</p>

That family threatened to kill her, she was beaten, pushed to the ground and kicked, and forced to sign a document giving custody of R to the father.  It is alleged in Ms. Hutchinson’s statement that the paternal family threatened to kill R in front of the mother,  and had a gun pointed at the little boy’s throat.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Exhibited to the statement of her brother K, who also gave evidence to me via an audio link and through an interpreter, is a translated document dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2008.  According to this witness it was obtained at the request of the mother following her return to England in February 2008.  I remind myself of the mother’s evidence that her own father was requiring her at this point in the chronology to make complaint to the English authorities about the father’s behaviour and to get R back, which she was doing.  The document was probably produced to support the mother’s complaint to the police in England made about this time.  There is no suggestion on the father’s part that this document is a falsely manufactured one, and in particular no such suggestion was made to K when he was cross-examined.  I accept K’s evidence and consider the document to be a reasonably reliable account of these events in its essential particulars.  This document, in significant respects, confirms the mother’s evidence about her abandonment.  It describes her being found helpless after she cried out, and that when she left the next day she was still worried and crying, and bore the visible mark of a “blow” on her face.  [N.B. I accept the evidence also of her brother H to her brother K that the former found that the mother had bruised wrists when he subsequently saw her].  In the course of those passages she also describes how the hotelier allowed her to speak by telephone (corroborated by the hotelier) to her family (the individuals are unspecified) who were very angry with her and said “that if you come back to us we will kill you, we do not want a stupid girl like you”.  The mother’s father denied that he had spoken to her on that day, as did her brother K.  Thus there is a question as to whom it was she spoke.  Whether or not the mother has the chronology quite right in relation to telephone calls and to whom she spoke on which occasions, I am fully persuaded by the evidence I have heard that indeed her own family were extremely angry with her, for as described above, her father had made considerable financial sacrifices to raise the money to pay for her return to the United Kingdom about late July 2007, only to find that she had returned to Iran and been duped by her husband.  Her own father was so cross with her that I find he did indeed decline at that stage to help her.  Both K and the maternal grandfather gave evidence about this.  Both were still incensed by what they regarded as her stupidity.  The brother K spoke of this day, calling it the worst one of his life.  It seems to me, however, that this description related in part at least to the disruption of his own social arrangements caused by the telephone call, as well as his overwhelming anger at his sister.  As I have noted above the mother is, in my view, inconsistent as to details, and although she refers to her own father being spoken to by her from the hotel he denies any such conversation, and I am more inclined to accept his evidence on this than hers.  I do not think that her unreliability on this point overall infects her evidence as to the essential matters on this subject in any serious way.</p>

I regard that last suggestion as illustrating the flaw in this submission: in none of the places visited by this couple were they unknown, or at least unidentified.  Although they were not known intimately to the hotelier in Meriwan their respective passports had been handed over to the staff, and as is consistent with many destinations throughout the world their details would have been carefully noted in the hotel records, thus making them easily traceable.  That would not be a place to commit a murder.</p>

It is her evidence that she took matters into her own hands and went to stay with a person who aided her.  She then went to see her father-in-law, demanding to see R.  The father and his own mother were present and “beat her up” calling her a whore and asking “why have you come to get someone else’s child.  He is not your son, he is ours”.  Her father-in-law pointed a gun at her threatening to kill her if she did not leave.  She was told before leaving that she must sign something but was not told the content of it, although she feared it was something to do with R.  She put her thumb print to the document only because a gun was at her neck.  It was on this occasion that she alleges she was given a copy of the purported “agreement” to which I refer below.  When she asked to see her son “they” put a gun to the boy’s neck and threatened to kill him if she did not leave.  She denies that representatives of the two families were present when an allegedly consensual agreement was reached.  I shall set out my findings on this account later.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the many puzzles in this case, particularly when considering the mother’s actions, and her credibility in her descriptions of those alleged actions, is that, on a number of occasions, even when she says she is the subject of death threats from the father’s family, she walks into the lion’s den.  The visit she made to the father’s family home, allegedly in pursuit of her son, and when she says she was facing a real risk to her life, is a striking example.  Were these acts of hers (if true) driven by desperation to retrieve her son?  Or do they suggest that there was no risk at all because there were no threats to her, and no acts by the father or members of his family which might suggest she was at risk?  Or is there some other explanation (see below for my findings)?</p>

He says that the maternal grandfather and J travelled to Iraq, and that, at the third family meeting, he pronounced the Talaq in front of both his and her families.  He did this even though the two families were not on good terms.  A settlement of divorce was arranged whereby he handed over money (US$ 10,000) to her and a property.  He alleges that it was further agreed that he would be R’s main carer and that R would stay with him in Iraq.  [In relation to the pronouncement of a Talaq he is inconsistent in his evidence, for although he has given the above account in writing he later changed his evidence orally and said the witnesses were not present at the time, and that the Talaq was pronounced only in front of his family.  Thus, even leaving aside the change of account, on the second version there are no objective witnesses to speak to this.]</p>

The maternal grandfather and the mother’s brother J were present.  It was suggested in oral evidence by one of the father’s witnesses that her father and/or brother were telephoning her at regular intervals to discuss aspects of the purported agreement.    I regard this as wholly improbable and reject it.  In these families, as is agreed, it is the men who sit round and negotiate.  The women are not consulted, even though the discussions affect them profoundly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">J has not given evidence in these proceedings.  The answer to that omission is perhaps the obvious dislike of the mother for J whenever she spoke of him.  Thus, her legal team would be dissuaded, at its lowest, from approaching him.  The mother’s dislike is allegedly based on her childhood memories of him, but in more recent times upon his aggressive temperament, and his direct threats to her own safety and indeed her life at the first meeting by way of example (see above).  The omission is, forensically, an unhappy one.  I have been deprived of assessing the evidence of a crucial witness not only in relation to this purported agreement, but also in relation to alleged threats to kill, and earlier acts said to have been perpetrated by this brother.  I have given my speculation as to why he has not been called, but there may well be, as Mrs. Crowley submits, more fundamental reasons than that, namely that he would give an account which fatally undermines the mother.  That proposition must, unhappily, remain simply recorded as a speculation.</p>

The evidence of the maternal grandfather is that whilst there was some loose talk of divorce nothing was concluded.  He went on to say at one stage of his evidence that he was not present when the sum of $US10,000 was discussed as part of a divorce settlement, and at other parts of his evidence saying that he was present but that no agreement on the principle let alone the amount had been finalised.  It is suggested by all that there was some discussion of a shop as part of the divorce settlement, although again the position is not pellucid.  It is said by the father that a shop was purchased (I am not clear in whose name) with part of the mother’s wedding jewellery which had been given to her on her marriage, but sold in order to acquire this property.  This has never been clarified to my satisfaction.  Yet both the shop and the sum in dollars appear to have been on the table in some sense at some stage, possibly only in the presence of J.  I regret that the opacity of these talks does not support any clearer finding.</p>

On a subsequent day when the maternal grandfather’s evidence was being concluded she put to him as part of the father’s case that he was doing his best to protect his “much-loved daughter” by entering into this agreement.  I still find myself baffled, despite Mrs. Crowley informing me that she was simply “testing out the waters” with a number of potential theories, how this part of the case is put by him.</p>

I have considered whether or not the paternal grandfather might have required her to put her thumbprint at the foot of a blank sheet of paper and filled in a purported agreement and signatures at a later stage, but this does not fit with the mother’s evidence either, for she told me in her statement that the document was already made out.  </p>

That manuscript draft was sent down to the town to be typed, this exercise taking over an hour.  Those present at the meeting then dispersed, and when the document returned that witness did not see any other witness sign, for it had been couriered around them and signed by each one as it came his way.  He was the last to sign, for it already had 15 signatures on it.  It did not, by that stage, have the mother’s thumbprint on it.  He said that all these signatures were collected by a man (O) who has not made a statement and not given oral evidence.  All this was achieved in a period of two hours and on one day.

Furthermore, it is more consistent with families who believe in “honour”, including honouring agreements, that if there had indeed been an agreement that she be divorced on the above terms, her own father would have been the first to tell me.  Yet he consistently supports her in this if in nothing else, and twice in concluding passages of his oral evidence begs this court to secure the return of her son to her.  This does not sound like a consensual divorce to me, and I accordingly accept that on the balance of probabilities, although I have had no handwriting expert testimony in relation to the signatures, that the document purportedly signed by the maternal grandfather and J is an ex post facto artefact and at least in relation to the first-named signatory, a forgery.</p>

He told me, although he gave inconsistent evidence about it, that he had raised the money partly through his brother A, and partly through the usual informal arrangements with “friends” in the Kurdish community in England.  He could give no sensible account of raising this money, from whom, when, and when, if at all, he had made repayments.  There was no documentary evidence to support his account that the sum had been wired at short notice to Iraq.  He told me that the agreement had been negotiated and the terms consented to on what I shall call “day one”, but that the agreement did not come into effect until “day two”, he having been given a deadline of 10:00am on day two to provide the money.  Once he had given the cash the mother “signed” with her thumbprint.  Had he indeed had such a sum wired, it would have been open to him to produce documentary evidence to support a transfer of such a significant sum of money on the relevant day.  No such documentary evidence has been provided.  No evidence from any of the “friends” has been provided.  His brother A gave evidence, and gave no, or no satisfactory account of this period.  Nor have I seen any documents to support the transfer of ownership of land in the form of a shop.  I simply do not believe the father’s account on this subject.  Even were he to produce such documentation it would not change my view in relation to my finding in paragraph 251 above that there was no consensual arrangement as to the future care of R by the father and/or members of his family.</p>

In support of her evidence asserting that she has not been divorced, the mother, and some members of her family who gave evidence about the subject, made it abundantly clear that the family did <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> believe in divorce, and that there was no history of any divorce within their family or previous generations.  This issue had not been raised by either side until she gave this evidence.  A number of names were put to these witnesses (including the mother’s father) and they were all in their answers on this subject in my view consistent with each other.  I initially believed them as to the absence of divorce in that family.  I found it an odd part of the evidence that the father did not raise this issue until quite so late in the day, for there was nothing in print from him despite many pages of written material until the mother referred to it and one of his witnesses spoke of this subject, the relevant statement being filed towards the end of the second week of the hearing.  The maternal grandmother (who was alleged to be a first wife gravely put out by the taking of  a second one by the maternal grandfather) was not even asked about these matters when she gave her oral evidence.  If it was intended to be relevant to undermining the credibility of the mother’s family, it did not at first succeed.  It was, I believe, not only thought by him to be relevant to that, but was part of the father’s case to support his contention that the maternal family did indeed agree to a divorce taking place because there was no cultural or social shame in a divorce as long as there were good reasons for it.</p>

She gave an account, supplemented by her oral evidence on the penultimate and the last day of oral evidence that she was a 14 year-old servant in the house to whom the grandfather had taken a fancy.  He seduced her, she fell pregnant, and he paid the man to whom she had been promised a significant sum of money in order to release her.  He then married her whilst she was pregnant.  She gave birth to a son (M), now dead from an overdose of opium.  The maternal grandmother of R was so put out by this that she left the household and went to live with her sister-in-law and brother.  She did not return for a year, having successfully lobbied her husband into rejecting the second wife and son.  AQ gave a considerable amount of detail about what followed thereafter, including an agreement that he would pay maintenance which he dishonoured, and ultimately having to take a DNA test to establish paternity.  He continued to pay nothing despite her approach to a number of courts.  The son did not see his father although attempts were made to effect this.  Eventually she re-married and had other children.  Although it was not in her statement she spoke in her oral evidence about that son (M) who had wished to take a bride, and who wanted to live in the ‘big house’ with his father.  He made an approach to his father which was rebuffed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I listened carefully to her evidence, and the tone was one of long-standing outrage at the way she had been treated as a pregnant girl, and the way she and her son had subsequently been treated.  I am sorry to say that her account had the ring of truth.  It was compelling in its detail and the manner in which she gave it, although of course I had the disadvantage of not being able to see her.  I disbelieved the maternal grandmother in her denials, and find the account of AQ to be a truthful one, save in one respect.  I do not believe that the solicitor/interpreter calling from London was the first she knew of this.  I have no doubt at all that someone in the father’s family, possibly the father himself, was the one to make the approach.  They knew she was disenchanted, or likely to be, tracked her and gave the contact details to the father’s solicitors in London.  I do not think that lie by her undermines her credibility as to the main part of her story.  I well-understand the points made by Miss Theis in her closing submissions, and particularly in relation to whether or not there is any real identifying evidence to prove who AQ is, and what her historical links may be to the maternal grandfather.  I have the word of Mrs. Crowley that the technical deficiencies of this statement will be put right swiftly, and that a signed and dated copy duly authorised as properly translated to the witness by an interpreter before she signed it, will be made available.  On that basis I have treated it as proper evidence in the case, and come to the above conclusions.</p>

I have come to the conclusion, on fine balance, that overall it does not undermine that finding for the following reason: I consider it more likely than not that his first wife’s response to his marriage to this young girl, and her response to the pregnancy leading to the birth of M, was vitriolic, and that he found himself, as he would perceive it, “between a rock and a hard place”.  In those circumstances he chose wife number one over wife number two, rather than face further rejection by his first wife and the community, and knowing that the young girl and her infant son were powerless to do him much, if any, harm, rejected her and M.  I have, for that reason, inevitably based on surmise, made the findings recorded above.</p>

I agree that it has obvious implications for the credibility of the grandmother, but it is the sort of history which families will suppress even amongst themselves, and I remind myself that these events occurred over 40 years ago, when the two brothers H and K would have been very small if born at all.  This is not the sort of period that either of the grandparents would have dwelt upon in conversations, and for my part I doubt that the boys, and even less so their much younger sister, would have heard about it.

My puzzlement arises from the fact that she felt free to marry the Afghan male referred to below (see paragraphs 300 to 301 and 309 to 310).  As far as I am aware her religion and culture do not permit her to take a second spouse unless divorced.  I note also that her father (AA) does not believe she has been lawfully divorced either, for he says she did not put her thumb print on the relevant document, has not received any money and, therefore, the divorce is not valid.  Neither of her brothers H and K consider her to be divorced.  It was the oral evidence of her brother K, when he was asked whether he had heard anything about the mother forming a relationship with another man, that he purported not to know of any such relationship.  He added that he would be very angry if she had formed such a relationship because she was married and had not yet been divorced.  This family is very clear about the rules.</p>

The evidence seems to establish that the only member of her family to see her during the five-moth period before she was able to return to the United Kingdom was her brother H, who in fact provided her with shelter and support.  I mentioned earlier Mrs. Crowley’s submission that the mother had faked her story about abandonment in Meriwan in order to present herself as a victim, and in order to soften her reception by the family.  That H alone provided her with shelter illustrates to my mind why this submission cannot stand.  Her brother K, in oral evidence, said that the family knew that H had helped her but did not know that she was staying with him.  I accept that evidence, for it seems to me consistent with the family’s outrage at recent events, and their own condemnation of her “stupidity”, whilst also being consistent with doing nothing to interfere with her return to the United Kingdom.  Had he been against the mother returning to the United Kingdom to make complaint to the authorities it would have been open to the maternal grandfather to do all in his power (and I have no doubt with success) to stop her.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">She had to return to England, but her visa had expired.  She told me with clarity that when considering the grant of a fresh visa to her the embassy in Tehran had written to the husband to seek his views on such a grant, and that he had written back saying he did not wish his wife to come to him in the United Kingdom.  At least she thought the embassy had written to him.  The father’s evidence to me was that he wrote to them without prompting.  He had heard on the grapevine (I think from the mother’s relatives) that she was trying to get back.  At the start of his oral evidence this letter was not available but was produced to me subsequently.  It is a comprehensive attempt to block her entry back into this country.  Not only does he state that he has no wish for her to re-enter, but he says that she has no friends or family with whom she can stay, and does not have enough money to support herself.  It points out that R is in Iraq and so she has no reason to enter the United Kingdom.  It could not be a clearer declaration of war.  He was doing all he could to keep her away, and in part this was no doubt, to thwart any action she may take with the authorities in England to secure the return to her of R.  I found her evidence on this subject compelling and have no doubt at all that the husband was doing his best to inhibit her room for manoeuvre for the above reasons.  He did not succeed.  She had earlier acquired permanent leave to remain referred to earlier.  As a coda to this part of the case I heard evidence from Mrs. ST, a neighbour of the father in England.  She spoke of his frequent requests for help, they not being friends particularly at that stage, but she feeling her religious and moral duty to help someone in need.  I was profoundly impressed by her evidence for many reasons.  I did not doubt anything she said.  She made concessions against her own behaviour where necessary, and despite the development of her friendship with the father subsequent to February 2008, I do not believe that friendship to have coloured her view of the facts as she recalled them.  She told me that the father had come to her in a state of considerable anxiety, having heard that the mother was trying to return.  It was she who drafted this letter, and she told me in her oral evidence that it was most unlikely that she consulted him as to its finer points, but drafted it and then got him to sign it.  The core information must, however, have come from the father.  Either she had picked that up in their recent conversations, or, in particular in relation to the assertion in the letter that the mother had “indefinite leave to remain” in the United Kingdom from the father at the time of drafting.  I do not find this belief of his at this stage that she had indefinite leave to remain to support the evidence he gave me that he thought that was her immigration status from the time of her arrival.  As I have found above he knew, in my judgment, exactly what her status was following her arrival as a spouse, and when that visa would end.  That she had subsequently obtained indefinite leave to remain was also something which, I find, he knew by this stage.</p>

I further prefer the evidence of the maternal grandmother over that of her husband (who denied making the remark set out hereafter), for she spoke against the family’s interest in so admitting, and it had the ring of truth: the remark was that if he found out that it was the mother’s fault (by virtue of her behaviour) that she had been abandoned, he would kill her.</p>

It is his case that he was aware before her arrival back in the United Kingdom in February 2008 that she was on her way, and that believing that she would go and stay at this person’s home he made a telephone call to her to tell her that he was now divorced from the mother, that he wanted nothing more to do with her, and that he would not change his position on this.  It is the evidence of the mother, supported to some extent by contemporaneous recording of a call to the East Sussex Police Force by the recipient of the father’s telephone call, that the father’s call had been a much more threatening one: he had intimated acts of considerable violence to this person if the mother were granted succour in her home.  He also made clear threats of significant acts of violence towards the mother.  He was cross-examined extensively on this part of the case, and was wholly unimpressive in my view.  I do not feel the need to set out all the matters I rely upon in coming to this conclusion, save to note that once again when any suggestion was made of him threatening violence his pose in the witness box was a comparatively timorous one, and he again carefully modulated his voice to the gentlest of whispers in an attempt to persuade me that such threats were alien to his way of living.  I did not believe him, and have no doubt at all that he made such threats to this person both as to her own safety and as to the mother’s.</p>

I have already made findings in respect of the improbability of some of her allegations as to the duration and nature of the father’s sexual assaults upon her.  Mrs. Crowley quite rightly invites my attention to them, and suggests that they are so wholly improbable as to illustrate the nature and extent of the mother’s mendacity and fantasising on this and many other subjects.</p>

I have to bear in mind when looking at this part of the material that, even though I find the mother to be woefully inaccurate in some respects, I remind myself that she was back in this country unaccompanied, with no obvious means of support save acts of friendship from those known to her, but those being of uncertain duration.  Furthermore I have illustrated above, and found to be true, the fact that the father made certainly one threat to somebody who had tried to help her.  </p>

It is fair to the father to add that the MPS have taken the view that the risk does not just arise from the alleged threats made by, and subsequent alleged behaviour of, the father and his family.  An entirely separate set of risks (compounding the risk from the father) is said to come from the mother’s second husband, and furthermore from one or more of her own brothers for the double “dishonour” she has brought by behaving as she has in relation to both her first and second husbands.</p>

This is particularly so in relation to someone who had lived most of her life in a geographically isolated Iranian village, and in the Kurdish culture, whose language was her first language, and whose cultural, social and religious beliefs have been shaped by that upbringing.

Unhappily, they did not find out about this relationship from her but from another source.  She was questioned about it and in due course admitted that not only was this accurate information, but that she was having a sexual relationship with him.  She had been in this country for only some eight weeks.  She was asked about this in oral evidence and denied that there was any sexual intimacy between them.  In fact she barely recognised it as a relationship, just a mutual exchange of limited information, mostly by sign language given that neither spoke each other’s language, in which she had indicated to this young man that she was married and has a child, and he informed her that his girlfriend had abandoned him, taking their two small children with her.  I regret to say I do not think she was telling me the whole truth about this relationship, nor indeed was she telling me the truth when she denied that it was a sexual relationship.  I do not know if she lied from shame or for some other reason.  She was told she had to move but resisted it.  According to DC B she had no trouble telling the MPS her views, DC B describing her as “a petulant child”.  She was frank enough to admit in the witness box that, particularly at this period, she was indeed behaving like a child.  It was made clear to her that she had no choice and she accordingly moved.

The police monitored telephone calls on her mobile telephone, but they hold the firm belief that she also had a secret telephone which they were not told about, and which she used to make contact with others.  It is DC B’s view that she lied to them.  Eventually, on close questioning, she would end up confessing.  Whether or not she had a secret telephone it is clear to me from the evidence of her brother H, which I accept on this point, that she did make a call to him even though the police had not authorised it.</p>

She was warned that should her circumstances become known through this man to those attending the mosque, or to any of them, there was a risk it would seep into the wider Kurdish community exacerbating the risks spoken of above.  She was advised to discontinue the relationship.  She had already been moved at very short notice after the discovery of her relationship with the male referred to above, and knew, or must have known, of the risks to which she was putting herself and others.

As DC B told me in oral evidence, her passport was readily accessible to her in one sense, for in each of the accommodations provided for her it was lodged with those who had some oversight of her, and she could have requested it from them.  Further evidence did put a slight gloss on this to the extent that she had, on this occasion, asked for the return of it, but was told to consult the police first, and it was this advice which led to her exchanges with DC B on this date.  Not for the first time one has to ask whether this is the act of someone who is truly afraid, and whether or not it casts some light on the genuineness or otherwise of any purported death threats.  She made it clear that she was bored and frustrated, particularly when she was advised yet again to avoid her own community.  After several days of seeking her passport she began to ask for money to return to Iraq.  This request was declined.  The warnings were repeated.</p>

I think she is mistaken about these dates, but that the mistake is genuine and not intended to mislead.  I have found in listening to her that dates are not her strong suit.  This is not a civil marriage recognised in English law, and indeed may not be valid in Moslem law since she was not, on one view of the evidence, and certainly to her own belief, divorced.

She alleged that he had threatened to kill her, and that he had a firearm.  These events had apparently occurred on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009, although it was later established that the most serious allegation relating to the gun (being held to her neck) had in fact occurred on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  Why had she not called DC B earlier?  She made no mention in making her report to him, or any subsequent commentary on it to DC B, of him holding the gun to the back of her head, although she does make this allegation in her Section 9 CJA statement of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2008, and in a recent statement in these proceedings.  She clearly had some telephone discussion with DC B, and he told me that when she first made this complaint to him on or about 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December he felt that she was genuinely terrified.  The allegation was investigated by the Thames Valley police, and it was only at the very start of this hearing that the Section 9 statement referred to above was made available, along with extracts from the relevant file including an anonymised transcript of a lengthy interview under caution with the male held on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2008.  I have, for obvious reasons, not heard from him.  She has given her account, although not surprisingly, she has not been invited to dwell on the minutiae of her compliant to the police and his response to it.  I did not feel the need to investigate that particular allegation beyond minimal aspects of it. </p>

To some extent it clarifies the chronology for she refers to meeting him in June 2008, and marrying him on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2008.  Thus her account given above of some three to four months between the meeting and the marriage is more probably than not erroneous as I have already implied.  He soon became controlling, aggressive and subjected her to domestic violence.  He required her to wear a hijab and a scarf, and to cover herself.  Almost as soon as they were married they began arguing and fighting.  She did not live with him but visited him at weekends.  This, no doubt, explains why she was not at her then accommodation on the night of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December but only returning to it in the early hours (see above).</p>

I need not go again into the argument and counter-argument.  Suffice it to say that after obtaining a warrant the police searched his home and found no evidence of a gun.  Since there was no evidence to corroborate her account the matter was dropped.  The father points to this refusal to proceed with a charge and a prosecution as suggesting that the mother’s account is innately incredible.  I do not think the material goes so far.  The police of course have no gun by way of evidence, and the competing accounts either of them may have been valid.  </p>

It is her account that, between the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, and particularly on that last date, there was a crescendo of threats to kill her.  This does not entirely account for why she did not speak to DC B until the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> but goes a long way to explain what might otherwise appear to be an inexplicable hiatus.  I reject the submission of Mrs. Crowley that she only made these reports after she became aware that he had reported her for alleged criminal offences.</p>

In her oral evidence she told me that in fact she had only confessed to the relationship <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> the Afghan male telephoned her family and told them.  They (but not her mother) (or he) repeatedly rang her and threatened her life for the dishonour she had caused.  She also told me that culturally it would mean that she could never be received back into her family.  I accept that some members of her family did know, although I am not altogether clear how many.  Certainly, as I have found, her brother K did not.  I nevertheless believed her evidence on this subject of threats from one or more members of her family (see above), and think it probable that these threats were additional overwhelming pressures which led her once again to call the police, for in combination with the collapse of this unfortunate marriage, and the overwhelming rejection of her cry for help to her family, she was even further isolated and worn down.  The police were the only people to whom she could turn.</p>

In her oral evidence she spoke eloquently of her abandonment by all, her total isolation from any form of community (save for the hotchpotch community she was then staying in where the other young women had their children with them, making her feel even more lonely), and the investment of her hopes (woefully misplaced) in this marriage in which she felt, finally, she would be safe.  She was only to find, all-too quickly, that she had married a man who was certainly very controlling of her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I must, despite that finding, look at the undoubted issue of her credibility in relation to whether or not she could marry at all.  It is overwhelmingly clear from the evidence that she did not regard herself as divorced from the father.  She told me that she had discussed with the young Afghan male the fact that she was married and had a child before she married him (a factual issue corroborated by the Afghan male in the interview under caution) and thus I accept this part of her evidence.  It is her account that he told her that if she stayed away from her first husband for a sufficiently long period then she would indeed be divorced.  I found this part of her evidence wholly unpersuasive and unsatisfactory.  I have no doubt at all that in her mind she believed herself still to be married to the father, but I also find that her despair and loneliness and belief that he might protect her drove her to ignore the fact for the purposes of a second marriage in which she hoped to find some safety and solace.  Thus whilst I find her credibility impugned to this extent, I do not believe that this one issue provides a key to her credibility on other issues.  I have nevertheless been on guard when considering other crucial matters.</p>

An illustration he gave me related to February 2010 where the mother, despite many requests made to her by DC B not to call him on his personal mobile telephone (the number of which she had acquired earlier by accident) for making calls relating to the case.  Yet in this month she sent him many texts asserting that she believed she had seen the father’s friends in her neighbourhood, and could she move home.  She was told that this would not be possible immediately, but she constantly pestered him.  In her oral evidence I thought her distress genuine when she was describing this series of attempts to contact him.  She told me that she was alone and extremely frightened, and, with the exception of the police, had no-one to turn to.  I thought her evidence credible even if her actions were wholly inappropriate.  I can well-understand the frustration of DC B and that he came to the view that this was manipulative behaviour, although looked at objectively I consider that her actions were born of genuine distress and fear.</p>

After further investigation it is now very clearly the view of the MPS that the two men were not in fact in search of the mother, and that this was simply a case of coincidence.

She was required actively to seek work, and to sign on regularly and frequently.  She was under great pressure from the job centre to find work.  She also has a strong willingness to work, but by virtue of all the practical arrangements surrounding her anonymity and the careful way in which she has been advised to move within the community, it has been very difficult to find any work.  Apart from anything else it must be remembered that she is illiterate, and although her English has immeasurably improved, it is not fluent.

She has not only acquired working English, but is going on to further studies in that language, and has recently acquired a certificate in computer usage.  She spoke of the miserable times she had not being independent, and how her confidence has improved immeasurably with these recent steps.  I can well-understand it, and to coin a phrase she found herself “between a rock and a hard place” as she was advised by the police of her limited options, yet pressured by the Job Centre to work.

The worker makes clear that the police had not given them any specific instructions as to where the mother could and could not work.

It was only after application was made to me by the MPS, in consequence of which I discharged them from the undertaking they had earlier given me to facilitate the mother and her legal team in having discussions with each other and making provision for face-to-face meetings with them, that the mother (having met with her legal team after that team made arrangements on an emergency basis) finally agreed to move.</p>

As the father said to me at one stage in his cross-examination the Kurdish community certainly in England, and by virtue I find of the intense and well-connected family groups in Kurdistan and Iran, know everything about each other.  I take as one particularly egregious example of an attempt to mislead me from the paternal grandfather’s evidence to the effect that he has never discussed with his son the reasons for the failure of his marriage and what has ensued.  I am not, I emphasise, in making this finding projecting on to their familial culture an increasing tendency in “the West” to intrude into private matters.  These two families have a powerful sense of what is right and wrong (although their respective senses may be different from each other’s).  When relationships go wrong (as here they demonstrably did) it is groups of elders (and on the more formal occasions only male elders) which come together to attempt to resolve these problems.  They do not come to such meetings and discussions blind of what has been going on, and the attempt to persuade me that these distressing matters had not been discussed is, I find, patently absurd.</p>

I have not done so on some occasions (declared on the face of the judgment) because the evidence was insufficiently illuminating to permit me to make findings on the cross-allegations.  I have also declined to make findings on occasion because I do not feel it necessary to do so in order to come to a proper conclusion on the main aspects of the case.</p>
