	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The appellants have been in a relationship since September 2012 (or shortly before that date).  The first appellant (‘the mother’) has five elder children from her previous relationship with Mr S.  The second appellant (‘the father’) has three children from a previous relationship.  Together they have two children of their own.  L, a girl, was born on 15 May 2013.  She is now just over 2 years old and lives with her potential adopters following care and placement orders made on 27 June 2014.  Whilst no adoption order has yet been made because of the currency of this litigation, L has now lived with her potential adoptive parents for some 10 months since the beginning of October last year.  That is a significant period for a child of this age.  She has never lived in a home with her birth parents, the appellants in these proceedings, having been removed from their care when she was nearly three weeks old.  T, her brother, was born on 6 May 2014.  He is now 15 months old and is currently living in a foster placement pursuant to orders made at the conclusion of a further hearing on 28 October 2014.  He has never shared a home with his parents, having been removed from their care at birth.  If the parents’ current appeals are unsuccessful, L’s prospective adopters remain open to the local authority’s plan to place T with them in order that the two siblings can be adopted together and grow up in a shared home.  Contact between L and her parents and wider sibling group (to whom I shall come shortly) ceased when she moved to her current placement.  T continues to have contact with his parents and half-siblings three times a week.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">This case has already been the subject of appeals to a circuit judge sitting in Birmingham and to the Court of Appeal in London.  The litigation has now been before the courts for in excess of two years without a final resolution. Time is running for these children, each of whom needs the security of knowing who will be looking after them and where they will grow up.  Of equal importance is the need to bring this long-running litigation to an end in order that the heavy burden of stress currently placed on the shoulders of the parents and the children who remain at home with them can be lifted.  For the most part, the appellants have sat through several days of this hearing together.  Whilst I did not hear evidence from them given the nature of these appeals, I want to say at the outset of this judgment that each has shown great restraint and courtesy to the court as they have been forced to relive the evidence given during a number of previous hearings.  Many of the submissions made by counsel will have been difficult and painful to hear, but they have remained stoical throughout despite the distress they must have been feeling.  That is very much to their credit and I wish them to know that I have thought long and hard about this case since I reserved judgment.  That was a course which I had to take because of the manner in which the hearing unfolded.  At an early stage, it became apparent that an important case management direction in relation to the preparation of some of the evidence had not been complied with and, rather than abandon the hearing, I allowed counsel extra time to make good that deficit.  As a result, the two days which had been set aside for judgment writing were absorbed in concluding submissions.  </span>

Whilst the orders which he made on that occasion setting aside the care and placement orders have since been overturned by the Court of Appeal on 30 April this year (2015), s 54(4) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 provides that there is no route of appeal against a decision to give or refuse permission to appeal.  Hence his order giving the parents permission to appeal the care and placement orders made in respect of both L and T stands, despite the reinstatement of the previous care orders secured previously by the local authority in June and October 2014.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">There was also before me a fifth application by the parents to adduce fresh evidence.  That evidence consisted of updating statements they had made since the last court hearings and a third party statement which concerned alleged retractions by three of the mother’s elder children of some of the allegations which were before the court during the fact finding hearing in October 2013.  I dealt with this application during the course of the hearing.  On 11 June 2015, Roderic Wood J had given the parents’ permission to adduce evidence from their legal advisers in relation to the advice which they claimed to have received about the timing of any appeal against the fact finding decision.  Although privilege was expressly waived by the parents in respect of any such attendance notes or witness statements, none was produced at the hearing before me.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Because of the length and delay in achieving a resolution of these matters given the respective ages of the children, I need at this point to say something about the history of this litigation.  The appellants’ counsel, Miss Vanessa Meachin and Mr Guy Spollon, have produced a very detailed narrative chronology for which I am most grateful.  It has been of much assistance to me in understanding the background to a complex piece of litigation.  Together with counsel for the local authority and for the children’s Guardian (respectively Miss Ruth Cabeza and Miss Rhiannon Davies), they have also prepared a schedule of the retractions which it is said the children have made to various third parties at various points in time.  This has enabled me to navigate through the nine bundles of detailed documentation which were produced for the purposes of this hearing.  Included within that material were transcripts of each of the three hearings before District Judge Maughan (including a full transcript of the evidence given by various parties on each occasion</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">).  I have also been provided with written copies of the judgments delivered at first instance and appellate level on both interlocutory and final matters.  Several of these transcripts only became available at a late stage of the appeal proceedings.  Thus, unlike HHJ Plunkett who dealt with the first appeal, I have had the benefit of knowing exactly what evidence was before the court at each stage of the hearings before District Judge Maughan.  I have had the opportunity to revisit each day of the three substantive hearings which she conducted in relation to fact-finding and welfare disposals.  In all, I have read what transpired over the course of the eight days spent in court considering the futures of these two young children.  This has included the evidence, advocates’ submissions, various judicial interjections and – finally – the judgments, delivered on both an extempore and reserved basis. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">As I promised the parties I would, I have re-read more or less all the written material contained within the court bundles, together with counsel’s detailed written submissions.  I had a separate bundle containing twelve authorities, most of which were already familiar to me.  I have reread all the authorities and will refer to them where appropriate during the course of my judgment.  I cannot hope within the reasonable confines of my judgment to rehearse all the evidence in order to test the previous conclusions and decisions made in relation to these children, nor do I consider it appropriate to do so. However, because of the importance of the decision to both the children and the parents, I would wish them to know that I have carefully considered everything which was put before me before reaching my own conclusions in this matter.</span>

The following year, she moved with D from her own mother’s home.  She formed a relationship with Mr S.  That relationship was increasingly characterised by domestic violence and abuse which she suffered at the hands of her partner over a number of years.  Over the course of the next three and a half years, four more children were born into the family.  N, a girl, was born in February 1998; she is now 17 years old.  Her sister, C, was born in March 1999; she is now 16 years old.  Two brothers, B1 and B2, followed within eleven months of one another in 2000 and 2001.

Her confidence and self-esteem were at a very low ebb when, to her credit, she finally found the strength to leave the relationship.  For many months after its eventual demise, Mr S refused to leave the family home.  During that period, she became friendly with the father and they began a relationship during the summer of 2012.  By August 2012, he had become her full-time partner and moved into the household within a matter of weeks after Mr S moved out.  That household then consisted of four children who were aged between 10 and 16 years old, N having decided to move out to live with her father, Mr S.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Prior to the mother’s relationship with the father, these children had been the subject of various referrals to the local authority as a result of missing school and other concerns.  As long ago as the beginning of 2002, a child protection conference was convened and the four elder children were registered as being in need of protection.  The mother left Mr S for a brief period in 2003 but they later reconciled and there were further problems in the family.  There were more issues over domestic violence fuelled on at least one occasion by excessive alcohol consumption.  The family was referred to the police as a result of D’s anti-social behaviour and this led to a further multi-agency meeting in 2008.  At that time, the children were all said to be sleeping in one bedroom.  By October 2008, there were serious concerns about neglect and all five children were made the subject of a safeguarding plan which remained in place for the next two years.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Towards the end of 2012, Emma Spensley was appointed as one of the children’s social workers.  In one of her statements, she has recorded a confrontation which took place at the beginning of December 2012, shortly after the father moved in to the family home, when Mr S had attended at the property for contact.  He attempted to kick the door down and the police were involved.  N, who had accompanied her father, was encouraging her siblings not to listen to their mother.  This appears to have been characteristic of her behaviour at the time.  The papers are littered with many references to her being verbally abusive towards her mother and encouraging her younger siblings to show the same disrespect.  By this stage, it seemed that contact between B1 and B2 and their father had all but broken down.  There was a further incident when he attended at the property and attempted to force an entry which involved another police attendance.  There is evidence that C (then almost 13 years old) was smashing up her bedroom and calling her mother a “slut”.  Importantly, by the beginning of 2013, Emma Spensley had formed a view that the mother had the potential to change and become a good parent if she received appropriate help and support.  She made a referral to a local Family Centre.  </span>

D, the mother’s elder child who had been living away from the family home, moved back in in January 2013 and revealed that he had experienced sexual thoughts and feelings towards young girls.  His presence within the home was considered by the local authority to be another risk factor for these children.  The father and the mother were asked to ensure that the children were supervised at all times whilst D was present in the house.  </span>

He did not attend the hearing and was sentenced in his absence to a 12 month supervision order and a requirement during his probation to undergo a course in relation to domestic abuse.  It became clear during the course of his oral evidence to District Judge Maughan that illness had prevented him from attending on that day.  It was the joint case of both the mother and the father that this conviction was secured against the background of a relatively trivial incident which involved nothing more than the father stepping on his ex-partner’s foot and causing minor bruising.  Nevertheless, it warranted a formal conviction although the mother had explained to the District Judge in her evidence that the father had been open and honest with her about the incident before they commenced their own relationship.</span>

N was living with her father, Mr S.  Her relationship with her mother was hostile and she continued to refer to her in highly derogatory terms.  Her younger sister, C, and her two brothers, B1 and B2, were living under the roof now shared by the father and mother who was four months pregnant with unborn baby L.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">These assessments provide some support for the mother’s case that, with Mr S now out of the home, she had been able to start putting in place rules and boundaries for the three younger children.  In this, she had the support of the father.  B1 was reported to be happy living with his mother and her current partner.  Miss Spensley reported that she had observed B1 in his home environment on a few occasions when he appeared settled and was observed laughing and joking with both the mother and the father.  He said that he was enjoying school and had lots of friends.  The school had voiced some concerns about his general presentation; at times he appeared ‘scruffy’.   B2 was said to be happy at school and getting on well with his siblings, his mother and the father. There were still concerns surrounding C’s temper outbursts but these appeared to be manifest on occasions when she had spoken to Mr S or there had been issues over contact.  There were concerns that the flat was overcrowded now that D had moved back in and other concerns over his sexual disclosures.  Miss Spensley noted that the mother needed to become more pro-active in relation to her parenting and it was hoped that a course which she was undertaking in relation to domestic violence might address some of these issues.  Sibling contact would continue to be supervised in order to ensure that N did not have inappropriate conversations with C, B1 and B2 and did not pass on messages from Mr S.  The local authority remained concerned about the potential risk to the children posed by the father because of his PPRC status.  He had explained to them that he had been involved in two robberies when he was younger and acquired that status as his victims were under 16 at the time.  There were also concerns about his propensity for domestic violence.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Nevertheless, whilst there was an element of concern that the mother and father were relying too heavily on social services, these core assessments did indeed appear to suggest the first positive glimmer of light for this family.  There are references to ‘a noticeable improvement in [the mother’s] capacity to ensure safety and safeguard her children’ and her apparent willingness to share information with the local authority (e.g. </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[LB1/C:78]</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">).  There are also references to the children missing their father, Mr S, and wishing to have more contact with him.  There did not appear to be any particular financial concerns although the family was entirely dependent upon benefits, the father being then unemployed but in receipt of disability living allowance as a result of chronic ill health involving epileptic seizures.  The fact that these improvements were being undertaken in circumstances where the fabric of the family home was in a pretty poor state is, perhaps, testament to the mother’s willingness to make changes.  There were no internal doors inside the property since Mr S had vandalised them during his occupation.  These had been replaced with curtains across the doorways.  There was a large hole in the ceiling which was allowing water to penetrate and several of the electric sockets had live wires exposed.  In March 2013, Miss Spensley made a referral to the local housing department because of conditions within the home.  It was anticipated at that stage that the family might need to move into temporary accommodation because of the work involved in repairing the leak to the ceiling.</span>

The mother by this stage was about to give birth.  D appeared to have moved back into the family home for a brief period although he was due to be accommodated separately by the local authority.  Neither the mother nor the father had completed their courses although their failure to do so appeared to be the result of the mother’s late stage of pregnancy and the father’s recent hospitalisation rather than as a result of any deliberate inaction on their part.  The father’s probation officer was present at the meeting and reported that he had engaged well with his order, despite missing an odd session.   He was then assessed as being a medium risk of harm towards women and children.  Whilst he had never physically harmed a child, it was felt that he posed a risk of emotional harm to a child in the context of possible domestic violence.  Potential triggers for reoffending were identified and his health was a further area of concern.</span>

It was, as before, a supervised session.  It was the first sibling contact for some months because of N’s earlier refusal to attend any more sessions.  Miss Spensley had formed the view that her absence was having a negative impact upon the other children emotionally.  It was on the way back from that contact session, having dropped the other children off at home, that N told the social worker that she was concerned about her sister and brothers.  At first she was reluctant to share those concerns for fear of repercussions for her siblings.  Once she was reassured, she told Miss Spensley that C had told her that if B1 and B2 misbehaved, they were forced by the mother or the father to sit naked in a cold bath or made to stand by the bedroom door for hours on end as a punishment.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">As a result of that conversation, Miss Spensley and another social worker made an unannounced visit to the children’s school the following day.  Each of C and B1 were spoken to separately. (B2 attended a different school and he was not spoken to on this occasion.)   C reported that if B1 or B2 were cheeky at home or misbehaved, they were made to strip and forced into a cold bath naked.  She described feeling angry and upset on these occasions and described how B1 cried when he was put in the bath.  She described feelings of helplessness and being unable to assist her brothers.  She said she had shouted at her mother and told her to get B1 out of the bath because of his evident distress.  Both the mother and father had refused to do so.  On the contrary, they left him in the bath and prolonged the punishment until he had calmed down.  C could recall one occasion when B1 was allowed out of the bath.  She thought this had happened on about three occasions and described the last time has having occurred the previous week at the bed and breakfast accommodation at which the family was staying.  She also described occasions when the two boys were forced to stand for hours as a punishment.  She said that on one occasion when B1 had been forced to stand by the bedroom door as soon as he arrived home from school.  He was made to stand there for between six and twelve hours.  If either of the boys complained, they were made to stand for longer periods.  C specifically referred to B1 being too tired to compete at his recent sports day; he had apparently had to drop out of a race as his legs were aching so much from standing for hours the previous night.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">On 18 June 2013, the local authority applied for care orders in relation to N (then 15), C (14), B1 (12), B2 (11) and L (1 month old).  Interim care orders in respect of all five children were made in the local Family Proceedings Court on 26 June 2013.  The mother and the father attended court and were legally represented.  The mother consented to a care order in respect of her middle three children but sought the return to her care of N and L.  The father, too, opposed the removal of L.  By that stage, N had walked out of her foster placement and had been returned home under a working agreement with the local authority.   Both parents denied the allegations about the use of cold baths as punishment.  They said that ‘luke warm baths [had] been used out of necessity when [B1] was very dirty and the heating was not working properly’ </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  The judgment delivered by District Judge McGarva on that occasion records that ‘Mother is of the view that [the father] has been a positive influence in the house and he has imposed rules and boundaries which had previously not been in place.  Mother feels the children have at times reacted badly to this and believes the allegations may be a plot by the children collectively to get them placed together’.  The District Judge made the interim care orders sought on the basis that the disclosures made by the children were very serious.  The parents sought to persuade the court that L was not at risk of the sort of chastisement about which the boys were complaining.  However, in circumstances where, as a tiny infant, she had no voice of her own, the court decided the risk of harm was sufficiently serious to warrant her removal from the parents’ care.     </span>

Perhaps tellingly, when he was asked what he meant by his repeated reference to ‘elbow temperature’, he said that he understood that it was the temperature at which a baby had to have a bath but “to me it was cold and I said to, erm, my mum’s boyfriend, how can this be a erm, elbow temperature bath, I can’t see [L] getting in this” </span>

He said his mother could not lift him and so it was L’s father who had physically put him in the bath.  He was kicking and kicked L’s father who then just picked him up and put him in the bath.  He was standing up and saying ‘no’ and tried to get out of the bath but L’s father just kept him in the bath.

First, because all of this information was before District Judge Maughan in October 2013 when she dealt with the fact-finding hearing.  She, unlike me, also had the benefit of watching and listening to the full DVD recordings.  She had done that a matter of hours before she gave her judgment.  Secondly, that evidence has to be weighed and balanced against the subsequent retractions which the children (or some of them) were to make as the litigation progressed through its various stages.</span>

But they were also describing what they were feeling, sensations they were experiencing and the physical reactions their bodies had to those sensations.</span>

She found that each of B1 and B2 had been placed by force in a bath of cold water by the father as a punishment which lasted for no less than 10 minutes.  She accepted that on more than one occasion the father had made each of the boys stand for an excessive period of time in excess of an hour.  She found that the mother had failed to protect the children on these occasions.  She accepted that B2 had suffered emotional abuse by being woken and made to stand as a punishment.  C was found to have suffered emotional abuse and harm as a result of witnessing these punishments.  She found that the mother and the father had coached B1 in respect of the evidence he gave in his ABE interview insofar as he used the expression “elbow temperature” to describe the temperature of the bath water which was, in fact, cold.  She found that N had been physically assaulted by her father, Mr S, both on 14 June 2013 and on other occasions as a result of rough handling during physical altercations between them.</span>

The District Judge interjected at various points and asked her if she really thought it was possible for a child to stand for between six and twelve hours at a stretch.  Her view was that C was a bright girl who had a good understanding of matters and she thought that her reportage of these events might well be accurate.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">At the end of her evidence, the District Judge asked several questions of her own.  The mother was asked about B1 smashing up his bedroom.  She was asked how she would discipline the children.  She said that the boys had shared a bedroom so if they misbehaved one would be sent up to his room while the other would be made to stand up for a little bit of time in the hallway.  Had she sent them both to their room, it would not have been a punishment because they would be laughing and ‘playing up’ even more.  She confirmed that she would make them stand for 15 minutes and that ‘[B1] ended up doing half an hour in the hotel’ but he was given a break after 15 minutes.  The District Judge asked several probing questions about the dynamic of her relationship with L’s father and who controlled the benefits received by the family and/or managed the family’s budget.    The mother confirmed that when she first started a relationship with him she did not know how to control money because Mr S had spent most of their benefits on ‘bookies and stuff’.  The father had helped her to learn how to shop, to show her what to buy.  This, she said, was not done to control her but to give her appropriate advice as to how she should manage by herself.</span>

He denied the children’s allegations and supported the mother’s case in relation to N’s account of her having sent messages blaming the children for wanting to kill herself.  He said he had never pulled shoes off the feet of the children when they wanted to leave the house, although he did admit to standing in front of the door to bar their exit from the house so that they could not get out when their mother had been telling them they could not go to their father’s home </span>

Because the family was then living in emergency accommodation and had no facilities to make ice, he was advised in the alternative to run it under cold water to stop the swelling.

She was taken to the discrepancies in the accounts given by the mother and the father on various occasions when they had been asked about these events.  She was taken to the detail in the accounts which the children, including N, had been able to give.  The mother’s solicitor very properly set in context the reasons why she had not been able to compete her work with Family Action.  That work had to an extent been superseded by the work which to be undertaken by a local women’s centre called Anawim as part of her probation order following the conviction for animal cruelty.</span>

Those allegations were described as being “so farfetched as almost to be part of a soap opera plot”.  When the District Judge reminded that she was dealing with threshold and would need his specific submissions on the allegations, Mr Bean very properly turned to a forensic examination of each of the allegations and reminded the court of appropriate inconsistencies or the absence of any rational explanation for what the children were saying.  The judge engaged at various points with that forensic analysis and Mr Bean was allowed to develop his points from the foot of her interventions.</span>

He provided the judge with appropriate page references for his various submissions in order that she could consider the matter properly overnight.  He highlighted the fact that other contemporaneous evidence available to the court appeared to suggest that the children were doing reasonably well at that time and that improvements had been made since the father arrived to live in the home.  In relation to L, in particular, he stressed that there was no evidence to support a finding that she had suffered any physical harm.  He argued that none of the children had suffered physical harm.  When the judge asked him about emotional harm, Mr Ravshand submitted that, if the findings were made, he questioned whether the threshold of emotional harm would be crossed.  He invited the court to look at the subsequent actions of the children in returning to the family home.

Whilst acknowledging that his role was very limited in relation to fact finding, she reminded the court about the consistency of the accounts given particularly by B1 and B2 to a number of professionals, including the foster carer.  (The judge had available, and had read, all the foster carer’s notes which were included in the bundles put before her for the fact finding hearing.)  Whilst there were some discrepancies, the Guardian’s position was that, if true, the punishments meted out to the boys were totally inappropriate.  Whilst B1 had absconded from care and returned home, he had left his foster placement very early in the morning by climbing out of a window and walking a significant distance without any shoes on.  That was why the Guardian had felt there were real repercussions for his safety were he to abscond again.  These concerns had led him to endorsing his remaining with the mother and father despite the fact that he did not support the placement in that home and in their care.</span>

I caused enquiries to be made of District Judge Maughan as to the circumstances in which this second version came into being.  She responded by telling me that she had recently been asked to approve the fact finding judgment and had done so the previous week.  As I told the parties, I subsequently received an email from the judge.  It came via my clerk and is dated 27 July 2015 and was sent at 13:26.  In that email, the District Judge informed me that she had spoken by telephone to the transcribers who confirmed to her that they did not have any other versions of the October 2013 (Fact Finding) judgment.  Accordingly, she had amended the version which was sent to her and approved it on the Friday before our hearing began.  It appears that the version which was sent to District Judge Maughan on 30 June 2015 was the version which we had in our appeal bundles.  The fact that she had previously ‘signed off’ on that version had escaped the judge’s mind (and she must be forgiven for that, given the period of time which has now elapsed since she delivered judgment and the two further substantive hearings in this case with which she has dealt since then).  She is, of course, familiar with the case given her long involvement with it and, despite the fact that she did not have access to the trial bundles and was relying on her notebook, she has given her seal of approval to the amended version.  Thus it seems to me that this is the version which falls to be considered for the purposes of the first application for permission to appeal out of time against the findings of fact.</span>

By this stage of the proceedings,  the local authority no longer supported the return of B2 and L to the family home.

L’s parents argued that there was a gap in the evidence and that further work by Action for Children was necessary given the absence of any further input since the fact finding hearing.  The Guardian remained opposed to the return of B2 and L to the parents and felt that further assessment would not assist the court to reach its conclusions in relation to a final welfare decision.</span>

N was moving between her mother’s and father’s home and continued to report to social workers her mother’s various shortcomings including an allegation that she told lies and create a misleading impression of the home environment.  By this stage, the mother was in the early stages of pregnancy with unborn baby T.  N was aware of the position and appeared to feel that her mother was prioritising the interests of her unborn baby over those of the other children.  She went missing from home and had to be returned by the police who were involved on several occasions with the family over this period.  On one occasion C was reported to be smashing up the family home and the police arrived to find chairs broken and clothing strewn around the property.  As a result she was removed from the mother’s home and taken to Mr S’s property.  The father’s health had not improved and, at the beginning of the New Year (2014), he was admitted to hospital with seizures.  This impacted on his ability to attend one or more of the sessions which had been arranged with Action for Children.  It became necessary to obtain a medical report to confirm whether or not he was well enough to attend further sessions.</span>

He was arrested and bailed.  N went missing.  The police reported that she was refusing to stay in the home of either parent and wished to live alone albeit supported by the local authority.  B2, who was still in foster care, was telling his social worker that he wanted to return home because “my brother and sister have told me that it is better at home now; [the father] treats us better” </span>

Five days later, at the end of May 2014, he went with his elder brother, B1, to the lavatory during a period of family contact and both absconded from the centre.  He was eventually found by the police at 8pm that evening in the mother’s home.

The two cases not having been consolidated, counsel for the local authority told the judge that HHJ Plunkett had felt that it was a matter for District Judge Maughan whether the case in relation to Trevor should proceed in the absence of a resolution of the appeal in L’s case.  Having heard submissions for counsel for both the mother and the father (each of whom was advocating an adjournment), the judge ruled on the application and determined that the case could proceed.

She also took into account the fact that the Guardian’s evidence had been that B1’s retraction was only made when he learnt that L was to be placed for adoption at a time when he himself had been placed back in the family home and within the sphere of influence of his mother and father.  He did not consider that this was a significant feature and should not destabilise the timetable for T. Indeed, he felt it was an opportunity which had presented itself to the parents as a reason to go behind previously acknowledged findings.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">On 21 November 2014, the appeal was listed before HHJ Plunkett.  Very shortly before that hearing, the mother and father had issued a Notice of Appeal in a proper form seeking to challenge the decision in relation to T which was reflected in District Judge Maughan’s order of 6 November 2014.  Whilst this latest appeal was not formally before the court on that day, HHJ Plunkett was told of its existence.  The grounds in T’s appeal made it clear that the District Judge was wrong to dismiss the application to adjourn those proceedings and to refuse any further investigation into the children’s retractions.  No direct attack was made on the 2013 fact finding determination.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">At this point, it must be said, and clearly, that on 21 November 2014 the judge had before him a very limited amount of information about this long running case.  Whilst he had a transcript of the judgment which District Judge Maughan delivered in October 2013 (the fact find), he only had an abbreviated note of her June 2014 judgment (the welfare disposal in L’s case).  He did not have the full transcripts of either hearing and did not know the nature or ambit of the evidence which had been given during the course of those hearings.  He did not know the extent of the District Judge’s own interventions during those hearings and the questions which she had put to the various witnesses at the conclusion of cross-examination.  It is probably fair to say that a simple reading of her two judgments would not have provided him with a proper understanding of the extent to which the hundreds of pages of written evidence before the court had been forensically examined during the course of the hearing.  He certainly did not have the benefit, as I have had, of reading the written evidence and the transcripts of the hearings themselves.  Indeed, the lack of detailed analysis within the judgments is one of the pivotal reasons relied on by L and T’s parents in their current appeal.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">At the conclusion of the case on 21 November 2014 the judge adjourned the case to a further hearing.  At that juncture, it appeared to be his intention to hear additional submissions or, alternatively, deliver his judgment.  He directed that the parties were to file any further written submissions by 2pm on 25 November 2014.  Each of the local authority and the Guardian duly filed their submissions but neither document touched upon the grounds which were ultimately the basis for HHK Plunkett’s decision to overturn the care and placement orders in respect of both L and T.  When the case came back on 5 December 2014, he handed down a written judgment prepared in the intervening period.  In that judgment, he concluded that the findings of fact made by District Judge Maughan in October 2013 were not sustainable.  His main concern was her unwillingness to consider whether there should have been evidence from the children in relation to the alleged retractions.  That failure was compounded in his view by her subsequent failure in T’s hearing (almost a year later) to examine in any more detail information about those retractions and/or adjourn the case to enable that course to be taken.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Significantly, the judgment handed down by HHJ Plunkett was predicated upon the basis that the threshold facts related </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-family:Garamond">entirely</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> to the complaints of the children.  He said, at paragraph 2(i) of his judgment that “the case depended almost entirely on what they had said – there was little or no objective evidence to support their complaints” </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[AB1/1B:19]</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.   He went on to observe that there was little weight accorded to the opinion of the investigating police officer that the punishments complained of were ‘slightly over the top however understandable’.  Whilst he referred to the fact of the subsequent ABE interviews, he had no proper understanding of the evidence given by the children on those occasions nor the reach or extent of the cross-examination in respect of that evidence.  In short, his judgment is an overall critique of the two earlier judgments which he found to be thin on detail, analysis and reasoning.  He referred to the fact that it was the parents’ failure to accept those findings which was the primary cause of their failing the subsequent assessments but he did not refer to (and probably did not know about) the occasions since the fact finding hearing when each of the parents’ lawyers had acknowledged their inability to go behind those findings in the absence of a timely appeal.  He referred to the fact that it was the L fact find which had provided the threshold for T’s case.  That was inaccurate since a separate threshold document had been prepared by the local authority for the October 2014 hearing.  Whilst T’s threshold document made reference to the October 2013 findings, those findings related to only one of the two facts relied upon.  He took the view that a parenting assessment which had ostensibly ‘failed’ on the basis of parents refusing to accept the facts found could not be an adequate assessment for the purposes of a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">B-S </span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">compliant holistic analysis of the children’s welfare needs.  The final paragraph of his judgment alluded to the fact that this might well be a case more properly founded on neglect if, in fact, the case relying upon unusual punishment fell away.  In this context, he invited further submissions from the local authority in terms of the future conduct of the case and, if appropriate, a reappraisal of the way they put their case in front of the District Judge.  By subsequent order dated 5 December 2014, the care and placement orders in respect of both L and T were set aside.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In relation to the appeal in L’s case, the process adopted by HHK Plunkett did not come close to that which is required by FPR2010, Part 30.  The D11 notice filed by the parents did not contain any grounds of appeal, other than the bare assertion that the children had retracted allegations.  The Notice was stated to be challenging the judge’s decision regarding L’s adoption and the judge’s refusal to allow the parents to apply to revoke the placement order (ie the 2014 determinations) whereas the judge moved on to allow an appeal aganst the order made on the 2013 fact-finding hearing. Other than to note the point, at no stage did the judge engage with the fact that this un-pleaded ‘appeal’ was over a year out of time.  The grunds upon which the judge eventually came to allow the appeal emerged in the process of the free-flowing to-and-fro communication between the judge and counsel during the hearing on 21</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The lack of due process also caused the judge to by-pass the need to consider whether or not to extend time to permit an appeal against the fact-finding decision nearly 12 months prior to DJ Maughan deeming the parents’ application to be an application for permission to appeal.  In the present case the parents had been legally represented at the fact-finding hearing, yet the issue of calling the children to give oral evidence had not been raised with the district judge and it was not, apparently, considered a matter to be brought on appeal immediately following the fact finding hearing.  The question of whether the parents should be given an extension of time a year later to bring the point by way of appeal therefore plainly arose.  In the absence of a process that required the parents’ appeals on this point to be properly pleaded, the issue of an extension of time, it would seem, never sufficiently crystallised so that it was addressed by the parties or the judge.”</span>

That order and the order made subsequently by Roderic Wood J on 11 June 2015 expanded the ambit of the appeal hearing to include the appellants’ notice in relation to the findings of fact made on 25 October 2013.  The intention had been that Roderic Wood J would have dealt with the application for permission to appeal those findings out of time.  A whole day was allowed for that purpose.  By the time the case reached him, it was clear that the preparation of the appeal was deficient in a number of respects.  Accordingly, his lordship used that occasion to ‘case manage’ the hearing which was to come before me on 27 July 2015.  The time estimate was expanded and the appellants were directed to prepare a detailed schedule of “alleged retractions” and criticisms of the judgments setting out references to the documents and transcripts included within the eight bundles which were then in circulation.  The intention was that the respondents would reply to the schedule with a view to lodging the composite document, cross-referenced, by 10 July 2015.  Directions were given for obtaining a full transcript of the June 2014 hearing (L’s case) and the October 2014 hearing (T’s case).  In terms of the delay in bringing their appeal, the parents agreed to waive legal privilege in relation the legal advice they had received post the fact finding hearing as to whether an appeal could be pursued against that decision and, if so, when that could be done.  Each of the mother and the father has said that their understanding from the foot of advice received was that there was no avenue of appeal against fact finding decisions until the case had concluded after the welfare disposal hearings.</span>

FPR 2010, r 30.4 provides that an applicant for permission to appeal must file an appellant’s notice within 21 days of the date of the decision complained of.  The local authority invites me to consider whether this was a case management order which would have abbreviated the window of appeal to 7 days.  In my view, findings of fact involve a judgment reflecting the court’s determination of discrete but substantive issues.  Whilst that determination is but one of the building blocks in  case which is ongoing, it is nevertheless in my judgment a final determination of threshold and not simply a decision anchored to future case management.  Miss Cabeza on behalf of the local authority concedes that not much turns on this point since even the parents accept that they are 20 months late in issuing this appeal.</span>

On each of those occasions, the time for an appeal had expired.

There were two further substantive welfare hearings in June and October 2014.  On each occasion, the parents were represented.  On each occasion, the issue of their non-acceptance of the findings was canvassed as an issue before the court with an express or implied acceptance that the door was now closed.  Mr Spollen has specifically confirmed to me that he did not advise his client that he could not appeal before the full disposal of the case.

My focus at present is the issue of whether or not I should consider those appeals on the basis that the findings of fact stand or whether, as the parents contend, the final care and placement orders fall away completely once the findings of fact are overturned.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">, Miss Meachin and Mr Spollen make their submissions within the context of an overarching consideration of the merits of the parents’ appeals. They point to the fact that the picture was not one of a dysfunctional household at the time that the allegations were made but actually one where the children were well and happy within their mother’s care.  Having set out the background to the fact finding hearing in October 2013, I am unable to agree with the breadth of that submission.  Whilst I accept that there were certainly positive indicators which suggested that home life was improving with the absence from it of Mr S and the chronic domestic violence which had characterised the mother’s relationship with him in that household, there is in my judgment ample evidence to suggest that the children had significant problems and issues with which to deal.  The evidence which was before the District Judge in October 2013 included accounts of C and B1 smashing up their bedrooms.  The mother’s relationship with N was plainly dysfunctional and there was much coming and going between the two homes despite the disturbing picture of what life for N was like in her father’s home after she had voted with her feet and left.  L’s father confirmed that when he arrived in the home the previous year, it was chaotic and devoid of any boundaries or discipline.  Improvements were made in terms of the children’s attendance and progress at school and I have no doubt that, once free of an unhappy relationship with Mr S, the mother was indeed making efforts to effect changes to make life better for the family.  What I cannot accept is the picture which is painted on behalf of these parents as one where these allegations emerged out of the blue and from nowhere against the background of a happy and contented home.  In terms of the siblings’ perception, this was a fractured household.  It is common ground that the allegations emerged after N spoke to the social worker after the first sibling contact for many months.  </span>

She deals, first, with the evidence from Emma Spensley, the allocated social worker.  The judge does not rehearse verbatim the evidence which she gave but she refers clearly to the lengthy statement which she had read in addition to undertaking a review of the notes she made when she interviewed C and B1 about the allegations.  She commented upon the manner in which Miss Spensley gave her evidence.  She took into account the fact this witness had seen the children (including N) on a very regular basis.  She referred to the fact that Miss Spensley did not believe that the children had colluded over the allegations but reminded herself that this was only Miss Spensley’s opinion.  She commented upon the view which the social worker had formed about the truth of what she was told by C and reminded herself that C was then 15 years old.  She alluded to the fact that Miss Spensley had amended her typed notes of her interview with C in order to ensure that her record of events was an accurate record of what she had said.  She was present for the ABE interviews and confirmed that she was confident she had understood what each of the children were saying in relation to the allegations they were making.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The judge found Miss Spensley’s evidence to be ‘entirely cogent’ but did not simply endorse and adopt what she said.  It is important to recall that the judge was not present to assess the initial disclosures which N, C and B had made to Miss Spensley but she did observe the DVDs of the ABE interviews before she delivered her judgment.  Since Miss Spensley appears to have been in an adjoining room when the two boys were interviewed and watching on a television monitor, the judge was in the same position as the witness when it came to an evaluation of the truth or otherwise of what they were saying.  She saw, in effect, what the social worker saw.  Miss Spensley was able to express her views and opinions about that evidence from the foot of knowing the children well.  The judge was entitled to place reliance on those views and opinions in addition to forming her own views about what the children had said and the manner in which they had expressed themselves. However, there was no wholesale adoption by the judge of Miss Spensley’s evidence.  She had obviously considered and evaluated C’s evidence because she did not accept the witness’s opinion of everything which was said about the length of time during which the boys were made to stand.  She found that there may well have been some exaggeration on C’s part on this aspect of the evidence.  This was clearly an evaluative exercise on the part of the judge because she questioned whether it would have been physically possible for a boy of that age to have stood for six to twelve hours.  Insofar as the judge accepted that the children had been genuinely frightened by the treatment she found them to have experienced, she placed reliance on the social worker’s evidence because she formed an independent view that Miss Spensley was in the best position as the key witness in the case to relay that fear as it was communicated to her.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">She dealt with the evidence of Gemma O’Donnell in paragraph 14 of the judgment.  She had conducted the face to face ABE interviews with B1 and B2.  Before placing reliance on her evidence, the judge reminded herself that this witness had come to the case ‘particularly “fresh”’ having only seen the boys briefly in the office.  She had never met N.  She had not read the papers.  In my view, the judge was perfectly entitled to find, as she did, that this witness came to these interviews with no preconceived or predetermined views of the truth.  The judge found that to be ‘very helpful in this case’.  Miss O’Donnell had given evidence about her surprise to hear B1 use the phrase ‘elbow temperature’.  The judge recorded the fact that she was an experienced social worker who was fully qualified to conduct ABE interviews with vulnerable children.  If and insofar as that surprise was a factor shared by the judge in her evaluation of whether a boy of that age would use such a phrase, I do not think she can be criticised for importing it into her evaluation of the evidence.  The judge, too, had watched the interviews unfold although she did not have the advantage which Miss O’Donnell had of sitting opposite the children in the same room.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The judge dealt in fairly short order with the factual evidence of DC Francis.  Her role in the fact finding was limited and, as the judge remarked, was ‘fairly straightforward factual evidence’ which related to conversations she had had with C on 15 July 2013 very shortly after N had expressed her concerns to the social worker for the wellbeing of her sister and brothers.  Those expressions of concern were second hand; DC Francis’ role was to investigate those concerns at first hand from C.  She recorded what happened during her visit to see C at her school in a statement to which she was taken during the hearing.  C had confirmed to her that she had told N about ‘the bath and standing up for ages’.  She did not say that the cold baths had not happened; instead she accepted the suggestion put to her by DC Francis that there may have been a good reason for the cold baths. She said she had told N that B2 had been made to stand by the wall as punishment because he was misbehaving and not listening.  She described this punishment as having taken place when the family was living in hostel accommodation in circumstances where the boys had been running around causing other residents to complain.  She did not withdraw the allegation that the boys had been made to stand but said she thought the period may have been about forty minutes.  When she was cross-examined about C’s demeanour, DC Francis said she had appeared very open.  In her judgment, the District Judge highlighted the conflict between that evidence and what she said on another occasion that B2 was made to stand for six to twelve hours.   She had clearly evaluated that evidence and reached a conclusion.  The fact that the police decided not to prosecute the parents is not a determination by the police that the punishments complained of did not happen.  The police would have been very well aware that there were ongoing care proceedings in relation to these children who were immediately removed from the family home for their own protection.</span>

Having noted the mother’s denials in respect of the over-chastisement, the forced standing up and the use of cold baths, the judge appears to have been particularly struck by the mother’s over use of the expression “everything was fine, everything was fine” to describe life at home.  She said that it was very clear having heard live evidence that the mother had at best minimised what was going on in ‘this much fractured family’.  In the light of all the evidence put before the court for the purposes of the fact finding hearing, I take the view that there was more than sufficient evidence to enable the judge to reach that conclusion; indeed, it is one which I share.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In her response to the local authority’s revised threshold document, the mother had admitted that on two occasions the father had, at her request, woken the boys as they slept to take them to the toilet so as to avoid wetting their beds </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  In cross-examination she confirmed that was what she had said.  The judge recorded in her judgment that the mother had said that neither B1 nor B2 suffered from any bed-wetting problems.   In fact what the mother had said at </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[AB1/1C:46] </span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">was that she had not mentioned it to the social workers either for the purposes of the child protection minutes or in preparation for the core assessments because they were embarrassed and did not want any reference to bed-wetting to appear.  She accepted as a matter of fact that there was no such record in the papers.  She justified that response by saying that she felt as their mother she should have been able to deal with the problem without running to social services to ask for help.  Nevertheless, she accepted that this was not something which had ever been mentioned to the social workers and, further, that there had never been any problems in relation to bed-wetting since the boys had been staying in foster care </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[AB1/1C:47]</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  In the approved version of her judgment, the judge went on to refer to problems highlighted in the foster carers’ evidence about ‘inappropriate toileting’ but this related to what the judges recorded as “a behavioural fear of using the toilet in their premises for whatever reason” </span>

The judge was clear in her conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to persuade her that the boys had a bed-wetting problem and she therefore felt unable to place any weight on the explanation which the mother had given in her amended response to the threshold document by way of purported explanation for the father’s reasons for getting the children out of bed at night once asleep.</span>

In these circumstances, all that the judge could do was to look at the totality of the evidence before her, at what others (including the children) were saying and doing, and form a view as to his truthfulness as a witness.  She had the opportunity to see and hear him as he gave his evidence in court.  She was able to observe his demeanour and the manner in which he answered the difficult and searching questions which were put to him in cross-examination.  She reached the conclusion that he was ‘a little more honest than the mother in that he eventually acknowledged that things were going badly wrong in this family’.  In weighing her conclusions about the father, the judge found that he had sought to minimise the description of the assault on his former partner which had formed the factual basis of his criminal conviction.  She found that he had been involved directly in imposing discipline on a family which was devoid of even elementary boundaries at the time he began living with the mother.

She found it to be reliable and truthful.  She was entitled to weigh this finding in the balance when she came to consider the father’s denials.  She found him to be an untruthful witness.  She found that he had minimised the controlling and negative impact which he had had on this family.  She found that he had minimised the extent of his involvement in disciplining the boys and that he had been prepared to lie in rejecting the truth of their descriptions of his behaviour towards them.  She was aware, even if she did not spell it out in clear terms in her judgment, that each of the boys had given a different yet detailed account of how they had been placed by the father in cold baths and made to stand against the wall.  She was aware, because she had seen the DVDs, that whilst B1 said he had kicked and resisted being placed in the bath, B2 had not “dithered” like him and had merely sat silently.  She would have heard B1’s account of telling the social worker that “</span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-family:Garamond">they</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">” had said it was elbow temperature but he could not see L being placed in a bath that cold.  He had been able to contextualise that comment by explaining to the social worker that, on a scale of one to ten, the water had felt as cold as a ‘9’.  The judge was aware that this was not mere reportage or a simple allegation of a child being placed in a cold bath.  This was a clear and lucid description of what had happened and how the child had experienced what had happened to him.  In a similar vein, B2 had been able to describe his teeth chattering and being too cold to speak.  The judge did not specifically refer to this evidence from the children in her judgment but there is no doubt that she was fully aware of it having watched it and heard it very shortly before delivering her judgment.</span>

In their written submissions, they point to the absence of a transcript of the fact finding hearing and their inability to point to this allegation being put to the parents.

In my view, her findings in relation to the parents’ attempts to coach or influence the children cannot be impugned even if she did not rehearse within the body of her judgment the specific evidence which informed her conclusion.  There was an evidential foundation for that conclusion and she had given reasons for rejecting the evidence of the parents in terms of their overall credibility.</span>

The District Judge took a similar view.  Whilst I accept that the analytical content of the fact finding judgment cannot be said to be full, I am not aware of any specific piece or pieces of evidence which the judge should have taken into account but failed to take into account.  She knew about the retraction which C had made to the Guardian because she had asked about it.  She did not refer to it in her judgment but she plainly had it in mind because she had heard detailed submissions about it from the mother’s advocate.  That must lead to the conclusion that the judge felt she could place little weight on that piece of evidence which did not arise until the child was back at home with her mother in an environment where she had already found there to be collusion or coaching.</span>

The judge had referred to the correct position in relation to the burden and standard of proof not once but twice in her judgment.  She had cited the relevant authority.

Each of the findings sought was then set out by way of a general allegation (e.g. the father has physically abused B1) with sub-paragraphs following with particularised incidents / examples.  In delivering her judgment, the judge not only accepted the generic categories of physical and emotional abuse; she also particularised her findings as to the detail and, where her findings were in conflict with the threshold document, she highlighted where those differences lay.  In relation to the cold baths, she found that these had been administered as a punishment against the children’s will.  In relation to the periods when the children were made to stand, she rejected C’s account of standing for six to twelve hours but found it to have been in excess of one hour.  She said this was a period of time which she found to be excessive and abusive.  She declined to make a finding in relation to inappropriate sexual activity in the presence of one or more of the children and explained why she had done so.  This allegation was based on reportage from N whom the judge described as “a young person in need of emotional support and professional help”.   It was not an allegation which had been reported by any of the other children whom she had seen and heard on the DVD evidence and whom she described as “children who were not shy in coming forward to voice their concerns about Mr D [the father] and their mother” </span>

It was not, either at the conclusion of the fact finding hearing in October 2013 or at the conclusion of the welfare hearing in L’s case in June 2014.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">On behalf of the local authority, Miss Cabeza makes the point that if local authorities are to act with reasonable expedition in giving effect to care plans approved by the court at final hearings, it is essential that local authorities and adopters have confidence that, once the period for permission to appeal has elapsed, a court will not lightly allow an appeal against care and placement orders.  That was a view endorsed by McFarlane LJ in Re: H (Children) cited above. Nothing was said or done by these parents for well over a year after these findings of fact had been made.  No one had thought to ask the District Judge to revisit her judgment or to provide any further explanation for her conclusions in relation to the facts or their linkage to threshold.  The cases in relation to both L and T had proceeded over the course of the following 12 months without any indication that the fact finding process had been flawed in any way.</span>

I agree with her to the extent that it seems to me that the real issue in this case is whether or not District Judge was wrong in June and/or October 2014 to refuse to reopen her findings of fact in the light of the parent’s evidence with regard to retractions by the children and/or her unwillingness to test her earlier conclusions against the reliability or otherwise of what they then appeared to be saying.</span>

Had that appeal been dealt with promptly, the findings could have been re-examined and the local authority might then have been invited to put its case forward on the basis of an alternative threshold if that had been felt necessary.  It is difficult to imagine at this point in time how there could in any event be an effective reopening of the facts as they stood in June 2013 (which is the relevant date for L) and in May 2014 (which is the relevant date for T).  Everything which has happened since October 2013 has been shaped by the findings which were made and, whatever the deficiencies in the depth of the forensic evaluation, they were findings which, in my judgment, were supported by an adequate evidential foundation.</span>

The process of a rehearing of the evidence relating to the fact finding is likely to require the elder children to revisit the events which were the subject of their earlier allegations.  Their positions may or may not be in harmony.  There is already ample evidence before the court of their disturbed behaviour and a difficult family dynamic.  It would be extraordinarily difficult for a judge to undertake that process afresh after the passage of over two years.  It would inevitably be a stressful position for the elder children whether a further enquiry proceeded by way of further local authority interviews, the instruction of an independent social worker or the children’s attendance at court. The court already has some evidence about the boys’ reaction to the news that the two younger children would not be returning to the family.  One can only imagine the anguish which must have been felt by B1 and B2 in believing that they had somehow precipitated that final fracture within the family.</span>

At that stage, he did not feel able to express a view about arrangements for L because he had not seen a placement application from the local authority or considered the parents’ response.</span>

When it was suggested to him that he, too, had made allegations about him, B1 said, ‘Yes, but people change’.  He said that since he had been spending time with the father, things were better.

There was concern about missed sessions with Action for Children because of the parents’ absence with the children on holiday.  It subsequently transpired that the local authority knew about the holiday plans and the missed sessions arose because of the father’s illness and the mother’s inability to attend because she was then in the late stages of pregnancy.

She had undertaken work with the family from August 2013 and January 2014 when she produced her main report.  Her central concern had been the parents’ non-acceptance of the findings but she also expressed significant concerns about the mother’s ability to effectively manage the behaviour of the older children and the impact of that on the younger children.  She confirmed that when she visited the home, she did not have any concerns about cleanliness and tidiness.  She was asked about her inability to complete her work with the family because of the holiday taken in April 2014 prior to T’s birth and she confirmed that she had tried to alert the parents to the difficulties which their absence would present in finalising a report.  When cross-examined by the Guardian’s advocate, she confirmed that she had significant concerns about the parents’ insight and their commitment to change.  She was worried about their ability to manage five children within their home and, in particular, about managing the behaviour of the elder children whilst trying to care two much younger children.  She was concerned that managing the stress of running a large household of five or six children might lead to repeat behaviours of domestic abuse and she pointed to the vulnerability of the L and T in the context of those family dynamics.  In her view, the previous findings of fact were but one aspect of wider concerns over the safety of these children within that family dynamic.</span>

She accepted that there had been difficulties of communication between Action for Children, the local authority, the parents and their solicitors and she accepted that one of the meetings had to be cancelled because of the mother’s pregnancy.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Miss Allen was cross-examined at some length about the prospects of managing the risk for L if she were returned home. She accepted that if there was therapy and ongoing support from social workers, there might well be a more positive outcome for the elder children which could bode well for the younger children.  However, she remained of the view that the mother’s ability to parent five or six children on her own would give rise to concerns and she was worried about the father’s ongoing health problems and his unwillingness to engage with the services being provided.   As the social worker responsible for the care plan for L, she said that in balancing all the factors, she had to take account of the family make up and the dynamics of the relationship between the parents in order to decide whether they could meet L’s needs. She said she had looked very carefully at the prospects of maintaining L within her birth family and had considered seriously the prospects of support through MST.  She had considered a possible placement with the father’s parents so as to maintain a familial link but they were already caring for his three elder children and the relationship between those grandparents and the mother was ‘non-existent’.  She said she had also considered long term fostering so as to maintain links with the family but had rejected the option because of L’s age.  She had ultimately rejected the possibility of a further assessment for the parents because of concerns over their ability to change within the younger children’s time frames.  There were obvious worries about the chaotic household and the possible risk posed by the mother’s eldest son given the previous breaches of the working agreement which prevented him from coming into the home.  She did not believe that the parents were capable of caring safely for the two younger children.</span>

She did not believe that even an intense level of support would safeguard two young children in the chaotic home environment which was known to exist.

She was asked about L’s relationship with her siblings and confirmed that the children interacted well.  She accepted that the elder children would go through a grieving process if L was adopted and she gave evidence about some of the work which could be done to help them with their feelings of loss.  She was asked whether she believed the risk could be managed with the family home so as to mitigate the severity of the consequences of adoption.  Her evidence was that the risk was too great to be managed effectively and there remained serious concerns about the parents’ ability to work effectively with support services.  The environment within the home remained chaotic and the parents had failed to manage the behaviours of the older children.  She confirmed, when cross-examined by the Guardian’s advocate, that there were global concerns about the family which went beyond concerns for L and T over inappropriate methods of chastisement as they grew older.  She was concerned that their inability to accept the findings might mean that the children felt unable to report any further instances of abuse or harm because they had not been believed before.  There was also the risk, in her view, of coaching by the parents.  These were concerns which Miss Evans described as “extremely significant” </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[AB2/2C:120]</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  She said she was concerned that the elder children remained at risk notwithstanding the supervision orders which were to be put in place.  Despite the “robust package of support” she had striven to provide, she remained unconvinced that it would be sufficient to safeguard the older children.  Despite the work which she intended to do with them to verbalise their wishes and feelings, she had doubts as to whether they would feel confident in coming forward now.  She confirmed that adding to the family dynamic two children under two years old and entirely dependent upon their parents for their needs would represent “a huge risk”.</span>

She spoke about the courses she was undertaking in parenting and domestic violence and she descried her relationship with the father.   She accepted that life in the household had been chaotic when they first got together and the children had little respect for her.  Things were much better and she had a strong relationship with L and T’s father.  When cross-examined about the findings on behalf of the local authority, she accepted that she believed the children had been telling lies.  Nonetheless, she accepted that neither she nor those trying to work with the family could go behind them.  She understood that the social workers had concerns for L apart from the specific findings and recognised that there were times when she had prioritised N’s needs of B1’s.  She was not prepared to accept that she was being naïve about the reality of life or her ability to cope if L returned home.  She accepted that she had been remanded overnight in prison because of poor compliance with her probation requirements but she told the court that this was because her legal team had not been present and the judge did not have any of the paperwork.

She dealt with a number of searching questions about her own criminal conviction, the domestic abuse she had suffered over 16 years in her previous relationship with Mr S and the father’s conviction for assault on his previous partner.  She said that she had not been prepared to end her relationship with him after the findings had been made against him in October 2013 because she did not believe those things had happened to the children.  She gave evidence about the support she was receiving from the Anawim centre and told the court about the improvements she felt she had been able to make in her parenting of the children.  She was asked about the level of stability she could provide for L if difficulties arose in the future with D and N.  She said that D would often pop in while the children were at school to bring washing round but he knew he was not allowed to come to the property when they were home.  When it was put to her that N had said D had been staying at the property, the mother said she was not telling the truth.  If L and T were returned home, she would not take them round to see him until he had competed his own assessments and it was safe to do so.

She asked him whether or not he had thought about how they might cope if L and T were returned to their care.  He said that they would share all the care and housework between them.  He was quite happy to change nappies and knew how to look after young children although he accepted he needed “a bit of improvement with teenagers”.  He dealt with the judge’s questions about the holiday to Cornwall and that he was now considered fit again to drive.</span>

He had produced two reports for the court, both of which were included in the material in the bundles.  The District Judge had read those reports, as have I.  He was asked about the significance of the findings which had been made in October 2013.  His evidence was that they related to L’s parents’ capacity to manage behaviours coming from all the children.  The issues which faced the court were not simply confined to their ability to manage behaviours of children of B1 ad B2’s ages.  There was a much wider issue which involved their capacity to provide stability and security for two very young children whose needs were different from, but no less demanding than, the needs of 12 and 13 year old children.  He said that the totality of the situation facing the court could not be defined simply by the findings although they were important.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">It was his view that the package of support which the local authority was proposing to put in place to support the older children at home was unlikely to produce meaningful long term change and not the fundamental changes that would be required to enable them to safely meet the needs of infants of L and T’s ages.  He was asked about the balancing exercise he had carried out in his report before making his final recommendations.  That had included an assessment of the relationship which L enjoyed with her older siblings.  The Guardian explained that he hd considered this aspect carefully.  Because he did not consider that her parents could safely meet her needs at home, he could not see any means by which that sibling relationship could be maintained.  If she was placed in permanent foster care, the local authority would remain her corporate parent throughout her life until she was 18 years old.  She would not have a family of her own to meet her needs.  It would not be a stable upbringing for her.  In his view, adoption would provide her with permanence and stability which was more important than preserving her relationship with her older half-siblings.  He did not support further assessment of the parents and believed that the package of support for the older siblings was as much as could reasonably be expected of the local authority.</span>

L had been in care for about a year and she was getting older all the time.

In my submission, where harm is perhaps less tangible than physical injury, broken bones or profound abuse of a child, it is sometimes harder to evaluate that harm.  The Court has the benefit of a very clear picture of what the harm to [L] could be and could produce were she returned home.  Because we have a picture of [N] aged 16, having lived within the family home all her life and now being a child demonstrating difficult, damaged and unsettled behaviour, whose lifestyle is itinerant, historically unsupported, with her toing and froing between her parents.  The feared harm for L and in turn T is chronic neglect of their physical and emotional needs.

In my submissions, the evidence that assists the court in answering this question is as follows.  There is a real risk to [L] of experiencing the same harm.  The real risk is well beyond, in my submission, the threshold of likelihood. Why ? There is no acceptance by the parents of past harm.  There is no acceptance of the Court’s findings or an understanding or insight into the reasons for past neglect and where the responsibility for that lies.

In my submission, in order for the Court to be able to make that decision, it must be satisfied that, first of all, parents cannot provide the safe care that is required, and I have dealt with that.

I have set out above several relevant extracts from the transcript of that hearing.  The Guardian was cross-examined at some length in relation to the overall risk to L and the judge heard submissions from Miss Pritchard on this point.  By this stage she was very familiar with the case having case managed it since its transfer at the beginning of October the previous year.  In paragraph 7 of her judgment, she set out a lengthy exposition of the circumstances behind the “chaotic living” within the family and the children’s current circumstances.  She refers at the end of that paragraph to the fact that N and C had already been placed under supervision orders at home on 3 March 2014 on the basis of the findings which had been made.  She went on to record in her judgment much of the evidence to which I have referred earlier in this judgment and identified the salient aspects of the evidence which each of the witnesses had given.  </span>

In relation to the evidence she had given in relation to MST, the judge found it relevant that an “extremely high threshold” was required to be crossed before such a referral could be made.    She found Miss Fiellateau to be a reliable and effective witness.  Her evidence had plainly informed the judge’s conclusions in relation to concerns about the father’s health and the fact that neither parent had displayed an effective commitment to change.  That concern was reinforced in the judge’s mind, as she made clear, from the evidence she heard from Linda Evans whose evidence she set out in paragraph 13 of her judgment.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">The judge analysed in some detail the evidence she had heard from the mother (paragraph 14).  She was plainly concerned about the content of some of the mother’s responses to questions put to her in cross-examination.  Her lack of insight into the underlying causes of the chaotic dynamics within the home, her tendency to blame N  for the problems, and her absence of any concern as to how she would cope with two very young children added to the mix were clearly addressed as risks for L in the judge’s mind.  She expressed very clear concerns about the quality of parenting which was available to the children at that particular time and factored in the risks of two young babies being returned to the home in circumstances where the mother had no insight into the additional stress factors which would thereby become engaged.  It is true that she placed reliance on the failed assessments which reflected in part the parents’ failures to accept the findings and thereby demonstrate the capacity for empathetic acceptance of what the children had suffered.  However, I have found in my refusal of permission to appeal those findings of fact that there was ample evidence before the court to reach the conclusions that it did in October 2013.  There is thus something of an internal tension in the parents’ position as I pointed out to Miss Meachin during the course of her submissions.  In circumstances where the findings of fact stand undisturbed, the mother and father must be taken to be wrongly in denial about their failures vis à vis these children.  The judge did not ignore the positives in her judgment.  For example, she gave the mother full credit for recognising the need of all the children, including L, for stability.  She accepted that the proceedings could not go on indefinitely and that, too, the judge found to be a positive response.</span>

She referred to his reports, the most recent of which had been prepared only a week before the hearing.  She referred to the full child impact analysis which he had carried out in relation to L.  That analysis was set out over eight pages of his report.  His analysis as it related specifically to L occupied four of those pages.  In relation parenting capacity, the Guardian had been quite clear in his views which he had formed on the basis of all the information available to the court.  He did not consider that either the father or the mother would be able to provide a standard of parenting for L which would be good enough to ensure that her needs were safely met.  He went on to explain precisely why he had formed that view.  He dealt with the relationship which L had formed with her parents and her siblings as contact had developed.  He referred to the option of placement as being a Draconian step but recognised it as one which was proportionate to L’s need for a family of her own where she would receive good enough parenting.  He had looked at the only alternative options of a placement with the maternal grandmother and/or the paternal grandparents.  Both assessments had been negative.  In paragraph 9 of his report he set out in tabular form a permanence analysis for L in terms of the range of orders which might be considered and gave his reasons for his recommendation of adoption.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In dismissing the appeal, McFarlane LJ pointed to the danger of attacking a judgment or process of judicial analysis as “linear” (i.e. based upon a stepped approach through the welfare checklists in the 1989 and 2002 Acts) simply because as a matter of structure the judge considers and then expresses a conclusion upon one particular option for a child before moving on to consider another option.  He said, in para 18 :</span>

Those submissions are echoed in the grounds which Miss Meachin and Mr Spollon have put before me in relation to the appeal with which I am dealing.  Having read the judgment as a whole, McFarlane LJ was unable to agree.  He considered that the judge had indeed made his own assessment of risk, albeit not using any formal structure to conduct that analysis.  Given his findings as to the deeply entrenched nature of the mother’s choice of partners and the pattern of her alcohol abuse (in that case), the judge was entitled to conclude that the risk of harm could only be managed or neutralised by the introduction of a round the clock professional carer, a proposition which was “obviously unrealistic”.  The question for the judge in that case, as he made plain in his judgment, was whether the mother could make sufficient progress in a timescale that was compatible with the needs of her young child.  McFarlane LJ considered that the judgment in relation to his findings of fact and the entrenched nature of the mother’s behaviour and the related underlying problems led inevitably to the conclusion that there was no other avenue open to him as an option for the child (para 34).</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">With this in mind, I return to District Judge Maughan’s judgment.  She had already made her findings in October 2013 in relation to the abuse and over-chastisement of B1 and B2 and their mother’s failure to protect them from that harm.  She found in her June 2014 judgment that the parents’ failure to accept those findings was “a significant fact” because that failure constituted evidence of their inability to change and embrace the work which would be required to rectify many of the parenting defects which had been identified throughout the body of evidence which was then before the court.  She was very mindful of the time frame for L and reminded herself that the proceedings had been ongoing for 53 weeks, more than twice the length of time normally permitted.  She accepted the evidence of the principal social workers and made further findings that the parents’ inability to accept the findings made in October 2013 were not the only factors which gave rise to concern for L.  She identified the chaotic home life and the failure of the parents to maintain discipline and boundaries as another major factor in the case.  She accepted that there was  “a very real risk” that the parents would be unable to prioritise the younger (and wholly dependent) children’s needs if the older children continued to display the challenging and abusive behaviours which had featured as a regular occurrence in the evidence which was before the court.  Those behaviours were not challenged by the parents as having occurred.  Both B1 and C had reacted to attempts to discipline them by smashing up their bedrooms.  The judge referred to the highly dysfunctional relationship which N had with her mother, a relationship which had led in the past to abusive behaviour towards her mother which included not simply a complete lack of respect but physical altercations involving kicking and biting.  The judge referred to the “extremely high threshold” which was required before a family could be referred for consideration for MST.  This type of intervention involved 24 hour assistance for parents struggling to manage their children.  It was the type of intervention which McFarlane LJ rejected as being “unrealistic” as an option in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Re R</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond"> (above).  The family had in any event been turned down as candidates for this type of intervention, a fact which perhaps speaks much about the perceived level of dysfunction within it.  The judge found specifically that the mother showed insufficient insight into the work which had been done by Action for Children and that she currently lacked insight into the need for change.  She found as a fact that the mother had failed to recognise the needs of the children by taking control of issues of discipline primarily by herself (paragraph 14).  Similarly, she found that the father had failed to prioritise his contact with his three elder daughters; that he had failed to demonstrate any or any sufficient insight into their needs, wishes and feelings’ that he had minimised his own shortcomings as a parent; that he had failed to accept responsibility for the domestic violence perpetrated against his former partner on the single occasion it had happened; that he had a propensity to ‘play the victim’ in these proceedings and had moved no further forward in his parenting abilities or his appreciation of the situation from the time of the October 2013 fact finding hearing (paragraph 15).</span>

The cumulative evidence of the risks to L of being returned in June 2014 were found by the judge to be too high.  That was her analysis and evaluation of risk within the final disposal hearing; it went beyond her previous evaluation of risk in terms of the threshold analysis which identified the risks at the relevant date.

An appellate court is much less likely to conclude that category (iv) applies in cases where the trial judge’s decision was not based on his assessment of the witnesses’ reliability or likely future conduct.  So far as category (v) is concerned, the appellate judge should think very carefully about the benefit the trial judge had in seeing the witnesses and hearing the evidence, which are factors whose significance depends on the particular case.  However, if after such anxious consideration, an appellate court adheres to her view that the trial judge’s decision was wrong, then I think that she should allow the appeal.”</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">This ground warrants separate consideration since it involves, in part, the retraction which B1 is said to have made to the Guardian.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  In my judgment, the District Judge cannot be criticised for not revisiting her fact finding conclusions.  First, in his conversation with the Guardian, B2 did not retract anything he had said previously.  He simply said that he wanted to go home.  Secondly, the Guardian’s view (as the person who had spoken to B1) was that his wish to withdraw what he had said about the father was an emotional response to learning that placement was the preferred option of the local authority for L.  B1 had by then become attached to his baby sister.  We know that he was anxious about the outcome of the pending June 2014 hearing.  He wanted her to come home and he was concerned about the impact of the findings on the outcome.  I have analysed in some depth the evidence which was available to the District Judge in the context of her original findings of fact about the cold baths and the excessive punishments meted out to B1 and B2.  There was cogent and reliable evidence, as I have found, available to her as the basis of or platform for those findings.  In my judgment, she was entitled to accept and adopt the Guardian’s view as to why B1 had said what he did.  She was entitled to find that explanation sufficiently persuasive in the light of the holistic evaluation of all the other evidence which was put before her.  Accordingly, on that basis, and because no one asked her at the time to revisit her findings, I decline to adopt ground 3 as a reason for disturbing either her findings or her orders. </span>

The criticism made in the report of the father is confined his lack of commitment to his three elder daughters, his lack of engagement in the contact arrangements, his failure to liaise effectively with his parents (to whom their primary care had been entrusted) and his failure to engage with work being undertaken by the author of that report.</span>

The judge did not find that the placement of the elder children with the parents was without risk.  On the contrary, she had heard the evidence of the Guardian (which she adopted) and other professional witnesses that a placement with the parents was fraught with risk.  The Guardian viewed it as the least detrimental option for C, B1 and B2 because of the history of their absconding behaviour from previous foster placements.  The Guardian dealt specifically with the risks to B1 and B2 of further absconding and the option of placing the elder children in secure accommodation was rejected at an early stage.  On balance, the judge accepted that a supervision order was the least harmful outcome for the elder children.  The risks to L as a two year old child without a voice and without the means to remove herself from a potential situation of harm were very different and required a different response in terms of the level of protection required.  The judge was satisfied that placement was the only realistic option if L was to receive safe parenting over the remaining years of her minority.</span>

I do so not because it deserves and requires any less analysis and investigation but because much of the evidence relied on in informing the court’s conclusions in relation to T was itself informed by and predicated upon previous findings and the body of evidence which was then available to the District Judge.  Having said that, there was a separate threshold document in relation to T for the purposes of the final hearing in October 2014.  In addition to recording the October 2013 findings and the fact that the mother was asserting that the children had lied to professionals, there was a new limb :-</span>

B1 and B2 remained at the home she continued to share with the father under the supervision orders which had been made in June 2014.  L had moved to her adoptive placement on 7 October 2014 and a ‘goodbye’ contact had taken place with her parents and half-siblings shortly after the hearing in June.  T was in his foster placement; he had never been cared for since his birth by the parents.  He was then just six months old.  The local authority had at that stage identified a placement for T with his sister, L, and was anxious to expedite the placement of T.  However, by the time she came to deal with this hearing, District Judge Maughan was well aware that, despite the absence of any appeal in relation to the fact finding hearing, there was a pending appeal in relation to the welfare disposal of L which was due to be heard by HHJ Plunkett on 21 November 2014, some six weeks hence.  The local authority had confirmed that it would take no steps to place T prior to that appeal hearing if care and placement orders were granted and would not arrange “goodbye” contacts prior to that date.</span>

He had been upset about this and, according to the mother, had said it was not fair that L was going to be adopted because of something he had done </span>

The mother says that once he was allowed to remain in the home, he kept asking about the chances of L being able to come home.  She further states that B1 and C would sometimes blame each other for L not being at home and C had said to B1 that it was his fault for going along with it.  She says that on 11 July 2014 B1 had said to his mother that it was his fault that L had been placed for adoption.  He said they had wanted the father to leave the home and had made up the allegations in the hope that Mr S would return.  She told him to speak to Adele Johnson.  She was the assistant vice principal and child protection officer at his school.  This conversation prompted her to issue her application for revocation of L’s placement order.</span>

He was extremely upset about a letter which he had written to the judge which he did not believe had been passed on to the court by the social worker.  (I have referred to this letter already.  It was before the court and is in the bundles.  He told Miss Johnson that he and the other children had made up “the stuff” about the father.  When asked what he was talking about, he said, “things like having to stand in the cold bath and all that”.  The memorandum goes on to confirm that on 11 July 2014 a social worker had come to the school to see C but C had refused to speak to her.  C also said they had lied about the father but no one was listening so there was no point in speaking to them.  On 19 September 2014, Miss Johnson had spoken individually to C, B1 and B2 as “a catch up from the summer holidays and to confirm that they were okay”.  C confirmed that there were lots of arguments because they had lied about the father and it was mainly her idea.  B1 stated that he had told social workers that they had lied but they kept saying that it was too late or they could not talk about it.  B2 said he was upset about L and T and said he felt sad because they had lied.  He did not elaborate.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Before the hearing commenced, the District Judge made it clear that she was aware there was a pending appeal in L’s case which was due to be heard the following month.  On behalf of the mother, Mr Messling sought an adjournment of the proceedings in relation to T in the light of that pending appeal.  The transcript shows that Mr Messling was at that stage unaware that the Guardian had given oral evidence about B1’s retraction.  The application was opposed by the Guardian who was anxious that delay for T should be minimised.  The court was reminded that there was still no extant appeal against the fact finding judgment notwithstanding that 12 months had by that stage elapsed.  The local authority’s case in submissions was that the concerns for T went beyond the October 2013 findings.  Specifically, the threshold for him included the risk of harm flowing from the mother’s vulnerability, her volatile relationship with N and C and her inability to offer appropriate parental control or set boundaries </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  The judge reminded herself that there was evidence within the witness statements of the parents which confirmed their acknowledgement that they could not go behind the findings.  She noted that HHJ Plunkett’s directions did not relate to any appeal against the October 2013 judgment but only to the care and placement orders in respect of L.  She made specific reference to the balance which was required between the Convention rights enshrined in Articles 6 and 8 and the inevitable lengthy delay for T in circumstances where he was then 6 months old and had a potential placement with L’s adoptive parents.  She reminded herself that it was within the context of that balancing exercise that she had to examine the quality of the evidence which was being relied upon in terms of a change of circumstances.  She recorded in her ruling the Guardian’s evidence from the June 2014 hearing as to his views about why B1 sought to recant his accusations having been placed back in the home after he learnt that the plan for L was adoption.  She recorded the views of the local authority and the Guardian that this might be seen as an opportunity for the parents to go behind previously acknowledged findings.  Having weighed matters in the balance, the judge decided that the hearing should proceed so that final decisions could be taken about T whose welfare was her paramount consideration.  She noted that the appeal hearing had already been listed before HHJ Plunkett on 21 November 2014 and said that if either of the parents wished to appeal any decision made in relation to his long term future, it was in T’s interests for any further appeals to be dealt with by that judge on 21 November on the basis that transcripts should be expedited.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">This first ground of appeal has to be seen now in the light of my own decision to refuse the parents permission to appeal the fact finding hearing.  I have explained earlier in this judgment why I took the view that there was ample evidence before the court in October 2013 to justify the findings of fact which were made.  I have not disturbed those findings, and they stand.  However, if and insofar as it may be relevant, I also take the view, as did District Judge Maughan in her substantive judgment on the welfare issues for T, that B1’s retraction was on the balance of probabilities an emotional response to discovering that the plan for L was adoption.  The judge declared herself “entirely satisfied” that “no cogent evidence has been put before this court to warrant any reopening of the fact-find or reinvestigation by an ISW” </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[AB3/3B:14]</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  The children had been placed back in the family home in an environment which was, on any view, emotionally febrile and unstable.  There is ample evidence in the papers to suggest that B1 and B2 were suffering emotionally as a result of carrying what they perceived to be the guilt of responsibility for the potential loss to the family of L and T.  I have found that the accounts of the treatment they received at the hands of the father as they described it during their ABE interviews was likely to have been true on the balance of probabilities.  They could not then have appreciated the consequences of what they were revealing to the social workers but they came to appreciate only too well what the consequences were.  The Guardian has described B1’s reaction to that news because he personally told him.  B2 had said that something had “hit him like a bomb” and caused him distress when he had a discussion with one of the social workers.  Whilst I accept that these reactions might equally be said to be the reactions of children who have come to realise the far reaching consequences of lies, I have not found these children to be lying.  The accounts of these alleged retractions are inconsistent.  B2 did not make any retractions at all until very late in the day.  All he said was he wanted to go home.  He later said he could trust his mother as there were new rules and new punishments.  It was only after he had spent time with B1 and C that he finally said he had been telling lies.  Even while she was purporting to write to the court supporting her mother’s case for the return of the two younger children to her care, she was telling police officers (who were completely independent third parties unconnected with the care proceedings) that that the boys were being brainwashed by the mother and father and threatened with being returned to care.  The judge had previously made findings that the children had been coached or influenced by their mother.  N did not deviate throughout the 12 months from her initial expression of concern for the boys that she was worried about them.  Despite the contents of C’s letter to the judge, she had by that stage voted with her feet and gone to live with Mr S because she was so unhappy in the home she shared with her mother.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">At the end of the day, the decision as to whether or not to adjourn the hearing was a case management decision for the judge.  It was a decision she took in circumstances where there was not only no appeal against the fact finding, there were specific acknowledgements from the parents that they were bound by the findings despite the fact that they did not accept them.  The father had accepted only for the purposes of T’s welfare hearing that threshold was crossed and the District Judge was well aware that, if they thought it appropriate to do so, the parents would have an early opportunity to challenge any decisions made in relation to T in the context of the appeal which was then pending in L’s case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">.  By reference to her findings in the June 2014 judgment in respect of L in relation to the parents’ capacity to make the necessary changes within the children’s time frames, she found that there was no solid evidence based reason before her then to change that view.  She pointed to the existence of the work already undertaken by Action for Children and Anawim.  She referred to the mother’s unwillingness to undergo a psychological assessment and to the content of the updated report from her probation officer as well as the fresh evidence from the social workers.  She found that there was no function for an ISW in terms of interviewing the children again because of the absence of cogent evidence to warrant any reopening of the fact finding process.  She agreed with the evidence of the Guardian that there was no reliable evidence before the court which pointed to a basis for believing that either of the parents had the necessary commitment to making changes such as to justify postponing the timetable for T.</span>

He was concerned by the anger displayed by the father towards social workers.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">Miss Meachin urges me to consider whether or not the Guardian had made any or any sufficient attempt to analyse or link with this evidence his assessment of the perceived risk for T.  In this context, it has to be borne in mind that threshold had not been opposed in T’s case.  In any event, the District Judge set out in her judgment an analysis of the evidence she had heard during the course of the hearing as to the events which had taken place since L’s hearing in June that year.   In my view, she was entitled to conclude that there had been no reduction in the risk presented to a small infant within that household from the previous occasion when she had determined that L should be placed for adoption.  Miss Meachin further submitted that this analysis by the Guardian came very close to the proscribed exercise of “social engineering” if the only concern was that this small child would not be afforded an opportunity to grow up in a calm and stable household.  I do not agree.  The analysis of both the Guardian and the judge was rooted in their respective conclusions about each of the parents.  In paragraphs 31 to 39 of her judgment, the District Judge reviewed the totality of the evidence she had heard from the Guardian.  She makes specific reference to the full Permanence Analysis which he carried out and his confirmation that all other avenues for placement have been explored.   She noted the positives he had drawn to the court’s attention such as the improvement in the father’s health and his attendance, with the mother, on a parenting course.  Equally, she notes his concerns about the absence of any change or improvement in their parenting since the fact find and the aggression being displayed by the father.  The judge said that she accepted that evidence and his detailed analysis in its entirety and effectively adopted it as her own as she had done in the previous hearing for L.  In terms, she was adopting that analysis as her own.  I cannot accept that there was insufficient evidence available to the court to reach a determination that those conclusions were wrong. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond">In my judgment, this ground of appeal is not made out.  First, the social worker’s admission that the local authority had a closed mind was a qualified admission as I have explained.  It was an evidence based assessment informed by what was already known about the defects in the parenting abilities of the mother and the father.  It was informed to an extent by the findings made in October 2013 and, at that stage, the findings still stood.  As was made abundantly clear by the evidence which had been put before the court in L’s hearing some four months before, there was a range of concerns outside the specific findings of fact.  The IRO had agreed with the placement option of adoption for T.  There was a considerable body of evidence available to the judge by that stage to support the local authority’s concerns that these parents were not fully engaged with or committed to the process of change within a time frame acceptable to a 6 month old baby.  When the father was cross-examined by the Guardian’s counsel, he was unable to identify any aspect of his parenting which he would wish to change.  When asked the specific question as to whether he felt there was anything he had done wrong or which he was still doing wrong, he stated, quite simply, “no” </span>

I agree with the local authority’s submission that it is wrong in principle to assert that because the October 2013 fact finding exercise was the starting point, the rest of the evidence before the court becomes irrelevant to the analysis which was conducted by the Guardian and/or the judge.  Each explained (the Guardian in his oral evidence and the judge in the course of judgment) how information gathered and assessment of that information had informed their respective evaluations.  The District Judge directed herself properly as to the law which she had to apply in undertaking the welfare evaluation in relation to T (paragraphs 49 to 56).  I am satisfied that she did carry out a sufficient weighing and balancing exercise to reach a position where her placement option evaluation (paragraphs 57 to 65) was sound.  She directed herself impeccably in relation to the law she had to apply in relation to placement and no criticism is made of her judgment in that regard.  Having reached a conclusion on the basis of all the evidence before her that T’s welfare required the making of care and placement orders (paragraph 64), she went on to balance once again the disadvantages of that course with the advantages which becoming a full member of a family with his sister, L, would bring (paragraph 65).

I have wanted to ensure that these parents should know that I have considered all the evidence which was put before me before reaching my final conclusions that there is no merit in either of the substantive appeals which are before the court.  My decision will be a difficult one for them to accept because I accept that each loves L and T and will suffer as a result of their loss.  However, I would encourage them to continue to engage with whatever assistance and support is made available to them in terms of the future for N, C, B1 and B2.  I hope that, with support, some of the concerns for these children can be ameliorated and the emotional toll of this lengthy litigation can be put behind them.</span>
