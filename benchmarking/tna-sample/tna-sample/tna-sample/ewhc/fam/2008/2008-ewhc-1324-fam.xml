	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This judgment is very long. In part this is a tribute to the very careful and detailed submissions I have received from counsel: Mr Nicholas Stonor representing the local authority, Mr Tim Spain representing Ms Z, Miss Lesley McKenzie representing Mr Y, Mr Justin Gray representing the GRK, and Miss Rachel Hudson representing X’s guardian, Mrs Suzanne Armstrong. I should like to pay tribute to all of them for the very considerable assistance they have given me throughout a long, arduous and complex case. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Albeit for very different reasons, as the oral evidence began to unfold both Mr Stonor, on the one side, and Mr Spain and Miss McKenzie, on the other, were faced with a number of forensic embarrassments which they handled with skill and aplomb. I should like to pay especial tribute to Mr Spain and Miss McKenzie who, as will become apparent, faced a number of particular difficulties. Although as the case progressed, and particularly as it neared its end, they must have been all too aware of the difficulties confronting their clients, they continued to strive to the very end to do the very best for them. Neither Mr Y nor Ms Z could have wanted for more.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This judgment is also very long because Mr Y and Ms Z are entitled to know in some detail why I have come to various findings which will not merely be devastating for them but may also bring unpleasant consequences for them. More especially, however, X – not now, when she is really too young to know much of what is going on, but later in her life – is entitled to a detailed and authentic account of what has happened to her and why I have come to a decision which she may, I fear, struggle to understand and accept.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This truly is, as Mr Stonor put it, a case which is unique, complex and tragic. It has been a tragedy for X and has become, and, I fear will long remain, a tragic nightmare for Mr Y and Ms Z. It is all too easy to say that they have only themselves to blame, that they have brought it on themselves. But the truth – and the tragedy – is that they did it all, I am quite satisfied, with the best of motives and impelled by nothing other than care and love for X. Having in March 2006 made a fatal decision to utilise what they initially thought was a loophole but which almost immediately snared them in what they well knew was illegality, they then found themselves trapped in a nightmare from which they could see no escape.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Stonor rightly says, I am now faced, as I was at the outset of the hearing, with a stark choice: to return X to Mr Y and Ms Z, or to approve a plan for her return to Kenya. Both options, as he realistically concedes, carry risks. That is also the considered view of the guardian – a view which I share. However, he submits, and as he says without complacency, that after eleven days of evidence the decision for the court is now more straightforward than it might have appeared at the outset. Whilst the oral evidence has served to enhance the merits of the Kenyan option, it has also, he submits, served to diminish the merits of the Mr Y / Ms Z option.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with Mr Stonor. A painstaking process, spread over many days, has indeed done much to make clear what was previously unclear. In the outcome, with considerable sadness in my heart but, I have to say, without any real hesitation at the end of the day, I have come to the clear conclusions:</p>

There is nothing I have seen or heard to suggest that (with the exceptions to which I must refer in due course) they exploited those whom they were professing to assist and there is evidence from them, which I am inclined to accept, that they were held in high regard by their clients and, for their part, felt a sense of continuing obligation to them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In June 2005, on one of his many visits to Kenya, Mr Y visited an orphanage, the H Children’s Home (HCH), run by a woman called MZ. I am quite satisfied that this visit was wholly innocent. X was one of the children he met. The account he was given was that she had been abandoned by her mother at or shortly after her birth on or about 29 December 2004 and brought by the Kenyan police to HCH to be looked after as an abandoned child on 6 January 2005. He decided to sponsor her, and started making monthly payments of £50. I am quite satisfied that there was nothing sinister in this – it was an altruistic and humanitarian response to an aspect of life in Kenya which he had not previously come across and which, it is clear, affected him deeply. Subsequently he and Ms Z also sponsored two other, older, girls at HCH, Wa and J.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the summer and autumn of 2005 Mr Y and Ms Z’s position gradually changed from one of concern at X’s plight, to a perception that she needed, for her own health, safety and happiness, to be ‘rescued’, as they saw it, from HCH, to a decision to adopt her and bring her to this country. On their own account they were discussing the possibility of adoption in August and September 2005 and we know (see below) that they contacted the local authority seeking information about adoption on 26 September 2005.</p>

MZ gave them a letter dated December 2005 “To whom it may concern” stating on behalf of the board of HCH that that they had “released” X, referred to in the letter as Emily Wairimu, to Mr Y and Ms Z “for Adoption trial period while in Kenya.” </p>

I say this for two reasons. The first is that, although they did not name him, they told the local authority on 15 February 2006 that they had had advice from a Kenyan lawyer (see below). The other is that, contrary to their denials until the document was produced at a very late stage during the hearing, an e-mail from Mr Mb to Mr Y on 28 February 2006 (see below) shows that Mr Y had already been in contact with him.</p>

The email which Mr R sent later the same morning to Mrs KL, the manager of the local authority’s permanence team, says “He will be writing in requesting a home study re: the adoption of a child from Kenya. I mentioned costs and he quoted £5000.” Mr Y was unable to give me any explanation as to what the £5000 related to.

This produced a letter from Mrs KL dated 18 January 2006 asking them to give some indication of the reasons and circumstances which had led them to consider adoption. Their reply, signed by both of them, is dated 30 January 2006. On 15 February 2006 they were visited at their home by Mrs F, a family placement worker. Though there has been controversy as to what exactly they were told by Mrs F, it is clear from her contemporaneous manuscript note of the meeting that the topic of private fostering was mentioned. Her note also records “have legal rights to adopt” and “Kenya – solicitor advised that could foster”. Having heard Mrs F I am quite satisfied that those two entries in her note accurately summarise information she was given on that occasion by Mr Y and Ms Z. Her evidence was clear and compelling and I have no hesitation in accepting it.</p>

Those documents (exhibited to Ms Z’s witness statement of 16 August 2007) included the Home Office Leaflet, <span style="font-style:italic">Inter-Country Adoption and the Immigration Rules</span>, which it can be seen from the print-out was downloaded on 17 February 2006, and the Department of Health’s publication, <span style="font-style:italic">Private Fostering – a cause for concern</span>.

It continues: “Failure to comply with the conditions may be punishable by up to 12 months imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine upon conviction.” Paragraph 4 states that the 2003 Regulations aim to deter people from bringing children into the United Kingdom for the purpose of adoption unless they have first been assessed and approved and have the necessary certificate from the Secretary of State.

Under the heading ‘What are the rules governing private fostering’ it spells out that amongst the things that the private foster carer “must” do is to “advise their local council of their intention to foster a child at least 6 weeks in advance or, where an emergency placement is made, within 48 hours of the child’s arrival.” Under the heading ‘What should professionals do?’ it spells out that professionals in the health field who know that a child is being privately fostered but think that the local council is unaware are encouraged to notify the local social services department.</p>

The first quoted guidance from BAAF (the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering) “strongly” advising that you “do not attempt to identify a child until you have been approved as prospective adopters by the authorities here.” The article went on to refer to the need to apply to the relevant British Embassy for permanent admission “before the child arrives in Britain.” The article concluded with the comment that “there are grey areas in the law that can allow parents who have not followed the correct procedures to keep the adopted child” and quoted Felicity Collier, the chief executive of BAAF, as saying that children brought in illegally after private adoptions should be denied entry “but they are usually let through.” The other article quoted a BAAF report as saying that the “overwhelming majority” of local authorities do not give “any priority” to privately fostered children and that the majority of private fostering arrangements were never notified to the authorities as they should be.</p>

(His advice was that there was no such provision and that under Kenyan law it was “mandatory” for the intending adopters to stay with the child for a minimum of three months before adoption proceedings could commence.)

There is nothing either in Mrs F’s contemporaneous manuscript notes or in the worked-up typed version she subsequently prepared (nor for that matter in some notes which Ms Z made during or in the immediate aftermath of the meeting) to suggest that their discussion with her had touched on the topic – indeed, why should it, because so far as English law is concerned the point is relevant for the purposes of immigration law rather than adoption law? The obvious explanation (and he was unable to come up with any other), is that the idea had come to Mr Y as a result of his study of the material which Ms Z had downloaded only a few days earlier. As we have seen, paragraph 25 of the Home Office Leaflet, <span style="font-style:italic">Inter-Country Adoption and the Immigration Rules</span> addresses the point. And if this is the true explanation, as I find it to be, then it demonstrates what one might in any event have thought was obvious, that, contrary to their continued denials, Mr Y at least had read this material with some care and attention. And if that is so, can it seriously be suggested that in relation to something as fundamental to both of them as the adoption of a little girl who, I have no doubt, they already very much saw as being “their” child, Mr Y did not share with Ms Z the fruits of his study of this material, even assuming, which I decline to do, that Ms Z had not herself read it with care and attention.  </p>

At the same time, the newspaper articles suggested that this was a ‘grey area’ where the authorities tended not to get involved or, if involved, tended not to resort to drastic steps. Thus there arose in their minds the idea that there was a ‘loophole’ they could exploit – not, I emphasise, an idea planted in their minds by either Mrs F or Mr E but rather an idea in which they may have been encouraged by the newspaper articles they had downloaded. </p>

And it is inconceivable that Ms Z did not know at least the gist of Mr Mb’s advice. The idea that one half of a couple living together as husband and wife would meet with a lawyer and discuss the possibility and legalities of adoption in a foreign country without speaking to the other half is little short of absurd. As Mr Y himself accepted, when I put it to him, there was no rational reason for him to withhold from Ms Z the fact that he was talking to Mr Mb about Kenyan adoption. And he later agreed, in answer to questions from Miss Hudson, that he and Ms Z had indeed discussed the idea of an interim adoption order, albeit he still maintained she had not seen the e-mail from Mr Mb. Conceivably she did not, but that is very far from saying that she did not know what was going on, and as to the substance of it she was, in my judgment, all too aware.</p>

Two of these documents were letters addressed to MZ by Mr Y (and presumably intended to be used by her in support of the visa application). Both are dated 10 March 2006 and refer to MZ travelling to the United Kingdom to visit sponsors. These letters are in slightly different form, though both contemplate a “visit” by X, who in one of the letters is referred to as “your daughter”, and both refer to Mr Y as being willing to pay the cost of <span style="font-style:italic">return</span> flights. (I assume that there were two versions so that MZ could actually make use of whichever seemed better to serve their purpose when the time came to submit the application.) No doubt in order to add verisimilitude to this deception it was also said (for example by a business acquaintance of Mr Y, Mr MS, in a letter to the High Commission dated 18 April 2006, as also in one of the letters from Mr Y dated 10 March 2006) that X would be accompanied on her visit to this country by the other girls Mr Y and Ms Z were sponsoring – Wa and J.</p>

X was not coming to this country to “visit” her “sponsor” before returning to Kenya; she was – as Ms Z well knew – being brought to this country permanently to be adopted in due course by her and Mr Y, MZ acting as the courier for that purpose.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there is Mr Y’s assertion that he saw nothing unusual about the birth certificate naming MZ and her husband as X’s parents. I find this impossible to believe.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there are the unusual circumstances in which, on Mr Y’s own account, he actually arranged the Kenyan passport. He enlisted the assistance of Mr MS’s lawyer, Mr K, and describes how Mr K telephoned from his office to a Mr N who came around to Mr K’s office within some 5-10 minutes and was introduced to Mr Y as a passport office official. Mr Y handed him the (false) birth certificate and a photograph and the passport arrived within four days. Mr Y claims that he did not suspect anything improper when Mr N, purportedly a passport office official, came round to Mr K’s offices within 5-10 minutes of a telephone call, in order to meet the request for a passport. Again I find Mr Y’s professed lack of surprise quite unbelievable. Mr Y can have had no reason to think that an honest official would act in this way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, there is Mr Y’s professed inability to understand why the High Commission should have refused MZ a visa. That Mr Y should have maintained this stance given his knowledge that MZ was in fact not X’s mother – in other words his knowledge that the reason given by the High Commission was, as it happened, ‘spot on’ – throws an interesting light on his attitude both to the truth and to acceptable standards of private and public probity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two aspects of this part of the story bear emphasis. First, on Mr Y’s own account, his chosen intermediary on this occasion, Mr FL, agreed without demur, and indeed seemingly without even asking any questions, to obtain the false birth certificate and false passport, both of which he was seemingly able to do without any difficulty. It is revealing that Mr Y seems to have known the very man who was both willing and able to obtain false documents for him. Secondly, it is not clear what pressure or inducements were brought to bear on Mr O and his wife. Mr Y asserts that they willingly agreed to help him out of gratitude for what he had done for them in previously enabling Mr O to come to work in this country. Mr Y’s account was hardly compelling and his explanation is so thin as to be incredible. I suspect, though I emphasise I cannot find as a fact, that darker influences were at play when Mr O and his wife were induced to cooperate. </p>

Again, such explanations as she gave were utterly uncompelling. She either did look at these documents – which she cannot admit because it would destroy her assertion that she did not discover what had happened until January 2007 – or she did not, either because she knew what they showed, having been told by Mr Y, or because she knew very well that, whatever they would have told her, it was not the truth or something she would want to know (This was only one of a number of occasions whilst I was listening to their evidence when one could feel the shade of Admiral Nelson hovering over the court.)</p>

This is simply incredible. Quite apart from the fact that X was a black African, and therefore obviously not Ms Z’s biological daughter, it simply does not accord with experience that no-one should have asked Ms Z in a friendly and welcoming way about her newly arrived child. That is not how small communities with mothers and children operate. Whatever the truth of all this, it casts yet further doubt on yet another aspect of Ms Z’s evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The truth about all this is obvious. Not merely was Mr Y, as he admits, fully aware of the illegality, so too was Ms Z. For why else should she have acted throughout from July 2006 until May 2007 as she did? Her assertion that she discovered the illegality only in January 2007 is simply incredible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Y says that he acted – or rather, failed to act – as he did because he was trapped in consequence of what he had done. That, I have no doubt, was true. But the same in truth, despite their protestations to the contrary, goes also, in my judgment, for Ms Z. From the moment when X arrived in this country, Ms Z was trapped, in just the same way and for precisely the same reason as Mr Y: she knew, as he did, that X’s removal from Kenya had involved deceit and deception of both the Kenyan and the United Kingdom authorities, just as she knew, as he did, that X’s unannounced presence in this country involved breach of English adoption law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact the matter goes somewhat further than that. One of the purposes of X’s concealment by Mr Y and Ms Z after she arrived in this country was to buy time to strengthen the attachment between them and X and in the hope that they would get 12 months “under their belt” before the authorities became involved, so lessening the risk that she would then be taken away from them. Mr Y actually admitted to a social worker, Mr M (see below), that the intention of ensuring that X remained in their care once in this country was to attempt to achieve a fait accompli of attachment between X and themselves. During all this time they must have known that there was a serious risk that X might at any time be removed, whether by the immigration authorities, the local authority or the courts, inevitably in circumstances of emotional disruption. As Mr Gray says, this all amounted to a manipulation of X’s attachment emotions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to be precise as to what, in this context, I mean by illegality. It is clear that X’s removal from Kenya and introduction into this country involved breaches both of Kenyan law – Kenyan adoption law and Kenyan criminal law (the obtaining of false documents) – and of English law – English immigration law and English adoption law. It is also clear, in my judgment, and I so find, that both Mr Y and Ms Z were aware – knew – that the scheme which they jointly planned and implemented involved (i) the obtaining by deception of false Kenyan documents, (ii) the introduction of X into this country by deception of the United Kingdom immigration authorities and (iii) breaches of English adoption law (at least insofar as they knowingly omitted to notify the local authority of X’s presence, either before or after her arrival in this country, and deliberately decided to side-step the necessary process of assessment). </p>

I have my suspicions. After all, it is clear that they obtained at least some advice on this topic from Mr Mb, and it might be thought unlikely that he would not have told them enough for them to appreciate that what they were doing was contrary to Kenyan adoption law. But, not least because of their continuing coyness – in plain words, their continuing refusal to give a frank account of their dealings with Mr Mb – I am unable to find as a fact that they were aware that what they were doing involved breaches of Kenyan adoption law.</p>

There is, in my judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>evidence whatsoever to implicate Mr Y (or for that matter Ms Z) in any illegal or otherwise prohibited payment in relation to X. (I accept Mr Y’s case that he rejected immediately the extortionate – possibly blackmailing – demand by Mr N in August 2006 for payment of 100,000 Kenyan Shillings.) It has never been suggested, nor was it put in cross-examination to them, that the £50 paid monthly for X, nor indeed the sums paid for the other two children, Wa and J, were anything other than as they were represented to be, namely bona fide sponsorship.</p>

Ultimately, he says, it is Mr Y and Ms Z. I can only agree.</p>

A strategy meeting was held on 22 May 2007. On the afternoon of 23 May 2007 social workers and police officers visited Mr Y and Ms Z’s house, the police removing X in pursuance of their powers under section 46 of the Children Act 1989. She was placed in foster care with a local authority foster carer where she has remained ever since. Mr Y and Ms Z have throughout had regular and extensive contact with X.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, at a slightly earlier stage, it had been contemplated that X might be returned to Mr Y and Ms Z in the interim. Only after a meeting of its team on 11 September 2007 did the local authority decide that it would be premature to do so pending the response from Mrs Magana. There was, I emphasise, nothing at all improper or inappropriate about the way in which the team considered its position at that meeting, just as there was nothing disingenuous about the stance being taken by the local authority at the hearing on 5 October 2007 (when all parties were anticipating an interim return to Mr Y and Ms Z once Mrs Magana’s replies had been received). Indeed, the stance of the guardian at that stage was that it was premature to return X to Mr Y and Ms Z pending, inter alia, a reply from Mrs Magana.</p>

The information supplied by Mrs Magana signalled significant doubts about the account thus far given by Mr Y and Ms Z and, at the same time, a likely desire on the part of the GRK to seek X’s return to Kenya. She said “it is evident that the child removal from Kenya was totally illegal and irregular” and pointed out that under Kenyan law a child “cannot be adopted by a foreign couple not married to each other, nor by a single foreign person.” She opined that returning X at this juncture to Mr Y and Ms Z would be “ill advised.”</p>

So, as they correctly submit, a decision to return X to Kenya can be reached only on the basis that it is in her best interests to do so, not because the welfare principle has been superseded by some other consideration – it has not.

There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future. Our own society is a multi-cultural one. But looking at it from the child’s point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the differing cultures within his own family.”</p>

But, they submit, if after an intellectually rigorous evaluation of the welfare considerations the court should conclude that placement far from the country of birth, the country of origin and her cultural and familial ties (if ever they might be established) is, in terms of her welfare, the optimum outcome for X, the court should not shy from such a placement.</p>

He submits (and this is something I will have to return to below) that X’s case is different in a much more fundamental way: in each of the three cases he has taken me to, the welfare considerations pointed towards the child remaining with its carers; here in contrast, he submits, X’s welfare points towards her return to Kenya. That said he emphasises that the local authority’s support for the GRK is not based upon a view that policy trumps welfare; whilst policy, he says, is clearly important, the local authority’s support for the GRK is founded upon its view that this is what X’s welfare requires. That, of course, is at the end of the day the fundamental question with which I have to grapple.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, as they rightly emphasise, it is obviously necessary to have a factual basis for any order which is to be made. The burden of proof lies throughout on the local authority and the GRK. The standard of proof is the balance of  probabilities, though as explained by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the well-known passage in his speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H and Others (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</span> [1996] 1 FLR 80, the more serious the allegation the more cogent must be the evidence required to establish its truth. On this approach, they submit, allegations of such deceit of immigration procedures and deliberate steps to defeat systems which are in place for the protection of children are of a type which require strong and cogent evidence to establish on a balance of probability. They refer in this context to <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Minor); Re K (Minors) (Child Abuse: Evidence)</span> [1989] 2 FLR 313. I agree; this is the approach which I have adopted. Moreover, they submit, when the court has to attempt to evaluate the chances of an event occurring,  such as the chances that one or other of the parents may face extradition proceedings, that the proceedings in turn may prove to be successful and that, ultimately, after a trial in Kenya there may be a deprivation of liberty, the court must proceed on the basis of proper evidence, rejecting speculation, persuasion and mere bold assertion unless and to the extent that it is based upon facts which are established to the requisite  standard of proof. Again, I agree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, they accept, of course, that all evidence which is relevant to the issue before the court will be admissible, subject to considerations of the weight to be attached and any exclusionary rules. As this is an investigation concerning the welfare of a child the rule against hearsay does not apply to exclude evidence. Accordingly, written statements by witnesses, whether prepared for the instant proceedings or for the police, or prepared in a foreign  jurisdiction, are all admissible as a class, whether or not the maker of the statement attended before the court to present oral  evidence and be subject to cross-examination. Obviously, however, as they point out, less weight may be given in the absence of such an ability to test the evidence. Equally the court will consider whether, in making such a statement for which it has not been possible to challenge the maker in court, such as the statement by MZ, the maker had any purpose of her own to serve at the time she made the statement.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that a party or a witness has been shown to have lied, or lied repeatedly and consistently, in the same way as a witness or a party may be shown to have previous convictions or cautions or allegations of offences of dishonesty, cannot by itself, as they correctly say, prove that the account provided as to the role of that person in the possible unfolding of the events must be rejected. There are many reasons which may explain why a party has chosen to lie, either in court or out of court, to professionals or to others. The age of the person, the abilities of the person, the timing of the lie, the significance subjectively and objectively applied to the prevailing circumstances at the time of the lie, together with the possible advantage to that party, are all matters which may have to be considered. However, admitted or proven lies may well, unless otherwise satisfactorily explained in their true context, when the total picture is considered, be used to establish that the account provided by that party in the court proceedings may not be safely relied upon as to establish the truth: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lucas (Ruth)</span> [1981] QB 720 and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Middleton</span> [2000] TLR 293 as applied by Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v K, D and L</span> [2005] EWHC 144 (Fam).

That must be right. To repeat, and I emphasise the point, from beginning to end X’s welfare – now and throughout her life – has to be and has been my paramount concern. </p>

Her police statement makes no mention of this. It did her no credit when she continued to insist that her police statement was not misleading either in its wording or in its spirit.

They failed to do so. As Mr Stonor says, their accounts in these statements were selectively vague and, I am bound to agree, self-serving. In fact, as Mr Gray points out, the picture is even worse, for in his first statement Mr Y said “I have been upfront and honest with all the authorities since X was removed” and in his second statement, following my direction that he file a further statement to fill in the gaps, he said “I have tried to be as frank as honest as possible in this statement”. That was simply untrue. And in their oral evidence, as Mr Stonor points out, neither of them seemed particularly concerned that, in many significant respects, their oral evidence was at odds with their written statements.</p>

Moreover, he remained adamant that Ms Z was not aware of any illegality until the removal of X to foster care in May 2007, which plainly contradicted Ms Z’s evidence. That said, when recalled to the witness box on 2 May 2008, Mr Y was able to appreciate that “it must look absolutely atrocious” and to say that he could understand why the court should not return X to his care given his evidence (and, when prompted, his conduct).</p>

Without any apparent warning – everyone who was there will vividly remember the surprise we all felt – she gave evidence in chief which was substantially different from the evidence which she had previously given in her written statements, admitting for the first time that she had been aware of the illegality since January 2007. Mr Gray, who records the GRK’s belief that Ms Z was in fact fully aware of all the plans and their unlawfulness from the start, characterises this new evidence as a poor attempt to lend credibility to her other evidence by purporting to give new information at this stage.</p>

Yet neither Mr Y nor Ms Z was able (or if able willing) to give a coherent account as to the reasons for the death threat, the reasons for the installation of the alarms, or indeed the reasons for their removal. Mr Stonor asks rhetorically, Why lie about this? Do they have something to hide? Is there a link between that and the reason why they did not pursue adoption in Kenya? I simply do not know. The only finding I can safely make is that the account they have given is neither full nor frank, that there is more – I suspect much more – to this than they have been willing to divulge, and that there is more they could have told us if they had wanted to. What that is, and why they have not been willing to tell us, I do not know, and in my judgment it would be dangerous to speculate.</p>

Even at the very end, there was a continuing and worrying lack of frankness and indeed lack of truthfulness on the part of both Mr Y and Ms Z. There were too many evasions, prevarications and, in too many instances, straightforward lies. And this, to make clear, is a factor that in my judgment extends far beyond the purely forensic in its implications. Lying, <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, I entirely accept does not disqualify a potential adoptive parent.

Mr Stonor submits, and I am driven to agree, that there was no letter or, if there ever was, that Ms Z knew it had not been posted. As he points out, Mr Y and Ms Z gave differing accounts: she said that she had left it out in the kitchen unsealed for Mr Y to read and sign; he said that it had been left on his desk in a sealed envelope. Her explanation that it was a handwritten letter written during the day in X’s presence simply lacked credibility (not least because we know that the couple’s practice was to type important letters); I suspect that the explanation was provided simply to meet in anticipation the obvious difficulty of a request to download a copy from their computer. And given the importance of the letter and the fact that they seem to have had no difficulty in producing copies of other significant documents, Ms Z’s failure to produce a photocopy of the letter is, as Mr Stonor submits, telling.</p>

As to this group of arguments I would only add that, however plausible it may be as an answer to the charge that they were knowingly breaking Kenyan adoption law (as to which I remain sceptical and suspicious), it hardly begins to address the other aspects of the alleged illegality.</p>

He elaborates by suggesting that the initial plan was considered by both parents to be legal, save that they were prepared to mislead the authorities in relation to the visa application. The fact that Ms Z, as originally planned, was to accompany X and MZ is, he says, indicative of their appreciation of the lack of risk involved. So far as concerns the second plan, he suggests that, given his willingness to lie on oath to protect Ms Z, it is therefore credible that Mr Y would similarly have attempted to insulate her not only from his actions but also from any knowledge of them and asserts that there is no evidence, directly or by any admission, to establish that Ms Z knew either the details or even the general effect of the plan. </p>

A careful analysis of the evidence provided by Mr Hussein serves only to indicate, they say, that his department, Children Services, has submitted its final submission, that the Criminal Investigation Department has submitted its final submission and that the matter has been handed to Interpol. But to date, they say, there has been little further information shared with the court and it would be wrong for me to speculate in this regard. Moreover, as they observe, documents filed by the GRK have repeatedly given wholly unrealistic time-scales promising, for example, the identification and location of the birth family, but with little progress made thereafter. Accepting that the GRK is acting in good faith, there must still, they submit, be residual doubts as to the prospects of successfully gathering sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against either Mr Y or Ms Z. And all this, they say, is subject to disclosure which may already have occurred and disclosure which may subsequently be ordered, specifically of the evidence given by the parents and of this judgment.</p>

On the evidence, they say, the prospects of such extradition should be treated as unquantifiable and should not be used to the detriment of Mr Y and Ms Z’s claim to parent X. If quantifiable at all, they submit that although one cannot exclude the possibility of them being extradited it is unlikely. And they deprecate any attempt by Mr Gray to draw an analogy with the so-called ‘Miracle Baby’ case (see <span style="font-style:italic">Haringey London Borough Council v C, E and another intervening </span>[2004] EWHC 2580 (Fam), [2005] 2 FLR 47, and <span style="font-style:italic">Haringey London Borough Council v C, E and another intervening </span>[2006] EWHC 1620 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 1035) and the extradition of the Kenyan Pastor, for all such applications for extradition are, they say, case-sensitive.</p>

As Mr Stonor says, the prospects for X would be bleak: the delight of a return to Mr Y and Ms Z’s care, only to be followed by a further separation from them which would be far more difficult to manage than the current separation. It could last for several years; there would be no direct contact between X and Mr Y and Ms Z; and as X grows older she would become far more questioning about the separation and in need of an explanation. And in this connection Mr Stonor is rightly sceptical of Mrs Appleby and Dr Oboho’s seeming willingness to rely upon grandparents to ‘step in’ (though commenting, in fairness to Mrs Appleby, that she had had only a limited opportunity to consider this aspect). As he points out, the guardian was far more circumspect in her final report and then, in her oral evidence, expressed grave doubts as to how realistic it would be to expect the grandparents to shield X in the event of Mr Y and Ms Z’s extradition.

Whilst it would be possible for members of the extended family to take her to Kenya, Mr Gray suggests that for such a momentous occasion as a journey to visit her home country, with all the complicated issues that might involve for X, it would be far from ideal for X to know that her parents are not welcome and at risk of arrest in that country, and that they cannot travel with her to assist her in coming to terms with so much of her background. Mr Stonor makes the same point. Mr Y and Ms Z’s inability to visit Kenya would of itself, he says, be an important factor given X’s need to know and appreciate her cultural heritage. The optimum means for that need to be met would, he says, be for X to be able to visit Kenya with her carers, and that indeed is what had been envisaged by Mr Y and Ms Z, as their discussions with Mrs Appleby show. But that cannot now happen. DVDs, photos and even visits with grandparents would, as Mr Stonor rightly says, be a poor substitute.</p>

It was apparent to the guardian, just as it became very apparent to me as they were all giving their oral evidence, that Mr M took a different approach to his co-worker, Mrs S, and their team manager, Mrs T. But as the guardian rightly says, the fact of division within a social work team is not necessarily unusual and need not be a negative feature in a case – indeed it can, as she says, provide a constructive arena in which the social work decisions are carefully and thoroughly considered.  </p>

And she suggests, and I can only agree, that their stance appears to have had an effect upon the planning for X: the intervention of the GRK provided the opportunity for the local authority to support a plan for X to return to her home country, unqualified support being given to this plan at an early stage and without the vital information required to assess either the appropriateness of the plan or the consequential impact on X of the proposed return to Kenya.  </p>

Her explanations, that she had been on holiday (when it transpired that she had been away for one week, whereas the care plan had been available for over two months) and that she thought that the others in the social work team had read the care plan (although she did not determine whether they had in fact done so), could not, as Miss Hudson rightly says, explain her failure. And as Miss Hudson points out, Mrs S’s evidence was all the more significant as it appears that, of the two social workers co-working the case (the other, of course, being Mr M), she had primary responsibility as the case manager and was the main author of the local authority’s care plans. It is also, I have to say, surprising and disconcerting that her omission was not detected by Mrs T as the team manager, not least in circumstances in which, it was said, there was regular supervision as well as detailed discussion about the case and the local authority’s recommendation.  </p>

There is, as he correctly says, and as I would wish to emphasise, nothing improper in any of that. Indeed, it would be surprising if, in a case such as this, there were not differences of opinion along the way. On the contrary, it is very much to the credit of all concerned that there <span style="font-style:italic">were </span>these differences of opinion and that, over time, opinions were modified. Too often local authorities are criticised, sometimes with justification, for an unbending determination to stick to the original thinking and plan. And on occasions social workers too readily cleave to the ‘party line’ even though it may differ, to a greater or lesser extent, from their own professional appraisal. Here, all concerned were doing their best, in a very difficult case, to exercise their personal professional responsibilities and to come to considered professional judgements as to what was best for X. The fact that those professional judgements differed, and that individuals may have wavered in their judgements over time, is cause for approbation not cause for concern. </p>

In some ways his approach was untypical, perhaps in some respects almost quirky, but I found it all the more impressive and useful for that. In many ways, if one has to compare him with his colleagues, it was Mr M rather than the others who early on saw, and thereafter did the most to grapple with, what he, most of all, understood were the very real and taxing difficulties of a very complex case.</p>

Without in any way questioning his expertise, it was apparent that his experience in children’s cases is limited. In some key respects his evidence (both written and oral) lacked depth and balance. There was little sense that Dr Oboho appreciated the complexities involved in this very difficult case; indeed, for him it was a simple case. And there was scant consideration in any depth of the potential benefits for X of a return to Kenya. Moreover, I have also to say that a number of the views and opinions espoused by Dr Oboho struck me as concerning: for example, that children are highly likely to be damaged if their parents work full-time (in oral evidence, Dr Oboho confirmed that he held this view in relation to children generally not just in relation to adopted children); that it is highly likely that X’s birth mother would take some form of revenge on her; that parenting capacity has nothing to do with whether Mr Y and Ms Z lied about how they brought X in to this country; that the means of X’s removal from Kenya are not relevant to welfare (as Mr Gray pointed out, Dr Oboho expressed the view that the background to the case was not part of his remit, and that it was not relevant to the capacity of Mr Y and Ms Z to parent X); that X will be grateful to Mr Y and Ms Z for bringing her to this country illegally, more so if they are imprisoned; and that extradition is not a concern because it will not happen. It should also be noted that Dr Oboho undertook an assimilation scale test, and concluded that “they do not have a tendency to lie” – an evaluation which their subsequent evidence showed to be sadly adrift from the reality.</p>

His conclusions about the significant and potentially damaging effect this could have upon X reflected the risks she had identified. But the extent to which his report and conclusions are relied upon by the guardian is, however, tempered by her evidence that she could not agree with some aspects of Dr Oboho’s report and evidence. His evidence therefore forms part of the full picture which she has considered, but her conclusions, as she makes clear, have never rested upon his assessment.</p>

The guardian considers this to be important evidence of the strength of the attachments between X and Mr Y and Ms Z, and it is, she makes clear, evidence to which she has given considerable weight throughout the proceedings when considering how X’s welfare needs are best met. This continues to be the case.   </p>

All three of these witnesses, as we have seen, had a significant impact upon the guardian’s change of stance during the course of the hearing; indeed they form a vital element in her reasoning. In her own evidence, Mrs Appleby said the issue of the extent to which a failure of Mr Y and Ms Z to be full and frank either now or in the past was “a difficult question”. She accepted that it would say something of how they function, and that it would make them more flawed as individuals, but she was “not convinced that it would impact significantly upon their parenting”. She concluded, “weighing up, the positives are still greater than the negatives”, further indicating, in response to questions from me, that, although she declined to condone the behaviour of Mr Y and Ms Z, she comforted herself that no harm had been done to X, the potential harm having been caused by “the system”. Whether she would have expressed the same views if, like the guardian, she had had the benefit of sitting throughout the entire hearing is obviously a matter of speculation. But I cannot help thinking that it might, as in the case of the guardian, have had at least some impact on her thinking and led her to more pessimistic conclusions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Very little was said on this topic during the hearing. Tacitly at least Mr Y and Ms Z accept that threshold is established under section 38(2) – after all they have never sought to challenge the successive interim care orders that have been made from time to time since the original order was made on 24 May 2007. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am quite satisfied that the requirements of section 38(2) are met; indeed if the need arose – in the event it does not (see below) – I would be quite satisfied that the more stringent requirements of section 31(2) are also met. The plain fact is that, whatever actual harm she may or may not have suffered, X was plainly exposed to real risk of significant harm at the time the proceedings were commenced, and that suffices to meet the requirements of section 31(2). Further elaboration is not required. The facts as I have set them out speak for themselves. It has not been suggested that I lack the power to make a care order if satisfied that that is what is in X’s best interests. In other words, ‘threshold’ has not been put in issue. Indeed, as we have already seen, the risk of harm has in effect been admitted, albeit in a different context and for a different purpose: see Mr Spain’s submissions as referred to in paragraph [154] above.</p>

As was emphasised by most of the professionals involved, its management will be of crucial importance. As Mr Stonor observes, careful and sensitive attention needs to be given to: what X is told at various stages and by whom; the involvement of Mr Y and Ms Z in this process; and the introduction of X to the Kenyan social worker, Catherine Maina (see below), and then to her proposed carers.</p>

Their insight into the needs of a young child is therefore questionable. And, as Mr Stonor points out, on his own account it had not occurred to Mr Y that X might grow to resent him and Ms Z for the way in which she was taken from Kenya and brought to this country and the fact that she would be unable to visit Kenya with her carers. He observes that when Ms Z came to give her evidence she clearly knew what was coming, saying that these matters had indeed occurred to her. But when pressed (by me) as to how she proposed to address these matters, Ms Z resorted once more to rather simplistic reference to the DVDs, photos and so on which they used to tell X about Kenya. As was pointed out to her, those materials may be relevant to meeting X’s cultural needs, but have nothing to do with the question of resentment. Sadly, says Mr Stonor, and I can only agree, this was all lost on Ms Z. The reality, unhappily, is that neither Mr Y nor Ms Z seemed able to understand, let alone engage with, the issue of X’s possible resentment.</p>

He identifies a number of specific reasons why in X’s case this may be especially important in the longer term: (a) X’s future identity in her more mature childhood – Dr Oboho indicated that X may better understand the concept of identity when she is aged eight or nine; and (b) in respect of X’s adulthood, particularly having regard to the matters referred to in the 2002 Act.</p>

His thoughtful, nuanced, reflective and child-centred evidence similarly testified to both his understanding of the issues in this very difficult case and to the welcome openness of mind and flexibility of thinking he was so very willing to bring to bear. Obviously I was not privy to what were plainly the very fruitful discussions he had out of court with both the local authority and the guardian, but I am not at all surprised to hear how positively they reacted to their discussions with him. It accorded entirely with the impression I had gained seeing him in court and hearing him give evidence.</p>

The commitment it has demonstrated to one of its children is, if I may be allowed to say so, very impressive. It contrasts very favourably indeed with the lack of interest which in too many such cases is exhibited by foreign states which find themselves in similar circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss McKenzie and Mr Spain rightly say that there  can  be  no  issue  with the  quality  of  the  day-to-day  care afforded  to  X  by  Mr Y and Ms  Z. For a child without any familial ties to be ‘rescued’ from the  institutional  environment of a children’s  home, brought to England and to thrive in the manner in which she clearly has thrived, is, as they rightly say, a testament to the care given to her by these first-time parents. As they rightly stress, all this was universally borne out in the core assessment and oral evidence of Mr M and the assessment by Mrs Appleby as well as by the investigations of the guardian. They submit that the stability, security, protection and emotional warmth required by a child being removed from her life in Kenya to a wholly different life in Northumberland was unreservedly forthcoming. It is, they say, all the more remarkable that it was provided by parents under considerable emotional stress and in circumstances, admittedly of their own making, in which they found themselves without recourse to professional help, support or guidance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">They challenge the proposition that Mr Y and Ms Z failed properly to prioritise X’s interests and that they lack insight into X’s emotional needs – something, they say, which was not identified by either Mr M or Mrs Appleby –, pointing, for example, as explanation for X’s multiple carers between January and July 2006, to what they saw as the need to avoid the greater evil of her continuing in institutional care with consequent risk to her health. And in that connection they make the important point that there is nothing to show that X has in fact suffered any emotional (or, indeed, any other kind of) harm as a result of her experiences – witness, they say, the excellence of her attachment and her current emotional stability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">They submit that selflessly, when many other parents might have clung to her with the idea that it might make it difficult for her to settle, so as to expedite a placement by return to them, the evidence supports the contention that Mr Y and Ms Z gave her ‘permission’ to live with the foster carer, thus avoiding unnecessary distress for her. As they submit, when it is asserted that Mr Y and Ms Z have acted selfishly, that they have failed to act in a child-centric manner, that they have prioritised their own needs over those of X, it is only fair to place their care of her in this regard in the balance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, as they rightly stress, such was the quality of the care that, notwithstanding the effluxion of time during which she has remained in the care of the foster carer, X’s primary attachment remains with Mr Y and Ms Z. However, they submit, and this is an important point, it would be overly-simplistic, and contrary to the expert opinion of Dr Oboho and the assessment of Mrs Appleby, merely to transpose this ability to move without apparent harm in a domestic setting and to employ this as a predictive tool for the success of a move for X back to Kenya in line with the GRK’s revised care plan – a process which, as they rightly emphasise, is self-evidently not reversible. The factual situation envisaged in the care plan is, they say, readily and obviously distinguishable from the change she has experienced in Northumberland in moving from her ‘parents’ to the foster carer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There have undoubtedly, say Miss McKenzie and Mr Spain, been times of great stress and great distress experienced by Mr Y and Ms Z. They are strangers to court procedures, to police interviews, to awaiting decisions by the Crown Prosecution Service. Throughout, reading as they have in the papers filed and listening to the evidence, particularly from Mr Hussein on behalf of the GRK, the threat of extradition proceedings cannot have failed to become a real matter to have to contemplate. But still, they submit, Mr Y and Ms Z have managed to insulate and protect X from such distress. (It was, as they tell me, only over the weekend of the recent Bank Holiday, with the reduction in the length of contact and a tightening of the strictures applied to contact by way of supervision at the behest of the local authority, that X has reacted.)</p>

This, they say, is contrary to the core assessment and the assessment of Mrs Appleby, which both emphasise as a positive their ability to work together. (I understand the point but in the light of my findings I do not, of course, accept the premise.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In conclusion, Miss McKenzie and Mr Spain submit that striking the balance is not a matter of merely weighing the future risk posed by Mr Y and Ms Z as against the uncertainties in the Kenyan plan. They submit that I should start with the question “Why should X be deprived of the care of these parents?” Only if the risks posed by them are proved to be unmanageable should X lose the prospect of being brought up in their care. And, they ask rhetorically, if the GRK had not intervened would the local authority be seriously challenging their ability to look after and care for X.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this connection Mr Spain says that the reservations expressed by Mr Y as to the ability in practice of Mr Hussein to deliver what is in X’s best interests are not unreasonable. As he points out, until the third day of the final hearing, the GRK, through the head of its Children Services, adhered to the policy that upon her return to Kenya there was an absolute requirement that X be returned to a children’s home for a significant period of time. This changed only when the guardian expressed severe misgivings. In light of this, he says, it could not be accepted that the planning for X had been specifically child-centric to X’s needs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In many such cases, as they point out, the relevant foreign country may have displayed no interest in the proceedings, whereas here the GRK has played an active role in the proceedings and has evinced an intention to pursue matters relating to the alleged dishonesty as to the manner of X’s removal from Kenya and arrival in this country. But that should not, of itself, they say, afford any more weight to submissions by the GRK, nor should it in any way detract from or lessen the intellectual rigour to be applied to the proposals and to the evidence submitted. I agree.</p>

The stress applied to each in the course of their evidence, say Miss McKenzie and Mr Spain, may not be a safe indication of their presentation in the more controlled environment of an assessment. They submit that before the undoubted and numerous positive attributes of each of them as described by Mr M and Mrs Appleby may safely be disregarded to X’s disadvantage, a full psychological assessment should be undertaken to attempt to determine whether the lying is endemic and whether, in turn, their ability to cope with stressful situations serves to compromise their ability to offer stable care for X. In this connection and, as they say, ever conscious of the necessity of avoiding delay, even more so in this case than many, they submit, nevertheless, that the GRK’s revised care plan provides a window of opportunity for such a psychological assessment and for a further consideration of Mr Y and Ms Z by Mrs Appleby.</p>

And she has throughout been willing to consider the illegality surrounding X’s entry to this country in a more open-minded light. Indeed, as she said in her oral evidence, in the balancing exercise of the welfare considerations she considered the separation of X from her ‘family’ in England to be of greater significance than the issue of the illegality itself.</p>

It provided her, she says, with a greater insight not only into the factual issues and disputes between the parties, but also – and for her most significantly – as to the welfare considerations for X. She considers that the evidence over the eleven days of hearing has left the court much better equipped to assess the competing claims and to provide for X’s long term welfare. That is certainly so, but it is clear that it equally left the guardian in a much better position to do so.</p>

The approach taken in cross-examination of Ms Z and Mr Y on her behalf reflected, she says, her increasing frustration at their apparent inability to tell the truth and to appreciate the significance of their actions and evidence for X.

The failure even to consider these risks at the time may, she suggests, reflect a lack of consideration for X’s safety and wellbeing or, worse, a determination to put their own desire to have her first. And their lack of appreciation of the risks she faces even now shows a continuing failure or inability to understand the import and potential consequences of what could have happened to her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the guardian there were important developments during the final hearing. She found the contribution of Mr Hussein, both in his evidence and in his detailed discussions with professionals out of court, valuable and reassuring. She was impressed by his commitment to formulate a plan for X which would address the acknowledged risks inherent in a return to Kenya, she found him to be very receptive to her own views and those of the local authority social workers as to X’s needs, and she was considerably reassured by the meeting she had with him and by the content of the revised Kenyan care plan. She also found it beneficial to meet Ms Maina. At the same time, Mr Hussein’s evidence also stressed the approach of the GRK in relation to criminal proceedings against Mr Y and Ms Z and the pursuit of extradition proceedings. This aspect of the case, and the potential for one or both of them to face extradition and criminal proceedings in Kenya, assumed a higher prominence for the guardian as a result.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The guardian is, she says, “entirely satisfied” that Mr Hussein is committed to doing all that can be done to meet X’s needs if she returns to Kenya. Nonetheless, as she points out, and as Mr Hussein himself said in evidence, there are many differences between Kenya and this country as well as the many similarities. And there remain many and important uncertainties in the planning for X in what would undoubtedly be a traumatic move for her. So the GRK’s willingness to work in conjunction with the English High Court and with those professionals involved with X to ameliorate the effects of a move, should it be ordered, is, in the guardian’s view, an important safeguard in seeking to ensure that X’s return to Kenya, if ordered, is undertaken in the most appropriate manner.</p>

The guardian stands by her analysis and recommendation at the time of filing her final report but invites me to conclude that the balancing of those considerations now leads to a different conclusion. Her oral evidence reflected the change in her view and was supportive of the plan for X’s return to Kenya. The change in her recommendation, based on the oral evidence and developments over the previous ten days, came as the result of her increased confidence in the plan put forward by the GRK in contrast with her decreased confidence in Mr Y and Ms Z.</p>

It seems that she is resilient, for she has coped with these changes remarkably well to date. The strong attachments she has with Mr Y and Ms Z (and their extended families) are good indicators of her ability to form new attachments. These positive features do not detract from the enormous changes X will experience if she returns to Kenya. It remains the guardian’s view that X will be adversely affected by the changes inherent in a return to Kenya <span style="font-style:italic">in the short term</span>; however she now considers that this plan best provides for X’s <span style="font-style:italic">long term</span> welfare. But, she emphasises, in the event that the plan for X’s return to Kenya is approved it is vital that the plan is managed with the greatest possible care to reduce the risk and extent of harm to her. It needs to be a flexible and responsive plan, which can be adapted to meet her needs as the plan is worked through, with input from those professionals who know her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Hudson submits that the <span style="font-style:italic">extent</span> of the findings of illegality is relevant in balancing the welfare considerations. If the findings are that Mr Y and/or Ms Z behaved in a way which goes beyond the admitted illegality, it reflects, she says, a continuing dishonesty in their evidence, despite the very clear encouragement from professionals (and indeed from the court) of the need for candour, with clear explanation of the reason why it may be significant in determining X’s future. This would be evidence of a failure to put X’s needs before their own. There would also be a consequent risk that circumstances might come about where X’s needs would once again not be given the precedence they require. Miss Hudson adds that this is so whether it is found that one or both of them has continued to lie about the circumstances and extent of the illegality given that they remain strongly united. (That said, Miss Hudson suggests that it is difficult to envisage findings which exonerate one (or both) of them in the light of the evidence as it developed during the course of the hearing.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as concerns the risk of extradition, Miss Hudson points out that although the prospect of criminal charges being brought by the GRK and extradition proceedings has been known to be a possibility since Mrs Magana’s contribution to the proceedings in October 2007, it has assumed a greater significance in the light of the evidence of the GRK, particularly Mr Hussein’s oral evidence, of the determination of GRK to press charges and the likelihood that extradition proceedings would then follow. This, she submits, must be a relevant factor when considering X’s welfare. The stress brought about by the continuing uncertainty (potentially over years) as to whether such charges and proceedings will be brought and, in the event that they are, until they are finally determined, will inevitably take its toll and is likely to have an effect upon Mr Y and Ms Z’s ability to parent.  Furthermore, it brings with it the prospect that one or both of them may be unavailable to care for her for what could be a lengthy period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All that said, as Miss Hudson acknowledges, the likelihood of extradition proceedings being pursued successfully remains unknown, as does the likely timescale, though she suggests that the timescale is likely to be years rather than anything less – so X’s awareness of the situation would then be greater by virtue of her age and understanding. In addition to the impact of the absence of one or both of her primary carers should extradition be successful, the guardian also raised the further issue of the potential effect upon X of knowing that extradition and possibly imprisonment came about because of the actions of her parents in relation to her. The guardian was concerned about the impact this could have upon X’s emotional wellbeing and, while not questioning the support of the extended family and their commitment to X, also referred in her evidence to the very difficult situation they would face if they were caring for X in circumstances in which she was the cause of the absence and possible imprisonment of a family member.</p>

But she submits that if X’s welfare otherwise dictated that she should continue to live in this country with Mr Y and Ms Z the potential for action by the Borders &amp; Immigration Authority with a view to X’s removal should not lead to a different conclusion regarding her placement, though it would require careful consideration of the appropriate legal framework within which she were placed in their care, given that anything short of an adoption order would leave her status vulnerable. In those circumstances, the court, she says, would need to consider the orders that would best achieve the placement, determined by her welfare needs rather than any attempt to subvert immigration procedures. (As she points out, X’s immigration status will also require consideration in the event of any fall-back plan of family finding in this jurisdiction should permanency not be appropriately achieved by the Kenyan authorities.)</p>

Importantly, the guardian wishes to be actively involved in the planning for X, indeed she will travel to Kenya if required. She sees the court as having a continuing and crucial role in the current circumstances in safeguarding X’s welfare. Moreover, as Miss Hudson points out, having regard to the assurance of the Borders &amp; Immigration Authority, the continuing court proceedings will also provide the necessary security in relation to X’s continuing presence in this country for as long as is required to implement the revised Kenyan care plan.</p>

Her previous recommendation was couched in cautious terms, the guardian expressing herself in her final report to be “not as strong in the support of this as I would want to be”. Her support of the revised Kenyan care plan is not subject to that qualification.</p>

Accordingly, he accepts that it may be appropriate for a care order to be made, albeit with leave for X to be placed abroad. Moreover, as he makes clear, the GRK welcomes the assistance of the guardian in planning the difficult task of preparing X for departure to Kenya, and accordingly, an interim care order could be made in order to retain her involvement, albeit expiring without renewal once X has moved to Kenya. Therefore, he says, notwithstanding its preference the GRK will accept the making of an interim care order in relation to X, subject to the court approving the local authority’s plan to effect the GRK’s revised care plan. </p>

The GRK is confident that it will be able to achieve a suitable adoptive placement for X in Kenya and Mr Gray submits that I should entrust this to the GRK, in collaboration with the local authority and the guardian and with the anticipated involvement of Mr Y and Ms Z should they prove co-operative. He fears that retention of the court’s involvement in the adoption process, even if merely to indorse the matching adopters with X, leaves open the possibility of significant delay and the danger of tactics that risk the smooth transition of X by the professionals who are particularly familiar with her needs. Consequently, he says, the GRK resists any notion that there should be a further fixed court hearing or that X should not make the journey to Kenya until the court has given its further approval. He points to the possibility of Mr Y and Ms Z restoring the matter to court in the event that there were problems implementing the revised care plan, though acknowledging the unlikelihood of them being considered as carers once it has been decided (if it is) that X is not to return to their care. (As he rightly says, to reverse such a decision would cause considerable confusion for X.)</p>

(This would also, he suggests, afford the court the opportunity of listing the matter of its own motion). Having helpfully identified these different approaches the local authority, as it seems to me appropriately in these very unusual circumstances, seeks my guidance as to whether or not a review should be listed at this stage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The guardian says that the care proceedings should continue, with X subject to continuing interim care orders, as this will secure X’s position and give the local authority the necessary parental responsibility to take appropriate decisions and steps in relation to her. Furthermore, she says, the court should take an active role in monitoring the progress of the plan. Since she anticipates that the steps required to put the plan for X’s return to Kenya into effect will take some months, she suggests that provision should be made for the further consideration of the case at an appropriate stage by me. As she points out, the care plan and its execution require particular care and consideration in this case, having regard to the changes the plan will bring about, and a further hearing will give the parties the opportunity of making any representations in relation to the plan and, crucially, for the court to give its approval (or otherwise).</p>

I would currently envisage, therefore, that for so long as X remains in this country, but not, I am inclined to think, thereafter, the English court should continue to be actively involved.
