	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The litigation arises out of the civil marriage celebrated in London on 3 October 1998 between Abdulhadi Ali Shayif, who was born on 10 May 1948, and Faiza Ben Hashem, who was born on 15 June 1959. Their Islamic marriage took place on 25 November 1998. I shall refer to them for convenience as “the husband” and “the wife” respectively although their marriage, valid by the law of their religion, was declared by Bennett J on 17 October 2005 to be void, the husband being still married to another woman. The husband had previously been married three times, in 1965, in 1978 and in 1985. He had divorced his first and second wives (by talaq) in 1979 but was still married in 1998 to his third wife.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The husband’s marriage to the wife finally broke down in July 2004 when they separated. Following the decree nisi pronounced by Bennett J on 17 October 2005 the husband registered a talaq divorce in Saudi Arabia on 22 October 2005. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The husband has spent his entire adult life in Saudi Arabia, of which he became a citizen in 1982 and where he is domiciled and resident with a house in Jeddah. After a long and successful career in banking he rose to become, in 1999, the general manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, one of the most prominent banks in the Middle East. He retired in September 2005. It is plain, not least from his own evidence, that he is well connected and highly thought of in Saudi Arabian financial and business circles. Since his retirement he has held positions on the bank’s board of directors and executive committee. Information gathered by the wife – the husband has declined to file his Form E (see below) – indicates that he continues to have various interests in a number of projects in the Middle East. Thus, in addition to continuing to serve on the board of the bank, he has joined the boards of several large organisations in Saudi Arabia, including the Saudi Railway Organisation, the Saudi Cable Company, and the Federation of Arab Banks. It appears that he is also involved with – according to the wife he owns – various businesses including a real estate business and a business which supplies hospital equipment.</p>

By and large the Properties were acquired as investments and rented out, though there were periods when they (or some of them) were used by the husband, the wife or the children whilst visiting, holidaying or staying in this country. The first three (64 St John’s Wood Court, 215 The Quadrangle and 32 Forest House) have now been sold. The other two (17 Kensington Heights and 57 Forest House) are still held by the Company.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following difficulties in the marriage, and in particular following an argument between the husband and the wife at the wedding of the husband’s daughter in August 2000, the wife, who had previously been living with the husband predominantly in Saudi Arabia, where the main matrimonial home was, returned to this country. She says he sent her back; he says she ran away as a wilful and disobedient wife. Be that as it may, she forced her way into 17 Kensington Heights – having nowhere else to live – and changed the locks. She has been living there ever since. Although the marriage recovered, the wife remained based in this country, the husband in Saudi Arabia, though visiting her quite frequently and, when he did, staying with her at 17 Kensington Heights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the breakdown of the marriage the wife issued divorce proceedings on 20 December 2004. The Company issued proceedings in the Chancery Division on 7 April 2006 seeking to make good its claim to 17 Kensington Heights and 57 Forest House. So, putting matters in a nutshell, the wife seeks ancillary relief from the husband; at the same time there is a dispute between the wife on the one side and the husband, the Company and the children on the other as to the true ownership of both the Company and the Properties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly (“the Chancery proceedings”), there is an action by the Company and the children against the wife. The Company seeks declarations that 17 Kensington Heights and 57 Forest House are owned by the Company beneficially, an order for possession of 17 Kensington Heights and the usual consequential relief. The children seek a declaration that they are the beneficial holders of the shareholdings in the Company registered in their respective names. The Chancery proceedings were issued on 7 April 2006. The wife’s defence and Part 20 claim were filed on 19 May 2006. Despite strenuous objection from the Company, the proceedings were transferred to the Family Division by Master Moncaster on 7 June 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By order of Roderic Wood J dated 12 October 2006 the Company was joined as second respondent to the ancillary relief proceedings. By the same order Roderic Wood J injuncted the husband until final hearing or further order from disposing of his shares in the Company and the Company from disposing of or depleting the value of 17 Kensington Heights and 57 Forest House. (A similar order was obtained by the wife in the Royal Court of Jersey on 16 November 2006.) By an order made by Bennett J on 20 November 2006 the two sets of proceedings were consolidated. The consolidation order was not drawn in the form familiar in the Chancery Division (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Heward</span>, Chancery Orders, 1986, page 95), hence the ungainly form of title above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The history of the ancillary relief proceedings has been characterised throughout by the husband’s failure – in truth, his adamant refusal – to engage in any meaningful way with the process. He has failed to comply with the relevant provisions of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 and has disobeyed numerous orders of the court. He has never given proper disclosure. These are all topics which I must return to in greater detail below when I come to consider the husband’s litigation misconduct and the inferences I can properly draw from it.</p>

The same order required the husband to pay the wife’s costs in the sum of £13,500 and (see <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (Maintenance Pending Suit: Provision for Legal Fees</span>) [2001] 1 FLR 377) a further £12,000 towards her future litigation costs. No payment has ever been made by the husband under that order and as at the date of the final hearing the maintenance arrears amounted to £156,000. So the total sums outstanding under that order amounted to £181,500. By a further order dated 11 April 2006 Bennett J required the husband to continue paying the mortgage and service charge in relation to 17 Kensington Heights. He has not done so.</p>

At the point where Miss Parker’s cross-examination of the husband was about to move from those matters directly raised in the Chancery proceedings to the wider issues canvassed in the ancillary relief proceedings, the husband protested, seeking to assert that he should not be required to answer any more questions and indicating that he did not propose to take any further part in the hearing. I ruled that he could not choose the topics on which, having been sworn, he had to answer Miss Parker’s questions, that they were plainly relevant to the ancillary relief proceedings and that I required him to answer her questions. The husband accepted my ruling and answered the remainder of Miss Parker’s questions – whether satisfactorily is another matter. At the end of his evidence the husband withdrew from the proceedings. </p>

This enabled me to gain considerable insight into the history and activities of the Company and the history of the Properties. But it is to be noticed that this disclosure, massive though it was, is not comprehensive. For example, there were no accounts for the Company later than for the year ended 31 March 1993, though whether this was because of inadequacies in the process of disclosure or because such accounts had never been prepared and do not exist, was never made clear to me.</p>

Inevitably her knowledge of the Properties and of the Company’s affairs was based in large measure on what she had gleaned from the husband. Mrs Penny was a patently honest witness doing her very best to assist. On matters within her knowledge she was accurate and reliable, but the focus of her activities had been on the management of the Properties and so her knowledge of other aspects of the Company’s activities was limited. The evidence of the three children who gave evidence was reasonably frank, so far as it went. But I was left with the distinct impression that each could have said more than they chose to and that the similarities in their accounts strongly suggested that they had ‘put their heads together’. The husband presented as respectable – even distinguished – but his account, insofar as he volunteered anything, had obviously been carefully prepared and was plainly an ‘edited’ version of the truth. He gave away no more than he chose to and was neither frank nor honest. </p>

The husband has accepted in terms (see paragraph 33 of his witness statement in the Chancery proceedings dated 3 July 2007) that he “will not contest [the wife’s] claim for my share of [the Company] which amounts to 30% of the net value of the assets after discharge of all mortgages and fees etc.”</p>

As she put it in her skeleton argument, the Company and the children accept that the husband’s interest in the Company, namely his shares, is property against which an order in the ancillary relief proceedings may be made.

It is also clear that on 7 June 1988 the decision had been taken to use a Jersey company – in the event the Company – to hold 215 The Quadrangle (see below), just as it is clear from a letter dated 13 August 1988 written by the husband’s informal adviser, Mr Simon Penny, that the Company was to be the vehicle for holding both 64 St John’s Wood Close and 215 The Quadrangle.

This would have given the husband, Isam and Firas 600 shares (25%) each, leaving the daughters, Aliyah and Abeer, with 300 (12½%) each. But on 12 February 2000 this was being revised to a proposal that the only transfer would be of 240 shares by the husband to Firas. When it was noticed on 8 March 2000 that this would have given the husband and Firas 600 shares (25%) each but left Isam with only 480 (20%), corrected documents were prepared (in April 2000), reflecting a transfer by the husband to Firas of 120 shares.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first place, as I have already observed, the history of the ancillary relief proceedings has been characterised throughout by the husband’s failure – his adamant refusal – to engage in any meaningful way with the process. He has failed to comply with the relevant provisions of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991. He has disobeyed numerous orders of the court. He has never given proper disclosure. I can summarise the main features of all this as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Even assuming that, despite an order made by Bennett J on 17 October 2005 requiring him to serve a Form E within 28 days (his appeal against this order being dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 26 January 2006), the husband was justified in not serving his Form E until his ‘strike out’ application (see below) had been dismissed on 11 April 2006, there is and can be no justification for his failure to do so thereafter. Yet the husband has never filed a Form E, despite being ordered to do so by Bennett J on 19 October 2006 (in an order which was endorsed with a penal notice) and despite the wife’s application dated 26 February 2007 to commit him for contempt. The husband’s only response was to write a letter to Bennett J on 27 March 2007 seeking to justify his stance. I set out this extraordinary document in an Appendix. In these circumstances, not surprisingly, no order was made on the wife’s committal application when it came before Bennett J on 29 March 2007. The only disclosure the husband has ever made is in a manifestly inadequate affidavit which he swore on 8 February 2006 in response to the wife’s application for maintenance pending suit (see below). As Miss Parker justly observes, the accuracy of that affidavit as a purportedly full and accurate statement of his means can be measured against his complaint, in the letter to Bennett J, against having to provide “extensive details of every single asset I have.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">On 8 February 2006, as we have seen, Bennett J made an order, backdated to the date of service of the petition on the husband, requiring the husband to pay the wife maintenance pending suit at the rate of £48,000 per annum. And the same order required the husband to pay the wife’s costs in the sum of £13,500 and a further £12,000 towards her future litigation costs. No payment has ever been made by the husband under that order. The husband’s failure to comply with this order is, as Miss Parker points out, aggravated by two features. In the first place the husband had made an open offer in a letter from his solicitors dated 7 February 2006 to pay the wife £36,000 per annum (in addition to meeting the running costs of 17 Kensington Heights) yet he has paid nothing. Secondly, in the affidavit which he swore on 8 February 2006 the husband deposed to the fact that as well as an annual income of £160,000 he had £500,000 cash in bank accounts in Saudi Arabia – so he can scarcely plead poverty – yet he has paid her nothing. In the circumstances Miss Parker, in my judgment, is well justified in describing the husband’s refusal to comply with this order as wilful and contumacious.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, it is apparent that the husband’s strategy has throughout been to ‘string out’ the proceedings as long as possible, his objective, I have no doubt, being to exhaust the wife financially so as to prevent her litigating. Bennett J referred on 17 October 2005 to “the war of the long purse” and the Court of Appeal on 26 January 2006 to the “perceptible risk that the wife would be worn down” by costs. There are repeated examples of this:</p>

On 8 February 2006 Bennett J listed that application for hearing on 11 April 2006. A matter of days before the hearing, the husband’s solicitors wrote to the wife’s solicitors on 3 April 2006 saying that the husband would be placing himself on the record and that “he does not propose to pursue his strike out application.” The next day (4 April 2006) the husband filed notice of acting in person, since when he has played no active part in the proceedings.

It will be recalled that the wife’s petition was issued on 20 December 2004. On 19 January 2005 the husband gave telephone instructions to the Company’s solicitors that the property should be sold, followed up by written instructions the same day indicating that “the purchaser is pressing for quick exchange and I would like you to expedite”. Only on 24 January 2005 was it discovered that the wife had registered her unilateral notice on 10 January 2005.</p>

In relation to (iii), the Company’s case is that these instructions from the husband were given by him <span style="font-style:italic">qua </span>director of the Company; Miss Parker says that it was on any view an attempt by the husband to place one of the two remaining Properties beyond the reach of the court.</p>

Pointing to the fact that the Chancery proceedings were issued on 7 April 2006, precisely three days after the husband had filed a notice of acting in person in the ancillary relief proceedings (and after which, as we now know, he took no further part in the proceedings), she says that what she calls the chronology of the Company’s involvement in these proceedings begins almost exactly at the point when the husband’s engagement in the ancillary relief proceedings ends. She submits that this is no coincidence but rather a part of the husband’s overall tactics, approach to the litigation and intention to pressurise the wife. In this connection Miss Parker also draws attention to the fact that, as she puts it, the Company fought tooth and nail to keep the Chancery proceedings in the Chancery Division and separate from the ancillary relief proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For good measure Miss Parker suggests that the sense of cynicism relating to the Chancery proceedings is heightened when one looks at the various co-claimants. The Company was obviously (and properly) a claimant but it is difficult, she suggests, to see what the legal justification was for including the children but not the husband as co-claimants. On one view, she says, the only necessary claimant given the Company’s case was the Company itself; but if it was necessary for the individual shareholders to be co-claimants, it is difficult, she says, to see why the husband did not join in that exercise. With all respect to Miss Parker this is a thoroughly bad point. The reason why the children were joined as co-claimants was because the wife had put in issue their beneficial ownership of their shareholdings, so they accordingly sought the declaration I have mentioned. That claim was appropriately joined together with the Company’s claim for declaratory relief in relation to the Properties. But for obvious reasons the wife had never put in issue the husband’s beneficial ownership of his 30% shareholding in the Company, so he did not need to bring declaratory proceedings of the type brought by the children whose shareholdings were under attack.</p>

And I have little doubt that the overall litigation strategies of both the husband and the Company were co-ordinated. I doubt, however, that the Company or the children required much if any persuasion to launch the Chancery proceedings. I have the distinct impression, in the light of all the evidence I have read and heard, that the children had thoroughly disapproved of the wife’s occupation of 17 Kensington Heights, both in 2000 and thereafter. They had been prepared to go along with it initially on the basis that the husband would be responsible in the short-term for the outgoings and, in the longer-term, for getting the wife out. By April 2006 they had every incentive – loyalty to their father quite apart from their interests in the Company – for wanting to get the wife out without further delay. No doubt it suited the husband that the Company was launching the Chancery proceedings, and no doubt he was happy to see the wife being put under pressure from both directions, but it is probably going too far to say, if this indeed is what Miss Parker is saying, that the Chancery proceedings were commenced only at his instigation and that they were nothing more than a part of his campaign.</p>

The wife says this is a grotesque and dishonest under-statement. The husband’s account of his financial situation is, says Miss Parker, completely at odds with his lifestyle and that of his family. It is, she says, self evident from the lifestyle the husband and wife enjoyed that the husband has a very high standard of living and access to considerable wealth. The wife’s case – indeed, her belief – is that the husband’s resources are in fact in excess of US$500 million and may even exceed US$800 million. Miss Parker invites me to find that the husband is worth in excess of £250 million. Alternatively, she submits, even if I am not able to find that as a fact I am able to and should find that he is more than able to satisfy the wife’s claim in its entirety. </p>

But the picture must be kept within the bounds of reality. Whatever the wife’s belief – and I neither dispute the honesty of her belief nor dispute that it <span style="font-style:italic">may </span>be correct – the evidence before me does nothing to support her case that the husband’s wealth is to be measured in hundreds of millions. Their lifestyle was undoubtedly grand, but it was not marked with the opulence or extravagance one might have expected if the husband was really worth what she says, nor is she able to point to tangible assets remotely approaching in value what she says he is worth. It <span style="font-style:italic">may </span>be that there are hundreds of millions invested in intangibles – I am certainly not finding that there are not – but the picture I have does not suggest it. Theirs was not, for example, a lifestyle characterised by yachts and private jets, nor is there anything to suggest that the husband ever engaged in the kind of expensive hobbies and pastimes one often associates with the mega- or even the very-rich. </p>

One relates to the matrimonial home in Saudi Arabia. It was obviously a large and very comfortable property – larger, more comfortable and, indeed, probably more opulent than the husband sought to paint it – but it was far short of the enormous or the palatial. The other relates to the Properties, all of which, it is to be noted, were worth in the hundred thousands at most – and the low hundred thousands at that – rather than in the millions. And the same seems to go for the other properties owned by the husband in the Middle East. If this really is a man worth as much as the wife says, one might have expected him to own at least one property somewhere worth very much more than any of the properties which have been described to me. And bearing in mind his longstanding affection for this country – the country in which he went to school and the country with which, as the very acquisition of the Properties demonstrates, he maintained a close connection – one might have expected the husband, if he really was worth as much as the wife says, to have had at least one really large, even if not opulent, house in this country.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Parker’s primary case, as she calls it, is that the husband and the Company are one and the same, that the Company is simply the husband by another name and that the other shareholders – the children – are simply his nominees. This is the foundation of her claim that the wife is entitled to pierce or lift the veil of incorporation. Her alternative claims, as we have seen, are that even if the wife cannot go behind the veil of incorporation either (1) the two remaining Properties are held on constructive trusts for the husband or, alternatively, (2) the children’s shares in the Company are held on resulting trusts for the husband. Miss Parker makes no bones about the fact that the evidence she relies upon in support of these alternative cases is largely the same as the evidence which she relies upon in support of her primary case. Indeed, in relation to both of her alternative bases of claim she says that they may not amount to much more than a reformulation of her primary case and are probably no more than variations of the main theme, ‘whose money is it?’</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point, as she correctly says, is that the Company is on any footing a small family company. It is not, she says, a trading entity. Its directors, as we have seen, have largely been fee-paid professional company directors drawn from corporate service providers in the Channel Islands. They are certainly not full-time employees. There are no substantial creditors, whether trading associates, Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs or otherwise. The Company was formed and exists, as the evidence amply demonstrates, to hold property in a tax-efficient manner. Its sole function is to hold property in England for, the wife contends, the husband alone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against this background Miss Parker points to what she says are the following specific and telling features of the evidence:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">First, and as the wife has asserted from the very outset, there is her evidence – which I accept – that the husband on a number of occasions during the course of the marriage pointed out or referred to the Properties as being ‘his’ – ‘mine’ – and similarly told her that the Company was his. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the Company was established in 1988, the husband providing the entire share capital, at a time when Isam was just 18, when the other children were all minors and when Firas was a very young baby. Of course, as Miss Parker accepts, even minors can legitimately own shares, and many fathers legitimately wish to make provision for their children by conferring shareholdings on them, but it is important, she says, to note that the Company was in no way and never has been a joint venture between investors or a partnership of equals on the part of the husband and the children. The issue for the court, she says, is whether, at that stage, the husband genuinely intended to part, in favour of his children, with 70% of the value of the assets transferred into the Company’s name or, indeed, of those assets acquired subsequently. She submits that he did not.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, and as the contemporaneous documents to which I have referred make clear, the purpose for which the Company was established was not to make immediate provision for the children but to protect the husband from United Kingdom capital gains tax and inheritance tax. In particular, says Miss Parker, the references to inheritance tax indicate that the benefit of the Company’s assets was not to be enjoyed by the children until after the husband’s death.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the only person to contribute funds to or to draw funds out of the Company has been the husband. When funds have been required by the Company he has provided them. (It is asserted that since about March 2006 some funds have been provided by Isam to meet various costs incurred by the Company. Miss Parker says that, given the date and circumstances in which the Chancery proceedings were launched, it is not difficult to be cynical about that exercise; there is, moreover, she says, not a shred of evidence as to where Isam got the money from to make these contributions.) When the Company has purchased properties, restrictions have been registered with the Land Registry so that the properties could not be sold without the husband’s consent. Perhaps most important of all, and of particular significance given the amounts involved, she suggests, when the Company’s properties have been realised, the husband alone has received the proceeds of sale. She asserts (though this is hotly disputed) that not a penny of this has been paid to any of the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, whilst the various ‘hired’ directors or managers have dealt to a certain extent with various day to day matters, all the important decisions relating to the Company, she says, have plainly been taken by the husband and all the professionals involved with the Company plainly take their instructions from him. The documents disclosed by the Company are simply littered, she says, with examples of the husband and the Company being treated as interchangeable entities, and there is no example prior to 2006 of any of the other shareholders having anything other than a nominal relationship with the Company.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Sixth, the husband appears to have regarded himself as the ultimate beneficial owner. He refers to the Company’s property as ‘my’ property and to the Company as a ‘vehicle’; indeed the directors of the Company refer to him as “the company’s beneficial owner” even though his shareholding, on the face of it, is only 30%. Such references to the interests of the other shareholders as there are (and they are, says Miss Parker, few and far between) present as formalities, rather than real issues or impediments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Seventh, the timing of the attempt to sell 57 Forest House, the evident haste in the husband’s instructions, and the suggestion that the sale proceeds will be remitted outside the jurisdiction, are wholly consistent with a sense on the part of the husband of his personal property being threatened by the wife’s application.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, says Miss Parker, simply on the basis of the contemporaneous records there is a compelling case that the Company’s assets are in reality regarded by all concerned as the husband’s. Moreover, she says, his protestations – and the Company’s – fall to be considered in the light of what she says is the husband’s unscrupulous conduct of the proceedings and his attempts to defeat the wife’s claims by fair means or foul. She submits that when the case deployed by the wife is considered in the round the conclusion is inescapable that the Properties are really the husband’s, doubtless intended to benefit his children in time but still in his gift as at the date of the wife’s application. </p>

The persons who subscribe the memorandum, or who have agreed to become members of the company and whose names are on the register, are alone regarded as, and in fact are, the shareholders … Whether they are beneficial owners or bare trustees is a matter with which neither the company nor creditors have anything to do: it concerns only them and their cestuis que trust if they have any.”</p>

She submits that, even if the Company is not simply the husband by another name, and even if the children’s shareholdings in the Company are real and genuine, it does not follow that the Company is necessarily the beneficial owner of the two properties. The evidence establishes, she says, that even if the husband cannot properly be regarded as the Company’s sole beneficial owner, nonetheless the Company in truth has no beneficial interest in 17 Kensington Heights and 57 Forest House and holds them on constructive trusts for the benefit of the husband alone. (Miss Parker says the trusts are constructive trusts rather than resulting trusts though in my judgment nothing turns for present purposes on the distinction.)

These facts have to be considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, not least the many references to the Properties as being “mine” or “his” (including a number of statements to this effect which I am satisfied he made to the wife) and what Miss Parker says was the children’s lack of involvement in the subsequent ‘investment’ in Saudi Arabia of what was at least in major part ‘their’ money.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, it is necessary to start from first principles. The foundation of the wife’s case is the undoubted fact that the husband funded the acquisitions of all five properties, save insofar as the rental incomes were sufficient to service the mortgage loans. But that, of itself, takes the wife nowhere. For someone may provide money used in the acquisition of a property without thereby acquiring any interest in that property. It all depends upon the <span style="font-style:italic">character </span>in which the money is provided. Was the money provided by way of gift, by way of loan or in the character of purchaser? Only in the last case will there be any question of a resulting or constructive trust. If there was in truth a gift, the donor has no claim at all. If there was a loan, the lender has a claim for the repayment of his money with interest but no claim to, or any interest in, the property (save insofar as the loan is secured by a charge or mortgage of the property). But if the payment was in the character of purchaser, the investor has a claim to a share in the property by way of a constructive or resulting trust (for present purposes nothing turns on the important conceptual differences between these two classes of trust) and proportionate to his investment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A simple example will make the differences clear. Let us suppose that A provides £10 and B provides £90 towards the purchase of a property which is bought for £100 and eventually sold for £200. If A provided the £10 as a gift, then he gets nothing on the sale; the entire £200 goes to B. If, on the other hand, A provided the £10 as a loan, then he will recover the £10 plus interest (say £5) – a total of £15; the other £185 will go to B. But if A provided the £10 as a contribution to the purchase price and in the character of a purchaser, then, other things being equal, the proceeds of sale will be held on (constructive or resulting) trust as to 10% for A and 90% for B, so A will receive £20 and B will receive £180. (As will be appreciated, whether A is better off if he lent the money or if he invested it <span style="font-style:italic">qua</span> purchaser will depend upon whether the property is increasing in value at a rate greater than prevailing interest rates.)</p>

A bank which advances money to fund a purchase will usually do so by way of loan, and it makes no difference for this purpose that the loan is secured by a charge or mortgage of the property.

That is subject to the operation, where relevant, of the presumption of advancement. There is a presumption of advancement – a presumption of gift – if a father acquires property (land, shares or any other kind of property) in the name of, or transfers property into the name of, his son or daughter: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Shephard v Cartwright </span>[1955] AC 431 per Viscount Simmonds at page 445. The presumption is, of course, rebuttable and, as Lord Upjohn commented in <span style="font-style:italic">Pettitt v Pettitt </span>[1970] AC 777 at page 814, is “readily rebutted by comparatively slight evidence.” Indeed, the practical forensic reality (see the observations of Lord Hodson at page 811) is that the presumption is likely to have any decisive effect only if there are no living witnesses and no other relevant evidence. Where there is such evidence then the question simply becomes one of fact on the totality of the evidence, to be decided, as it has often been put, by the judge acting as a jury. As Nourse LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tribe v Tribe</span> [1995] 2 FLR 966 at page 974, “the presumption of advancement has … fallen into disfavour”.</p>

On the contrary, the husband received good consideration for the transfer of the beneficial interest in 64 St John’s Wood Court, namely, the issue of, in all, 2,400 shares to himself and the children. (The fact that the major part of the shares went to the children is, for this purpose, neither here nor there: consideration has to move from the promisee but need not move to the promisor.) In those circumstances, as Miss Evans-Gordon correctly observes, it cannot be said that the Company held 64 St John’s Wood Court on a resulting trust for the husband, as he received full payment for the acquisition by the Company of his previous interest.</p>

The treatment in the Company’s books of the husband’s advances is, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, inconsistent with any claim by the husband to a beneficial interest or (putting the same point the other way round) to any resulting trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should at this point go a little further into the facts. Mr Wagstaffe has prepared a most helpful analysis of the relevant entries in the Company’s books and accounts. This shows that the total of the funds introduced by the husband and added to his loan account with the Company during the period from 1989 to 2005 amounted to £684,580. The Company’s accounts for the year ended 31 March 1989 show the Company owing him £203,575. The corresponding figures for the next few years (as I have said, I have seen no accounts later than those for 1993 but there is no reason to think that there was any change in the Company’ accounting policies in later years) are: 1990 – £244,994; 1991 – £259,422; 1992 – £264,829; 1993 – £285,232. It is also to be noted that, consistently with this treatment of the husband’s payments as loans, the Company’s accounts show 64 St John’s Wood Court, 215 The Quadrangle and 17 Kensington Heights as assets of the Company (57 Forest House was not acquired until 1996, after the last set of accounts I have seen). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as concerns 32 Forest House, Miss Evans-Gordon says that is clear from the contemporaneous documentation that the husband gifted the purchase monies for this property to the Company and in circumstances, moreover, where, she says, the contemporaneous documentation in relation to other properties previously acquired evidenced his intention to gift additional monies to the Company for the ultimate benefit of both himself and the children as shareholders. There is, as Miss Evans-Gordon submits, no reason to question this documentation, as there is no contemporary evidence or suggestion of wrongdoing. If the monies were gifted to the Company then that is, for reasons I have already explained, equally inconsistent with any claim in trust. It is to be noted that, as in the case of the other Properties, 32 Forest House was shown in the Company’s accounts as an asset of the Company.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, and insofar as the claim to a constructive trust is founded on a wider range of circumstances than the mere fact that the husband initially funded the acquisitions of the Properties – in other words, is founded on an overall assessment of the conduct of the parties from which, it is submitted, one can properly infer a common intention justifying the imposition of such a trust – an overall analysis points, in my judgment, not in favour of the existence of any such trust but decisively in the other direction. I have already pointed to the Company’s treatment in its books of what it saw as its indebtedness to the husband. And it is, in my judgment, clear from everything I have read and heard that the husband believed and acted on the basis that his interest in the Properties derived from his shareholding alone; it was not an interest directly in the Properties. And what, asks Miss Evans-Gordon rhetorically, is there in the husband’s conduct in any way inconsistent with what she says is the true view, namely that the husband’s actions in relation to the Company and the Properties were referable to his position as a director for much of the time, to his shareholding and to the shareholdings of the children for whom he acted. In this connection, as she points out, it is relevant to note that in 1988 all except Isam, who had just reached his majority, were minors. </p>

At the end of the day, she says, it cannot be unconscionable in the circumstances for the Company to claim ownership of the Properties as against the husband. I agree. Nor, she submits, can there be any question of unconscionable behaviour in relation to the wife, who no longer asserts – and in any event, in my judgment, cannot on the facts assert – that she has acted to her detriment in reliance on any belief caused by anything done or said by the Company. Again, I agree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there is the undoubted fact that on many occasions the husband referred to the Properties and/or to the Company as being his, a form of words which, with other analogous expressions, is to found liberally sprinkled throughout the contemporaneous documentation. Indeed, as Miss Parker points out, there are instances of the Company’s directors (and, I might add, its solicitors) referring to the husband as being, or in effect treating him as if he were, the owner. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are here, in my judgment, two general points to be made. First, one has to have regard to the context in which such expressions are being used. Often one can refer to something as “mine” even though one knows very well, and does not intend to suggest anything different, that it actually belongs to someone else. One can invite relatives or friends down to stay at ‘my house in the country’ even though, as they may or may not be aware, the title to the property is actually vested in some family company or trust in which others also have interests. If a rambler walking across the grounds of a stately home comes across the Tenth Duke of Loamshire and asks ‘Are you the owner, do you mind if I walk across your land’, he is likely to be given the answer ‘yes’ to both questions rather than being referred to the trustees of the settlement created by the Ninth Duke. If a traffic warden concerned about the illegal parking of a company car says, whose car is this? the answer, even from a lawyer, is going to be ‘mine’ and not ‘Abracadabra plc’. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other point relates to what is in this context the important distinction between the assertion in the husband’s mouth that the <span style="font-style:italic">Properties</span> are ‘mine’ and his assertion that the <span style="font-style:italic">Company</span> is ‘mine’ – both of which, I am satisfied, he has said on many occasions. These are, and not merely in terms of legal analysis, quite distinct propositions, and many of the words and other matters relied up relate more to the Company than to the Properties. An assertion that the company is ‘mine’ is in no way inconsistent, either as a matter of fact or a matter of law, with the company rather than the speaker being the owner of its property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context Miss Parker relies upon many specific references in the documents. I propose to comment on only a few. In 2000 the husband writing to solicitors refers to “my apartment 215 Quadrangle”, an example typical of many which, although suggestive, are in reality too ambiguous to be determinative. In relation to a much earlier period, a letter which Mrs Penny wrote in June 1990 to the local authority in relation to council tax, saying that “Mr A Shayif (Company name: Radfan) purchased this property” – that is, 215 The Quadrangle – neatly illustrates how careful one has to be in reading too much into loose or unguarded language. But there are other references which require more searching scrutiny. One of the matters on which Miss Parker places particular reliance, as we have seen, was the registration at the Land Registry of restrictions in relation to the Properties. This was explained in a letter written by solicitors to a bank on 17 May 2002 as being “to protect his interest in the property”. Earlier documents show that those solicitors were, of course, well aware that the Properties were, as they put it, “owned” by the Company, so even lawyers were able to speak without any apparent difficulty of the husband having an interest in property which they well knew belonged to the company. Years earlier, in 1992, other solicitors had likewise referred to the purpose of the restriction as being to “protect Mr Shayif’s interest”, though the same letter correctly described him, albeit as holding the largest block of shares in the Company, as “not a majority shareholder.” There is, in my judgment, no particular difficulty in understanding these references and in understanding what these two firms of solicitors were driving at, even if they expressed themselves in language which might have caused an old-fashioned black-letter conveyancer to wince. The reality was of course, as they saw it, that the husband had a substantial loan account which was otherwise unsecured. In those circumstances he plainly had an interest, if not, strictly speaking in the Properties, at least in ensuring that the Properties were not realised without appropriate provision being made in relation to the Company’s indebtedness to him. So there is, in my judgment, a perfectly understandable reason why the restrictions were registered and why the solicitors said what they did, a reason, moreover, which is entirely consistent with Miss Evans-Gordon’s case and which does not lead to, let alone compel, the conclusion for which Miss Parker contends.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other matter I must deal with is the undoubted fact that the entire proceeds of sale of three of the Properties were remitted to the husband, who also received £50,000 on the re-mortgage of one of the Properties. That is not, and cannot be disputed, but it is not inconsistent with the analysis for which Miss Evans-Gordon contends. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first place, the husband, as I have pointed out, was a substantial creditor of the Company. Moreover, although the precise details of much of this are far from clear, it is a fact, as I find, that the husband made generous provision for the children in the form of properties in Saudi Arabia which he acquired and gave them. True it is, as Miss Parker urges upon me, that even now there has never been any accounting by the husband to the children either in relation to any interim reinvestment of the proceeds of sale pending the later acquisitions of the properties in Saudi Arabia or, indeed, with a view to demonstrating the extent to which the proceeds of sale were in fact used for that purpose. But it is clear from the contemporaneous documentation that, at least on one occasion, the three older children expressly gave their consent to the payment of the proceeds of sale to the husband. And looking to events more generally, I satisfied on the basis of their oral evidence that the children were consulted at least informally by the husband as to what was going on and were content that he and the Company should act as they did. Whatever the implications of that may be in relation to other parts of Miss Parker’s case, it does nothing, in my judgment, to detract from the reality – the factual and legal reality – that, as between the husband and the Company, the Company was treated, by the husband, by the children, and by the directors and other agents of the Company, as being the beneficial owner of the Properties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first place, as Miss Evans-Gordon points out, if the Company was intended to be wholly owned beneficially by the husband it would have been unnecessary for <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> shares to be allotted to the children. The husband could have held all or most of the shares himself, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Salomon</span>, or, alternatively, if he had wished to hide his involvement, he could have arranged for the shares to be held by a trust company or professional trustees. The important point is that either of these courses of action would have achieved the tax advantages sought by setting up the Company in the first place. So there was no fiscal reason for having the children as shareholders and, as Miss Evans-Gordon points out, there is no evidence – or even any suggestion from Miss Parker – of any other motive or reason for the Company to be acquired and structured in this way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, and this, in my judgment, points tellingly in the same direction, the shares were not allocated randomly to each shareholder; they were allocated to the children in specific, and differing, proportions, reflecting, even if not exactly, Islamic practice under which male offspring receive a greater share of their father’s property than women. Furthermore, and this is really, at the end of the day, the most telling point of all, there is, as Miss Evans-Gordon submits, simply no rational explanation for the redistribution of the shares in 2000 if the children did not own them beneficially. So the redistribution of the shares, relied upon by Miss Parker as one of the indicators that the husband treated the Company and the shareholdings as his own, in fact, as it seems to me, points strongly in the other direction. (And, I might add, there is nothing to show that in procuring this redistribution the husband was riding roughshod over the interests of the children, for although at one stage the proposal had been that Aliyah and Abeer would transfer shares to Isam, the scheme as eventually implemented involved only the transfer of shares by the husband to Firas.)</p>

It is plain, she says, from the documentation which has been made available, as well as from the manner in which the Company has acted, that the Company is in fact no more than the husband’s alter ego and a conventional tax shelter, notwithstanding the shares nominally held by his children. On that basis, she says, it would be manifestly appropriate for the corporate veil to be lifted.

It was held that the company was (as Lord Hanworth MR put it at pages 956, 961) formed in order to mask the effective carrying on of a business by Mr Horne, the purpose being to enable him to carry on that business in breach of a covenant he had entered into. The shareholders and directors of the company were Mr Horne’s wife and one Howard, an employee of the company. Farwell J had found (see at page 955) that the business was obviously carried on “wholly” by Mr Horne, that Mrs Horne had taken no part in the business or its management, that Howard was an employee, and that those dealing with the company treated Mr Horne as being the ‘boss’ or ‘guvnor’. Lawrence LJ observed (page 965) that although the inference to be drawn from those facts might have been displaced by evidence adduced on the part of Mr Horne and the company “no such evidence was forthcoming”, even though the issue had been plainly raised on the pleadings. </p>

Its only function was to make and receive payments. It was in substance little other than Mr Dalby’s offshore bank account held in a nominee name. In my view this is the type of case in which the court ought to have no hesitation in regarding Burnstead simply as the alter ego through which Mr Dalby enjoyed the profit which he earned in breach of his fiduciary duty to ACP. If the arrival at this result requires a lifting of Burnstead’s corporate veil, then I regard this as an appropriate case in which to do so. Burnstead is simply a creature company used for receiving profits for which equity holds Mr Dalby to be accountable to ACP. Its knowledge was in all respects the same as his knowledge. The introduction into the story of such a creature company is, in my view, insufficient to prevent equity’s eye from identifying it with Mr Dalby”</p>

Furthermore, he is not able to make out any case that at any stage the company was a mere façade, or that it concealed the true facts, nor that there was any sham. All the transactions that took place were overt transactions. They were conducted in accordance with the liberties that are conferred upon corporate entities by the Companies Act 1985 and they do not conceal anything from anybody.

However much the court may wish to assist a wife and children where a lump sum has not been paid, I am satisfied that doing so here, whensoever it may be permissible, would be a step too far in all the circumstances.”</p>

As managing director of Charlton, he took the day to day decisions about how to get the Bangladesh deal off the ground. Again, I have no doubt that Jack and Helga were kept fully informed and had input into decisions and could, ultimately, as I say, “call the shots”: nonetheless, so far as concerns the Bangladesh end of the transaction, Charlton was, so it seems to me, a genuine company which was not being used, <span style="font-style:italic">vis a vis</span> the Bangladeshis, as a sham or façade at all.”</p>

As she observes, the Company was established in 1988 and the Properties had all been acquired by the beginning of 1997, well before the parties met again and well before they first contemplated marriage. In these circumstances, as she points out, it cannot be said that the Company was established to facilitate any wrong directed at the wife, nor, she says, does a bone fide arrangement become bogus or a sham simply as a result of a marriage breakdown. This was not, she says, a sophisticated off-shore structure. It is a simple corporate structure with the shareholdings clearly set out. Moreover, until the wife decided she wished to occupy 17 Kensington Heights, the Company was not a dormant company simply holding property for its shareholders and dependent upon their largesse to maintain it. The Company, as she points out, traded actively in the rental market as is evidenced by its accounts. And its rental income was used, as we have seen, to discharge its liabilities, including its mortgage obligations. (I do not, of course, overlook either the fact that the Company was also dependent upon substantial cash investments from the husband or the fact that some of its properties were from time to time used by the husband, the children and the wife.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, she says, there is no evidence that the various professional and independent directors of the Company were parties to anything wrong or that they acted inappropriately, for instance by abdicating responsibility and simply doing whatever the husband required of them. Absent evidence to the contrary – and, she says, there is none – it is to be assumed that they were honest and acted appropriately, properly exercising their duties and responsibilities as directors. And in this connection, as she points out, it must not be forgotten that independent legal advisers were often involved, not merely in relation to the conveyancing of the Properties but also in relation to the shareholdings. Miss Evans-Gordon accepts, of course, that the husband was, as she puts it, “heavily involved” in the Company’s activities and, moreover, not merely when he was a director. (Miss Parker seeks to turn this last point to her advantage, saying that it merely shows how immaterial it was to the husband and the Company whether he was or was not a director.) Miss Evans-Gordon accepts, for example, that he gave instructions directly to solicitors in relation to purchases and sales of the Properties, that he negotiated with vendors and purchasers of the Properties and that he dealt with banks in relation to the Company’s borrowings.  She accepts that he was, as she puts it, the “dominant” director. But, she insists, the other directors were ‘proper’ directors; they were not the husband’s stooges, nor were they mere ciphers. And, she says, the evidence shows that, when taking these actions, the husband was acting with the authority of the directors and (as the case may be) for and on behalf of the children, as shareholders, having consulted with them and, in some cases, at their urging. Thus, she says, the proceeds of sale of 64 St Johns Wood Court, 215 The Quadrangle and 32 Forest House were paid, as she puts it, “into his keeping” with the prior agreement of the children and for their benefit.</p>

There has to be some relevant form of impropriety, that is, she says, some impropriety or wrongdoing by an individual – here the husband – in which the company structure is being used by the wrongdoer so as to avoid personal liability for his wrongdoing. And here, she says, there is simply no such impropriety: there is no wrongdoing by the husband, let alone any wrongdoing in relation to which the Company is being used as a means of diverting or avoiding liability. </p>

Accordingly, she submits, the court should not – indeed cannot properly – make orders against either the Company or its property.</p>

The fact, in my judgment, is that there are here, as Miss Evans-Gordon submits, genuine third-party shareholdings which give each of the children real minority interests. No doubt the children were, and are, and for a variety of reasons, some culturally motivated, inclined to defer to the husband and, within limits, to accommodate his wishes. But these are not nominee shareholdings; they are real shareholdings which, as I find, both the husband and the children have always treated as belonging to the children. The children, however submissive on occasions they may be to the husband’s wishes, are not his nominees, nor are they simply his stooges or lackeys. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That alone would be fatal to the wife’s case but matters do not end there, for it is equally clear, in my judgment, that the Company’s directors were not mere men of straw, nor were they the husband’s stooges or lackeys. To adopt Warren J’s phrase, it may have been the husband who, subject, of course to being able to persuade the children to go along with him, tended to ‘call the shots’. But this is a long way from saying that the other directors were mere ciphers, jumping to his orders and unthinkingly accommodating his requirements. The episode when they required him to obtain the three older children’s consents to the payment to him of the proceeds of sale of 64 St John’s Wood Court is demonstration of that. And whatever suspicions one might have about Mr Farid and Mr Shaibi – though those suspicions have to accommodate the fact that on at least some occasions they seem to have acted without first referring back to the husband – there is, in my judgment, no comparable cause for suspicion in relation to any of the ‘professional’ directors, who would, after all, have had little incentive to breach their fiduciary duties and imperil their standing merely to assist an ‘investor’ whose investment was on any basis fairly modest and which is unlikely to have been generating very substantial fees. And it is important to note that there were ‘professional’ directors in place until 29 April 2005 – in other words there were ‘professional’ directors in place at the time of each of the relevant sales (which, it will be remembered, took place between April 2000 and February 2001) and on each of the occasions when the impugned payments were made to the husband.</p>

One of the husband’s Saudi Arabian business colleagues, who seems to have been involved as his “adviser”, as the husband put it, and who acted on occasions as his middleman in relation to the Company’s affairs, described him as “owner” of the Company. Solicitors acting on behalf of the Company in various conveyancing transactions in relation to one or other of the Properties referred to the husband as “the underlying client” or “our client” There are references to actions having been taken on the husband’s “instructions” or as a result of what he has “decided” or “agreed”, to him “negotiating the sale” of one of the Properties and, on another occasion, to him “not wishing to sell” one of the Properties “at this time”. There are examples of Mrs Penny asking the husband “if you wish to proceed.” There is a letter written by the husband to solicitors in 1999 referring to the properties as being “held in the name of” and “formally registered in the name of” the Company.

The true principle is that ‘<span style="font-style:italic">equity </span>looks on that as done which ought to be done’ (emphasis added), this being one of the maxims of equity (see Snell’s Equity, ed 30, para 3-25) and not, so far as I am aware, a principle of the common law.

But I need not explore this aspect of his judgment any further for the present case does not on any view, given my findings on the other aspects of the matter, satisfy the conditions identified by Bodey J as being necessary if there is to be the ‘short-circuiting’ he referred to.

Third, there is the fact that claims which might otherwise have to be made good, if at all, by application of the doctrine of piercing the veil can in appropriate circumstances be made good in the Family Division (though in the nature of things not elsewhere) by successful reliance upon either section 37 of the 1973 Act or the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas </span>[1995] 2 FLR 668. Finally, and fundamentally, there is the point made by Hobhouse LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Ord </span>at page 457, that the concept of stripping or piercing the veil is “extremely limited indeed.” Reported cases in any context where the claim has succeeded are few in number and striking on their facts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Parker summarises her case as follows. She says that it does not appear to be disputed that the two properties although held by the Company have been used by the husband and the wife throughout the marriage as though the Company’s ownership was a mere formality. The Company, as she correctly points out, has never received a penny piece in rent from the family for their occupation of the property, and 17 Kensington Heights, in particular, has been occupied exclusively since 2000 by the wife and (for part of the time) the husband. And thereafter, until after the wife had issued her proceedings, there was never any suggestion that either of the properties should be sold or let. In these circumstances, Miss Parker submits that both properties, or at the very least 17 Kensington Heights, have been settled on the husband and/or the wife in such a way as to engage section 24(1)(c). She relies in particular upon the decision of Coleridge J in <span style="font-style:italic">N v N and F Trust </span>[2005] EWHC 2908 (Fam), [2006] 1 FLR 856. She submits that, even if the Company establishes that it is not simply the husband’s creature or alter ego, it has been entirely complicit in his requirements, especially so far as dealing with the two properties is concerned. In such circumstances, it is difficult, she says, to avoid the conclusion that, as in <span style="font-style:italic">N v N and F Trust</span>, settlements in relation to these properties have come into being and are capable of being varied by the court. Whether they should be so varied will of course, she accepts, depend upon the court’s assessment of the various section 25 factors.</p>

Conversely, a disposition which confers an immediate, absolute interest in an item of property does not constitute a settlement of that property. The statutory provision is concerned with an order varying the terms of a settlement. This would not be an altogether apt exercise in relation to property given out-and-out and belonging to one of the parties to the marriage as his or her own absolute property. The context does not require that outright gifts of this nature should fall within the scope of the variation provision. In such a case the appropriate order on the dissolution of the marriage, if an order is needed in respect of the property, is a property transfer or property settlement order.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Beyond this the authorities have consistently given a wide meaning to settlement in this context, and they have spelled out no precise limitations. This seems right, because this approach accords with the purpose of the statutory provision. Financial provision that is appropriate so long as the parties are married will often cease to be appropriate when the marriage ends. In order to promote the best interests of the parties and their children in the fundamentally changed situation, it is desirable that the court should have power to alter the terms of the settlement. The purpose of the section is to give the court this power. This object does not dictate that settlement should be given a narrow meaning. On the contrary, the purpose of the section would be impeded, rather than advanced, by confining its scope. The continuing use of the archaic expressions “ante-nuptial” and “post-nuptial” does not point in the opposite direction. These expressions are apt to embrace all settlements in respect of the particular marriage, whether made before or after the marriage. In this connection, it should be noted in passing that a settlement may be made in respect of a particular marriage even though in certain circumstances the wife or husband by a subsequent marriage might be the person to take.  <span style="font-style:italic">Lort-Williams v Lort-Williams</span> [1951] P 395 affords an illustration of this.”</p>

Thus it includes any interest the settlor himself thenceforth may have in the settled property by virtue of his own settlement. Further, the court’s power is not confined to varying the interests of the parties to the marriage under the settlement. The power includes, for instance, the interests in the settled property of the children or, more widely, of others under an old-fashioned protective trust. <span style="font-style:italic">Blood v Blood</span> [1902] P 78 is an example of the former, and <span style="font-style:italic">Marsh v Marsh</span> (1878) 39 LT 107, 545, of the latter.

Indeed, she says, the same result follows even if all that was granted was a bare licence to occupy. I quote: “If therefore a settlement confers upon the beneficiary a bare licence to occupy, the entire estate in the property is retained by the settlor (subject to that licence); but that retained interest would form part of the subject of the settlement.” </p>

It is this – that the whole of the hereditaments and premises comprised in the schedules to the marriage settlement were property settled by that settlement, and that the Court could therefore under the terms of s 5, which gives the Court power to make orders with reference to the application of the whole or a portion of the property settled for the benefit of children or their respective parents, order that the whole or a portion of the hereditaments and premises be applied for the benefit of the petitioner.

Therefore the settlement is for the purposes of the Settled Land Act a settlement of the moiety of the fee, that moiety is settled land for the purposes of the Act; and each daughter, having the powers of a tenant for life, can sell and convey a half part of the moiety, the purchase-money being paid to the trustees of the settlement.”</p>

The 1925 Act was, as she puts it, part of the wide ranging property and trust legislation of 1925 and must be seen as the background to section 24(1)(c) of the 1973 Act and its post 1925 predecessors. </p>

Indeed, she submits, given what is said in <span style="font-style:italic">Brooks </span>and the numerous earlier authorities to which I have referred as to the wide meaning to be given to the word “settlement” under section 24(1)(c) of the 1973 Act, it would be remarkable if the word ‘settlement’ had a narrower meaning for the purposes of the 1973 Act than it did for the purposes of the 1925 Act. And since both the 1882 Act and the 1925 Act provide that “settlement” includes not just that which is settled, but that which is retained by the settlor or reverts to him, it follows, she says, that when a settlement comes into being for the purposes of the 1973 Act, the ‘settled property’ includes not only any interest created in favour of the beneficiary, but also any interest retained by or reverting to the settlor. </p>

If so, then the Company, she says, holds the entirety of its interest in the property or properties on trust for the husband and the wife with remainder to itself (and indirectly to its shareholders), the trust thus defined being one which I have power to vary under section 24(1)(c) of the 1973 Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context one has to bear in mind the purpose and scheme of the 1882 Act and of its replacement, the 1925 Act: see <span style="font-style:italic">Megarry and Wade</span>, The Law of Real Property, ed 5, pages 317, 343. The 1882 Act marked a decisive break with the past, its purpose being essentially economic and its object, in pursuit of its economic aims, being to liberate settled land from the legal restrictions on alienation which often made good management impossible. The method adopted to achieve this object was to give the tenant for life under the settlement not merely full powers of management but also wide powers to sell or otherwise deal with the land, free from the trusts of the settlement and without the consent of the other beneficiaries, as if he were the owner in fee simple (the settlement, and with it the rights of the beneficiaries, being shifted from the land to its proceeds of sale). Much of the detail of the legislation was therefore directed to a variety of conveyancing devices designed to give the tenant for life the powers of a full owner. Section 1(4) has to be read in this context and, read in this context, its purpose and meaning is clear: it was simply to bring within the settlement, as defined by section 1(1) of the 1925 Act, the specific interests referred to in section 1(4) so that the tenant for life, in accordance with the general scheme of the legislation, would be able to sell the land free of those interests. In other words, section 1(4) is no more than a conveyancing device inserted to ensure that the statutory scheme operates notwithstanding that the settlor retains an interest in the settled land. Viewed in this light it can readily be seen that section 1(4) is needed because, and only because, of the particular scheme of the 1925 Act and why it is therefore expressed as applying “for the purposes of” the 1925 Act. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, and in any event, the 1925 Act, as Miss Evans-Gordon correctly points out, simply has no application in the case postulated by Miss Parker. Section 1(1) of the 1925 Act defines what is meant by a settlement for the purposes of the Act (section 2 going on to provide that the land subject to the settlement is “settled land”). Family charges under section 1(1)(v) apart, there is no settlement for this purpose unless land is “limited in trust” either for an infant or for successive interests: see the definitions in sections 1(1)(i), (ii) and (iii). In the present case, nothing is limited in trust and there are no successive interests within the meaning of section 1; one is here, as it were, in the realm of the law of landlord and tenant, not that of settled land. As Miss Evans-Gordon puts it, the argument is based on a confusion between interests in reversion or remainder under trusts (whether of land or personalty) and a landlord’s reversion to a lease. Put another way, the creation of a lease, or the granting of a licence, does not give rise to any trust or settlement, let alone a settlement within the meaning of the 1925 Act. And for good measure Miss Evans-Gordon adds that a terminable licence to occupy does not create an estate in land (see <span style="font-style:italic">Street v Mountford </span>[1985] AC 809 at page 814) and therefore cannot be the subject of a settlement within the meaning of the 1925 Act.</p>

This being so, she submits – the point of course being directed to 57 Forest House rather than to 17 Kensington Heights – that it would be irrelevant, even if the fact, that the wife had never occupied the property or never even been there.</p>

So the fact that the husband and the other shareholders may have been permitted to use the Properties is, she says, neither here nor there when the use is attributable to their status as shareholders. As she puts it, the husband had the same ‘right’ as the children, no more and no less, to occupy the Properties and he, like they, did so <span style="font-style:italic">qua </span>shareholder. And the fact of the wife’s marriage to a shareholder and her consequent occupation of 17 Kensington Heights cannot of itself turn company property into a nuptial settlement. The settlor’s intention or purpose must, she says, be relevant, so a settlement cannot simply be the accidental consequence of something done for other reasons – here, permitting a shareholder and his wife to occupy company property from time to time. Moreover, as she correctly submits, the requirement that the settlement make “continuing provision” for the parties means that there must be something more than the fleeting or the temporary.</p>

Even on the wife’s own evidence it was never on any sensible meaning of the phrase a matrimonial home and whatever use she and the husband may have made of it was temporary and fleeting. Moreover, the property was also used from time to time by the adult children, a circumstance hardly consistent, she says, with it being either the wife’s matrimonial home or with it being the subject of a nuptial settlement. The only remotely plausible case, she says, is in relation to 17 Kensington Heights following the events of 2000, but even there, she says, the Company never committed itself to any arrangement sufficiently indefinite and prolonged as to satisfy the “continuing provision” test or to any arrangement having the necessary matrimonial character. At most, she says, expressing the arrangement in the language of landlord and tenant, there was a licence or tenancy revocable at will or on (short) reasonable notice. There was certainly nothing equivalent to a life interest, something – lifetime provision – which, as she correctly points out, the children would never have agreed to. </p>

Such use as was ever made of this property by the husband and/or the wife lacked both of the two essential ingredients. It was too temporary and fleeting to constitute the necessary “continuing provision” and it was not nuptial in character. Insofar as the husband and/or the wife ever used the property it was use, in common with the children, in or derived from the husband’s status as a shareholder; nothing more and nothing less. (And I might add that even if there was a settlement, the settled property would amount to no more than a revocable licence.)</p>

It is clear, in my judgment, that they were far from happy with the idea that the wife should be living in the property, and they seem to have made it plain to the husband that they expected him to sort the problem out – the phrase is mine but the sentiment was theirs – and that, in the meantime, they would expect him to be responsible for the outgoings. But, whatever their feelings, the fact as I see it is that they were prepared to go along with the wife occupying 17 Kensington Heights for an undefined time which was always going to be more than a few weeks or months and which, in the event (and seemingly without their objection) had lasted for some four years before the marriage finally broke down in July 2004.    </p>

The arrangement which the children went along with, and as described by Mrs Penny, had, in my judgment, a sufficient nuptial element – the provision of the (married) wife’s home in this country – and was also intended to make continuing provision for that purpose throughout an undefined period, likely to be measured in at least months, and in the event measured in years, which was more than temporary, fleeting or transient.</p>

To paraphrase the words which Gorell Barnes J used in <span style="font-style:italic">Dormer v Ward</span> and which the Vaughan Williams LJ endorsed, it is an extraordinary proposition that because the owner of Blackacre has granted a married couple some revocable licence or tenancy to occupy, this court should have power to deal with the fee simple (or, as here, a long leasehold). Everything will, of course, depend upon the facts of the particular case. In some cases the facts will show that what has been created is an interest analogous to a life interest (or even successive life interests) or to a term of years certain. In some cases (and the present is one such case, in my judgment) the interest created, although sufficiently enduring to satisfy the criterion of making “continuing provision”, will be analogous to a licence or tenancy determinable either at will or on notice. It is all a matter of fact. In the present case, the facts, in my judgment, although establishing a sufficient degree of continuity to bring section 24(1)(c) into play, do not point in the direction of a life interest (let alone any greater interest); they point quite clearly, as it seems to me, in the direction of an interest analogous to a licence determinable on reasonable notice.</p>

He brought into the settlement reversions that were substantially all that he possessed; he now has, apart from these funds, no expectations and very little property; if, as seems likely in view of his age, he remarries, he has extremely little to settle on any future wife or children. If I refuse his request and devote exclusively to this child all the money that came from him, allowing none of it to go to any future wife or child of his, it may quite reasonably give him a feeling of injustice and impair the satisfactory relationship between father and child, a relationship of whose existence his generous dealing with the question of her maintenance gives some indication. Moreover, in the eyes of fair-minded members of the family, or friends, and of the child herself when she grows up, such an order will probably seem unjust and an excessive preference of the child’s interests to those of her father. To produce this result would cause a loss to the child which the retention of the money would not compensate. To produce a happier result by the surrender of some part of the husband’s fund would, in my view, be a benefit to the child. There may be cases where financial stringency might compel one to disregard such a benefit, owing to the necessity of keeping every available penny for the child, but this is not such a case.”</p>

In my judgment, moreover, it is upon that basis that in this case any proposed variation of the marriage settlement should be weighed: namely, that if and in so far as it would affect the interests of the child, it should be permitted only if, after taking into account all the terms of the intended order, all monetary considerations and any other relevant factors, however intangible, it can be said, on the while, to be for their benefit or, at least, not to their disadvantage.”</p>

Any loss to them is to be found in the reduction of the capital of the trust-fund by £20,000. Against that, however, they would have gained financially – by the discharge of the respondent’s contingent life interest in the trust-fund after their mother’s death – a gain which it is impossible now to quantify in monetary terms but which could be considerable if by some mischance she were to die while relatively young. In addition, when considering the financial background of the parties, the standard of life that they and the children have been accustomed to, and that the children will undoubtedly continue to enjoy while living with the petitioner, I am of the opinion that it is of importance to the children, to their enjoyment of their father’s company and of their visits to him, as well as to the maintenance of good relations between them, that he too should have a settled and secure home to which they can come. In my view, moreover, that is unlikely to be achieved unless he receives such a capital sum as that now proposed.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the basis of my findings thus far, the only question, as I have said, is, as it were, to determine the period of notice to which the wife is entitled if the Company decides to have her removed from 17 Kensington Heights. Having regard to all the circumstances, and in particular the fact that the property had been the wife’s home for some four years when the marriage finally broke down and for well over five years before the Company took steps to regain possession, but also the fact that that was over two years ago, it seems to me that justice will be done all round if I say that the wife is entitled to not less than six months’ notice from the date when my order is finalised. That will give her adequate time to reorganise her affairs and seek alternative accommodation if in the meantime she is not able to buy out the Company’s interest – in substance, the children’s interests – in the property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That is also the order I would make even if Miss Parker had been able to persuade me that the court’s powers extended to the Company’s entire interest in 17 Kensington Heights. At the end of the day, the fact remains, in my judgment, that all the Company (or the children) ever intended to part with when the wife was permitted to remain in the property was an interest in the nature of a revocable licence. That being so, what basis would there be, either in fairness or in justice, to give the wife a greater interest? There can, in my judgment, be only one answer to that question. Why should the Company be deprived of its property to meet the ancillary relief claims of the wife of one of its shareholders? Why should the children be deprived of part of what is, in effect, their inheritance to meet the wife’s claims? It is not the responsibility of the children to look after their step-mother or to provide for her ancillary relief. That is the responsibility of the husband, and the husband alone. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What benefit would it be to the Company or the children to make such provision at their expense? None has been suggested. There is none, whether one looks for pecuniary benefit or for some form of non-pecuniary benefit. The circumstances are far removed indeed from any of the cases to which I have been referred. The court may have a general and unfettered discretion, as between husband and wife, to re-arrange what can conveniently be referred to as the ‘family assets’. There is no such general jurisdiction to take away – in plain language to confiscate – the children’s property, let alone the step-children’s property, to meet claims brought by a wife, as here, only because the person to whom she would normally be expected to look – the husband – has so arranged his affairs as to frustrate her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When all is said and done, the statutory jurisdiction is a jurisdiction to “vary”, not a jurisdiction to confiscate, and what Miss Parker is inviting me to do is far outside any legitimate exercise of the jurisdiction. As anyone who has studied the case-law under section 24(1)(c) will appreciate, just as will anyone familiar with the various jurisdictions to vary trusts exercisable by the Chancery Division, ‘benefit’ is a wide and elastic concept. And ‘benefit’ can be found in circumstances which would leave the untutored layman puzzled or even astonished. But however far one can legitimately take the concept, it is quite impossible, in my judgment, to see any benefit to the children in what is proposed here by Miss Parker. And even assuming (without deciding) that there is no absolute requirement to show ‘benefit’ to the other parties when varying a settlement under section 24(1)(c), there must be a limit to what the court can properly do. That limit, in my judgment, is defined at its extremity by consideration of what is just and fair. What Miss Parker proposes is, with all respect to her, neither just nor fair.</p>

She submits, however, that there would be power in the court to vary the settlement in such a way as to require the Company to pay the mortgage and other outgoings (relying for this purpose on the older authorities, <span style="font-style:italic">Hargreaves </span>being an example, where the court required the trustees of the settlement to provide a spouse with an annual income), whilst recognising the practicality that the court would in all probability have only limited ability to enforce such an order, bearing in mind the nature and extent of the Company’s assets and the extreme unlikelihood that either the husband or any of the children would put it in funds. Indeed, and Miss Parker makes no bones about it, it is for this very reason that the wife says that the only effective remedy would be a transfer to her of the property free from any trusts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Evans-Gordon for her part submits that any legitimate variation could not require the introduction of new property from outside the settlement as would be necessary to pay the mortgage and other outgoings. I agree. The present case is quite different in this respect from <span style="font-style:italic">Hargreaves</span>. It is one thing to direct the trustees to pay income from the settled property; it is a very different thing indeed to direct trustees to pay income otherwise than from the settled property – and that, in reality, is what is proposed here. As Miss Evans-Gordon says, a court will never require trustees to pay out monies when there are no monies in the trust. She accepts that the court’s powers under section 24(1)(c) are, as she puts it, extraordinary, but not so extraordinary that they bite on the genuine property interests of third parties which were always owned or held outside a nuptial settlement. And where, she asks rhetorically, if not from such third party interests is the money to pay the mortgage to come from? Miss Evans-Gordon puts the point succinctly but accurately: The court should not treat the husband, the Company and the children as if they were one and the same; so far as concerns the wife’s claim for ancillary relief both the Company and the children are innocent third parties with pre-existing vested interests which should not be prejudiced; and the wife is not entitled to receive further monies or property from either the Company or the children.</p>

But that is no reason for making an unprincipled award for her benefit at the expense of either the Company or the children. She is entitled, for the reasons I have given, to occupy 17 Kensington Heights on the basis I have described, but subject to the Company’s right to give her notice to go. But that is all she is entitled to. There is, in my judgment, no principled basis for requiring the Company to pay the mortgage or other outgoings. That, as I have said, was always envisaged as being the responsibility of the husband. But if he fails to honour his obligations, as he has and as, no doubt, he will, that is no reason for foisting some corresponding burden on either the Company or the children.</p>

The one point on which she has succeeded is in establishing that the Company cannot remove her from 17 Kensington Heights without giving her notice. But subject only to that qualification, the Company and the children are entitled to the relief sought by them in the Chancery proceedings.</p>

And if that is so then, as Miss Evans-Gordon points out, the wife is liable in accordance with section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 to be tried as a principal offender whether or not the husband is convicted. Moreover, as Miss Parker also accepted, someone in the wife’s position may be guilty of offences under sections 3(1) and 5 of the Perjury Act 1911. </p>

The facts for present purposes are straight forward and, somewhat simplified, can be summarised as follows: The applicant for ancillary relief (the respondent in the suit) was still married to his wife, a fact of which the petitioner ‘wife’ was aware at the time of the ceremony. The ‘marriage’ was accordingly bigamous, the applicant being guilty of an offence under section 57 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and the petitioner being guilty as a secondary party to the principal offence. Mr Stephen Bellamy QC (sitting as Deputy High Court Judge) held (see at paras [7], [9]) that the applicant ‘husband’ was debarred from applying for ancillary relief despite the fact that the ‘wife’ was a prominent party to the illegality, having engineered the ‘marriage’ with full knowledge of his status and thus effectively inducing the bigamous marriage.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“I would seek to explain my approach as follows. (1) In all the relevant sections of the Act of 1973 dealing with ancillary relief all decrees of nullity appear to be treated in the same way. (2) Section 25 of the Act of 1973 requires the court when exercising its powers under section 23 or 24 to take account of all the circumstances of the case. This requirement suggests that the scope for the trial of a preliminary issue is very limited. (3) The principle of public policy which can be invoked to bar a claim depends on the establishment of a “serious” crime by the claimant. In many cases, as it seems to me, a decision as to whether or not a particular crime has crossed the threshold of seriousness may involve an investigation of all the circumstances, including the effect on the other party and any mitigating factors which may reduce the degree of blame. In a case concerning a transsexual in particular such an investigation may require detailed consideration of the medical treatment and advice which the applicant received over a period. (4) I have not been persuaded that in a case which involves the exercise of the court’s discretion it is necessary or desirable to carry out a preliminary inquiry to determine one aspect of an applicant’s conduct before the general merits of the claim are investigated. As I have already indicated, crimes may vary to an almost infinite degree in their seriousness. This is particularly true of offences under the Perjury Act 1911. (5) Though it is clear from the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Tinsley v Milligan</span> [1994] 1 AC 340 that where considerations of public policy intervene to prevent the enforcement of rights claimed under an illegal contract the court is precluded from carrying out a balancing operation, the situation appears to me to be different where parliament itself has conferred a discretion on the court and has included a requirement that the court in exercising that discretion should consider all the circumstances of the case. </p>

Miss Parker has to accept that, as she puts it, the wife did not emerge from the hearing wholly without blame or criticism, but she points out that Bennett J found that it was the husband who was the driving force behind the deception, found that the husband had procured the wife’s own sister to give false evidence against her and held that his “attempt to heap blame on her” was “only done to enable him to obtain a significant, perhaps decisive, advantage in ancillary relief proceedings.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the essential factors in the present case – every case is unique and, as Sir Brian Neill made clear, one has to have regard to all the circumstances of the particular case – can be summarised as follows: both parties were aware that their civil (English) marriage was bigamous, both went into it with their eyes open, neither was the victim of any deception or overbearing conduct, and there is little to choose between them in terms of criminal, social or moral ‘guilt’, save to the limited extent indicated by Bennett J. An important ‘’mitigating factor’, to adopt an expression used by Sir Brian Neill, is that the parties’ contemporaneous religious marriage, which was obviously a matter of importance for each of them, was valid. So, whatever view the law of England may take, in their own eyes and in the eyes of their god, the husband and the wife were indeed just that – husband and wife.</p>

There is, in my judgment, nothing here to justify either depriving the wife of all relief or stripping her of the major part of what she would otherwise be entitled to. In this particular case – I stress that every case is unique and that in other cases the outcome may be very different – the impact of the bigamy is marginal.</p>

She has not worked as a landscape architect since 1998 and fears that her skills in this area are now outdated so that it would, she thinks, be impossible for her to return to this type of work at this stage even if she wanted to. Since the parties’ separation in 2004 she has undertaken some part time work, though her last employment (as a receptionist) was in 2006. In October 2005 she had to sell her jewellery (given to her by the husband) to raise £20,000 for the payment of her legal costs. She is at present unemployed, existing on job seekers allowance of £59.15 per week and borrowing from family and friends. She is heavily in debt, her debts, excluding the substantial legal costs to which I have already referred, amounting to some £63,000. Previously she had been funding this litigation out of her own pocket but since September 2006 has been in receipt of public funding. As she sees it, the reality is that her future ability to generate income will arise from her access to such capital resources as she manages to obtain as a result of this litigation. </p>

Neither may have been as opulent and magnificent as Miss Parker would have me accept, but that does not, in my judgment, affect the outcome. Essentially, as I have indicated, the wife seeks a ‘Duxbury’ fund capitalised at £2,804,689 and based on an annual budget of £113,326 and a ‘housing fund’ to provide a house in London at a cost of £2,250,000 and a house in Saudi Arabia at a cost of £1,000,000. Neither, in my judgment, is at all extravagant in the circumstances. Both are easily justified on the basis of ‘needs’ generously interpreted, as also is the remaining part of the award which the wife seeks. The wife needs to have her debts paid if she is to be put back on her feet, just as she needs the costs of sensible re-training to be provided for her. She needs furniture and cars and, in the particular circumstances of this case, not least given the findings I have made as to the husband’s litigation misconduct, she needs a ‘fighting fund’. </p>

Be that as it may, I am satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the fact that the ‘marriage’ was bigamous, the award sought by the wife is, in the light of my findings, entirely justified.

I am not in a position to find that the loan account stands at the figure of £684,580 or, indeed, at any other sum. What in fact the Company owes the husband is a matter to be determined if necessary on some future occasion. I will, if need be, hear further argument on the precise way in which my order should be expressed to cover this point.
