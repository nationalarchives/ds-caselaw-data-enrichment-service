	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the morning of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, when she was supposed to be leaving for a skiing holiday, M, then aged forty-three, was found by her partner S in a drowsy and confused condition.  She was taken to hospital where she soon fell into a coma.  It was discovered that she had suffered viral encephalitis which left her with extensive and irreparable brain damage.  Ever since, she has been wholly dependent on others for her care, and since April 2003 fed artificially via a gastrostomy tube.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">When M emerged from the coma, the doctors diagnosed that she was in a vegetative state.  After several years of exploring all options in the hope that she would recover consciousness, members of her family decided, with the support of the treating doctors, to apply for a court order authorising the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration.  On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2007, in accordance with the procedure then in force, an application was made to the Family Division under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court seeking a declaration that M lacks capacity to make decisions as to future medical treatment (which has never been in dispute) and a further declaration that the doctors may lawfully discontinue and withhold all life-sustaining treatment including artificial nutrition and hydration.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the course of subsequent investigations for the purposes of the application, however, it was discovered that M was in fact not in a vegetative state but rather in what is called a minimally conscious state. A patient in this condition is above the vegetative state and is aware to some extent of herself and her environment but does not have full consciousness.  After extensive further investigation, however, M’s family decided to proceed with the court application, which ultimately came before me in July 2011 sitting in the new Court of Protection, to which the jurisdiction to hear such applications had been transferred by the Mental Capacity Act 2005.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Any decision made under the Mental Capacity Act for a person who lacks capacity must be made in her best interests.  The law requires the court to identify those factors which are relevant to the person’s best interests and carry out a balancing exercise weighing up the factors on each side of the issue.  This approach is well established in cases involving medical treatment. This is, however, the first time in this country that a court has been asked to authorise the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration from a patient in a minimally conscious state. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The hearing before me lasted ten days. I heard evidence from B and S who spoke movingly about M and contrasted her previous life with her current circumstances. They told me about things that M had said before her collapse which, they maintain, demonstrated that she would not want to be kept alive in this condition. I also heard evidence from a number of members of the dedicated team of professional care staff, skills workers and physiotherapists who look after M in her present nursing home. They portrayed her life in much more positive terms that those used by members of her family.  I heard evidence from Helen Gill-Thwaites, a specialist occupational therapist who has developed a widely-used and internationally-respected assessment technique known as the “SMART”, and who applied that technique to M on two occasions to assist in the diagnosis of her level of consciousness. Finally, I heard from </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">two leading experts in neuro-rehabilitation – Mr. Derar Badwan and Professor Lynne Turner-Stokes – who expressed contrasting opinions on M’s level of consciousness, and also on the ultimate question whether it is now in M’s best interests for ANH to be withdrawn. </p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph>
	  <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:auto;margin-left:0.50in">6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The case put forward on behalf of M’s family is based substantially on what they say were, and still are, M’s wishes and feelings.  The law rightly requires the court to take into account M’s wishes and feelings when determining her best interests.  Importantly, however, M did not make any formal advance decision that she wanted artificial nutrition and hydration to be withdrawn in the circumstances that now exist.  Had she done so, under the law that existed in 2003, the court would have abided by that advance decision.  Under the new Mental Capacity Act, there is now a statutory procedure for making advance decisions, protected by stringent safeguards and formalities.  If those safeguards and formalities are satisfied, the advance decision is binding.  In this case, the various statements made by M prior to her illness in 2003 were informal, and not specifically addressed to the question I have to decide.  Accordingly, whilst I take those statements into account, they are not binding and in all the circumstances I do not consider they carry substantial weight in my decision.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The factor which does carry substantial weight, in my judgment, is the preservation of life.  Although not an absolute rule, the law regards the preservation of life as a fundamental principle.  As another judge has said: “there is a very strong presumption in favour of taking all steps which will prolong life and, save in exceptional circumstances, or where the person is dying, the best interests of the patient will normally require such steps to be taken”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">M does experience pain and discomfort, and her disability severely restricts what she can do.  Having considered all the evidence, however, I find that she does have some positive experiences and importantly that there is a reasonable prospect that those experiences can be extended by a planned programme of increased stimulation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Having weighed up all the relevant facts, I conclude that it is not in M’s best interests for artificial nutrition and hydration to be withdrawn and I therefore refuse the application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, however, agreed that the existing “Do Not Resuscitate” order should be continued.  I conclude that other treatment decisions should be left to the clinicians to determine in consultation with M’s family.  I will in due course hear further submissions about the details of M’s future care plan. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I realise that this decision will be a severe disappointment to members of M’s family who have endured years of anguish during which they have demonstrated their deep devotion to M. I hope it would be of some comfort to the family that M will continue to be looked after in her current nursing home, which I have visited during the course of the hearing.  All parties, including members of M’s family, agree that the care given to M at the nursing home is of the highest standard.  I urge everyone concerned with M – doctors, care staff, and her family – to work together to agree a revised care plan which gives her an opportunity of more positive experiences.   </p>

Until her illness, she had always lived in the same town in the north of England where other members of her family still reside.  She has two siblings, a brother, some ten years older than she, and a sister, B, to whom she has always been very close.  After their parents were divorced, M and B were looked after by their mother, W.  When they left school, both M and B became hairdressers and worked together for a number of years before B left the salon to look after her two small children.  </p>

They lived together in the same town in a succession of properties, latterly in a house owned in their joint names.  Although they never married, nor had any children, M and S were clearly in a very close, loving, stable and permanent relationship. </p>

The following morning, S was surprised that M, contrary to her usual habit of rising early, was still in bed when he woke.  She was drowsy and confused, and he therefore telephoned NHS Direct who ordered an ambulance to attend at the property.  M was admitted to hospital where her condition quickly deteriorated so that within a short space of time she was in a coma.  The doctors diagnosed that she had suffered from viral brain stem encephalitis, although no cause of the virus was ever identified.  She remained in a coma for some weeks and although she recovered consciousness, it became apparent that she had suffered extensive, irreparable and devastating brain damage.  Since April 2003, M has been fed and hydrated via a gastrostomy tube. She remains totally dependent on others for all aspects of her basic daily care. She is immobile and has limited head and trunk control. She is doubly incontinent. She has flexion contractures in the elbows, hips, knees and Achilles tendon. She is moved by hoist for all transfers. </p>

For some time she suffered from facial twitching and epilepsy, but these symptoms gradually decreased and had settled by 2006.  She remained in that hospital for over four years.  During that time there were many conversations between the doctors treating her and members of her family, principally S, B and W.  From an early stage the consensus of medical opinion was that there was no realistic prospect that any improvement could be achieved in M’s condition.  For some time, the family members, in particular S, fought hard to ensure that every possible attempt was made to identify processes of rehabilitation which might bring about some improvement.  Despite these efforts, there was at that stage no discernable sign of any change.  Dr W, the consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the hospital responsible for treating her, expressed the view that M had suffered irretrievable and severe brain damage, that she was unlikely to improve and that she had reached the stage where she should be cared for in the community with appropriate nursing support and help.   </p>

The family and the NHS Hospital Trust therefore instructed Professor Keith Andrews, then Consultant Physician and Director of the Institute of Neuro-palliative Rehabilitation, to carry out an assessment, first, as to M’s diagnosis and in particular whether or not she was in a permanent vegetative state, and, secondly, as to whether it was appropriate to discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration.  Professor Andrews reached the conclusion that M was clinically in the vegetative state and had been so for at least three years at the time of his report.  Although members of staff at the hospital noted occasional responses, such observations were isolated and amounted to “inconsistent islands of function” which would still fit within the criteria of the vegetative state.  In the view of Professor Andrews, further investigations would add nothing to the clinical knowledge already available regarding the extent of her brain damage.  He formed the view that there was no clinical reason why life-sustaining treatment should not be discontinued.   </p>

As it pre-dated the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and the introduction of the new Court of Protection, the application, dated 16 January 2007, was filed under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Family Division.  On 23 January 2007, Sumner J made a declaration that M lacked capacity to conduct her own affairs, to litigate, and to make decisions regarding her medical treatment.  Further directions were given, including an order appointing the Official Solicitor to act as litigation friend for M, and granting permission to him to instruct an expert witness.   </p>

His first report in these proceedings is dated 10 April 2007.  He noted that M’s medical records appeared to disclose repeated occurrences in which she responded to command.  He expressed the view that those responses, taken in isolation, would be of limited significance, but considered together they constituted what Mr Badwan described as “a repeated and reproducible, but inconsistent response to command”. He concluded that, whilst there was some evidence that M would meet the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of vegetative state, there were doubts about the diagnosis that suggested it remained possible that she was in fact in a condition above the vegetative state generally known (since the publication of a research paper in the United States in 2002, as to which see below) as the “minimally conscious state”.   </p>

During the last fifteen years, a number of assessment techniques have been developed in several countries, including the “Sensory Modality Assessment and Rehabilitation Technique”, generally known, and hereafter referred to, as “SMART”, developed initially in this country by Helen Gill-Thwaites, an occupational therapist specialising in acquired brain injury. The SMART assessment is widely recognised here and abroad, and has been professionally validated as a method of diagnosing the level of awareness and consciousness in a patient with profound brain damage. Mr. Badwan recommended that M should undergo a SMART assessment in order to settle any doubts about the diagnosis.  After discussion with Mr Badwan, Professor Andrews changed his mind.  In a letter to solicitors acting for the family, after talking to Mr Badwan, Professor Andrews wrote that he and Mr Badwan, “both agreed that M </p>

The SMART assessment was carried out by Miss Helen Gill-Thwaites herself over a three-week period in June 2007, and her findings and recommendations were set out in a report dated 28 June.  Miss Gill-Thwaites found that M’s responses were incompatible with the diagnosis of vegetative state but rather that, based on the results of the SMART assessments the likely diagnosis was of at least a minimally conscious state.  Amongst the most striking observations made in the course of this SMART assessment was that M demonstrated a repeated ability to obey commands, notably when asked to press a buzzer switch. Miss Gill-Thwaites recommended that M undergo a specifically designed SMART treatment programme to explore whether her quality of life could be further developed and, in particular, whether she could be assisted to communicate.   </p>

In the light of the SMART assessment, they advised that M was in a minimally conscious state, but added that there was a possibility that she was in fact at a higher level of function than she was at that time demonstrating.  They supported the proposal that M undergo a special treatment programme prior to reassessment by Miss Gill-Thwaites.  In a separate report dated at this time, Mr Badwan reiterated his view that M was not in a vegetative state but that rather her level of awareness was consistent with at least upper levels of minimally conscious state.  He noted that for any person to be able to respond to a verbal command (1) she must hear such commands; (2) she must understand the contents of the command i.e  be able to process the information and (3) be able to activate areas of the brain selectively in order to perform the act or command requested.  He observed that the ability to obey a verbal command on repeated occasions is inconsistent with a diagnosis of vegetative state. He concluded that up to that point, she had not received appropriate rehabilitation and that it was not in her best interests to remain at her present hospital.  Professor Andrews agreed. Having observed the DVD taken during the first couple of SMART assessment, he wrote a letter to the Official Solicitor noting specific responses which he considered of particular importance namely the obedience to command and in particular the test using the buzzer.  About this, he observed: “she pressed the buzzer switch once and released on command.  She did this on several occasions.  It is of note that she released immediately whereas many severely brain-damaged people have difficulty in releasing”.  He reached this conclusion: </p>

Because of the lack of consistency and the inability to use them, as yet, for communication purposes, this places her in the diagnostic category of minimally conscious state – but at a moderate level of MCS.  I say moderate level to indicate that these are not simple responses but are indicating some sophistication in the response level… in summary, it is clear to me that she is NOT in the vegetative state.  Moreover, she is making responses at a level that must raise the possibility that she will eventually be able to communicate.  In view of this, it is my opinion that she requires the opportunity of access to a team very experienced in the assessment on management of people with this level of profound neurological disability.” </p>

In order to advance that proposal, a “best interests” meeting took place on 7 June 2010 attended by care staff, family members and the parties’ legal representatives.  It was the firm view of the family members, in particular S and B, that they did not support the recommendation that M be taken into the community to test her responsiveness.

As she had shown a number of behaviours, Dr Badwan concluded that he did not consider that she was near the border between minimally conscious state and vegetative state but, rather, at a higher level. He added in his view, her life expectancy was at least a further ten years. He assessed that “her present quality of life is reasonable and could be further improved taking into account recommendations made for future management”. He recommended that, in order to improve her quality of life, she should be encouraged to watch television, listen to music and look at magazines.

When the matter was put before me on paper, I was concerned that there should be no further delay in these proceedings which had already lasted nearly four years and therefore directed a telephone hearing take place at which I declined to order the vacation of the July listing and instead directed the parties to identify appropriate hearing dates which would be convenient for all experts and witnesses.  It subsequently transpired that it would be possible for second SMART assessment to be completed and evaluated before July, and for the experts and other witnesses to attend, and the hearing has therefore gone ahead as scheduled.  Meanwhile, at a further directions hearing in April, I directed that the parties were jointly to instruct Miss Gill-Thwaites to undertake the further SMART assessment of M at the care home between 3 May and 3 June 2011, to prepare a report on the results of the assessment by 9 June, and that, following the receipt of that report, the two medical experts should discuss and prepare a joint statement identifying all matters in which they agree or disagree.   </p>

An order was made on that occasion in April, but following objections by the press, a further hearing was convened on 12 May at which I relaxed some of the restrictions and made an order, which remains in force, and has the effect of prohibiting, for the duration of M’s lifetime or until further order, (a) the publication or broadcasting of any information likely to lead to the identification of M, the current and former parties to the proceedings, witnesses, current and past healthcare professionals  and members of M’s care team referred to in the proceedings, the care home where M resides, and any address or location referred to in the proceedings, save that the location may be stated to be the “north of England” and (b) any person bound by the order from (i) communicating with M, V, W or S; (ii) approaching within twenty metres of M; (iii) approaching within fifty metres of the care home for the purpose of seeking information about M and/or these proceedings; and (iv) taking any photograph of M, W, B or S.  The reasons for my decision to make a reporting restriction order, and the full terms of the order, are set out in a judgment reported at [2011] EWHC 1197 (COP). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Applicant’s case in summary is as follows.  Medical science has developed from the 1990s when the concept of persistent or permanent vegetative state (originally “PVS” but now more commonly “VS”) was first considered in the English courts. Since then medical science has recognised the concept of the minimally conscious state (“MCS”), which is a state just above that of vegetative state, but which also involves extremely significant limitations on consciousness with a quality of life that many would find impossible to accept were they able to consistently express themselves with full competence. The court has jurisdiction to decide what treatment patients in a minimally conscious state should receive. The issue in this case is whether M continuing to have medical treatment in the form of ANH is truly in her best interests, as defined in s.4 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (“MCA”).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is however a difference between VS and MCS cases. In VS cases, the balance falls in one direction in every case – in favour of withdrawal. In MCS cases, it depends on the facts, and the expert evidence, in the particular case. In assessing where the patient’s best interests lie, the court must follow a “balance-sheet” approach. The Applicant does not contend that all those in MCS result in the balance of best interests to be in favour of withdrawal – simply that in some individual cases, after meticulous consideration of all of the factors for and against – that might be the most humane course and in the individual’s best interests. In this case it is important that the factors for and against withdrawing treatment are carefully examined and weighed in the balance, after mature reflection. The proper assessment of best interests in this context requires great weight to be given to M’s wishes and feelings and those of her family, past and present. The interpretation of evidence as to M’s behaviour is best performed by the neuro-rehabilitative experts, in particular Professor Turner-Stokes who concludes that M’s experiences are predominantly negative. Accordingly, given M’s clearly expressed views and paying particular attention to the type of person M was when fully sentient, it is in M’s best interests for ANH to be withdrawn, and for her to be permitted to die with dignity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In reply, the Official Solicitor’s submissions on behalf of M can be summarised as follows. He accepts that, where a person is in the MCS and <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> clinically stable, whether the withdrawal or withholding of life sustaining treatment is in that person’s best interests will depend on that person’s best interests under s.4 of MCA. Withdrawal and/or withholding of life sustaining treatment may or may not be lawful depending on the circumstances. However, where, as in M’s case, a person is in a MCS and is otherwise clinically stable, it can <span style="text-decoration:underline">never</span> be in that person’s best interests to withdraw and/or withhold life sustaining treatment including ANH. To withdraw and/or withhold life sustaining treatment in such circumstances is unlawful and, if done intentionally, amounts to unlawful killing and murder; it would amount to a breach of M’s rights under articles 2, 3 and 8 and (depending on the circumstances) 13 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“ECHR”). The Official Solicitor submits that, just as PVS cases do not involve a balance sheet analysis of best interests due to the specific and particular circumstances, cases involving people in a MCS who are clinically stable do not involve a balance sheet analysis of best interests, because of their particular and specific circumstances. He accepts that the Court under section 4 MCA must listen to and consider evidence from the family, clinicians and care staff. However, where a person is in a MCS and is otherwise clinically stable and well it can never be in their best interests, and therefore lawful to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment including ANH. </p>

The PCT notes the reports of staff that M can express emotion and appears at times to experience pleasure, for example in response to certain music or care home personnel. It does not appear to the PCT that M’s condition is such that her life has no positive aspects to weigh against the discomforts she may at times experience. The PCT notes the statements of M’s partner and sister that they believe her previous expressed views indicate that she would not have wished to continue to live as she does.  The PCT does not doubt the veracity of these accounts. However in the absence of any clear advance refusal of treatment or very clear and unambiguous exposition of the patient’s wishes in anticipation of the particular situation that has arisen, the PCT cannot take the family’s indication of M’s preference as a direction as to how it should decide upon commissioning her treatment in this case. Whilst some weight should be given under s.4 MCA to an incapable patient’s previous capable statements there is nothing in this case to indicate to the PCT that M made her previous statements with reference to the withdrawal of ANH from someone with consciousness. The PCT submits that the weight to be given to previous opinions expressed by M is in no way sufficient to tip the balance in favour of withdrawing of life sustaining measures in this case. </p>

The Aspen Group defined the diagnostic criteria for MCS, so as to distinguish it from VS, by “the presence of behaviours associated with conscious awareness. In MCS, cognitively mediated behaviour occurs inconsistently, but is reproducible or sustained long enough to be differentiated from reflexive behaviour.  The reproducibility of such evidence is affected by both the consistency and complexity of the behavioural response.  Extended assessment may be required to determine whether a simple response (e.g. finger movement or eye blink), that is observed infrequently is occurring in response to a specific environmental event (e.g. command to move fingers or blink eyes) or on a coincidental basis.  In contrast, a few observations of a complex response (intelligible verbalisation) may be sufficient to determine the presence of consciousness.” </p>

In cross-examination, she acknowledged that two research studies had demonstrated that some patients do emerge from MCS after periods measured in years: see Lammi et al (2005) “The minimally conscious state and recovery potential: a follow-up study 2 to 5 years after traumatic brain injury”, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 86: 746-754 – in which the authors concluded inter alia that “the low correlation coefficients between duration of MCS and the outcome measures suggest that prognostic statements based on length of time a person is in the MCS cannot be made with confidence” – and Luauté et al (2010) “Long-term outcomes of chronic minimally conscious and vegetative states”, Neurology 75: 246252. However, the prospects of anyone emerging from MCS after eight years are, in Professor Turner-Stokes’s view, remote, and there is nothing in either research paper to contradict that view. Indeed, the Luauté paper, whilst confirming that the potential for unfavourable outcomes was significantly greater in PVS than in MCS, also confirmed the “generally very poor functional prognosis of non-traumatic brain injury”. </p>

SMART assessors require formal training and accreditation.  The SMART is comprised of two components – the formal component, conducted by the SMART assessor including the SMART sensory assessment and the SMART behavioural observational assessment, and an informal component consisting of information from family and carers regarding observed behaviours and pre-morbid interests likes and dislikes.  The SMART behavioural observation assessment is carried out during a ten-minute quiet period prior to commencing the SMART sensory assessment in which the assessor observes and becomes familiar with the patient’s reflexive, spontaneous and purposeful behaviour. The SMART formal assessment is conducted in ten sessions within a three week period with an equal number of sessions in the morning and the afternoon.  Within the SMART sensory assessment, there are eight SMART modalities, including five sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory and gustatory) and three other modalities (motor function, function communication and wakefulness).  The assessment consists of twenty-nine standardised SMART techniques, offering a range of stimuli such as assessment of response to visual threat, response to light, touch and taste, visual tracking and following specific written instructions.  The SMART five point hierarchical scale is consistent across all of the seven modalities.  The five levels are (1) no response (2) reflexive and generalised responses (3) withdrawal (e.g. turning head away) (4) localising (e.g. turning head or moving upper limbs towards stimuli) and (5) discriminating responses following visual or auditory commands or using objects appropriately.  A consistent response on five consecutive assessments at SMART level 5 in any of the five sensory modalities e.g. following verbal instructions, indicates a meaningful response.  These behaviours are inconsistent with VS and are indicative of MSC or higher levels of functioning. </p>

Experience has shown that some of the types of behaviour are in the wrong position in the hierarchy, which require adjustments to be made when analysing the results of the assessment. Mr. Badwan was more sceptical of the utility of the WHIM in assessing patients in MCS. I accept the view of Professor Turner-Stokes, however, that the WHIM will remain an important assessment tool, particularly when used in conjunction with the SMART and over time, especially at the higher levels of consciousness.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Turner-Stokes distinguished the use of SMART and WHIM as follows. The SMART is a very detailed systematic assessment under controlled stimulation delivered over three weeks by trained and accredited personnel. The WHIM is what Professor Turner-Stokes described as a broader tool designed to be used by any clinician in the course of interacting with the patient when they simply record types of behaviour they observe. It is relatively quick and easy to carry out and can be repeated by other clinicians. Professor Turner-Stokes described how this is particularly useful in MCS cases in which a feature of the condition is inconsistency of behaviour. The WHIM is very helpful in determining the amount of time the patient does and does not demonstrate a particular type of behaviour. Whereas the SMART is primarily designed to diagnose whether or not a patient is in a VS or a MCS, the WHIM, in Professor Turner-Stokes’ experience, (although not yet confirmed by published research), allows clinicians to track a patient’s progress through a MCS. Thus both tools play a very important part in the diagnosis and treatment of low awareness states. </p>

In the article by Seel and others cited above, it was reported that the Disorders of Consciousness Task Force, having carried out a systematic review of a number of behavioural assessment scales for disorders of consciousness, concluded that both the SMART and the WHIM demonstrated good content validity and contained items that could distinguish persons who are in a VS, in a MCS, or have emerged from MCS. It should be noted, however, that the authors of that research stated that there has been no validation study for detecting meaningful change along a continuum of disorders of consciousness, which confirms Professor Turner-Stokes’ evidence that the use of serial WHIM tests to track progress over time is “not yet in the literature”. </p>

Seel et al (supra) on behalf of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Disorders of Consciousness Task Force, note that “diagnostic errors in classifying persons in an MCS as being in a VS have been reported to range from 30% to 40% and can have adverse consequences for clinical treatment”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“[T]he fundamental principle is the principle of the sanctity of human life - a principle long recognised not only in our own society but also in most, if not all, civilised societies throughout the modern world, as is indeed evidenced by its recognition both in article 2 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd. 8969), and in article 6 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights 1966. But this principle, fundamental though it is, is not absolute. Indeed there are circumstances in which it is lawful to take another man's life, for example by a lawful act of self-defence …. [T]here is no absolute rule that the patient's life must be prolonged by such treatment or care, if available, regardless of the circumstances. First, it is established that the principle of self-determination requires that respect must be given to the wishes of the patient, so that if an adult patient of sound mind refuses, however unreasonably, to consent to treatment or care by which his life would or might be prolonged, the doctors responsible for his care must give effect to his wishes, even though they do not consider it to be in his best interests to do so …. To this extent, the principle of the sanctity of human life must yield to the principle of self-determination  …  and, for present purposes perhaps more important, the doctor's duty to act in the best interests of his patient must likewise be qualified …. Moreover the same principle applies where the patient's refusal to give his consent has been expressed at an earlier date, before he became unconscious or otherwise incapable of communicating it; though in such circumstances especial care may be necessary to ensure that the prior refusal of consent is still properly to be regarded as applicable in the circumstances which have subsequently occurred: see, e.g., <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">In re T. (Adult: Refusal of Treatment)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[1993] Fam 95 …. But in many cases not only may the patient be in no condition to be able to say whether or not he consents to the relevant treatment or care, but also he may have given no prior indication of his wishes with regard to it. In the case of a child who is a ward of court, the court itself will decide whether medical treatment should be provided in the child's best interests, taking into account medical opinion. But the court cannot give its consent on behalf of an adult patient who is incapable of himself deciding whether or not to consent to treatment. I am of the opinion that there is nevertheless no absolute obligation upon the doctor who has the patient in his care to prolong his life, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, it would be most startling, and could lead to the most adverse and cruel effects upon the patient, if any such absolute rule was held to exist. It is scarcely consistent with the primacy given to the principle of self-determination in those cases in which the patient of sound mind has declined to give his consent, that the law should provide no means of enabling treatment to be withheld in appropriate circumstances where the patient is in no condition to indicate, if that was his wish, that he did not consent to it.” (pp 863-5) 63.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Later, he continued:  </p>

In such circumstances, it is now established that a doctor may lawfully treat such a patient if he acts in his best interests, and indeed that, if the patient is already in his care, he is under a duty so to treat him: see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">In re F. (Mental</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Patient: Sterilisation)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[1990] AC 1, in which the legal principles governing treatment in such circumstances were stated by this House. For my part I can see no reason why, as a matter of principle, a decision by a doctor whether or not to initiate, or to continue to provide, treatment or care which could or might have the effect of prolonging such a patient's life, should not be governed by the same fundamental principle. Of course, in the great majority of cases, the best interests of the patient are likely to require that treatment of this kind, if available, should be given to a patient. But this may not always be so …. The doctor who is caring for such a patient cannot, in my opinion, be under an absolute obligation to prolong his life by any means available to him, regardless of the quality of the patient's life. Common humanity requires otherwise, as do medical ethics and good medical practice accepted in this country and overseas. As I see it, the doctor's decision whether or not to take any such step must (subject to his patient's ability to give or withhold his consent) be made in the best interests of the patient …. It is of course the development of modern medical technology, and in particular the development of life support systems, which has rendered cases such as the present so much more relevant than in the past. Even so, where (for example) a patient is brought into hospital in such a condition that, without the benefit of a life support system, he will not continue to live, the decision has to be made whether or not to give him that benefit, if available. That decision can only be made in the best interests of the patient. No doubt, his best interests will ordinarily require that he should be placed on a life support system as soon as necessary, if only to make an accurate assessment of his condition and a prognosis for the future. But if he neither recovers sufficiently to be taken off it nor dies, the question will ultimately arise whether he should be kept on it indefinitely. As I see it, that question (assuming the continued availability of the system) can only be answered by reference to the best interests of the patient himself, having regard to established medical practice. Indeed, if the justification for treating a patient who lacks the capacity to consent lies in the fact that the treatment is provided in his best interests, it must follow that the treatment may, and indeed ultimately should, be discontinued where it is no longer in his best interests to provide it.” (pp 866-867). </p>

In both classes of case, the decision whether or not to withhold treatment must be made in the best interests of the patient. In the first class, however, the decision has to be made by weighing the relevant considerations. For example, in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">In re J.

By contrast, in the latter class of case, of which the present case provides an example, there is in reality no weighing operation to be performed. Here the condition of the patient, who is totally unconscious and in whose condition there is no prospect of any improvement, is such that life-prolonging treatment is properly regarded as being, in medical terms, useless ….[F]or my part I cannot see that medical treatment is appropriate or requisite simply to prolong a patient's life, when such treatment has no therapeutic purpose of any kind, as where it is futile because the patient is unconscious and there is no prospect of any improvement in his condition. It is reasonable also that account should be taken of the invasiveness of the treatment and of the indignity to which, as the present case shows, a person has to be subjected if his life is prolonged by artificial means, which must cause considerable distress to his family - a distress which reflects not only their own feelings but their perception of the situation of their relative who is being kept alive. But in the end, in a case such as the present, it is the futility of the treatment which justifies its termination” (pp 868-9). </p>

The same principles must apply in either case when the question is asked whether the doctor in charge may lawfully discontinue the life-sustaining treatment or care; and if in either case the treatment is futile in the sense I have described, it can properly be concluded that it is no longer in the best interests of the patient to continue </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re D (Adult: Medical Treatment) </span>[1998] 1 FCR 498, Sir Stephen Brown held that it was not in the best interests of a patient to be kept alive by ANH who met most but not all of the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of PVS according to the 1996 guidelines produced by the Royal College of Physicians. All the medical expert witnesses were agreed, however, that the patient “had no degree of awareness whatsoever” and the President concluded that “all the evidence establishes, to my satisfaction, that there is no evidence of any meaningful life whatsoever”. He stated that he did not believe “that, if a declaration were to be granted in this case, it would be extending the range of cases in which a declaration might properly be considered” (page 508).

In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust v Wyatt</span> (supra), a case concerning a two-year-old child born fourteen weeks prematurely and suffering from chronic respiratory and kidney problems with profound brain damage, Hedley J at first instance, upheld by the Court of Appeal, made a series of declarations unlimited in time authorising doctors to withhold ventilation in the event that the child suffered an infection that led or might lead to a collapsed lung. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">An NHS Trust v MB (A Child)</span> [2006] EWHC 507 (Fam), [2006] 2 FLR 319, a case concerning an 18-month-old child suffering from a very severe and degenerating form of spinal muscular atrophy, who was being artificially ventilated and fed, was suffering pain and discomfort from associated medical procedures, and had a short life expectancy but was not in a PVS and was aware of his surroundings, Holman J, having carried out a comprehensive balancing exercise, refused an application on behalf of the doctors for a declaration authorising the withdrawal of ventilation but granted a declaration authorising the withholding of further procedures, such as CPR and the administration of intravenous antibiotics, which would mean that the child had moved naturally towards his death despite the ventilation and involve the infliction of further pain.

Total parenteral nutrition had been provided since she was one month old, and was affecting liver function which was likely to lead to liver failure at around one year of age.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2005, Parliament enacted the Mental Capacity Act to provide a comprehensive statutory regime for making decisions about mentally incapacitated adults. The Act is supported by a Code of Practice. Jurisdiction in respect of such persons was transferred to a new Court of Protection. New rules of court – the Court of Protection Rules 2007 (“COPR”) – were introduced governing the procedure of the Court, supported by a raft of practice directions. Although many of the procedures were new, the Act drew substantially on the principles and practices that had evolved under the inherent jurisdiction. Thus, the Act provided the new Court of Protection a statutory power to make declarations as to whether a person (“P”) has or lacks capacity to make a decision and as to the lawfulness or otherwise of any act done, or yet to be done, in relation to that person: s.15. In addition, the Court has the power to make decisions on behalf of P in relation to P’s personal welfare and property and affairs: s.16. The powers to make decisions as to personal welfare include, inter alia, the power to give or refuse consent to the carrying out or continuation of a treatment by a person providing health care for P: s.17(1)(d). Under the previous law following <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bland</span>, decisions about the proposed withholding or withdrawing of ANH from a person in a PVS were obliged to seek a declaration from the High Court. PD9E paragraph 5 repeats this requirement, but notably extends the obligation to bring cases before the Court of Protection to those involving decisions about the proposed withdrawing of such treatment from a person in a minimally conscious state.  Where an application is to be made to the court in relation to the lawfulness of withholding or withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration, from a person in a permanent vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, the proceedings must be conducted by the President of the Court of Protection or another judge nominated by him, in practice another High Court judge: COPR rule 86, PD 9E para 11 and PD 12A para 2. Thus the lawfulness or otherwise of withholding ANH will continue to be determined by declaratory proceedings usually conducted by judges of the Family Division sitting in the Court of Protection. </p>

As explained by the expert evidence in the current case, medical understanding of VS has expanded significantly in the intervening ten years since that case was decided, and it may be that Butler-Sloss P’s assertion would not now be applied without qualification. In non-VS cases, however, a patient may have some awareness and comprehension of the withholding and withdrawal of treatment. The impact of the withdrawal of treatment, the methods by which it is achieved, and the steps that can be taken to alleviate any suffering and distress are all part of the best interests assessment. Thus a decision by the Court, having carried out an assessment in accordance with established legal principles, that it is in the patient’s best interests to withhold or withdraw treatment does not give rise to a breach of article 3. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Article 8</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Dolan submits that, whilst it is clear that the benefit of preserving of life will always weigh extremely heavily in the balance, it cannot be assumed that there will always be no relevant dis-benefit to weigh against it. Even in a clinically stable patient there must be room for any relevant psychological and emotional aspects of their position to be taken into account as part of the balancing exercise. She further argues that the fact that the balance is most likely to come down in favour of preserving life in a MCS patient whose only medical treatment need is for ANH is not grounds for saying that a balance between factors in support of and against providing such treatment need not be struck in such cases.   To do away with the balancing exercise and balance sheet would be to disregard the requirement of s.4(2) MCA that consideration be given to  “all of the relevant circumstances” and would also disregard s.4(6) MCA which requires consideration of those matters of import to P or that P would be likely to consider if he could do so, when coming to any best interests decision. In addition, she points out that the Official Solicitor’s proposal that the use of the balance sheet analysis should depend on whether or not the patient was clinically stable merely begs the question of what “clinical stability” means. Depending on the particular circumstances, there could be a multitude of possible indicators of clinical stability, including absence of acute illness, absence of acute symptoms, presence of vital signs, absence of pain, absence of psychiatric disorder or acute psychological problems, and responsiveness to treatment. Assessing whether a patient is clinically stable would itself involve weighing up a variety of factors. Miss Dolan submits that if it were to be accepted that the presence of an acute single physical symptom, such as pain or discomfort, could indicate that a patient was not clinically stable, then, when considering best interests, there could be no rationale for not also weighing up the intermittent pains and discomforts of normal everyday life and/or those discomforts associated with the restriction of movement that will usually accompany the chronic disability of an MCS patient. For these reasons, the PCT, supported on this point by the Applicant, submits that the Official Solicitor’s suggested approach is wrong in law and unworkable in practice. </p>

There is, in my judgment, no rationale for extending the approach adopted by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bland</span> to non-VS cases. Lord Goff specifically distinguished between cases in which,  having regard to all the circumstances, it may not be in the patient’s best interests to continue treatment and cases in which a patient was permanently insensate and thus unable to benefit at all from the treatment. Crucially Lord Goff observed: “In both classes of case, the decision whether or not to withhold treatment must be made in the best interests of the patient. In the first class, however, the decision has to be made by weighing the relevant considerations.” There is no justification for introducing a requirement of clinical instability before embarking on a balance sheet analysis in MCS cases. To do so would introduce an impermissible gloss on the best interests test, and undermine the clear requirement laid down in s. 4 of the MCA to consider all the relevant circumstances when determining best interests. It would also lead to lengthy satellite argument as to the meaning of “clinical stability” and the diversion of legal and medical resources into determining that issue.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, the fact that a patient is demonstrating what may be seen as the components of clinical stability is unquestionably an important factor to be taken into account in the balance sheet analysis itself. For example the fact that a patient is not experiencing undue pain or discomfort, is not suffering from any acute illnesses, and seems psychologically settled, will be significant factors to take into account. The longer the patient has demonstrated these symptoms, the greater the period of clinical stability and the more weight to be attached to these factors in the balancing exercise. </p>

B said that she had not really seen any of them – no smiling, no opening eyes in response to anything, nor any tracking with her eyes, no laughter or any response to music.  She accepted that on occasion M had appeared to smile but did not think that this was necessarily a response to anything.  She described how she had asked M in the past to give her a smile and her mouth had on occasions moved a little.  B has not done that recently, because in her words, M “has got nothing to smile about”.  B was sceptical about whether M had any capacity to speak.  She pointed out that you need your tongue to speak and that M has no control of her tongue.  She accepted that M had a number of different noises that she makes and it might be that a different noise is made for a different need, but B was unable to differentiate this because she does not provide care for her.  She acknowledged that M does make different noises at different levels of volume and B was unable to say if the noise reflected any particular need.

Nurse O described how M’s carers talked to her, telling her what they are going to do and speak to her throughout the process.  M receives early morning medication between 6.30 and 7.  Throughout the day, and night, M is repositioned every three to four hours to make her more comfortable and to avoid pressure sores.  During the day, she might spend some time in her room or in the small lounge with her carer and one or two other residents, either with the television on or off.  Sometimes she goes into the snoozeroom.  On occasions, singers or other entertainers come to entertain the residents. M is fed by a gastrostomy tube or Peg tube.

However, after a short while, she will open her left eye and look again. Nurse O describes how she has been present when staff gossip when they are with M and how M will respond by opening her left eye and sometimes both eyes and definitely look at the members of staff.  Generally, according to Nurse O, if you focus on M and she sees you she will close her eyes.  Also, if you mention that she has her eyes open, she will probably close them.

Nurse O was assigned to the task of taking her out with another member of staff, and described the three visits in her statement.  On the first visit on 11 April, she described how they had visited a lake and how she had seen M look at her and her colleague and then appeared to be looking up beyond them at some trees for at least a minute.  When some ducks came up on the lake she turned her head to the right to see them swimming.  Nurse O described her eyes as “clearly moving and tracking.”  Nurse O estimated that M had her eyes open for two to three minutes and possibly longer.  During that time, M was clearly relaxed with her hands by her waist instead of in their usual position held up by her chin.  In the course of that first outing, Nurse O held M’s hand in the bus on the journey and when they were walking to and from the lake.  During these times she noticed it was quite flaccid.  When the wind blew into their faces, however, she noticed how M gripped her hand more tightly. Nurse O made similar observations on the second outing. When M’s wheelchair was being pushed across a rough path, M became tense and pulled her arms up under her chin.  Later, when they got to a smooth path, M became relaxed  In addition, Nurse O observed how at one point M turned her head towards the sun so it shone in her face.  While they were sitting by the lake, she had her left eye open for much of the time.  On the third outing, Nurse O observed how M flinched in reaction to a cold breeze.  On this occasion, M’s level of response was not the same as had been shown in the first two visits.   </p>

Nurse O described similar responses from M during some of these visits.  In particular, on 28 June, when care staff remarked how there was a fireman in the farmyard they were visiting, she briefly opened her left eye.  Nurse O continued: “as we returned to the minibus, we again started talking about the fireman and commented on the fact that he had gone.  At this point M opened both her eyes very wide for about thirty seconds.  We teased her that we would not tell S that she had been looking at fireman, at which M opened her eyes and made a groaning sound as if she was trying to communicate something.” Nurse O’s evidence about these outings clearly demonstrates that M has some awareness about her environment. It is Nurse O’s view that M should continue to go on outings to a variety of locations.  </p>

For that reason, she says that she has explained to all staff that they must record their observations accurately as possible and understand that they might have to give evidence on oath about them.  Nurse O accepted in answer to questions from Mr Sachdeva that there is a degree of subjectivity in the observations of M’s responsiveness. She accepted that the response/activity sheets would tend to cite positive sightings of responses and that a lack of responsiveness would not necessarily be recorded.

Amongst her tasks is to manicure M’s nails which she does every fortnight.  When she does this, she also gives M a hand massage.  She has noticed that M’s arms relax during the message.  While H is massaging M’s hands, M will usually peek at her through her left eye.  H describes how she often says things to her such as “you’re peeping”, but if M catches her looking at her, she will shut her eyes and keep them very tightly closed.   </p>

While reading, H occasionally makes comments to M about the story.  On a recent occasion, when she started reading, M started making a louder and higher-pitched noise which H interpreted as indicating that she did not want her to read.  She therefore stopped and switched on the television whereupon M became quiet.  H also described how on 7 April 2011, during a visit by an in-house entertainer, M became noticeably more relaxed, and kept opening her left eye fully and glancing around the room.   </p>

She confirmed a number of the observations seen by Nurse O - for example, she describes how M responded in the stiff breeze.  On one occasion, when they were walking past the lake, she said to M: “open your eyes – it is a lovely lake”.  At this, M appeared to look at the lake by turning her head to the right.  H said that she appeared to look for quite a while before she moved her head back to its usual position.  On the occasion of the second visit, H described how, while they walked around the lake, M turned her head to the direction of the sun and seemed to “be really pushing her face towards the sun”. H reiterated this in cross-examination and demonstrated how M had pushed her face upwards in the direction of the sun and held it there for some time. H gave a similar account to that provided by Nurse O about the reaction showed by M during a subsequent outing to the conversation concerning a fireman.   </p>

Cross-examined by Mr Sachdeva, C insisted that it was not possible that she had misheard what M had said.  She was quite taken aback because this had never happened before.  This is the only occasion on which she has heard M apparently speak. C said that she had never seen M smile.

She rarely opens her right eye but when relaxed can open her left eye, and can open it when spoken although not consistently to command.  Physio L described how M can open and close her mouth. Physio L described that M has some degree of neck flexion.  Her neck is left side flexed and rotated to the right. She has some limited right flexion in her neck which is naturally protracted.  If she is startled she will usually protract her shoulders.  She naturally protracts her arms forward.  Her arms are also internally rotated and turned so that they are held across the top of her chest with her hands under or next to the chin.  She has a full range of passive movements in her wrists, but normally only uses a small amount of the wrist movement turning her hands upwards.  When she is in a chair, she will normally be flexed to the side. She does sometimes flex her trunk when apparently watching T.V.   There is very little movement in her hips.  She has some flexion and extension in her knees but passive movement of her ankles and feet are limited.  Physiotherapy has produced some slight improvement in some of these movements and on occasions M has relaxed appropriately to massage.

M was sitting in the lounge and the music channel was on the television.  The well-known track by Adele called “Someone like You” was playing.  M was vocal during the song but, towards the end of the song, she started to cry, making what K describes as a “piercing, squealing sound” at a higher pitch and louder than normal.  K recalled that when the song had been playing earlier that morning while she and another carer were giving M a shower, she had been “very vocal” on that occasion as well. K said that whether it was the words, music or the voice, she did think that there was something in the Adele song to which M was responding. On 6 May 2011, K observed M making a similar sound when a track by Rod Stewart was played.  She screamed and K saw her eyes fill with tears.  K took the song off and played another one.  When M had stopped crying, she put the Rod Stewart song back on again and M started crying again.  K commented: “I am absolutely sure it was a scream and can confirm that M’s eyes were full of tears and they were running down her face.  It was similar to the piercing squeal that I heard from her on 15 April.  It was the most extreme response I have ever witnessed from M”.   </p>

She gave a similar picture of M’s condition and responsiveness as provided by other members of staff at the home. She told the court that, if M is settled, she does not screw her face up. If agitated or frustrated, she will have her arms and hands up by her face, but when settled they will be lower down her chest. Like other staff, Care Worker W said that she has noticed that the noises made by M vary depending on her needs. If she is cold, she will make a low monotone, whereas if her pad needs changing, the noise has a higher pitch. This occurs at all hours, but is particularly noticeable at night. On two occasions, care worker W has heard M make noises in the snoozeroom, as if going along with the music from the CD player. The sound is not necessarily in tune, but seems to rise and fall in line with the music.  She has also seen M tap her arm to the music, perhaps ten or fifteen times, in particular when an up-tempo song is being played. She has seen M look at the pattern of the lights on the wall in the snoozeroom. Usually it is her left eye that is opened, but she can open both eyes. She has seen this on about 90% of the occasions she has seen M in the snoozeroom. Care Worker W has also seen M open one or both eyes on the lounge on about 80% of the days she has seen her there, although not for the whole of the time that she is there on that day. She described how M will screw her eyes up if you say to her: “I can see you peeping”.  </p>

I found all of the staff from the care home who gave evidence to be honest and reliable witnesses who were manifestly endeavouring to give accurate evidence. Their devotion to their work was obvious.

One such feature is that the SMART protocol requires repeated assessment over time, thereby allowing the assessor to become familiar with the patient’s behavioural repertoire, thus helping to discern any motor responses which may be utilised to elicit meaningful and reproducible behaviours.  In addition, SMART provides an extensive range of assessment techniques across all of the sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory and gustatory) plus motor function, functional communication and wakefulness/arousal, which provides the patient with the optimal opportunity to demonstrate their potential.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As summarised above, SMART consists of both formal and informal components. The formal component requires an assessment by the SMART assessor over ten sessions within a three week period. There are two aspects of the formal assessment component – the SMART Behavioural Observation Assessment and the SMART Sensory Assessment.  The SMART Behavioural Observation Assessment comprises ten times ten minute formal observations of patients’ behaviours at rest.  At the end of the ten assessments, the behaviours are categorised as reflexive, spontaneous or purposeful, and the frequency of these behaviours is calculated.  The SMART Sensory Assessment consists of twenty-nine sensory techniques which include, for example, in the visual modality, techniques such as visual tracking.  A range of techniques is presented across all of the modalities to elicit behavioural response.  </p>

The responses are further categorised by the frequency with which they are displayed.  A “consistent response” is defined as one that occurs during at least five consecutive assessment sessions.  A “frequent inconsistent response” does not meet the requirement for a consistent response, but occurs five times nonconsecutively during the ten assessment sessions.  A “highest inconsistent response” is the highest response observed in the modality that occurs on one to four occasions during the ten assessment sessions.  Under the SMART protocol, a consistent meaningful response at SMART level 5 in any one of the sensory, motor or communication modalities is indicative of awareness. </p>

The information from the CLHQ is also used to further assess a known preference for different stimuli, such as music, taste, touch and smell.  The SMART informs require carers and relatives to describe any responses observed during day to day activity seen during the time since the incident leading to the brain injury.  This information enables the SMART assessor to categorise the response within the five SMART levels to allow comparison with the results gleaned from the SMART formal assessment.  This information would also be used to customise the SMART treatment programme if a significant response has been observed by carers and relatives but not noted in the SMART formal assessment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Gill-Thwaites carried out SMART assessments with M in 2007 and 2011. In the first stage of the formal component of the 2007 SMART assessment – the behavioural observation assessment – M’s behaviours were noted as being all either reflexive or spontaneous with no evidence of any purposeful behaviour.  Furthermore, the behaviours were not significantly influenced by environmental stimuli.  However, the sensory assessment produced more positive results.  The assessment process was hampered by the difficulty in ensuring that M opened her eyes sufficiently frequently to undertake the assessment.  Miss Gill-Thwaites reported that, once M’s eye or eyes were opened and her attention gained, she was able to consistently focus and track an object and follow commands to move her left arm up and down.  Thus, in the auditory modality, M was able to demonstrate a consistent response at SMART level 5 discriminating between the commands “move your arm up” and “move your arm down”. Miss Gill-Thwaites reported that these responses were incompatible with a vegetative state.  There was consistently no response in the olfactory modality, and only limited significant response in the gustatory modality.  In the motor function modality, however, some of the responses observed were at SMART level 5. In the course of this part of the assessment, M was able to demonstrate a “frequent inconsistent” ability to press a switch to command and track a photograph of a baby, and a “highest inconsistent” ability to answer questions using the switch.   </p>

In oral evidence, Miss GillThwaites explained that the significance of the response to command was that the patient has to go through a cognitive process of understanding what she was being asked to do (for example, the command to press the switch) and then having the ability to move in response and comply with the command (by pressing the switch).  On the occasions when she pressed the switch twice, this would clearly involve a double response.  Miss Gill-Thwaites described the behaviour exhibited by M of pressing the switch promptly twice in response to command as “a good result”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The information gleaned from the informal components of the SMART assessment within 2007 was less supportive of a diagnosis of consciousness.  In other words, family and the carers then looking after her in hospital did not report responses at the same level as were observed during the formal component of the assessment.  Nonetheless, Miss Gill-Thwaites concluded in 2007 that “based on the results of SMART, I would suggest a diagnosis of at least a minimally conscious state for M with a recommendation to explore her to further develop her response range and quality with a specifically designed SMART treatment programme”.  In order to optimise results, Miss Gill-Thwaites advised it was essential to provide appropriate positioning, preferably in a wheelchair with optimal head support, rather than allowing M to remain in bed.  During the assessment, it was only when positioning was optimised that M had demonstrated behaviours indicative of a minimally conscious state. </p>

As a result, the hospital concluded that no further therapeutic intervention was advisable or appropriate at that stage. In describing the results from the 2007/8 hospital admission, Miss GillThwaites observed in evidence that the staff had tried many avenues but were unable to move M on to being able to establish a consistent yes/no response.  Although M was observed to follow commands, as had been seen during the SMART assessment, the hospital staff were unable to help her move on to the next stage, which would be linking that capacity to a yes/no response so that she would have been able to begin the process of communication. </p>

In other words, M’s behaviours were again either reflexive or spontaneous, with no evidence of any purposeful behaviour.  Once again, her behaviours were not significantly influenced by environmental stimuli.  Her behaviours were broadly the same as those exhibited in 2007.  As in the previous test, however, the other component of the formal assessment – the sensory assessment – produced more positive, albeit complex, results.  The assessment of the visual modality responses was again complicated by the difficulty in ensuring that M kept her eyes open. Focusing and tracking were less consistent than in 2007 although still evident. Furthermore, although discrimination had been evident in 2007, no such ability was detected in 2011.  Some responses to auditory stimuli, however, were demonstrated at SMART level 5 in 2011, albeit not as consistently as in 2007.  As in 2007, the majority of her responses in the tactile modality were reflexive, that is to say, compatible with the vegetative state and there was no evidence of any head turning towards stimuli in 2011.  As 2007, there were no significant responses in the olfactory modality, and limited significant responses in the gustatory modality.  Whereas, in 2007, she demonstrated the consistent ability to perform a verbal instruction, and an infrequent but inconsistent response to the use of a switch, only very limited responses of this type were seen in 2011.   </p>

Responses seen on this occasion included a nod to a question, mouthing words, and an attempt to write. In oral evidence, Miss GillThwaites described how, during the 2011 assessment, when she was shown a card and asked “Is this coffee?” M had mouthed a word in a way which Miss Gill-Thwaites, with her experience of SMART assessments, concluded was an attempt to read the words.  In the same session, when Miss Gill-Thwaites said “hello”, M responded with a short sound which Miss Gill-Thwaites regarded as a response to what she had said. </p>

On this occasion, the information from care staff was more indicative of consciousness than the observations of the hospital staff in 2007. Thus the findings from the formal and informal components of the 2011 SMART were consistent.  In both formal and informal assessment and observation, meaningful responses were noted, albeit infrequently. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Gill-Thwaites’ conclusion from the 2011 SMART assessment was that M was still demonstrating behaviour suggestive of minimally conscious state.  Whilst the meaningful responses were largely less consistent during the formal assessment, the observations by the team of carers were slightly more frequent than in the equivalent stage in 2007.  However, Miss Gill-Thwaites added that the meaningful responses were infrequent, and there is no pattern as to when they might occur.  In reply to a question from Mr Sachdeva, Miss Gill-Thwaites conceded that the reduction in the discriminatory behaviours particular in the visual and auditory modalities between the 2007 and 2011 assessments was significant.  She did not however necessarily consider that this indicated a reduction in functionality. This was something that might be explored in a further treatment programme.  There is less tracking and localising towards stimuli, but in Miss Gill-Thwaites opinion this is partly due to the difficulty in gaining eye opening.  Unfortunately, however, M still has no ability to communicate in a functional way, although she does on occasions, answer questions with a spontaneous retort.  Miss Gill-Thwaites’ overall opinion, however, is that, notwithstanding the disappointing outcome from the admission to Putney following the 2007 SMART and the absence of any subsequent improvement, M has maintained approximately the same status since the earlier assessment in 2007 and there are grounds for further exploration. She observed: “I am seeing potential there, there is definitely potential and there are these little islands of very significant responses.  But the question is can we make that more consistent to make it functional?” Her proposal is that a more stimulating setting and activity programme may lead M to open her eyes more frequently and as a result increase her responsiveness.  </p>

She did not observe any distress or any adverse response or “hypersensitivity” in the snoozeroom.  She agreed that it was possible that what was described by some as “hypersensitivity” is attributable in part, at least, to the fact that she has not had the opportunity to experience sensations and that, if she had that opportunity, the hypersensitivity might abate. She also thought that it would be beneficial to M to have photographs and possessions around her. She saw no disadvantages in having photographs in her room.  Miss Gill-Thwaites thought that M would only benefit from a more stimulating environment and said that it would be of interest to see how she would respond in those situations.  The purpose of introducing greater stimulation would therefore be both to enrich her life and to see whether she demonstrated an increased response.   </p>

They disagree, however, about a number of important issues, notably as to (1) where M’s level of consciousness lies on what Professor Turner-Stokes described as the “broad spectrum of consciousness” covered by MCS; (2) whether it is in her interests to be exposed to further stimuli, and (3) whether her experiences are on balance positive or negative.

All of these activities should be interspersed with periods of rest.

She is in a minimally conscious state, but at the lowest level, effectively on the border of a vegetative state.  Although she has certain responses that indicate a very limited level of awareness of her environment, none of these can be harnessed to allow meaningful interaction, communication or the ability to make choices at any level.  I am unable to identify any aspect of her life that gives her positive pleasure or satisfaction.  On the contrary she has marked hypersensitivity and it is evident that she experiences a significant level of discomfort and at times pain.  Her condition has not changed significantly in the last five years and there is no realistic possibility of recovery.  She lacks mental capacity to make decisions regarding her care and treatment, and so any such decisions must be made on the basis of her best interests.  Her family is united in their view that she would not want to be alive in her current condition.  In my opinion it would be appropriate to withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration and allow her to die in dignity.

She concluded that the ratings gave a reasonably consistent picture.  Of the sixty-two items on the WHIM scale, the first fourteen are compatible with vegetative state.  M, however, was noted to exhibit a number of types of behaviour above those fourteen. Items fifteen to eighteen were reported by carers and at least one other professional at a level which Professor Turner-Stokes characterised as reproducible.  Items twenty to twenty three on the WHIM scale were reported by carers only at a level categorised as reproducible.  Some other isolated behaviours at a higher level were reported at a level which Professor Turner-Stokes described as sporadic.  She concluded that, whereas items up to fourteen were compatible with a vegetative state, “items fifteen to eighteen clearly place her in a state of MCS as opposed to VS”.  Professor Turner-Stokes observes that this “concurs with the conclusions from the repeat SMART tests”.  In short, “M shows inconsistent, but clearly reproducible, responses above a level compatible with VS and is therefore in MCS. The WHIM scores by professionals have been helping in corroborating the behaviours reported by carers.  However, her range of reproducible behaviours falls in the lower third of the WHIM scale and her level of awareness interaction is substantially lower than that demonstrated by many of the patients in our series” who were progressing towards emergence from MCS. As there was no indication of improvement between 2007 and 2011, she thought it “highly improbable” that M would emerge from MCS. She placed this probability at less than five per cent although she stresses that this is “only an intuitive estimate in the absence of formal data”.  She does not consider it likely that a further stimulation programme at this stage will significantly alter the likelihood or emergence from MCS. In oral evidence, she confirmed that it was improbable that M would ever emerge out of a MCS, given the severity of diffuse brain injury suffered, the fact that she has been in this condition for over eight years, and the absence of evidence of any upward trajectory in her level of consciousness and behaviour, together with some suggestion in the 2011 SMART assessment of a reduction in her discriminating activity. </p>

Asked if that could equate to a high level of awareness around that time, Professor Turner-Stokes said “yes and no”. She accepted that three of the occasions of apparent vocalisation were responses to others. She thought it was “quite hard to know what is meant by those”. Miss Harry Thomas suggested that this greater level of vocalisation might be attributable to the greater stimulation she had experienced since being taken on outings.

In her first report, she expressed the view that the accuracy of some of the reports “appears to be questionable”. Professor Turner-Stokes observed that it was evident that M’s carers were highly committed and caring.  Given any level of uncertainty, it was entirely appropriate, according to Professor TurnerStokes, that they were sensitive to any signs that there might possibly indicate attempts on M’s part to communicate.  She warned however that this led to a risk of over-interpretation.  There was, she said, “a tendency to report more and more incidences of interaction which may artificially heighten their collective beliefs about her level of response”.  </p>

She maintained, however, that some of the staff comments were interpretative and thus merely conjectural. In fairness, Professor Turner-Stokes also pointed out that it is very difficult to determine whether a patient in VS or MCS is registering what they are seeing when they apparently gaze at something or someone for quite a long period of time.  She observed that, if she finds it challenging even after more than twenty years of working with patients in low awareness states, it is not surprising that carers and professionals with much less experience find it difficult to interpret what they are seeing. </p>

This gives me additional confidence in the reliability of their evidence. In addition, Professor Turner-Stokes fairly acknowledged that carers do become familiar with interpreting a patient’s behaviour over time. Common sense suggests that, as a general rule, the greater the experience a carer has of working with a patient in an MCS, the more familiar he or she will be with the nuances of the patient’s behaviour. Carers with extended and recent experience of the patient will thus be better equipped at interpreting that behaviour. In this case, in contrast with the family members, nearly all of the care staff at the nursing home who were called to give evidence have had extensive and recent experience of M’s behaviour. Accordingly, and having heard them in the witness box, I find that I can give considerable weight to their evidence as to M’s behaviour, fortified by the fact that these interpretations have been substantially corroborated by the formal assessments carried out using the SMART and WHIM processes.</p>

On the occasion of her first visit, in 2009, Professor Turner-Stokes carried out a WHIM test which suggested that she was at the lower end of the MCS spectrum. In her first report, this led her to warn that, for a patient who was on the borderline between MCS and VS “a higher level of awareness is not necessarily a good thing.  The physical sequelae of severe brain injury can be painful and distressing, so that a level of awareness of self or the environment can engender symptoms”. </p>

As M’s responses “fall considerably short of functional interactive communication” she does not agree with Mr Badwan that M is at the upper limit of MCS. However, in contrast to her position in the previous report, Professor TurnerStokes now accepts, in the light of the care staff witness statements, the activity/response sheets, and her own recent observations, coupled with those made by Miss Gill-Thwaites and Mr. Badwan, that M’s level of behaviours and responses places her at a moderate level of MCS.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In her oral evidence, Professor Turner-Stokes was asked a number of questions about aspects mentioned in her reports, namely pain and hypersensitivity. Professor TurnerStokes said in oral evidence that it is extremely difficult to evaluate a patient’s level and experience of pain when they are unable to communicate. One can only go by responses. There are a variety of tools used, such as the Abbey scale developed for dementia patients, but Professor Turner-Stokes advised that all or nearly all of these still require validation for use in MCS cases. Research evidence suggests that patients in MCS may be able to experience pain in similar ways to “normal” individuals. Whereas patients in VS may react reflexively and thus appear to respond, but are in fact lacking the part of the brain that appreciates and experiences pain, evidence suggests that in MCS patients these pathways are relatively intact. Cross-examined by Miss Harry Thomas on this point, Professor Turner-Stokes gave a more technical explanation. The interconnective link required to experience pain is between the somatosensory cortex (the part of the brain that received messages of pain through the brain senses) and the fronto-parietal cortices (the part of the brain where one experiences and associates pain).  Recent research (Boly et al “Perception of pain in the minimally conscious state with PET activation: an observational study”, The Lancet (2008) 7: 1013-1020)  has postulated that this link is present in MCS but not in VS. </p>

Cross-examined by Miss Harry Thomas, she accepted that the symptoms which she interpreted as indicating hypersensitivity could be seen as an indication of awareness and interaction between herself and her environment, but said that M’s apparent withdrawal on experiencing stimulation (such as scrunching up her eyes in bright light) was evidence that she was experiencing it as an allodynia (that is to say, an unpleasant sensation). Treatment of hypersensitivity in MCS cases was difficult because cognitively behavioural approaches were not suitable. One option would be to increase stimulation in the hope that it reduced her sensitivity, but this was not always successful and while being carried out would be likely to cause further distress.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the ultimate question in this case, Professor Turner-Stokes accepted in her supplementary report that, when considering the question of withdrawal of ANH, the issues are more complex for persons in the MCS than for those in VS, for a number of reasons. First, the diagnostic criteria for VS are more easily defined.  By contrast, MCS covers a broad range of awareness and responsiveness “so inevitably there will be a range of clinical opinion with respect to the individual’s level of awareness”.  Secondly, whereas there are established criteria for a permanent vegetative state from which meaningful recovery is considered to be at least highly improbable, there are, as yet, no established criteria for a “permanent MCS” and data are currently lacking in the world literature to determine the point beyond which meaningful recovery is highly probable.  Thirdly, persons in VS are considered to have no awareness of self or their environment, and so are not likely to experience pain or discomfort in the process of dying.

First, M has a very profound physical and cognitive impairments and is in a MCS.  Secondly, although she makes certain limited responses that indicate awareness of her environment, she is unable to communicate effectively or make basic choices even at the lowest level.  She has no functional communication.  Thirdly, Professor Turner-Stokes observes that M’s balance of experience in her current condition “remains a matter for continued concern”.  She highlights the fact in particular that M is bed or chair bound, doubly incontinent and totally dependant on nursing care.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In expressing her overall opinion in oral evidence, Professor Turner-Stokes said that, whilst recognising it was a matter for the court, she would support the withdrawal of ANH, given that it is very improbable that M will ever emerge from the MCS and that, in Professor Turner-Stokes’s view, her negative experiences outweighed her positive ones. She noted in her oral evidence that no-one had been able to ‘positively identify things that cause specific pleasure’<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and that the ‘positive’ experiences had to be viewed in conjunction with the negative aspects of M’s experiences. She acknowledged that, when ANH was withdrawn, M would have negative experiences while she was dying, but these could be ameliorated by medication and other treatment and, in Professor Turner-Stokes’s view, it would be in M’s best interests to endure this short-term negative experience rather than the prolonged negative experience of living, possibly for several further years, in a MCS. She summarised her opinion in these words: “as a general principle, if a person would not have wanted ANH to keep her alive, I would personally support its withdrawal from that person in order to allow them to die with dignity rather than allow them to continue that negative experience over many years …. In the absence of evidence that M is going to emerge from MCS I would apply my general principle”. For Professor Turner-Stokes, the three important factors are (1) what M wanted or would have wanted (2) the high probability that she will not emerge from MCS and (3) the overall negative balance of her future experience, taking into account when striking that balance the fact that, unlike a patient in VS, someone in MCS would experience short-term suffering, albeit mitigated by careful treatment, during the withdrawal of ANH. </p>

As Lord Goff observed nearly twenty years ago in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bland</span> case, “the fundamental principle is the principle of the sanctity of human life”.  Munby J in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Burke</span> case (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) spoke of the “very strong presumption in favour of taking all steps which will prolong life”. Paragraph 5.31 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 Code of Practice requires that “all reasonable steps which are in the person’s best interests should be taken to prolong their life”. As Miss Harry Thomas stated in her final submissions, “the starting point in this application and all applications involving the withdrawal and withholding of life sustaining treatment is the presumption in favour of the preservation of life”.  It is not an absolute right.  As Lord Goff said in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bland </span>“there is no absolute right that a patient’s life must be prolonged by treatment or care, regardless of the circumstances.”  Nonetheless, it is a fundamental right, as all subsequent cases have recognised, both in this jurisdiction, in the European Court of Human Rights, and across the world.   </p>

As set out above, s.4(6) of the MCA requires the court to consider, so far as reasonably ascertainable, M’s past and present wishes and feelings. Even though M made no formal advance decision as to medical treatment, it is said on behalf of the Applicant that she expressed wishes and feelings about the matter which should be give significant weight when deciding whether ANH should now be withdrawn. Indeed, Mr Sachdeva and Miss Butler-Cole on behalf of the Applicant say that this factor should be given decisive weight and place M’s wishes and feelings at the forefront of their argument. M’s family feel strongly that she would have rejected her current treatment and the rationale for this application is fundamentally based on M’s perceived wishes and feelings. They submit that those who oppose this application fail to give appropriate respect to M’s wishes and feelings about the right to choose her life and the manner of her death.  </p>

They rely, however, on the evidence given by B and S as to M’s views about dependency and dignity at the end of life. They submit that these views are relevant, as they indicate what her starting point was likely to be, and the factors on which she would have placed weight.  They remind me in particular of the unchallenged evidence that M felt that someone in the condition of Anthony Bland ought to be allowed to die.  It is submitted on behalf of the Applicant that it can be safely assumed that M would have been, as her partner stated, ‘horrified’ by the thought of living in her present condition. In reaching a view about her situation, she would, they submit, have taken into account the extent to which she had conscious awareness of the world, the extent to which she was able to participate in and have conscious awareness of activities that had given her pleasure, whether she was experiencing pain, the quality of her daily life, the importance of not being dependent on other people, the fact that there was no realistic prospect of recovery, the distress caused to her relatives and partner as a result of her condition, and the importance of her wishes and feelings being respected by others. The Applicant’s counsel acknowledge that the court will inevitably be concerned that, without knowing exactly what M would have thought of her actual condition, it is impossible to say she would have been certain about preferring death to continued existence in MCS. They submit, however, that according true respect to M’s autonomy requires the court to consider seriously what M’s view would have been, even if it cannot be conclusively determined, and to give it substantial weight. They accept that the more specific the statement, the more likely it is to be persuasive, but submit that it does not follow that more general statements should be ignored.

They further contend that the possibility that M’s present wishes are different from her likely wishes at a time when she had capacity should not hold as much weight as it might do if M were significantly less disabled. In M’s case, her world has shrunk so much; her interests (from her perspective) are now so marginal; and her present self is so fundamentally incapable of sustained or consistent autonomous thought and direction even on the most basic level, that it is reasonable, submits Mr Sachdeva, to consider that her earlier expressed views and interests should take precedence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the question of M’s wishes and feelings, the Official Solicitor submits that the law concerning advance decisions as developed by the courts prior to the MCA and then refined in ss 24 to 26 of that Act, whilst respecting the importance of personal autonomy, establishes a number of stringent safeguards and requirements. Miss Harry Thomas and Miss Apps submit that there are good reasons why the law, both at common law and under statute, insists on such stringent requirements before an advance decision can become binding, and in the absence of a valid binding advance decision that meets these requirements, the weight to be attached to any statements made by the patient must be limited. In this context, the Official Solicitor invites comparison with the American case of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re Martin</span> 538 NW 2d 399 (1995 Mich Sup Ct) in which the Michigan Supreme Court stated that “clear and convincing evidence” of a patient’s wishes was required to justify withholding treatment from patients in a MCS. “Only when the patient’s prior statements clearly illustrate a serious, well thought out, consistent decision to refuse treatment under these exact circumstances or circumstances highly similar to the current situation should treatment be refused.” Miss Harry Thomas drew my attention to similar observations in another American case, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re Wendland</span> 28 P 3d 151 (2001 Cal Sup Ct). The Official Solicitor acknowledges that Article 8 requires that there must be respect for personal choice, self determination and personal autonomy where it is capable of being expressed, even where, to give effect to those express wishes, would result in the death of that person. He submits, however, that in a case such as this, concerning a person who cannot express her current wishes, where the consequences of a withdrawal of treatment will be the patient’s death, previous statements of a general nature relating to the enjoyment of life, or dislike of nursing homes, cannot be decisive in determining whether that person, if capable, would now choose to die. Accordingly, whilst accepting that the statements made by M in the past as relayed by B and S are not irrelevant to the court’s analysis of best interests, he submits they cannot carry decisive weight.  </p>

Miss Dolan points out that the advance decision provisions require the patient to have gone through a specific thought process of identifying the specific circumstances in which the advance decision will apply, knowing that the decision will indeed be decisive, in cases such as this, this involves understanding that the effect of the decision would be the withdrawal of ANH when in a MCS.

In other words, an adult who makes an advance decision knows that it will be decisive in the event that he or she becomes incapacitated and is unable to communicate their current wishes and feelings. </p>

I accept, therefore, that when her grandmother and father were in declining health and moved to live in nursing homes, M said on more than one occasion words to the effect that she would  not wish to live like that, that she would not wish to be dependent on others, and that she “wanted to go quickly”. I also accept the evidence that, when reports about Tony Bland appeared on television, M expressed views to the effect that it would be better to allow him to die. But, as conceded on behalf of the Applicant, there is no evidence that M ever specifically considered the question of withdrawal of ANH, or ever considered the question whether she would wish such treatment to be withdrawn if in a minimally conscious state. Furthermore, even if M did specifically consider those questions, there is no way of knowing her current views, having lived in that state for over eight years. Given the importance of the sanctity of life, and the fatal consequences of withdrawing treatment, and the absence of an advance decision that complied with the requirements previously specified by the common law and now under statute, it would be in my judgment be wrong to attach significant weight to those statements made prior to her collapse. </p>

When she feels pain, sometimes she vocalises that experience, at other times not. Sometimes the sounds she makes are an indication of pain, at other times they are not.

Furthermore, in the light of the evidence about her recent outings given by Nurse O and Skills Worker H, I accept the opinion of Miss Gill-Thwaites and Mr Badwan that there is a real prospect that her enjoyment of life may be increased by a programme of stimulation, both inside and outside the home.  I recognise the dangers, identified by Professor Turner-Stokes, that M may be sensitive or hyper-sensitive, to such experiences.

I accept Mr Sachdeva’s submission, based on all the evidence including a comparison of the two SMART assessments, that there is no evidence that M’s level of consciousness has improved over the past eight years.  As set out above, Professor Turner-Stokes has changed her assessment as to M’s level of consciousness within the MCS spectrum, but the explanation for this change is more likely to be that the professor underestimated the level of consciousness in her initial report rather than any increase in M’s awareness in the last few years. The SMART assessments, supplemented by the WHIM test as explained and analysed by Professor Turner-Stokes, give a reasonably clear picture of M’s level of consciousness (or as clear as is possible given the difficulties in testing and communicating with M and the inherent difficulties in measuring consciousness in any circumstances).  I therefore accept that M is not on the border between VS and MCS, but rather at a moderate level on the MCS spectrum.  On this point, I accept the opinion of Professor TurnerStokes and reject the view of Mr. Badwan that M is at the higher end of that spectrum.  She is a long way short of full consciousness and, in all the circumstances, I find it very unlikely that she will ever emerge from MCS.   </p>

But I accept the view of the experts that M will very probably remain in MCS for the rest of her life.  Given her current life expectancy, it follows that she will remain in this condition for up to ten years.  As Mr Sachdeva expressed it in his closing submissions, “after eight years in MCS and with a diffuse non-traumatic brain injury, and in circumstances where M is approaching the end of her life and is therefore experiencing a declining cognitive function, there is no more than a glimmer of hope that M might start to emerge from MCS”.   </p>

On this aspect of the case, I accept the evidence of the carers, who have far greater experience of living with M in recent years than do members of her family whose visits have become less frequent as time has gone by.  Like Professor Turner-Stokes, I wondered when I first read the papers whether the carers were over-interpreting M’s behaviour, seeing what they wanted to see.  Professor Turner-Stokes has come to accept that the carers’ accounts are broadly accurate.  Unlike Professor Turner-Stokes, I have also the benefit, not only of reading the carers’ statements, but also listening to them give oral evidence over a number of days.  I have been impressed, indeed moved, by their professionalism and dedication to their demanding job.  Although most of them hold a clear view that ANH should not be withdrawn in this case, I find that they have remained objective in the evidence they have given and that their accounts are reliable and accurate.  I therefore accept that M does have positive experiences and that, although her life is extremely restricted, it is not without pleasures, albeit small ones.  Furthermore, I accept the evidence of Miss Gill-Thwaites and Mr Badwan that there is a reasonable prospect that M’s positive experiences and quality of life can be extended by changes to her care plan that carefully expose her to increased stimulation.  I am fortified in that belief by the knowledge that such a plan would be implemented by this truly dedicated care team. </p>

It is not disputed that, because of her condition, it would not be in M’s interests to receive cardio-pulmonary resuscitation having regard to all the benefits and burdens of such treatments.  I accept Mr Sachdeva’s submission on this point: “a key factor is the hypoxia that would inevitably result if M’s heart were to stop beating and the further damage that such hypoxia would cause to her brain. It is likely that even if CPR were successful, M would be left with worse brain damage and a lower level of consciousness awareness.  In making the DNR order weight has been placed on the quality of M’s life that CPR might result. Having treatment with the result that M would live in a yet lower level of MCS would not be in M’s best interests”.  So far as other treatment is concerned, including antibiotics, I accept the submission on behalf of the Official Solicitor, supported by the PCT, that such judgments should be left to the treating clinicians, in consultation with family members and carers.  Having decided that ANH should not be withdrawn, and having regard to the fact that M is clinically stable, it is impossible for this court to determine now whether it will be in M’s best interests at a future date for specific treatment to be given.  That will depend on the circumstances as they arise.  Whereas with CPR it is highly probable that any event which require the administration of CPR will cause significant harm to M, so that it is not in her best interests to be resuscitated, the court cannot say at this point whether a specific course of treatment such as antibiotics would at some future date be in her best interests.  Whether or not it is in her best interests will depend on the circumstances as they arise, and it must be left to the clinicians to make that decision in consultation with family members having regard to all relevant circumstances.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although some of the older cases concerned patients who whilst diagnosed as being in a VS were probably in a MCS, this is the first case in this country concerning an application to withhold or withdraw ANH from a patient diagnosed as being in a MCS. Professor Turner-Stokes told me that it is reasonable to think that there are several-fold more patients in a MCS than in a VS. The following observations, which have been approved by the President of the Court of Protection, are designed to assist in future applications for the withdrawal of ANH.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, it is important to reiterate that a decision to withhold or withdraw ANH from a person in VS or MCS must be referred to the court: COP Practice Direction 9E, paragraph 5. All applications of this sort must be made to a High Court judge. Furthermore, good practice dictates that they should be allocated at the earliest opportunity to one judge who will be responsible for case management and ultimately conduct the final hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, this case has demonstrated the crucial role played by the formal assessment tools, the SMART and the WHIM. The history of this case shows how cases may be misdiagnosed if these tools are not used. M was initially diagnosed as being in a VS. That led the family, advised by the very experienced clinicians and the independent expert instructed at that stage, to make this application. It was only some time after this application was launched that the SMART test was administered and disclosed that M was in fact in an MCS. I do not know whether or not this application would have been started if that diagnosis had been made at the outset. One can envisage cases, however, in which family members and clinicians take the view that they should start proceedings to withdraw life-sustaining treatment if, but only if, the patient is in a VS.  This issue was identified by Seel et al in the 2010 paper cited above:  </p>

Conversely, misinterpreting non-purposeful or reflexive behaviour as conscious behaviour may lead to falsely optimistic prognoses …. In the most severe circumstances, misdiagnosis can cause inappropriate family and legal decisions regarding withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Stokes said in evidence that she was “reasonably confident that future guidelines will state that, before making any decision concerning the withholding of ANH, there should be formal testing in the form of the SMART diagnostic test coupled with WHIM tests carried out over a period of time”. In future, therefore, no such application for an order authorising the withdrawal of ANH from a patient in VS or MCS should be made unless (1) a SMART assessment (or similarly validated equivalent) has been carried out to provide a diagnosis of the patient’s disorder of consciousness and (2) in the case of a patient thereby diagnosed as being in an MCS, a series of WHIM assessments have been carried out over time with a view to tracking the patient’s progress and recovery (if any) through the MCS. If an assessment scale becomes validated in the medical literature for tracking a person’s recovery through the MCS, this assessment may alternatively be used in place of the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, given the fundamental issues involved in cases involving the withdrawal of ANH, it is alarming to the court that public funding has not been available to members of the family to assist them in prosecuting their application. In the event, the Applicant’s team has acted <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> throughout the hearing and during much of the very extensive preparation. I stress that this has not caused any disadvantage to the Applicant. As I said at the conclusion of Mr. Sachdeva’s submissions, the family could not have had better representation. But it is intolerable that the family should have been dependent on the willingness of lawyers to work without remuneration. In this case, the “playing-field” was level because of the exceptional generosity of the Applicant’s lawyers. In other cases, members of a family who wished to ask the court to authorise the withdrawal of ANH but did not qualify for means tested public funding may have to appear in person, given the very high costs of litigation. Such a situation would seem to infringe the family’s rights under Article 6 of ECHR. There are many demands on the restricted legal aid budget, but consideration should be given to extending the right to non-means tested public funding to family members seeking to bring this type of application. At present, such non-means tested funding is available to parents whose children are the subject of care proceedings under the Children Act 1989. That provision is justified by the fundamental and life-changing consequences which flow from the making of a care order. The same argument applies to applications for the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, the hearing of the application has vindicated the decision, made for the reasons set out in the earlier judgment reported at [2011] EWHC 1197 (COP), to conduct the hearing in open court but subject to a reporting restriction order that prevents identification of M, family members, and the care home and its staff. Provided that the privacy of the individuals involved is fully respected, it is imperative that the press should be as free as possible to report cases of this sort. The issues involved are of fundamental importance to all of us, both collectively and individually. For society as a whole, they touch upon the very challenging issues, currently the subject of much public debate, about the treatment of those suffering from severe disability, and those nearing the end of their lives. For each of us as individuals, they draw attention to the question of how we would wish to be treated should we find ourselves in a vegetative or minimally conscious state. The public needs to be informed about how such questions are resolved, be it under the advance decision procedure in sections 24 to 26 of the Mental Capacity Act or by application to the Court of Protection. It is therefore in the public interest for such cases to be reported as widely and freely as possible, provided that due respect is paid to the wishes of the family to protect their privacy.  </p>
