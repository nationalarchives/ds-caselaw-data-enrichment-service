	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">One bright morning M awoke at her home. By her were her husband, F and their two year old daughter D who had crept into their bed at about 4 a.m., as she sometimes did. After a few moments shaking off sleepiness M became concerned. The whole family had overslept, which was unusual, notwithstanding that they had had a late night after visiting her parents. More concerning was the silence from their seven month old son, S who slept in an adjacent room. He would invariably awake at around 5 a.m. and would need attention. D stirred and signalled that she had a wet nappy. M went to D’s room to fetch one. As she entered she saw S lying prone in his cot, prostrate with arms outstretched. She turned him over and knew at once that he was dead. She cried out and rushed to her bedroom, passing F on the landing, to call 999 in great distress. F attempted resuscitation as instructed by the emergency operator. The paramedics arrived very quickly – by 9 a.m. S was loaded into the ambulance where one of the crew inserted a Guedel tube into his mouth, administered oxygen, and worked on him. The ambulance arrived at Hospital at 9.15 a.m, where a team of seven doctors and nurses were waiting. S was worked on very forcefully; the work included the insertion (after a number of fruitless attempts) of intravenous lines into vein and bone. The effort was unsuccessful and at 9.40 a.m. the parents were advised that further efforts would be futile. They agreed that it should all stop and D was pronounced dead at 9.42 a.m.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">The LA alleges that M and F had, throughout S’s short life, periodically inflicted abusive violence on him, and neglected him. It further alleges that about 4 hours before S died at about 7 a.m., one or both of them meted out extreme violence to S of a nature that can only be described as savage, resulting in gross bruising to his hands, feet, arms, face and ears, and to a ruptured upper lip fraenulum that can only have been caused by a forceful punch or slap to his face. The injuries to the hands include almost uniquely rare bruising to both of his palms which could only have been caused by holding his hands open and by “repeated application of significant blunt force trauma”, likely by beating them with a weapon. The evidence relied on by the LA is primarily scientific evidence, which is said to be almost irrefutable, as well as additional evidence from photographs and from others as to observed earlier injuries. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, the LA invites me to find that by virtue of the proximity of the time of causation of the injuries to the time of death, M and/or F later murdered S, probably by smothering him, which would likely leave no ascertainable evidential trace. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">M and F strenuously deny that they abusively inflicted any injuries on S and they utterly deny that they murdered him. They are aghast that such allegations should be levelled against them. They assert that S was a much loved child, and was at all times adored and cherished by them. In respect of those injuries which occurred earlier than those arising around the time of his death they say that they were either the result of normal childhood bumps and scrapes<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		  <p class="FootnoteText"> although they posit the possibility of natural disorder in life which may have provoked or aggravated the injuries .</p>
		</authorialNote>; and, in respect of those arising at the time of death, as a result of (a) a natural disorder, and/or (b) post-mortem degeneration, and/or (c) of resuscitation attempts. These explanations are “vanishingly unlikely” says the LA.</p>

I have heard the oral evidence of 50 witnesses of whom 10 were experts (as opposed to treating clinicians) drawn from a range of disciplines. The dense written material occupies 13 lever arch files. The written final submissions from Counsel ran to 226 pages. All of this evidence and other writings I shall examine with care in this judgment (although for obvious reasons I will not summarise every single piece of evidence before me). Given the gravity of the allegations this judgment will necessarily be lengthy. By its nature the decision I have to make is as serious as any as any judge, in any field, is tasked to make. I adopt the variedly attributed apothegm used by Dr L in his addendum report “I am sorry for the length of my letter, but I had not the time to write a short one”. </p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.”</p>

The requirement of evidential clarity is quite distinct from an elevation of the probability standard. Were it otherwise, and, say, an allegation of rape or murder of a child made in civil proceedings required P to be set at &gt; 0.6 then one could end up in the position where a court considered that P in such a case was, say 0.51 but still had to find that it did not happen; when, as a matter of probability, is was more likely that not that it did.

On 5 August 1978 the plaintiffs’ motor vessel Popi M sank in calm weather in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Algeria in deep water when laden with a cargo of bagged sugar. The plaintiffs, as assured, sought to recover, under two substantially identical time policies of marine insurance, against the defendants, hull underwriters, in respect of the loss of the vessel. The plaintiffs were entitled to recover under the policies if they could prove that the loss was caused by “perils of the seas.” The plaintiffs originally sought to explain the loss of the vessel in various ways prior to the trial but those explanations were all subsequently abandoned, and at the trial the plaintiffs finally advanced as an explanation for the loss a collision with an unidentified, moving, submerged submarine, which was never detected, never seen and which never surfaced. The defendants contested that explanation. Bingham J. made no finding concerning the seaworthiness of the vessel and although he regarded the plaintiffs' case as being inherently improbable he held nevertheless that the plaintiffs' submarine hypothesis had to be accepted, as, on the balance of probabilities, the explanation for the loss of the vessel. On appeal by the defendants, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The House of Lords allowed the appeal. Lord Brandon of Oakbrook stated:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The first reason is one which I have already sought to emphasise as being of great importance, namely, that the judge is not bound always to make a finding one way or the other with regard to the facts averred by the parties. He has open to him the third alternative of saying that the party on whom the burden of proof lies in relation to any averment made by him has failed to discharge that burden. No judge likes to decide cases on burden of proof if he can legitimately avoid having to do so. There are cases, however, in which, owing to the unsatisfactory state of the evidence or otherwise, deciding on the burden of proof is the only just course for him to take.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The second reason is that the dictum can only apply when all relevant facts are known, so that all possible explanations, except a single extremely improbable one, can properly be eliminated. That state of affairs does not exist in the present case: to take but one example, the ship sank in such deep water that a diver's examination of the nature of the aperture, which might well have thrown light on its cause, could not be carried out.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The third reason is that the legal concept of proof of a case on a balance of probabilities must be applied with common sense. It requires a judge of first instance, before he finds that a particular event occurred, to be satisfied on the evidence that it is more likely to have occurred than not. If such a judge concludes, on a whole series of cogent grounds, that the occurrence of an event is extremely improbable, a finding by him that it is nevertheless more likely to have occurred than not, does not accord with common sense. This is especially so when it is open to the judge to say simply that the evidence leaves him in doubt whether the event occurred or not, and that the party on whom the burden of proving that the event occurred lies has therefore failed to discharge such burden.”</p>

In the vast majority of cases where the judge has before him the issue of causation of a particular event, the parties will put before the judge two or more competing explanations as to how the event occurred, which though they may be uncommon, are not improbable. In such cases, it is, as was accepted before us by the appellants, a permissible and logical train of reasoning for a judge, having eliminated all of the causes of the loss but one, to ask himself whether, on the balance of probabilities, that one cause was the cause of the event. What is impermissible is for a judge to conclude in the case of a series of improbable causes that the least improbable or least unlikely is nonetheless the cause of the event; such cases are those where there may be very real uncertainty about the relevant factual background (as where a vessel was at the bottom of the sea) or the evidence might be highly unsatisfactory. In that type of case the process of elimination can result in arriving at the least improbable cause and not the probable cause.”</p>

In my view, it is important to remember this because it removes or reduces an approach which considers the overall question from the standpoint that someone with the opportunity to injure a child has to show that he or she did not do so. Again, in my view, the approach of the local authority and the guardian, at times, came perilously close to this. The correct position is that a medical view as to the most likely cause of injuries is that that cause is clearly established as a real possibility that has to be considered, in all the circumstances of the case, together with the other possibilities, in determining whether a child was the victim of an inflicted injury.</p>

On existing authorities, in these proceedings, the truth or otherwise of such an assertion by parents is determined by an application of the civil standard, and if the court concludes that it is more likely than not that either or both of the parents did not injure R by shaking him, then that is thereafter, as a matter of legal policy, treated as fact.”</p>

As you have heard, experts carry out examinations and some conduct tests to see whether they yield results which are relevant to the issues you have to consider.  They are permitted to interpret those results for our benefit, and to express opinions about them, because they are used to doing that within their particular area of expertise. You will need to evaluate expert evidence for its strengths and weaknesses, if any, just as you would with the evidence of any other witness. Remember that while experts deal with particular parts of the case, you receive all the evidence and it is on all the evidence that you must make your final decisions.</p>

The answer to that is yes. I do not think that it was helpful for the judge to embark upon a comparison with the direction which is given in criminal cases to jurors when they are dealing with expert evidence. Those directions no doubt are designed to remind jurors that the ultimate decision is for them, that the expert evidence must be evaluated and that if they disagree for a reason with the expert's conclusion they must do so, but that is to say no more than is the common coin of all litigation and jurors do not give reasons; judges do. In the context of a child care case, the judge is the decision maker, the expert is not. Where there is as here undisputed expert opinion evidence, the judge ought not to reject it without sound and articulated reason. This judge said at paragraph 171 that it was for him to weigh the evidence of Dr Gillett and the guardian in the context of all the evidence both oral and written in the case. To the extent that he parted company with the evidence or recommendations of Dr Gillett or the guardian, he recognised that he must give his reasons.”</p>

I fear that will not do. In a case such as this where the expert evidence, and here the expert evidence of the radiologist was all one way, the judge is certainly entitled, if he has evidence that he can rely upon to the contrary, not to accept that evidence. In my view he did not have that evidence in this case. He did not, in particular, have evidence that made the uncontroverted medical evidence logically unsupportable. The judge failed to analyse the evidence and give any reasons. The credibility or otherwise of the lay witnesses on the facts of this case, in my view, cannot stand so high as to make the evidence of the two consultant radiologists of no effect.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“‘Credibility’ involves wider problems than mere ‘demeanour’ which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be.  Credibility covers the following problems.  First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person?  Secondly, is he, though a truthful person, telling something less than the truth on this issue, or, though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue?  Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so, has his memory correctly retained them?  Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over-much discussion of it with others?  Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist.  It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active.  For that reason a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred.  Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance.  And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, it is so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken?  On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness.  And motive is one aspect of probability.  All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process.  And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.”</p>

The concept of inflammation has been around for two and a half thousand years or so and the microscopic correlates of that have been around a long time since the microscope was introduced and we started to develop microscope sections and staining with dyes and all of these sort of things when the macroscopic changes, which were well-known, were correlated with microscopic changes and it is a well recognised sequence of events which has been well catalogued and well documented for, well certainly there are good descriptions in the 19th Century but certainly the 20th Century was associated with a proliferation of documentation and completed our understanding.</p>

The science of histology is actually done by causing an injury, typically to an animal, then causing the death of the animal so many hours later and looking at it.

So I often get tissue taken within half an hour to say one hour of major surgery and I can confirm that they are often very much filled with polymorph neutrophils. So those cells do get there very, very quickly. They are a nuisance to me because they hamper my interpretation of that tissue.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Q. <marker name="tab"/>Publication? - A. Publication bias. People tend to go into print with the more extreme end and more dramatic end, I am not talking about the media now I am talking about in medicine, in science to get something published in the scientific literature it has to be eye-catching for the editor and the journal readers. So you have this bias. So it is perfectly possible that people who are involved with fatal cases report them and write them up and then cases where it is still a very serious matter, please do not misunderstand me, but say the child has a few bruises and a torn fraenulum and nothing else that is very unlikely to get written up. Indeed if the child, as I explained in my experience, the child got a torn fraenulum from falling off a slide in a children's park that is definitely not going to be written up. So there is this inherent skewedness I think that one has just got to be aware of. All one can say is of all the cases published in the world they do a trawl of the whole English speaking world literature.</p>

Because in most instances resuscitation occurs around the time of death with some degree of maintenance of circulation, or at least intermittent forced movement of blood within vessels, there is every possibility of producing extravasation of blood to the tissues that is indistinguishable from true bruising. “</p>

He also notes that “there is a lack of published histological studies of bruises of a known age”. He remarked that “probably one of the best [histological studies] was conducted on bruises on sheep”, and went on to state that “using Bayesian analysis of histological features it was concluded that bruises could only be aged as 0 - 20 hours or 24 – 72 hours with any accuracy”.

When D was very young, about 4 months old, he purchased from Halfords a “bike-buggy” which is an enclosed trailer for towing children behind a bicycle. F says that an instruction leaflet stated that the buggy was safe for children up to 6 months, and said nothing about the need for helmets. However, printed prominently on the back of the buggy are these words: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">These warnings are not visible when the buggy is folded up. F says that he never noticed these prominent inscriptions until very recently, which is, to say the least, surprising. He admits that, with M’s agreement, he would take D out in the buggy from a very young age, on Wednesdays, when he would be at home, and on one day at the week-end, and ride at speed, he said at up to 30 mph, over forest trails, bouncing over stones and tree roots. (Obviously, this asserted speed of 30 mph is exaggerated. It is the speed of a galloping sport horse. Professor S, who is a dedicated cyclist, has never been faster than 29 mph, downhill, on a light weight racing cycle). When S was born he would strap them both in, and I have seen a picture of S, aged 6 months,  slumped in his position in the buggy with the side of his head positioned against a hard(ish) fibre strut forming part of the canvas canopy, and with D’s head resting on his (within Exhibit 16). There is a video taken on a mobile phone (Exhibit 14) showing F preparing the children for a high speed ride in the buggy without helmets over forest trails punctuated by tree roots. F now admits that this was very careless on his part. The experts Professor S, Dr L and Dr H would go further and would characterise F’s conduct as seriously reckless and neglectful.</p>

Drugs (adrenalin) and fluids were ingressed, and blood samples were taken by 9.30 a.m., this being the time the earliest sample was received by the laboratory.

She saw the radiographer massage open S’s hands in order to X-ray them. [The radiographer] also made a statement (she too was not required to give oral evidence). She confirmed that the hands were beginning to stiffen through rigor mortis and that she gently massaged them open. She states that as she was working on them she noticed dark blue colouration towards the centre of the palm which appeared to be bruising. She did not notice any bruising to the backs of the hands. She also noticed scabbing to the toes, bruises on either side of the forehead and a bruise to the left ear.</p>

Death in this context means the irreversible cessation of natural circulation and respiration. In the context of vigorous resuscitation there is obviously a grey area between life and death, as there is generally. Medically, the period of the death throes is referred to as the agonal period. This can go on for some time. Rigor mortis, the stiffening of the body’s muscles after death, is a biochemical change that can only occur after death. The ambulance crew noted stiffness in the jaw consistent with rigor mortis, as did Dr at the hospital.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">After death, a sequence of changes naturally occurs in the human body. Although these changes proceed in a relatively orderly fashion, a variety of external factors and intrinsic characteristics may accelerate or retard decomposition. Understanding common postmortem changes and the variables that affect them allows the forensic pathologist to more accurately estimate the postmortem interval (PMI) and to provide a time frame during which death occurred. Further, an awareness of common postmortem artefacts limits the risk of misdiagnosis at the time of autopsy. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Postmortem changes begin soon after death and progress along a timeline. Two processes, putrefaction and autolysis, begin to alter the body; either one may predominate, depending on the circumstances surrounding death, as well as the climate. Putrefaction involves the action of bacteria on the tissues of the body. This process, prevalent in moist climates, is associated with green discoloration of the body; gas production with associated bloating; skin slippage; and a foul odour.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Autolysis is the breakdown of the body by endogenous substances. It proceeds most rapidly in organs such as the pancreas and stomach. It may predominate in more arid conditions and can eventually result in mummification.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In most circumstances, autolysis and putrefaction occur in tandem. In temperate climatic conditions, they can result in rapid degradation of the tissues. These alterations may eventually produce great distortion of the body after death, hampering the interpretation of the postmortem findings but not ameliorating the value of the autopsy.</p>

It should be remembered that the estimated period for the arrival and passage of these manifestations of the decomposition process is based on studies under very controlled conditions, including a temperate climate (i.e., 75° F). </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Although there is quite a lot of variability in the time schedule of common postmortem changes, all bodies eventually decompose to some degree. The physical and biochemical alterations, when considered in concert with a thorough medico-legal death investigation, may allow one to estimate the PMI. Estimation of the time of death is a critical component of forensic death investigations, but it is an imperfect science. Unless a death is witnessed, it is usually possible to provide only a time window during which death could have occurred. </p>

She is part of a team of professionals overseen by Dr K2 that is activated whenever there is a Sudden Unexpected Death in Childhood. The object is to gather information ostensibly to help the parents to come to terms with their bereavement and to assemble data to see if the incidences of such deaths can be reduced. Her notes are recorded in a workbook. It is clear that if suspicious information were obtained it would be shared with the police although this was not made clear to M and F and no warnings were given. I have seen a leaflet which has come into being since 2008 (Exhibit 3) which seeks to explain the reason for the intervention. It states that “all of the information we gather will be treated with the deepest respect and in strictest confidence”, which is inexact inasmuch as suspicious information will be shared with the police.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence of Dr P falls, up to a point, into the category of psychological/character evidence. His role was to undertake the “care of the next infant” (CONI) a nationally recognised programme for the care of subsequent babies when a previous child has suffered a cot death. The CONI scheme recognises that for a minority of cot deaths there may be predisposing factors indicating NAI. Thus a paediatrician must exercise extreme vigilance in relation to the care of the next child. As such he participated in child protection review conferences held in relation to S2 and knew of the grave allegations made concerning S and D. He had also heard things from medical colleagues. In his evidence he stated that the p<span style="color:#000000">arents were open about the background to S’s death; they were wanting answers. He was able to build up a reasonable picture as to what had been found in relation to S; it corroborated what he had been told by the parents. He understood the collective anxiety as regards unexplained injuries. D was extremely bright and responsive. The parents risked wrapping S2 in cotton wool. S2 was a happy lively normal baby; he had no concern about S2’s or D’s emotional or physical development.  The parents were still coming to terms with S’s death. They had good days and bad days. Nothing in the clinic concerned him; they did not appear avoidant, and he was looking very hard for that. They did not deny the existence of the injuries; or to seek to minimise them. He scrutinised them very closely.  He would be razor sharp as regards any injury to S2: “I have on each and every occasion been satisfied that his physical emotional and developmental care has been appropriate and of a high standard”.</span></p>

F, who had brought him in, did not know how it had happened. There was no mention about bruising to his right ear, nor was there mention of his feet. He stated that if there was any cause for concern this would have been recorded; there was no such record. It was not a suspicious NAI. He did not “take that away” from the consultation.

She confirmed that she had no concerns in relation to any bruising or marks. NC3, who cared for S, recalled that she noticed bruising to S’s left ear. She spoke to M about it and was told that he would have to go back to the Doctor if it did not go down. She cannot recall any other marks or bruises to him.  NC4 was S’s key co-ordinator. She recalled M bringing a bruise to S’s ear to her attention, on an uncertain date.  She did not remember which ear, nor did she remember the exact date of the conversation.  She remembered M asking if she had noticed anything but said it was not there when S was previously picked up from nursery.  M told her she presumed S must have banged his ear in his cot.  She said S did not appear to be in distress and was his normal happy self.  She remembered the next time S came to nursery the bruise was still there but she could not recall if it was worse or better, nor could she recall whether the conversation took place on either a Monday or Friday, but the second time he had attended with a bruise he had apparently been taken to the doctor (although she had this information from another member of staff).</p>

When the medical team stopped working on S they noticed his fraenulum was torn; that both of his ears appeared bruised; the left ear was worse, like a cauliflower ear.  He had hydroceles and an umbilical hernia.    He thought Dr B told him about the torn fraenulum and they both thought it might have been caused by the airway.

I have recorded above how she participated in the visual survey, and how she took samples from the body. She did not recall any marks of any nature to S’s hands. In her oral evidence she confirmed she had been with S throughout except when he was with his parents, when the nurse accompanying them was with S.  She described how to get a line in and demonstrated holding a hand to smooth the skin on the back of the hand to put the line in.  With children she said you would usually hold the wrist and it was unlikely that you would hold the hand although you may hold the fingers to extend the back of the hand.  She said it was to smooth the vein on the back of the hand and did not require a lot of pressure. A photograph was taken of how the hand would have been held (Exhibit 11). If using the feet you would hold just above the ankle.  She was shown the medical photographs of S’s ears and said she could remember the ear looking like that but could not specifically remember the other bruises.  In respect of the bruising to S’s forearm she said it did not look like it could have been caused by holding his arms during resuscitation as it was high up.  She looked at the photographs of S’s right foot taken at autopsy (Nos. 526-536) and in respect of 535 she said she could not remember if the backs of the toes were checked.  She could only remember the abrasion on the big toe and she certainly did not recall seeing the little toe. </p>

It is recognised that sudden and unexpected death can occur in infants for which a cause cannot be determined. Many of these deaths fall within the definition of sudden infant death syndrome. However, in this case S was older than the common age range for SIDS death and there were a number of injuries about the body which, although have undoubtedly not contributed to death, cause concern and therefore it is most appropriate to classify the death as unascertained. </p>

Histological examination of these lesions showed underlying vascular lesions which have developed as a consequence of a developmental anomaly and are therefore hamartomas. Within the smaller lesion on the right ear there was evidence that there had been some bleeding in the past as there was haemosiderin within macrophages. The left ear showed haemorrhage with some iron deposition. This may be as a result of recent bleeding or may simple represent the lack of resolution of an earlier episode of bleeding. The presence of bleeding has occurred as a consequence of some degree of trauma to the ears although given the presence of the underlying leison this may be relatively minor trauma in nature. </p>

Microscopically the presence of fibrin and an acute inflammatory cell reaction with neutrophils which have migrated away from the vessel indicate that this injury has occurred during life and not as a result of resuscitation attempts. The histological appearances indicate that this lesion has not occurred around the time of death. These features have been described as early as two hours but it is generally held that these changes indicate that the injuries occurred four to eight hours prior to death. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The post-mortem examination has documented a number of bruises about the body. Some of these injuries (injury 15 and injury 22) are undoubtedly older as they were brown in colour and, in the case of injury 15, from the right hand, histological examination has shown the presence of Perl’s deposition indicating some degree of resolution. The presence of Perl’s positive iron suggests that the bruise on the back of the right hand has been present for at least approximately 3 days. The most concerning bruises, however, are those to the palms of the hands (injuries 13 and 16). The palm of the hand is a difficult place to cause bruising and as such significant trauma would be required to lead to the damage to the blood vessels which leads to the bleeding. Histological appearances of these lesions again indicate that they have occurred during life and not in the time immediately leading up to S's death. The ageing of these lesions is similar to that seen in the fraenulum. As it stands, I am unaware of any explanations having been provided for these injuries and in the absence of such explanations these injuries strongly suggest non-accidental injury. <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11.5pt">It </span>is likely that these bruises were not apparent during the earlier examinations of the body as they were relatively deep bruises which have developed over a period of time. On the left forearm there were two purple/brown bruises with yellowing at the edges (injury 22). The colour of the bruising indicates that it has been present for a period of time greater than 18 hours. The positioning on the arm is suggestive of being caused by a "nip" or pinch. There were a number of other bruises to the body including the head and around the eyebrows. Whilst these all were minor injuries in themselves, no explanation for these injuries has been provided to my knowledge </p>

Although some features would suggest that S has died as a result of sudden infant death syndrome his age and the presence of the bruises around the body preclude its classification as sudden infant death syndrome and the death remains unexplained. A number of injuries has been documented with significant injuries to the hands and fraenulum which have undoubtedly occurred during S's life and most likely predate his death by a small number of hours. Whilst these injuries have not in any way caused S's death their very presence is seriously concerning.”</p>

One of the bruises on the back of the right hand was red/purple in colour and histological examination suggests that this bruise had been present for at least three days based on the presence of Perl's positive material. The bruising to the palms of the hands is concerning. The palms of the hand and the palmar aspects of the fingers are an unusual place to see bruising as due to the nature of the tissues involved bruising to the palm is difficult to cause. Given that there were also bruises present on the backs of the hands, the most likely cause of the bruising to the hands is some form of compressive blunt force. Possible mechanisms of injury include stamping or standing on the hands and also the trapping of the hands between unyielding surfaces. The injuries themselves had no specific features to indicate which of these were the most likely.</p>

They have, the neutrophils having moved, have been described as early as 2 hours but it's typically considered that these changes are 4 to 8 hours old. …</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Q. <marker name="tab"/>In relation to the palm bruises just one further matter please at page 12 of your report. Towards the bottom of the page just level with the lower hole punch, a little lower you say "It is likely that these bruises were not apparent during the earlier examinations of the body as they were relatively deep bruises which had developed over a period of time." Can you expand upon that please and perhaps bring into that your own experience of the development of certain bruises? - A. It is not uncommon for an initial examination to not document a bruise. That is not to say the injury wasn't present, it is just that it is not evident at the skin surface. So often for instance if you bang your thigh you might not see a bruise initially, you know it's sore but the bruising develops over time and it comes to the surface. And that part of the process does still continue after death, so we do still see some bruises that were not present at the initial examination. So for in this case for instance in Accident and Emergency in a child being resuscitated that are evident at the post mortem. Again we see it sometimes between two different post mortem examinations, we may see further bruising having come to the surface as it were. In other areas of the body, such as to say the shin, you would expect the bruise to be evident immediately simply because the damage is so close to the skin. So typically we do not see, some of the bruises that don't come out are the ones that are actually in the deeper tissues as it were. </p>

JUSTICE MOSTYN:   If a patient is being resuscitated and being given adrenaline and CPR and intubation does that keep these processes going, even though a person may be dead. I mean are you artificially alive for these purposes? - A. It very much depends how quickly after death resuscitation takes place. So if you have resuscitation taking place for instance in a hospital setting where you have been seen to collapse so resuscitation is almost instantaneous then yes to some extent you will get a little bit of continuation. In most situations in the community we do not see somebody collapse, and therefore the body has already effectively shut down before resuscitation starts and resuscitation will not restart the process. …</p>

Dr. H is an expert in this area of the body and looking at these changes down the microscope so her experience will be far more tailored than mine is. Therefore, if her opinion is that these are trauma related I think that is most likely the case. Dr. L again has a great deal of experience and I would agree that if he believes that they are trauma related, purely trauma related then I wouldn't argue against that. I looked at them, I was concerned that there was a natural component underlying it, but that I have said that the bleeding was trauma related.</p>

The histological appearances suggest that it only occurred a few hours prior to death. It is in general very difficult to bruise the palms of the hands because of the nature of the tissue which is relatively fibrous. <span style="font-family:Arial">It </span>is not something that is easily done and does not occur after any sort of trivial<span style="font-size:20.5pt"> </span>traumatic event. The sort of forces involved would make any event which produced this bruising memorable to witnesses. <span style="font-family:Arial">It </span>is possible that the bruising was caused by the hands being bitten but the only part of the injury which has appearances to particularly suggest this is the row of three small blue bruises on the back of the right hand. The other bruises do not in any way show any specific type of pattern to indicate a particular cause. <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11.5pt">It </span>is possible that they were caused by biting but if so a little surprising that the skin on the back of the hand was not broken. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In my opinion it is more likely that some or all of the bruises were caused by the palm of the hand being hit forcefully whilst the back of the hand was resting against something, or alternatively the hands being trapped and squashed in something like a door. Bruising to the palms of the hands in infants is distinctly unusual. The absence of any memorable accidental explanation and the presence of bruising on the palms of both hands rather than simply one are both highly concerning features which make it extremely likely that these injuries were deliberately inflicted.”</p>

It is important to point out that bruises are invariably non-specific – i.e. they give no clue(s) as to their cause.

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">It is said that the main reason why bruising only rarely involves palmar surfaces is that in these areas, dense fibrous tissue and restrictive fascial planes prevent the accumulation of blood, and that, as a consequence, and in order to create significant bruising, considerable blunt forces are required.  In contrast, the tissues over the back of the hand are much more lax, and, therefore, relatively easier to bruise.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In her second statement, Dr. J says that, in her opinion, “the most likely cause of the bruising to the hands is some form or compressive blunt force.  Possible mechanisms of injury include stamping or standing on the hands and also the trapping of the hands between unyielding surfaces”.  I can not disagree, but my professional experience of stamping on hands (albeit in adults) is that the resulting bruising is more severe over the backs of the hands, and that the bruises are not as discrete as those seen here.  In the same way, and for the same reasons, I would have though that trapping of the hands would also produce bruising which was more severe over the backs.</p>

Again, I can not disagree with this suggestion, but I think that if these palmar injuries had been produced by biting, the amount of force required for their causation would also have produced overlying abrasions and/or superficial lacerations from the edges of the teeth.</p>

If so, then it would mean that, as far as the bruises on the palmar surfaces are concerned, the hand would have had to have been held open whilst the injuries were inflicted.  Under these circumstances, it is at least possible that a single, forceful blow with a weapon could produce bruising in more than one location – thus, for example, a blow with a linear weapon could have caused the bruising on the palmar aspects of the proximal phalanx of the right index finger, the proximal phalanx of the right middle finger, and the middle phalanx of the right ring finger.</p>

In my own personal experience over 25 years, I have only seen the kind of swelling and discolouration described in the photographs following traumatic injuries in older children and adults as a result of contact sports.  I describe my experience now of two medico-legal cases when either the child concerned or a sibling had a skull fracture and where very abnormal appearances of the ear as described in this case were seen. One of these case were attributed to something called a pseudocyst of the auricle, a condition which neither I as an experienced paediatrician nor an experienced ear, nose and throat surgeon nor an experienced dermatologist had seen or considered. Given the appearance of blood at the time of post – mortem within the lesion within the ear, I think this idea of pseudocyst is even more implausible in the case of S. Dr J has raised a possibility of hamartoma but it does not seen to me that would fit either the temporal sequence or the appearances. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">This is the second case I have been involved in where a child under 8 months of age has presented with marked swelling and reddening of the ear and on both occasions the swelling contained blood. On one occasion the presenting child incurred a skull fracture and in this present case, the sibling had a skull fracture. I have never seen this appearance in any other children of this age. Everyone who has given contemporaneous descriptions in both cases described what appeared to be bruising or a cauliflower ear (typical of that seen from trauma in contact sports such as rugby). Expert witnesses in both cases have concurred that they have never seen such appearances other than due to trauma. However, in the first case, the court eventually attributed the appearances to a rare cause due to pseudocyst of the auricle (which itself may be a consequence of repeated slapping) and in this second case the possibility of a hamartoma has been suggested. I am concerned that I have never seen such appearances in my whole career in an infant due to natural causes, nor have I met or heard from anyone else who has. In contrast, in both of these two cases, there were other reasons to be concerned about trauma.</p>

I think I am the only person in the proceedings that I have read who has raised the possibility that the foot infection is not solely a fungal infection, but the appearances could be consistent with a bacterial infection. That then leads to the hypothesis that if those bacteria got from the feet into the bloodstream they could cause an overwhelming illness and death. I think that is possible but not probable for the following reasons. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Q. <marker name="tab"/>Yes please? - A. The first is that the pathologists found no evidence of a cause of death and indeed would probably have ascribed this by exclusion as a cot death had they not found injuries which they could not explain. They didn't find evidence of the cause of death. The second is that a high lymphocyte count whilst probably a sign of stress in this case, if it was an infection would suggest a viral infection. Whereas bacteria would cause the white cells to be raised. I think the third reason and least compelling of the three actually is that S by all accounts appeared to be well when put to bed and not overtly ill when seen at 5 a.m. I say least compelling because it is plausible that bacteria getting from his feet into his bloodstream could cause a fever and we know that fever can contribute to cot deaths but wouldn't explain the other features found in the case and children can deteriorate very rapidly. And in a dark bedroom at 5 a.m. and brief cursory contact with the child it might not be apparent to a parent that the child had developed a fever, an infection.</p>

Having explained them in more detail does your view remain that in terms of the likelihood of there having been a severe infection here it is unlikely and, as you clarified earlier, not marginal not close to a balance of probabilities? - A. Let me be absolutely clear what I am saying. I do not think anyone has suggested that a cause of death has been found in this case, and I am quite clear I think in my mind that had the injuries not been found I suspect, it is for you to ask them, but I suspect the pathologist would have said that this was a cot death. Rather older than the average and it's summer which is unusual, but it happens. It is possible that, we know that cot deaths can be precipitated by overheating and we know I think from reading their evidence that S probably had a cold or upper respiratory tract infection running up to this night, that in itself could be enough to cause a temperature and to cause overheating. If in addition he had some blood poisoning easy to imagine a high fever coming on in the middle of the night and leading to a cot death. That is going towards cause of death. To my mind it does not explain the unexplained injuries that were found at post mortem and clearly it does not explain the torn fraenulum or the other injuries in the other two children which is for his Lordship to decide whether they were fact or not, not for me. So I want to be absolutely clear that I am trying to assist the Court as to potential mechanism and cause of death.</p>

Is that a fair summary of your evidence? - A. Yes. I will not repeat it, I gave 3 reasons why I think it is unlikely that there was an overwhelming septicaemia, but I accept it's a possible precipitant of a cot death. I have said that even if that were the case it doesn't explain these other findings. The idea of a what we call a coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis it is a terminal event of an overwhelming infection and this doesn't look like this in my experience. …</p>

Well there are a small minority of conditions which are incredibly rare, subacute bacterial endocarditis, SBE, is a condition that you can be walking around for weeks. You are not well, you are unwell, but you don't drop dead and die. But leaving that aside blood poisoning in children tends to be overwhelming and they deteriorate very rapidly and become ill incredibly quickly and are very, very ill, I would say within 24 hours. … And just to be absolutely clear for the record, if S had had SBE that would be something that would be very apparent on post mortem.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">As a generalisation my experience is that parents are rather assiduous observers of their children, particularly young children. We teach medical students to listen to the parents, they are telling you the diagnosis. The basis of that maxim is that no-one knows their child better than their own parents. So we listen carefully to what they say. They dress their children, they bathe them, they feed them, they are in intimate contact with a young child if not quite 24/7 almost so. So they tend to be good witnesses of what is going on in their child's life, yes</p>

It ought to have been presented for medical attention, is that your opinion? - A. Well let me answer that in three ways. My experience would suggest that most parents, this is a generalisation, would present a child with unexplained bruising to the ear, or at least ask advice. Not least because it might betoken some of the underlying diseases that we may come back to and we have been discussing in these other reports. Secondly, they might not seek attention if they witnessed and knew how it was caused. So if they saw a sibling strike that baby on the side of the ear with a cricket bat and saw the injury caused, no they might not seek attention because they might quite legitimately say well he has got a bruised ear and we know how it was caused and do something to stop it happening again. The third thing would be that they did behave like most parents in my experience, come July they did seek medical attention for something that was clearly troubling them. That would be my experience of most parents, in a young infant they wouldn't ignore this.</p>

The rest of S’s results, in particular the lymphocyte count, were grossly abnormal and, although likely to be artefactual changes (due to the dying process) they were also consistent with the possibility that S had developed one of the acquired blood disorders (other than a platelet disorder). There was a range that was possible on the results seen, in particular consumptive coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

I have considered carefully whether this degree of vascular proliferation could represent an underlying lesion. Reactive vascular proliferations (either due to injury, trauma or inflammation) are very common findings in routine diagnostic histopathology I believe that the degree of vascular proliferation seen in this ear lesion is in-keeping with that.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">There was, however, a mild systemic lymphocytosis and the CSF gram stain also suggested a lymphocytosis, raising the possibility of viral meningo encephalitis, possibly related to the prior URTI. It would be interesting to know whether the post mortem examination of the brain and meninges revealed any abnormality consistent with this. I note that limited pre mortem virology of conjunctiva, and post mortem virology of lung tissue was negative. I cannot comment further on this as I am not a Virologist.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In conclusion, none of the microbiology cultures are suggestive of infection, so it is unlikely that his death was due to bacterial infection. This seems to be confirmed by the non-specific post mortem findings. Up to 20% of children carry <span style="font-style:italic">Staphylococcus aureus </span>in their noses as a normal commensal. While this can, and frequently does, become pathogenic and cause infection, there is no evidence this happened here. The only evidence of possible infection is the lymphocytosis which would, I believe, be compatible with a meningo encephalitis. Such a diagnosis is a possible cause of death but should have been obvious at post mortem. I am not a virologist, so cannot comment further on this aspect of the case.</p>

They involve the infliction of very serious injuries to a young child, and, indeed, include an allegation of causing that child’s death. The nature of some of the injuries which the court is being asked to consider is exceptional. The injuries to S’s ears and palms are outwith, or virtually outwith, the experience of the medical experts who have given evidence in this case.  Moreover, the allegations are made against parents who have been very highly regarded by those who have known them or assessed them. They have been seen to be loving, caring and committed parents. Non accidental injury, particularly the cruel and vicious nature of some of the actions of which they are suspected, appears to be starkly out of character. </p>

Later there were also attempts to unfold S’s hands (which were beginning to stiffen with rigor mortis) for the purposes of the radiological survey of his body.

Yet, upon scrutiny, she says, it can be seen that there has been little scientific examination about the production of neutrophils, and none in young children or babies. She relies upon the limited and less than categorical writings that I have referred to in my section on the histological science. She says that there is a possibility that S died as the result of an overwhelming infection, either bacterial or viral. If so, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that increased cytokine production may have caused post mortem production of neutrophils.</p>

It is a terrible allegation for these parents to have had to face. On the Local Authority case, one of them would have had to have been up in the night and have inflicted very serious and cruel injuries (in some unknown manner) to each of S’s hands, caused the tear to his fraenulum and other injuries, and then after at least two hours one or the other parent in some other assault would have had to have killed him. It is a wholly improbable scenario to say the least, given what this court knows about these parents, although, as I have pointed out, if the parents did in fact commit the gravest form of GBH on this tiny baby then it is a remarkable coincidence that a couple of hours later he should have suffered a completely unconnected cot death.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms S QC argues that there is a real possibility that S may have had some infection which led to his death. The microbiology is, she submits, ambiguous. There certainly is evidence of staphylococcal infection in two blood samples which if genuine would represent bacterial infection in the blood. The view is expressed by the lab that they are probable contaminants, but there is no way that can actually be established one way or the other. It is simply a matter of inference. Dr G is not an expert in microbiology relating to babies or in sudden unexpected death in infants (SUDI) and thus was unaware of the recent paper “<span style="font-style:italic">Difficulties in interpretation of post mortem microbiology results in unexpected infant death: evidence from a multi disciplinary survey"</span>, from the highly respectable sources of Great Ormond Street and the UCL Institute of Child Health London. This paper points to the fact that whilst post mortem microbiological investigations are recommended in SUDI cases, there are no current evidence based guidelines for the interpretation of the results. It points to the fact that data suggests that there may be an underlying infection related systemic process in a proportion of cases despite the absence of histological evidence of infection. Their findings emphasised that, at present, interpretation of microbiology results varies amongst specialists and is based on opinion rather than objective criteria. There is at the moment no gold standard test. <span style="font-family:Verdana">Dr G also drew attention to the possibility of S having a serious viral infection because of the high level of lymphocytes. </span></p>

He should have made himself aware of the instructions and followed them. He accepts that. In truth, the appearance of the ear was puzzling. It went up down and then up. It did not cause S any pain or discomfort. S was taken to the doctors about it after it had increased in size again. F was told advice would be sought from the hospital. He was then told it was a haemangioma.   In other words, there was a natural cause. Once the parents had received that advice, it is not surprising that they did not look for an accidental cause of the appearance of the ear thereafter. They would not have had to think about it again until the question of non-accidental injury to the ear was raised following S’s death.  Then they became aware of Dr J’s’ view that it was a harmatoma. In reality this father is never likely to use the bike buggy for such a young child or in such a way again. Nor would M let him. </p>

Finally in her section entitled “piecing the picture together” she submitted that as is so often the case, the approach of the medical experts (and pathologists) is that, unless parents can establish an accidental cause for an injury which may have been inflicted, a conclusion should be reached that the injury was non-accidental. In this case, the approach of the local authority has been similar, despite this being contrary to the legal position.</p>

The practice of sitting with an assessor has fallen into disuse (notwithstanding that the procedure for appointing an assessor has recently been reiterated in FPR 2010 r25.14), and thus the role of the representative of the Guardian in a case such as this cannot be overstated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">The injuries to the palms, which are the most serious of all, and which can be regarded as a touchstone, are shrouded in mystery. The surface area of the palm of a seven month old infant is very small indeed. No-one, apart from Professor H has ever seen anything like these bruises. He has only seen them twice in people with bleeding disorders. Although Dr L posited that they might have been inflicted by a ruler or cane he admitted that their appearance did not really fit with that hypothesis. In argument I pressed Mr S to advance a likely mechanism but he just fell back on “repeated application of significant blunt force trauma” and declined to be drawn into specificity. So I am being asked to conclude that the parents inflicted with some mystery weapon, which no-one can visualise, repeated beatings on these tiny palms causing bruising the like of which none of these experts,  Professor H aside, has ever seen before.</p>

But it must always be remembered that it is not specific to the facts of the case, and in a way is even less specific than the psychological evidence that authority has said is likely to be generally unhelpful. That research shows that petechiae can be seen on the cheek, ear and trunk of children who have been deliberately slapped or struck, does not prove of itself that petechiae on <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> child was caused by a slap. That all the research shows that children under six months are very unlikely to sustain bruising does not of itself prove that <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> child sustained bruising non-accidentally. That research shows that nosebleeds in young infants are very rare does not of itself prove that <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> child did not suffer from nosebleeds, and that M was lying about that.

Tests have demonstrated a wide variation in the threshold for yellow perception in the population and sensitivity for yellow decreases with age …It has not been rigorously established when yellow appears in a bruise. The published study stated that yellow was not seen in a bruise that was less than 18 hours old….The study lacked rigour as it was based solely on the observations of the author, with no formal testing of inter-observer or intra-observer variation.”</p>

They also make it unlikely (but not impossible) that the commoner albeit relatively rare severe disorders of clotting factor protein deficiency e.g. Haemophilia A &amp; B were present in S.  The blood tests do not rule out the very rare disorders of platelet function, factor XIII deficiency and alpha 2 antiplasmin deficiency which are very unlikely due to rarity and lack of family history and lack of prior serious problems. These disorders can lead to very easy and sometimes spontaneous bruising.   The mother might be a carrier of haemophilia, and had passed the disease on to S, without her tests being abnormal. The majority of haemophiliacs present only once they are toddling. Haemophilia remains a possibility in S’s case. He had seen bruising to the palms such as this only twice in a long career, both times in patients with bleeding disorders, one a severe disorder. In his experience, it has more often been the case that children in whom non-accidental injury has been suspected have turned out to have a blood disorder than vice versa.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.17in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the orthodox histological evidence is powerful I am not prepared to rely on it to displace my conclusion in (i) above for the reasons set out by me above. I would venture to suggest that there needs to be consideration within the medico-legal community as to reliance on histological evidence such as this in the forensic process where there is such a dearth of research on humans, and, particularly, babies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.17in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not prepared to find that the parents neglected S in relation to his feet. They sought appropriate medical advice for what was certainly a fungal and possibly also a bacterial infection. It is clear to me that there had been a significant postmortem degeneration in S’s feet by the time the photographs of them were taken at the autopsy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">I am therefore left with two improbable explanations namely that S was brutalised and murdered by his parents; alternatively, that he suffered a sequence of pathologically unlikely events that gave rise to his injuries and overwhelmed him. This is a <span style="font-style:italic">Popi M</span> case. Just as the decision of the House of Lords left no-one knowing why the vessel plunged to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, so we are left here with no explanations for the injuries and death of S, other than those I believe were caused in the bike buggy. This is one of those very rare cases where the burden of proof comes (as Baroness Hale put it) to my rescue and so the parents are entitled to the return of Lord Hoffmann’s value of zero, namely that they will be <span style="text-decoration:underline">treated</span> in law as if they did not deliberately inflict violence on and to these children.</p>

But a suspicion or a risk is not enough on a fact-finding hearing, as the House of Lords so emphatically confirmed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.5in">I appreciate that the parents, and indeed the LA, want definite answers and I am sorry not to be able to supply them. I am only prepared to find on the 51% balance of probability test, having surveyed all the evidence holistically as the authorities mandate I must do, that I am not satisfied that these parents deliberately abused their children (as opposed to treating them recklessly in the buggy), or neglected or murdered S. Thus far I am prepared to go, but no farther.</p>
