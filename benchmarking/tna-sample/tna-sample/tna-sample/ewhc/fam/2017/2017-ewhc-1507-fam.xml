	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I am concerned with the resolution of a preliminary issue which arises in the context of litigation between former spouses whose marriage came to an end several years ago, although it has yet to be formally dissolved by Decree absolute.  They cannot agree upon the effective date of separation and that is one of the matters which I shall have to determine in due course.  Prior to its demise, the marriage had lasted for some 25 years or more.  It was, on any view, a long marriage.  The parties have two daughters who are now respectively 28 and 25 years old.  In the context of ongoing divorce proceedings, the applicant wife has applied for financial remedy orders.  Whilst her application was proceeding along a conventional course in its early stages, the disclosure made by the respondent husband in his Form E revealed the existence of an offshore trust which was set up in 2007 for the benefit of the two children.  His financial presentation was significant in terms of its impact upon these proceedings.  It is his case that, with his wife’s agreement, the vast bulk of the fortune which was built up over the course of their marriage was settled into the Trust for the benefit of their children shortly after their separation.  In its current form, neither the husband nor the wife are beneficiaries of the Trust.  The preliminary issue which I have to determine is whether or not this Trust is genuine or whether, as the wife claims, it is a sham and of no legal significance in terms of the computation of the resources which will, in due course, fall to be divided between them in the context of her financial claims flowing from the ongoing divorce proceedings.</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In terms of a practical outcome for this couple, the stakes are very high.  If the husband’s case is made out and the Trust is genuine and left undisturbed by the wife’s alternative application to set it aside by engaging the court’s powers under section 37 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, some £50 million will be removed from the overall computation of this couple’s accumulated family wealth.  The wife’s claim to an equal share in what they built up together through their marriage will be confined to a share in the value of the wealth which was not diverted into the Trust.  This would reduce her potential entitlement to c. £5 million in round figures.  If she succeeds in her attack upon the Trust, the scope of her claims will increase exponentially.  A separate issue which I shall need to determine is whether the husband has successfully alienated his wealth into the Trust or whether, as the wife contends, she had a 50% beneficial interest in one of the companies which now falls outside the terms of the Trust.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue may be simple to define but the litigation it has generated has been far from straightforward.  Enormous costs (in excess of £2.2 million) have been run up on both sides of the case and we are still only in the foothills of proceedings in terms of a final resolution of the wife’s financial claims.  The husband has made an open offer to attempt to engage the support of the corporate trustees (based in X country) with a view to reorganising the Trust so as to make financial provision for the wife from the trust funds either by adding her as a beneficiary or by carving out some form of sub-trust.  The (adult) children are independently represented in these proceedings.  They have taken legal advice and wish to remain entirely neutral in terms of the ongoing litigation between their parents.  The husband’s offer was unacceptable to the wife as the basis of settlement and/or further negotiations and thus it was that the case was listed before me for determination of the substantive preliminary issue which, by that stage, had been honed and refined into a series of separate issues and questions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Its forensic unravelling has involved extensive discovery of many thousands of pages of documents.  The core material which has been distilled into the six court bundles contains detailed pleadings of the parties’ respective cases,  many narrative statements with extensive exhibits, expert evidence in relation to the law of X country and valuation evidence of complex business interests owned by the husband or by the parties jointly.  Several documents in Y language have had to be translated.  There is parallel litigation in X country instigated by the rather bizarre intervention of an individual employed by the husband’s X country lawyer who has been referred to in the proceedings as a “whistle blower”.  The parties themselves have given extensive evidence going back over a quarter of a century in relation to events which occurred as they began to expand their family businesses.  Each has given conflicting accounts of the arrangements which were put in place in relation to the manner in which shares in the family businesses were allocated.  The evidence has been extensive and it has provided the platform for a no less extensive raft of legal submissions from counsel involved in the case. In addition to detailed written skeleton arguments which were available at the start of the case, by its conclusion after nine days I had over a hundred pages of written closing arguments in addition to a substantial bundle containing verbatim transcripts of the entire proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The preliminary issue was originally listed in June 2016 before Mr Justice Flaux.  Counsel had estimated that, depending on the extent of the oral evidence, between four and eight days would be sufficient to conclude the case and enable the judge to deliver judgment. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>The judge had only five days to deal with the case.  On any view, that was an impossible time estimate, as the judge himself acknowledged.  The matter was adjourned to a further hearing in December 2016 to which was allocated nine days of court time.  Despite the fact that two of the witnesses who were due to make themselves available for cross-examination did not participate in the hearing, we did not finish closing submissions until the final day of the hearing which coincided with the end of term.  I made the parties aware that I would deliver a reserved judgment as soon as I could but that listings in the new term were likely to mean that the Easter vacation (2017) would be my first opportunity to read back into the case and produce the judgment.  Counsel were gracious enough to accept that even their revised time estimate had been hopelessly inadequate but it is right that I acknowledge the fact that their clients have had to wait for longer than I would have wished to know the outcome of their preliminary issue hearing.</p>

	      </authorialNote>, in November 2015.  Mr Mark Warwick QC appeared on behalf of the second and third respondents, Y Trustees Limited and Miss PH, one of the directors of Y Trustees Limited and an employee of Mr EW, the husband’s X country lawyer.  He is instructed on a direct access basis by EW in his personal capacity.  In circumstances to which I shall come, Mr Warwick’s role in these proceedings has not been made any easier by the illness of Mr EW who has terminal cancer.  EW is a resident of X country.  Whilst he has made a statement in these proceedings and was due to make himself available for cross-examination via a video link with the court, Mr Warwick informed me before the commencement of the December hearing that his client was extremely unwell in an intensive care facility in a hospital in X country.  I had a medical certificate from his treating clinicians informing me of his treatment and prognosis.</p>

She is 55 years old.   Each has since acquired British citizenship. They met in 1980 whilst both were students at K University .  Two years later, in April 1982, they married in London.  Neither had any assets at that stage.  The husband was a trainee accountant and the wife was teaching.  Both continued to study in London.   She went on to obtain a Masters degree in education and a further degree in sociology.  The husband was awarded an MBA.  Their elder daughter, M, was born in March 1989 some seven years into the marriage.  Her younger sister, L, arrived to complete the family in April 1992.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By this stage this young couple had begun to sow the seeds of what was to become a successful property lettings business which would grow into a very substantial property investment portfolio.  Both worked very hard in those early days.  Notwithstanding the fact that she had a young child to care for (and later, two), the wife played a full part in their first business which was a property lettings agency.  She worked daily from the premises they leased to run the business whilst the husband continued his day job with a local firm involved with hotel and property management.  He provided some much needed cash flow whilst doing as much as he could to assist the wife in their new business venture.  Whilst there was some issue about the date from which he took on a full-time role in the business, I am satisfied on the evidence I have seen that in early 1992 he left his employment and went to work with the wife as the business continued to grow.  He has suggested in his evidence, picked up in previous notes prepared by his counsel for earlier hearings, that the wife’s involvement in the business came to an end after the birth of their second child.  I do not accept that evidence.  Whilst it is neither necessary nor appropriate in this context for me to make detailed findings in relation to her contributions to the marriage, I am entirely satisfied that she continued to be fully engaged with the husband in the running and operation of the family businesses during these early years. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By now, they had acquired a modest home in Enfield and a small portfolio of buy to let properties in London.  Initially, these were managed by a company called A Limited.  That company was wound up and succeeded by a second entity called B Limited which was incorporated in March 1994.  The issued share capital in that new company (1,000 shares) was held equally by the husband and wife.  From the outset, each held 500 shares in his/her own name.   They were both directors and I am satisfied from the material which has been included within the exhibit bundles that the wife played a full part in the day to day operations of the company.  She told me that she had always regarded the efforts which they both made inside and away from the home to be their joint contributions towards the future welfare and prosperity of the family.  She felt herself to be a full partner with the husband in the business and I accept that, for all intents and purposes, throughout these early years in London that is exactly what she was.</p>

In February that year, a company called C Limited  was incorporated in X country.  At that time, the family’s base was North London.  That was where they had a home and it was where most of their property investments were situated.  However, the husband’s evidence was that he wanted to expand the property investment business and he anticipated that there would significant tax benefits if the corporate vehicle for that expansion was offshore.  He had an old friend from his university days, FG, who put him in touch with his cousin who lived in X country.  He made an introduction to a firm of lawyers based in Q City in X country, I &amp; Co.  It is the husband’s case that the lawyers acquired a “shelf company” which, in February 1994, became C Limited.  He maintains that this was all done without the need for him to travel to X country.</p>

It is common ground that at that point in time, non-residents of X country were not permitted to be registered as shareholders of any company based in X country.  Any such share ownership had to be authorised in advance by the central bank of X country.  On 7 February 1994, three days before the incorporation of C Limited, I &amp; Co secured the necessary permission from the central bank of X country in these terms.  Two resident corporate entities (J Nominees Limited and J Secretarial Limited) would hold the issued share capital in C Limited as to 500 shares each and, in each case, as nominees of non-resident individuals.  There were various conditions imposed on the operation of the company which are not relevant for the present purposes.</p>

The wife maintains that it was always acknowledged and agreed by the husband that they would own the shares equally in the same way as they were equal shareholders in B Limited.  She relies on the fact that a little over a month after the incorporation in X country of C Limited, B Limited (in its new guise) was formally incorporated in England and each held 50% of those shares both legally and beneficially.</p>

The wife’s case is quite different.  In one of her narrative statements, she describes a meeting which she says occurred shortly after the incorporation of C Limited in February 1994.  She describes how she travelled with the husband to X country to meet with the lawyer who dealt with the formalities.  That meeting was attended by Mr and Mrs R. She recalls signing paperwork on that occasion which confirmed that both she and the husband each held a 50% beneficial interest in the company.  It was agreed that her sister-in-law and Mr R would become the new registered shareholders in place of J Nominees Limited and  J Secretarial Limited since they were then resident in X country.  She has produced a letter from the central bank of X country dated 20 July 1994 which confirms permission for the transfer of the shares into the names of Mr and Mrs R.

She has produced a significant amount of evidence to demonstrate the extent to which she was an active participant in what she regarded as the family business.  The family’s financial fortunes improved considerably.  They were able to send the girls to local private schools.

Upon incorporation, the shares were held in unequal proportions by the husband and a Mr V, an employee of the husband’s at B Limited.  However, within a matter of months Mr V had transferred his shares to the husband and wife in unequal proportions but on the basis that, as with B Limited, the shares were thereafter held as to 50% by the husband and 50% by the wife.  This company was used over future years to acquire a significant property portfolio in north London which is now comprised of forty-eight separate investments worth some £20 million gross (£10.64 million net) according to the single joint expert, Mr Jon Dodge.  Both parties remain equal shareholders in D Limitedalthough there is a live issue which I shall have to determine as to whether or not the husband has declared a trust in respect of his 50% shareholding.</p>

A hotel business, F Limited, was established in 2001 with the company returns showing the husband and wife as equal shareholders.  A subsidiary entity, G Limited, operates (under lease) five separate hotels.  .  Another company, H Limited, was incorporated in July 2000 but dissolved in 2001.  The initial shareholding in that company was issued in the husband’s sole name and it is relied on by Mr Glaser as an example of the acquisition of an asset which was not held by the parties in equal shares.  </p>

The husband says that the wife became unhappy and disillusioned with life in London.  She says that they had lengthy discussions about their daughters’ future education.  They were then respectively 13 and 10 years old.  She wanted them to experience the culture of Z country as part of the dual heritage which was the reality of their lives.  She travelled with the girls to Z country during 2002 to make enquiries about schooling.  The plan was that she would establish a home base in Z country and the husband would follow shortly thereafter.  Initially they rented a property in T City in Z country.  It seems that the husband commuted weekly between T City and London where he continued to take care of the family’s various business interests.  The home in North London was retained as the family’s London base.</p>

In June 2003, a new company called M Limited was incorporated in Z country.  As the official records show, each was held out to the authorities as a director and 50% shareholder although the company was a subsidiary of C Limited.  They acquired office premises in T City and over the next few years both residential and commercial office space was added to the company’s portfolio.

During all significant holiday periods, such as Christmas, Easter and half term holidays, she contends that the family returned to the North London home.

Thereafter, on his case, he travelled regularly to their T City home to see the girls but on the basis that the wife would voluntarily absent herself from the property so that he could spend time there alone with the children.  In the early days she stayed locally in a hotel but came back to the house daily to look after the family.

She told me during her oral evidence that the precipitating event behind her decision to formalise their living arrangements had been further altercations within the family during the early summer of 2007.  Their elder daughter was studying hard for her final examinations.  They were important because her results would determine her entry to university in London.  The wife had asked the husband not to visit during that period because she did not want the tension flowing from their marital difficulties to disturb their daughter’s studies. He refused to change his schedule and told her that, since it was his house, he would come when he pleased.  In order to avoid confrontation, she left the house and moved for a few days to a hotel near Town M.  That, for her, was the point at which she felt something had to be done.  She approached Mrs CM.  Following a meeting which the wife had with that lawyer, a document was produced.  The wife has exhibited a copy of that document to one of her written statements.  It is dated June 2007.

In relation to the London home, each was to have the right to live in the property for a total of six months in every year but on the basis that they would agree dates in advance so as to avoid any “coexistence of the two spouses”.

He maintains that Mrs CM drew up a second version of the agreement which dealt with future ownership of the houses in T City and London; the retention by the wife of her 50% shareholding in D Limited; and, crucially, her agreement that the shares in C Limited would “go to the kids”.  He claims to have signed a copy of the second version of what he believed to be a formal separation agreement.  His evidence in relation to what happened thereafter is unclear and, in some aspects, conflicting.  He stated that he brought a copy of the signed second version back to London with him.  It was placed in his wardrobe in the bedroom at the North London home but was subsequently “stolen” by the wife when she attended the property in 2014 (some seven years later) and removed a quantity of documents without his permission.

The husband has described in his written evidence how these discussions began in 2005.  He says that he told the wife that he intended to give his shares in C Limited to the girls although he accepts that there was no mention at that stage of a trust arrangement.

On her case, even that document was not signed because the husband, having read it, became agitated and threw it away.  She maintains that his account of the second, signed agreement is a fabrication which is designed to support his claim that she had agreed to the alienation of the C Limited shares for the benefit of the children.  She is adamant that there was never any such agreement.

The company’s banking arrangements were undertaken through Alpha Bank   As and when the husband saw opportunities to acquire properties he would raise loans with Alpha Bank using the equity in the existing portfolio as security.  The C Limited portfolio was managed by B Limited in London and over the years the underlying value grew exponentially as a result of subsequent purchases and an increase in the capital value of the existing portfolio which rose with the London property market.</p>

EW was responsible for setting it up.  It was incorporated on 28 February 2006 and 100% of the shares were immediately issued in the name of YT.  She was employed as an administrative assistant in EW’s law firm but it is accepted that, from the outset, she held the shares in N Limited on trust for the husband.  Both he and EW accept that, for all intents and purposes, the husband was the beneficial owner of N Limited.  YT was merely his nominee.  According to the written evidence of EW there was a contemporaneous trust deed in place (dated 28 February 2006) which reflected the trust arrangement in relation to the N Limited shares.  I accept that evidence since I have now seen a copy of that particular trust deed.</p>

Having said throughout (and prior to EW’s statement confirming its existence) that he did not have a copy of that 2006 Deed in his possession, the husband produced a copy of the same some 72 working hours before the start of the preliminary issue hearing (7 December 2016).  He claims that his accountant found the copy deed in a safe in his London offices.  He passed it immediately to his solicitors who sent it to the wife’s solicitors.  He has sworn a short statement explaining how this document came into his possession.  <span style="font-style:italic">This </span>copy Trust Deed identifies the husband as the settlor and YT as the trustee. (She, it will be remembered, was the registered shareholder of the N Limited shares which she was holding as his nominee.)    It is dated 28 February 2006 and records by way of recital the husband’s beneficial interest in the N limited shares and his entitlement to have those shares transferred into his own name “but for reasons of his own he does not wish to exercise at present such right”.  YT was directed to hold the shares on trust for, and at the direction of, the husband on the basis that he retained control over them.  Those trusts were subject to a default trust “to hold the said shares in trust for [the husband’s] legal heirs in the proporit8ions <span style="font-style:italic">[sic] </span>which they would be legally entitled to the same”.  The trust was deemed to end as and when the shares ceased to be registered in YT’s name.</p>

Whilst this document appears to be in the same form as that produced by the husband from his office safe, it is different in certain respects.  The version sent by PH has been signed by the husband: there are now three signatures on the document instead of two.  Some, but not all, of the typographical errors have been corrected.  Further, there is now an extra clause in PH’s signed version of the document.

N Limited  did not become the shareholder of C Limited  until some two months later on 11 April 2006.

These disclosures have had to be grafted onto the chronology established over many months by the pleadings and the written evidence.  They have, in significant and material respects, altered the evidential landscape whilst still leaving many questions unanswered.  The absence from the final hearing of the individuals who had the knowledge and ability to provide answers to these questions has not assisted me, or the legal teams, to find an easy path to the truth.  EW, it is said, was unable to attend as a result of critical illness.  TU, a long standing employee of his, was prevented from giving evidence as a result of a so-called “gagging” injunction which EW and/or his firm obtained in the courts of X country.  The evidence which emanates from TU goes directly to the existence and/or extent of the wife’s beneficial interest in the C Limited  shares from the outset (i.e. 1994).  EW’s late decision to submit himself for cross-examination in these proceedings arises in the context of a witness statement which he produced on the eve of the adjourned hearing before Flaux J in June 2016.  By way of exhibit to that statement, he produced two drafts of Trust Deeds which had been created in 2002 pursuant to instructions given by the husband which support, to an extent, the wife’s case in relation to beneficial ownership of the C Limited  shares and the evidence of TU.  It is this evidence which Mr Amos has described at various points in the case as “potential dynamite”.</p>

By this stage, it was the husband’s case that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and the parties were living entirely separate lives save for his visits to Z country to see the children.  It is also his case that the parties had by then signed the second version of a private separation agreement which governed not only the arrangements for the children but also the division of their financial assets.  The wife denies that any such agreement, signed or otherwise, existed and she claims that, whilst fragile, the marriage continued and they were working together to resolve their differences.  She was at this stage completely unaware, as I accept, of the practical steps which the husband was taking with EW’s assistance to place the C Limited  shares into trust.  I shall come on to consider separately whether or not there had indeed been prior discussions between them about this possibility.</p>

Assuming that the trust was created in 2007 where has the income of the underlying companies gone since then ?  How can the husband demonstrate since 2007 that he had no interest in the trust or the underlying companies ?  You should also refer to the X country law firm which originally established C Limited with J Nominees Limited holding 50% of the shares for [the wife].  At the time it was a requirement that non-residents have their shares held by resident nominees by permit from the central bank so an application would have been made to the central bank in the names of [the husband and the wife].  When the company was transferred to the office of [EW] the shares were held by YR (sister of [the husband]) for [the wife] and her husband QR for [the husband] 50/50.”</p>

	    <p class="msonormalcxspmiddle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">“I have reason to believe that [the husband] is now anxious for a settlement given the direction the case is taking and has already discussed this with his elder daughter, [M].  If I am right the offer amounts to something in the region of GBP10m in the unencumbered<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>property and the rental income therefrom.  In return for any and all shares [the wife] holds in any [family]-related entity.  One of the conditions of the settlement is that [the husband] is to be made third beneficiary of the alleged trust he created for his two daughters. This 2007 trust was an afterthought and a sham and a way of seeking to gain approval for the alienation of considerable assets by alleging these assets were held in trust for the two daughters of [the husband and wife].  There was never any trust in 2007, simply the desire of [the husband] to alienate assets from his wife.  As I have said, the company C Limited was created by a law firm in X country with two nominee shareholders for two nominee non-residents – J Nominees Limited and J Secretarial Limited and a search on the records of either the incorporating law firm or the central bank … or the Registrar of Companies will bear this out.  If the shares were only ever meant to be held by [the husband] why two nominees ?  Subsequently the shares (500 and 500) were transferred to the brother in law and sister of [the husband] and there are trust deeds evidencing that these were held for [the husband and wife] in equal proportions.  The originals of these trust deeds are now in an unknown location however electronic copies are on the computer system of [EW]. At no point to my knowledge or from a search on the files did [the wife] relinquish or transfer her half share in the company C Limited and I firmly believe no evidence that has not been fabricated can exist of such transfer.  I would need access to the records to confirm but to the best of my knowledge C Limited owned dozens of properties, predominantly in London and therefore GBP10m would be perhaps one tenth of the actual worth of the portfolio. In order to be more precise I would need access to certain files.  If I were [the wife] I would not accept such offer on the basis that the children who have been dragged into this sorry affair and are being used as pawns by the father, find it “reasonable” according to him.”</p>

Ms Loizou had informed TU in her email that she was aware from “the most basic of web search enquiries” that she knew her true identity and that she was an employee of EW.

Stewarts Law was invited, on the husband’s behalf, to concede the issue of the wife’s beneficial interest in 50% of the C Limited  shares despite the fact that TU had not had access to, and had not produced, the 2002 trust deeds to which she had referred in her emails.  The letter included a lengthy request for documentation arising from references in the emails.

The District Court of P City made the orders sought preventing TU from making any further disclosures in these proceedings or in any other context.  Within the material in the bundles for the preliminary issue hearing was a translation of the affidavit which he swore in support of that application.  It records that, bar one year from 2007 to 2008, TU had been in his employment as a personal assistant throughout from 2002.  A term of her employment was her obligation of confidentiality to the law firm and its clients.  It also refers to the fact that TU had access to all backup information and data for the firm and kept copies of back-up discs at her home “for safety reasons”.  Those discs contained all of the firm’s electronic files including their intellectual property.  It informed the P City court that proceedings were ongoing in the High Court in London between the husband and the wife and that Y Trustees Limited had been made a party to those proceedings.  TU had had access to “all information concerning the said case as well as the emails which were exchanged between the lawyers and the parties”.  The emails which she had sent to Ms Loizou were put before the court as evidence of her breach of duty.  EW said in his affidavit that “the reason that I do not reveal all these emails is because I believe that such a disclosure is very likely to further adversely affect our client’s, [the husband’s], case, as well as of the company itself and of [his law firm]”.  He further refers to TU’s reference to the existence in his safe of signed versions of the 2002 Deeds although his affidavit is silent as to the truth or otherwise of this statement.</p>

They argued that the emails were part of the “fruit of the poisoned tree” and, as such, were inadmissible as evidence.  On 13 May 2016, Moylan J dealt with a discrete hearing which had been listed to determine issues of privilege.  By this point in time, another of EW’s employees, Miss OS, had made a statement denying the assertion made by TU in the proceedings in X country that she (OS) had been the source of the information disclosed in one of TU’s emails to Ms Loizou, the wife’s solicitor.   Moylan J concluded that the husband had waived privilege in relation to any documents or files created in or from 2006 held by EW or his firm insofar as these related to the ABC Trust, the Deed dated 2 August 2006 and/or the management and control of the 2007 Trust.

His statement had been preceded by a string of requests from Stewarts Law, the husband’s solicitors, seeking disclosure of various documents which the court had ordered the husband to disclose.

It seems that Mrs R is currently in litigation of her own with her brother (the husband) over the ownership of an hotel in London:  brother and sister are not currently on speaking terms. She appears nonetheless to have remained on good terms with the wife. Mrs R told the wife, according to her evidence, that she did not wish to get involved in these matrimonial proceedings in case her involvement were to impact on the outcome of her own litigation with her brother whether by way of settlement or otherwise.  The husband told me, in contrast, that he did not believe his sister would have been willing to assist the wife because she knew that she was seeking to mislead the court in relation to her beneficial interest in the C Limited  shares.  </p>

He points to the fact that, at the relevant time, his client was asserting a ‘collateral use’ privilege in relation to them.  I take that point on board but nevertheless there is little doubt in my mind that the husband was determined if he could to exclude from these proceedings evidence of the 2002 deeds.  I have already referred to the arguments run by his legal team at the “privilege” hearing before Moylan J when an attack was launched on the emails from TU.  EW himself appears to have accepted that her evidence in relation to the existence of the 2002 Deeds was potentially damaging for his client in the context of the English proceedings: he recorded as much in his evidence to the P City court.

It was suggested to him that the only reason he had not done this was because he knew there was material within those files which was detrimental to his case in relation to the wife’s asserted beneficial interest in C Limited .   In this context, he was asked why, within the space of less than 24 hours, he had been removed as a beneficiary of The ABC Trust when he had signed a document the previous evening at his sister’s home confirming his status as a beneficiary.  His response to Mr Amos was that “it was really just chance” <span style="font-style:italic">[Transcript: 16.xii.16 – page 198]</span>.  He denied that he had been excluded as a protective measure in the event of any future claims by his wife or to protect his position in relation to potential tax consequences.  He said that he had not considered the possibility of a future application to vary the terms of the trust in an English or any other court as a nuptial settlement.   In terms, his case is that the change which was made overnight from 2 to 3 August 2007 to the terms of the Trust was not in any sense a reflection of a desire to protect his position in circumstances where he perceived the marriage to have irretrievably broken down <span style="font-style:italic">[Transcript: 16.xii.16 – pages 198 to 199]</span>.   </p>

In this context, the question as to <span style="font-style:italic">whether</span> or not the deeds were executed in 2002 is of secondary importance to what happened in 1994.  The wife’s case rests on the arrangements or transactions in 1994 as corroborated by both the 2002 Deeds and the evidence of TU.  As I have said, the year 2002 coincided with the time when the parties had agreed to trial an arrangement whereby they spent much more of their time as a family living in Z country.</p>

Her disclosure of confidential and privileged information (which she knew to be so) cannot be justified on any basis however helpful it might have been to the wife or those advising her.  I do not know whether she took the action she did because of her own experience of a difficult divorce (as EW surmises) or whether she was, in part, motivated by the expectation of some financial gain at the end of the day.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus by this point in time (2007) we have a situation where a formal Deed of Trust (The ABC Trust) has been drawn up, executed and sealed.  The husband is not a beneficiary and, on the face of the instrument, he has purported to transfer or deliver to the trustee (Y Trustees Limited) or otherwise place under its control (i) all the shares in N Limited  , and (ii) his 50% shareholding in D Limited.  (Pursuant to the transfer by Mr and Mrs R on 11 April 2006, their 50% nominee shareholdings in C Limited  were thereafter owned by N Limited .)  Only the two children are named as beneficiaries of the Trust.  As at 3 August 2007 they were respectively 18 and 15 years old.  EW, as the named Protector, is given power under the terms of the Trust to appoint new trustee(s), a new Protector and to consent to the addition of new beneficiaries.  In default of such addition, the parties’ daughters are named as both the beneficiaries (as to 50% each) and the default beneficiaries.  In terms (clauses 12 and 15), the husband is left free to continue to manage the underlying trust assets without further enquiry from the trustee unless it has actual notice of any act of dishonesty on his part.  All decisions pertaining to the management and operation of C Limited /D Limited are left in the husband’s hands, including the decision whether or not to pay dividends on the shares.  There is a duty to maintain trust accounts and the operation of the trust is covered by a general umbrella of confidentiality.  Thus, there is no obligation on the trustee to disclose to the beneficiaries the trust accounts (unless they are specifically requested so to do). </p>

Indeed, that step was not undertaken until well after this litigation commenced.  In July 2015, EW sent the document to the X country Bar Association for formal stamping although even that administrative process was flawed because, on its first submission, the husband was shown as a trustee.  EW has said in his statement that it is common practice not to stamp or register such documents unless or until they are required for a specific purpose such as court proceedings.  Whilst the law in relation to formal registration did not require such formalities in 2007, there has, it seems, been a recent change in X country law which now requires registration.  This appears to be the reason advanced by EW for the submission of the Trust Deed to the X country Bar Association in July 2015.  This issue has been addressed by Mr P, the single joint expert, and I shall return to it at a later stage of my judgment.</p>

That step and the contents of the document which was drawn up show that, at the very least, the wife no longer wished to live in the same house as the husband whether in Z country or in England.</p>

In February 2008 she was admitted to hospital in Z country for some medical tests.  She recounts in her written evidence that the husband came with her parents to visit her in hospital.  They had what she describes as “a heart to heart” about their relationship.  She asked whether he had been having an affair and he allegedly confessed to having been unfaithful.  In her written evidence, she maintained that she nevertheless resolved to “make things work for our family”.  From documents which she has exhibited to her statement, it is clear that she continued to have some involvement in running the Z country operation of the B Limited business although that was finally closed at the end of 2008.  M Limited still held a portfolio of properties in T City and these were managed by the wife on a day to day basis.  In November 2008 she travelled to London to try to sort out the issues which had arisen in the day care nursery business.  Her evidence was not the subject of serious challenge and I accept that she continued her involvement with the family businesses in this way notwithstanding the fact that she and the husband were no longer living together.</p>

I accept that she had been shaken by his admission of infidelity and I accept her evidence about the hospital visit in February 2008.  She accepted when cross-examined by Mr Glaser that it was at about this time that she began to realise that their marriage was beyond repair.  In June that year, in an attempt to get to the bottom of their financial situation and the manner in which he was running the companies, the wife instructed a firm of Z country lawyers (L &amp; Co) based in T City to make enquiries in relation to C Limited .  Because C Limited  was registered in X country, she was advised that a law firm in that jurisdiction should be instructed as local agents to carry out various searches.  A firm called RS &amp; Co was instructed for that purpose.  The firm maintained offices in central P City and carried out a company search in the local Register of Companies which revealed that N Limited  was the registered owner of the shares in C Limited .  The wife’s case is that this came as a complete surprise to her.  She had believed that the shares were still held by her sister-in-law and her husband.  She knew nothing about N Limited  until a new company search revealed that the sole shareholder was Miss YT whose registered address was the same as EW’s offices in P City.  Up to this point in time, the wife had had no dealings with EW.  However, on 17 June 2008, RS &amp; Co wrote to EW on her instructions.  I have a copy of their letter within the bundles.

In his written statement EW acknowledges that he received that letter from RS &amp; Co although he recalls that it was an enquiry on her part about the Trust.  He has been unable to trace his copy of the letter.  I am entirely satisfied that, as the husband has accepted, it was not an enquiry about the Trust but about her asserted 50% ownership of C Limited .  Be that as it may, those enquiries seem to have come to nought.  EW never met with the wife to discuss these matters and she does not appear to have attended an appointment.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is not without note that the husband could readily have provided that authority.  By his own admission, he never told the wife about the Trust.  He told me that he had presumed that RS &amp; Co would have informed her about the trust arrangements which had been set up in 2007.  However, it is clear that their enquiries went no further than the formal company searches they were requested to undertake.  Despite the letter asking for an appointment to visit EW’s offices, there was – as is accepted – no response from EW.  As the husband has made clear, he was contacted by EW at the time but did not give him any authority to take the matter further or communicate with the wife or her X country lawyers (acting as agents for the firm in T City).  In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in finding that the wife knew nothing about the Trust or the various changes in share ownership other than those revealed by the formal searches in 2008.  I accept her evidence that she raised these matters with the husband informally but that he, too, provided her with no information.</span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By 2009 the wife describes the husband’s attitude to her as one of open hostility.  His visits to Z country had ceased and, after the early part of 2009 she was no longer sleeping at the London family home even in the husband’s absence.  In February 2009 she came to London to accompany her father who was undergoing a number of medical tests.  She remained a director of B Limited and used her visit to London as an opportunity to remove and/or copy a significant quantity of paperwork in the files which were kept at the company’s offices.    These she delivered to an accountant called Mr B who was asked to look at the documents with a view to assisting her to understand what was going on within the business.  The wife told Mr B about what she had learnt the previous year as a result of her lawyers’ enquiries in X country about share ownership.  She told me that she had not instructed him formally in his capacity as a professional accountant but as someone she had met through a friend.  Because he knew the husband socially, she thought they might find some common ground to move matters forward.  She had two meetings with Mr B.  Her husband attended the second meeting. He told me he had checked his diary and the meeting took place on 22 May 2009.  They both accept that this meeting was not successful.  It lasted about an hour and, at its conclusion, the wife says she was none the wiser about the state of their business and financial affairs.   She told me during the course of her oral evidence that Mr B had told her that what she needed was the original documentation from 1994 evidencing her beneficial ownership of 50% of the C Limited  shares.  She had implored Mr B to accompany her to a meeting at the North London property to speak to the husband about her predicament in order to <span style="font-style:italic">“persuade him how to find a solution and ask him, “What’s going on with N Limited  ?” and also if it’s possible to give me my paper as a document, as a copy”</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">[Transcript: 14.xii.2016 page181]</span>.  She said that during the joint meeting, her husband had told her that she owned nothing.  At its conclusion she was told by Mr B that he could not assist her any further and that her redress lay with the courts.</p>

He describes her as being extremely distressed during the course of their first meeting.  He says that, for the purpose of her first visit, he had secured copies of the accounts for the various companies from Companies House because she did not hold those records.  He describes the second meeting which the husband attended as wholly unproductive.  There was a good deal of arguing and both the husband and the wife apparently ended up in tears by its conclusion.  Whether or not the husband’s recollection of the date of the second meeting is correct, it is perhaps not without significance that the wife was removed as a director of B Limited in March 2009 shortly after she had attended the offices for the purpose of retrieving the documents and paperwork which she was to give to Mr B.  </p>

He had provided him with additional paperwork over and above that removed from the offices by the wife.  He accepts that he made no mention during this meeting either to the wife or to Mr B of the second separation agreement they had reached, on his account, in 2007.  He told Mr Amos in cross-examination that his copy of that agreement remained in his wardrobe at the North London property.  Presumably, on his case, it was there on 22 May 2009 when this meeting took place.  Yet for some reason which I confess I do not understand he made no attempt to meet the wife’s entreaties for information by producing this document and reminding her that they had settled all these matters two or three years earlier when she agreed that he should pass his interest in C Limited  to the children. That would have been the opportunity to explain to her that their joint intention, reflected in the agreement, had been carried into effect through the structure of The ABC Trust.  He did not do that.  He said nothing at that meeting about the agreement.  It seems to me quite extraordinary that, if what was done in August 2007 in setting up The ABC Trust was part and parcel of an agreement between them, he did not use that meeting with Mr B and the wife as the opportunity to remind her about their (allegedly) joint decision to give C Limited  to the girls.  It appears to be common ground between the husband and wife that nothing was said about an agreement on that occasion and, in my judgment, the omission is highly significant.  </p>

At that point in time C Limited  and its subsidiary companies were carrying just under £19 million worth of loans against approximately £45 million worth of assets.  The husband began to explore alternative avenues of financing the business.  He had discussions with Beta Bank and with Gamma Bank.  An employee of that Bank, KC, had previously worked for Alpha Bank and she was familiar with the C Limited  property portfolio and its operation.  It appears that the husband’s discussions with Beta Bank came to nothing because the Bank was unhappy about lending to C Limited  in circumstances where the shares were held by another company, N Limited .  He has produced an email dated 4 March 2014 which he sent to Mr A at Beta Bank confirming that the beneficial owners of C Limited  were his two daughters.</p>

As part of her obligations to complete the bank’s ‘Know Your Client’ anti-money laundering procedures, KC had asked the husband to provide further details about C Limited  in terms of its status as the proposed borrower.  By email dated 3 March 2014, the husband had emailed to her an organogram showing the corporate structure and N Limited ’s holding of the shares through Y Trustees Limited.  There was no reference to the Trust on that document.  By an email reply sent the same day, KC asked the husband to confirm who EW, PH and another director were and to identify the ultimate beneficial owners of the various companies.</p>

During the course of that meeting, he alleges that KC told him that the bank would only be prepared to lend if the shares were held by a person rather than by a trust company.  As a further condition of any lending, the Bank would need to be satisfied that he (the husband) was the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares because they knew him to be a good businessman with an established commercial track record. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following this meeting, the husband had discussions by telephone with EW.  A strategy was devised whereby N Limited  would transfer the shares to PH (EW’s office employee) and EW would then create a new Trust Deed which recorded that she was holding the shares on trust for the husband.  This plan was duly put into effect.  On 20 March 2014, the shares in C Limited  were transferred from N Limited  into the name of PH.  The following day, on 21 March 2014, the husband and PH executed a new Deed of Trust which EW had prepared.  This document recorded the husband’s beneficial entitlement to all 1,000 issued shares in C Limited .  It included a recital that he was entitled as of that date to have the entire shareholding transferred into his name but for reasons of his own, he did not wish to exercise that right at present.  Accordingly, they were to be held in PH’s name as his trustee.  She, in her turn, acknowledged that she was holding the shares for his benefit absolutely.  Their signatures were witnessed on the deed and, on 2 May 2014, EW signed a stamped pro forma confirmation that the copy document produced to the Bank was a complete and accurate copy of the original which he had seen.  It is quite clear to me from reading that Trust Deed that, bar the particulars of the parties and the recitals, it is in typical format to other similar trust documents which EW produced during his earlier involvement with the husband and C Limited .</p>

On behalf of EW, PH sent it to the husband on 21 March 2014, the day after she became the legal owner of the shares.  Her email refers to the intended preparation of a “trust agreement” between the husband and his two daughters to reflect their status as the true beneficial owners of the C Limited  shares.  Only her signature appears on the document which was emailed through to the offices of B Limited in London later that afternoon.  The husband told me during the course of his oral evidence that, although they had intended to prepare further documents making it clear that the beneficial interest in C Limited  belonged to the girls, those steps were never taken.  He told me that EW had advised him that there was  no purpose in doing so since the 2007 Trust was irrevocable and the 2014 Deed was irrelevant insofar as it purported to say something different.</p>

He acknowledges his, and – by implication – EW’s, complicity in this wrong doing but contends it was his only means of saving the companies from financial collapse when they lost their banking facilities with Alpha Bank.</p>

I have not seen any attendance note of the meeting with the bank on 18 March 2014 and I do not know what grounds those discussions covered.  It is right that the Bank, through KC, sent a brief email to the husband on 10 April 2014 enquiring whether the amended company structure was finalised.  She indicated in that email that she needed to pass the same to her compliance department and to the Bank’s solicitors.  However, I have significant doubts about whether or not I can place any reliance on the husband’s evidence that the Bank itself was complicit in the fraud.  It seems to me to be an inherently unlikely proposition particularly in the highly regulated environment in which the financial and banking sectors were then operating.  In my judgment, it is highly likely that the true scenario at the time was that either the bank expressed concern about the lack of clarity as to who owned C Limited  beneficially or they were unhappy about lending in circumstances where the husband was not the de facto owner of the corporate structure.  It was, after all, his track record and KC’s previous client relationship with him which had apparently influenced the Bank’s decision to consider his application for refinancing. </p>

The husband has admitted as much to me.  Although I have not heard from EW, I have reluctantly reached the conclusion that the same must be true of him in this instance, and notwithstanding his professional status, since it was he who prepared the 2014 Trust Deed knowing full well what he believed to be the irrevocable nature of the 2007 settlement.  In certifying the Trust Deed and the corporate organogram as true copies of the original documents, he must be taken to have known that they were going to be submitted to the Bank for lending purposes.  Thus, whilst Mr Warwick QC reminds me of the distinction between certifying that a document is a true copy of the original and certifying the truth of the contents of a document, I take the view that it is a distinction which does not, and cannot, exonerate either the husband or EW in this instance.  It is, perhaps, of note that EW’s witness statement contains no reference whatsoever to the creation of the 2014 Trust Deed.</p>

EW had no hand in the preparation of this document.  It was prepared by a London lawyer who had undertaken some conveyancing work for the husband on previous occasions, Mr Y.  The husband describes the circumstances in which the Will was drafted.  He was about to depart on a holiday to Brazil for a fortnight.  He says that a number of his employees became concerned that he was going to a relatively unsafe part of the world and he did not have a Will in place.  He spoke to Mr Y the night before his departure and asked him to draw up a Will at short notice.  The husband gave instructions on its contents over no more than two hours when Mr Y came to his office that same night.  He intended Mr Y to make it clear in the Will that the C Limited  and D Limited shares were already owned by the girls and that everything else which he owned should also go to them in the event of his death.   Having signed the Will, he left it in a documents folder in the wardrobe at the North London home.</p>

By this stage, their elder daughter had left Z country and was studying at a university in England.  Through one of the property companies (D Limited), a property in Kent had been acquired for their eldest child’s use whilst she was a student.  Their youngest child had a number of health problems which included what have been described as sporadic psychotic episodes.

I am also prepared to accept her evidence that her discovery of a document which appeared to reflect a claim to 100% of the shares in C Limited  had provided her with the documentary evidence she needed to litigate her claims through the English courts.  She had been told on a number of occasions that she needed to establish a paper trail if she was to advance her proprietary claims to a 50% interest in C Limited  and in her own mind I am sure that she felt this might be a starting point.  She told me that she had been “so happy to find that piece of paper” because it gave her that first step on the ladder.  </p>

It does, perhaps, speak volumes about the husband’s attitude to her and his dismissal of the assistance which she had undoubtedly provided within the businesses at least prior to 2006.  However, I am satisfied that 2006 (being the point at which the husband considered the marriage to be over) did not mark the demise of those contributions.  It is a matter of record that even after Mrs CM had provided the wife with what I will call “the first version” of the Z country private agreement concerning the children and housing/living arrangements (on her case, the <span style="font-style:italic">only </span>agreement), the family business continued to expand.  The husband had ambitions, as we know, to grow the property business internationally.  For these purposes O Limited was incorporated in England in December 2006 and traded for a number of years, albeit unsuccessfully, before being wound up in 2013.  The wife has produced a copy of a formal ‘announcement’  in respect of the ‘B Limited’ company which had been incorporated in T City.  That company (B Limited) was incorporated on 18 January 2007 and it operated from premises inT City which were owned by M Limited of which both parties were 50% shareholders on incorporation in 2003.  Whilst the husband is shown on the official government ‘announcement’ as the company’s local representative in Z country, the wife and the husband are shown as the “representatives” of the foreign (i.e. UK) branch of the company.</p>

In this context she has produced contemporaneous documentation which shows that she was signing off on instructions to the company’s bank regarding the payment of staff wages and local taxes.  In addition, I accept her evidence that during this period she was continuing to run and manage the portfolio of properties owned in Z country by M Limited.  I simply do not accept the picture which the husband seeks to paint in the T &amp; Co letter in relation to this wife’s role in, and contributions to, the business.</p>

From his perspective, it might have limped along for a few more weeks or months as they explored the possibility of counselling or therapy but I accept that, by the summer of 2006, he had ceased to make any real investment in salvaging their marriage.  He describes the holiday at the beginning of 2007 to Vienna as a “disaster” following which there were no further attempts at reconciliation.  The fact that the wife may have had a slightly different subjective impression of this period does not necessarily mean that either party is right or wrong in their respective cases as to the effective date of separation.  It is often difficult to define with any degree of precision the actual date upon which parties have effectively “called time” on a marriage precisely because one of the spouses will often have a different perception of the prospects of reconciliation.  Many marriages may “limp on” for months, if not years, before one of the parties decides to “call time” on the relationship.  In a statement which he swore in October 2014 in support of an application to adjourn the financial aspects of the divorce, the husband said this:</p>

I accept that by the beginning of 2009 when the husband confessed his extra-marital affair, she herself relinquished that hope.  In this context, I accept that her attempts to shore up the failing property business in T City were part and parcel of her continuing effort to support the husband in his wish to see the company survive in Z country, albeit that those efforts to save the company were eventually unsuccessful.</p>

The total value of the assets disclosed by the husband came to just under £2.15 million, including his business assets.  Under section 4.5 in the box which required details of any agreements between the spouses, the husband made no reference to any agreement and certainly none which related to the C Limited  and his D Limited shares being placed in a trust or otherwise given to the children.    That document was completed under the guidance of his former solicitors, T &amp; Co, and before his present advisers, Stewarts Law LLP, took over his representation.  Despite the absence of any narrative explanation about these matters, it is right to record that the husband did exhibit to his Form E a copy of The ABC Trust.

The husband himself accepts that he did not tell her about the Trust in 2007 but presumes that she would have learnt about it from the enquiries made on her behalf by RS &amp; Co.  That cannot be right because, as I have recorded earlier in my judgment, neither the husband (nor EW on his instructions) was prepared to open the door to those enquiries in 2008.  The appointment for her to attend at EW’s P City offices was never made, as requested, and that line of enquiry was abandoned.   Whilst the husband has stated in his evidence that the telephone call he received from EW in 2008 reporting the approach from RS &amp; Co was specifically in connection with “questions about the trust”, the letter from RS &amp; Co refers only to her “50% stake in C Limited ”.  Just as I have accepted that the wife knew nothing about the Trust at this stage, I accept that there was no mention in the enquiries made of EW by RS &amp; Co about a trust.  Whatever EW may or may not have said to the husband at the time, I am satisfied that neither the wife nor her Z country or X country lawyers knew anything about the 2007 (or any other Trust) at the time they initiated their enquiries on her behalf.  Nothing was said about the Trust during the meeting which the parties had with Mr B the following year in 2009.  The wife was not informed when the entire share capital in C Limited  was transferred from N Limited  to PH in March 2014; neither, as I accept, was she informed about the “revised” (albeit sham) trust arrangements which underpinned the corporate restructuring in 2014. </p>

These were served on 23 October 2015 and it is right to observe that, from the outset of his oral evidence, the husband conceded that there were several mistakes in this document.  One such mistake was his pleaded case that the second version of the private agreement was prepared by the wife’s lawyer but never signed.  In his oral evidence, he said that this was wrong.  On his case, the second agreement <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> been finalised and signed by the wife and left for his attention on the dressing table of their family home in T City.  She had signed it and he had signed it.  He had taken it back to London and put it in the wardrobe in the bedroom at the North London property.  That second agreement had disappeared during his absence on holiday in September 2014.  On his account, at that time their younger daughter was staying with him and recovering from a period of illness.  When he left to go on holiday to Brazil, the wife had moved from a local hotel in which she had been staying to the London family home.  By the time he returned and discovered she had removed the copy of his recently signed Will, he also discovered that his copy of the second agreement was also missing.  As I have said, this evidence came as part and parcel of his examination in chief on the fifth day of the hearing as he corrected earlier mistakes in his pleaded case.</p>

In addition having given his shares in [C Limited ] and [D Limited] to the children in 2007 the Respondent will seek equality in the shareholdings in [D Limited] and a transfer of 25% of the shares.”</p>

In his third statement sworn on 13 March 2015, the husband says that divorce was never discussed during or after the separation in 2006.  He states that the only issues discussed and agreed between them was that the wife would keep the house in T City and that he would transfer his interest in C Limited  (described as “a substantial property investment company”) to the children which he did by means of the 2007 Trust.  Once again, there is silence as to the existence of any signed separation agreement prepared by the wife’s Z country lawyer which evidenced this alleged agreement.</p>

The husband’s account is inconsistent and has only emerged in the context of this litigation.  EW’s evidence is silent as to the existence of this agreement and I find that a surprising omission if, as the husband contends, it was that agreement which underpinned his instructions to ‘perfect’ the gift of the C Limited  shares to the children through the vehicle of the Trust.  Further, the husband made no reference at all to any agreement at the time of the RS &amp; Co enquiries or during the meeting with Mr B in 2009.  With some reluctance, I am driven to the conclusion that the husband’s case in relation to the second agreement is a complete fiction and I reject it out of hand.

They appeared to her as if they had just been printed and there were no receipts on the file confirming payment of the invoices.  There was nothing on the file to evidence the payment of the invoice which had been prepared in respect of EW’s services for the creation of the Trust in 2007.  The file also contained money laundering documents which had been provided by the husband and the two children in August 2015.  EW justified their comparatively recent origin as the result of an audit at about that time.  </p>

He told me that he had a meeting with [the husband] and his sister and brother in law at some point in 2007 which then led to the purported trust being created.  He told me that there had been some discussions prior to that about the creation of a trust although there was no evidence of this on the file.  He also told me about a conversation he had with [the husband] in which [he] had informed him that [the wife] was mentally unwell.  [EW] told me that he had advised [the husband] to protect “his” assets and put them into a trust.

As soon as the author of the emails had indirectly confirmed her identity, Ms Loizou and her principal, Mr Hodson, had declared the position to the husband’s solicitors.  When Mr Glaser sought to suggest to this witness that she should have taken these steps at an earlier stage, I intervened to prevent any evidence which might have invaded the firm’s legal professional privilege in terms of the steps it had taken or the advice which might have been sought in relation to TU’s disclosures.   Miss Loizou declined to breach her client’s privilege by dealing with Mr Glaser’s questions about whether or not consideration had been given to obtaining a search and seizure order in relation to EW’s safe or offices.</p>

The meeting had taken place over afternoon tea at The Sanderson Hotel in London.  Its purpose had been to establish what M knew about The ABC Trust which had recently come to light as a result of the husband’s Form E. During the course of her oral evidence, Ms Loizou was asked by Mr Glaser about how this meeting had been arranged.  She said that she had spoken to the wife and asked whether M might have an objection to meeting with her to talk about this development which she described as “the bombshell that had hit in the Form E”.  The wife had spoken to her daughter who gave her consent to the meeting in the full knowledge of what was going to be discussed.</p>

She had no knowledge about it before and knew nothing now about its administration.  She confirmed that she did not want anything from the trust and felt that her mother should certainly have some benefit on the basis that “the trust should be broken”.  She had further commented that “Dad sees the business as his baby and he is very defensive about it”.  Ms Loizou accepted that the words which she had quoted in express quotation marks were, to the best of her recollection, the words, or the gist of the words, which had been used by M on that occasion although she did not have the manuscript notes from which she dictated her attendance note.  I did not hear directly from M in relation to these matters and both she and her younger sister, L, now have the benefit of experienced representation at Irwin Mitchell.  For present purposes it is sufficient to note that the two girls are maintaining an entirely neutral stance as between their parents in this litigation.</p>

Each has levelled against the other allegations of dishonesty and attempts to mislead this court.  I have already made my findings in respect of some of these allegations and, in the main, I have found the wife to be a truthful witness, particularly in respect of her knowledge about the 2007 Trust and the existence – or otherwise – of the second separation agreement.  I am also prepared to find, whether as a result of cultural influences or as a result of the personal dynamics within this marriage, that the husband had a tendency to be controlling and overbearing at times.  There is no medical evidence before me that the wife suffered from any form of psychological illness, still less that she was bipolar.  She herself accepts that there were occasions when her relationship with her husband was difficult and strained and I have no doubt that at times she may have struggled with feelings of low mood and depression.  She clearly regarded him as holding most, if not all, of the cards in relation to the manner in which he was operating the family business in 2005 and 2006 when the marriage began to break down.  She is clearly angry that he has deceived her about the C Limited  shares and sought to alienate (as she perceives it) part of her just entitlement at the end of what has been a very long marriage.  She is angry, too, about his attempts to ‘air brush out of existence’ the significant contributions which I have found she made to the success of this business in its early days and beyond.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That said, these are fundamentally good parents who love their children and wish only what is best for them.  The wife is rightly proud of the steps she has taken to preserve the children’s close relationship with their father despite their estrangement as spouses.  The husband, for his part, has consistently maintained the family in terms of its financial wellbeing.  I accept his evidence (because it is borne out by the inaction of the wife prior to 2014) that neither contemplated the formal dissolution of their marriage through divorce even after 2007.  Leaving aside the wife’s case in relation to the absence of sufficient resources to pursue a full scale legal enquiry into what had happened to “her” C Limited  shares after 2009, this is not a case where the husband had sought to put any pressure on the wife financially during several years of separate existence.  It is much to his credit that he continued to support the family and ensure that the rhythm of life for the wife, commuting as often as she pleased between Z country and England, continued as before.  The children were fully supported through their tertiary education and, depending on the outcome of these proceedings, they are potentially the beneficiaries of very substantial wealth as a result of their father’s gift.  He has said that he trusts them to look after him as and when he ceases to be an integral part of the businesses and that may not happen for many more years if the girls are content to leave matters as they stand.  These are all matters which I shall need to consider in relation to the formation of the Trust which is at the centre of these proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was clear to me as I listened to the parties giving their evidence that each has been exhausted by the course of this protracted litigation.  It has been enormously costly and it has taken its emotional toll on this couple.  There were times when the wife was unable to contain her emotions and the husband wept openly at the conclusion of his evidence.  I acknowledge and accept that the husband places significant trust in, and reliance upon, EW and what he is told by his friend and lawyer.  He clearly shares a relationship of confidence with EW and I am in no doubt, despite what the husband told me, that he will on past occasions have discussed with his friend his own perceptions of the wife’s psychological frailty.  The husband’s own evidence at the beginning of these proceedings signals loud and clear his deeply held opinions about her entitlement to share in the financial fruits of their family businesses.  It is abundantly obvious to me that, having left in her hands the home in T City and her shareholding in D Limited amongst other assets, he believed that he had met whatever financial entitlement she may have at the end of this marriage.  I am entirely persuaded that these are discussions he has had in the past with EW and that those discussions found reflection in what EW had to say to Ms Loizou when she saw him at his office in X country in September 2015.  I accept her evidence on this point entirely notwithstanding the absence of EW from this hearing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the end of last year, no doubt with advice and encouragement from his new solicitors, the husband made his open offer whereby he conceded that the 2007 Trust might be varied with the consent of the children and the trustee so as to include the wife and enable her to benefit in an appropriate way from the underlying trust assets.  I have encouraged these parties to find a way through this litigation and the enormously expensive “second round” which is likely to flow from my judgment in relation to the preliminary issue.  I still hope that may not be an empty aspiration on my part.  However, it is right to record in my judgment that, regardless of my findings in relation to the specific aspects of dishonesty which each of the parties makes against the other, by the time we came to the oral evidence which each gave to me in December 2016, there appeared to be a willingness on the part of both to assist me to understand their respective cases as they unfolded under the scrutiny of some acutely targeted forensic examination by Mr Amos and Mr Glaser.  The husband has admitted to several mistakes in the earlier pleadings.  He has accepted that aspects of his written evidence have in the past been misleading.  He has “put up his hands” to a fundamentally and (on his case) intentionally misleading series of representations to the bank in 2014.  I have rejected his evidence in relation to the existence of the second Z country separation agreement but I approach my task in relation to the circumstances surrounding the creation of The ABC Trust with an open mind and a complete overview of <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the evidence which is available to me.</p>

	    <p class="msonormalcxspmiddle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">“In respect of a trust governed by X country law, a consideration to be analysed is the settlor’s reserved powers.  A prerequisite for the creation of a trust is the transfer of legal ownership to the trustee.  If it can be shown from either the nature or the amount of powers reserved to the settlor that the transfer cannot be said to have occurred because the intention of the parties [i.e. the settlor and the trustee] was for the settlor to remain effective legal owner and control the assets, the trust may be held void ab initio as a sham.  The issue is in identifying the point at which the settlor has retained so much control that it can hardly be said that she or he has relinquished any proprietary interest to the trustees at all.  In making such an assessment it is necessary to consider not only the number, but also the nature of the powers cumulatively that may infer a sham trust and the facts surrounding it.  So a settlor’s power to replace the trustees may alone trigger a sham risk whereas retaining the power to add to the class of beneficiaries and change the governing law may be permissible.” (page 21)</p>

Indeed, it would seem to me to require very unusual circumstances before the court held that a transaction which was not artificial was in fact a sham.  I add this.  If the court were to conclude that a transaction was artificial, in circumstances where the party relying on it was contending that it was not artificial, then that might be a further reason (although certainly not a conclusive reason) for deciding that the transaction was a sham, given that a sham transaction involves a degree of dishonesty on the part of the parties involved.”</p>

The principle has a particular resonance here because The ABC Trust is a bilateral trust where there is both a settlor (the husband) and a trustee (Y Trustees Limited).  This legal principle, as Mr P has confirmed, has the endorsement of the Supreme Court of X country.   This principle is derived from an English case decided by Rimer J (as he then was) in 2005.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Shalson v Russo </span>(2005) Ch 281, at 342, his Lordship explained the principle thus:</p>

One might as well say that an apparently outright gift made by a donor can subsequently be held to be a sham on the basis of some unspoken intention by the donor not to part with the property in it.  But if the donee accepted the gift on the footing that it was a genuine gift, the donor’s undeclared intentions cannot turn an ostensibly valid disposition of his property into no disposition at all.  To set that sort of case up the donee must also be shown to be a party to the alleged sham.  In my judgment, in the case of a settlement executed by a settlor and a trustee, it is insufficient in considering whether or not it is a sham to look merely at the intentions of the settlor.

In that case the allegation of sham was levelled by a wife against two discretionary trusts which held shares in a family business which she and the husband had run throughout a twenty year marriage.  The settlors were the husband’s father (who had originally established the business) and his brother.  The trustees had changed through the life of the trusts but were based offshore in Jersey at the time of the litigation which concerned the wife’s entitlement to ancillary (financial) relief arising on divorce.  The wife alleged that the trusts were shams and that the husband should be treated as holding a significantly enlarged share of the business.  In the alternative, she argued that the shares held within the trusts should be treated as available to the husband in accordance with the principle enunciated in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas </span>[1995] 2FLR 668, CA.  Munby J held that the wife had not even begun to make out a case against the original trustees as having been parties to a sham transaction.  Further, the two cases presented by the wife as alternatives in respect of the shares held within the trusts were wholly inconsistent with each other and involved diametrically different assertions.  The first proceeded on the basis that the trusts were shams and the second on the basis that the trusts were genuine.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>That observation is highly relevant in this case because, although the wife has not yet articulated her case on the basis of any <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas </span>arguments, she does invite me – should I find the 2007 Trust to be genuine – to consider what Mr Amos has described as her “fall back” application pursuant to section 37 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.  In other words, she asks me to find in the alternative that this was a reviewable disposition which was undertaken for the purposes of defeating her claims in the context of an application for financial remedy orders.  As Munby J acknowledged in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>, when the court is considering claims under section 37 of the 1973 Act, it is concerned with a document or transaction which is entirely genuine.  The purpose of the transferor is to do the very thing which the transaction purports to achieve, i.e. to divest himself of assets which are thereby put beyond the reach of his former spouse and/or the court.  Section 37 is merely a statutory mechanism whereby, in appropriate circumstances, the court is entitled to set aside a transaction which is otherwise entirely genuine.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no challenge to the formal legal status of Y Trustees Limited as a properly constituted X country trust corporation.  The company was incorporated in X country on 27 December 2005.  Its single shareholder and the registered company secretary is another X country company called Y Secretarial Limited.  The directors of Y Trustees Limited are EW and PH.   The thrust of Mr Amos’s attack upon the bona fides of that entity is that it is no more than a ‘creature’ of EW’s.  He is its controlling mind and, for the purposes of establishing the requisite intention to establish that the 2007 Trust is a sham, he submits that I can look to EW’s intentions as being one and the same as those of Y Trustees Limited.  Since Mr Amos says that the evidence points to a dishonest intention on the part of both the husband and EW, that is sufficient to establish the necessary element of sham.  In other words, each intended to give a false impression of the position to third parties or to the court.  The essence of the wife’s case, as advanced by Mr Amos, is that the 2007 Trust Deed was a meaningless piece of paper and was intended to be so:  neither the husband nor EW/Y Trustees Limited had any intention of transferring the legal or beneficial interest in the C Limited /D Limited shares held by the husband into the hands of the trustee for the benefit of the children.  Throughout, he submits, that interest has remained with the husband who has carried on his dealings with the companies in exactly the same way as he did prior to 2007.  The 2007 Trust, on the wife’s case, is no more than a pretence created to encourage the court to believe that the underlying value of the shares cannot be treated as a resource of the husband’s for the purposes of any sharing claim she may have in the current financial remedy proceedings.  Because the husband resists her claim to original beneficial ownership of 50% of the C Limited  shares, the husband has used the device of the Trust (says Mr Amos) to attempt to remove entirely from the underlying asset base 100% of the value in those shares which runs, as we know, to tens of millions of pounds.</p>

The wife’s Petition was not issued until seven years later.  Whilst she may not have considered the marriage to have irretrievably broken down by that point, it is clear, as I have found, that the husband regarded their relationship as having foundered by 2006.  There is no evidence that he sought advice at that stage in relation to the wife’s likely entitlement in the event of a divorce under either English, Z country or X country law.  I accept his evidence that he had no plans at that stage to formally dissolve the marriage by instituting proceedings in any of those jurisdictions.  However, that does not, without more, absolve him of a wish to protect his assets in the event of a future divorce.  One of the issues which I have to decide is whether such a desire to achieve that measure of protection in the future was part and parcel of a dishonest intent on his part and on the part of the trustee to deceive the wife and the court as to the true nature of the transaction and the terms reflected in The ABC Trust.</p>

Each has given evidence that The ABC Trust was never intended as a sham but was settled with the clear intention that the children of the family were to be the beneficiaries of those assets which were transferred into the legal ownership of the trustees.  In this context, the extent of the wife’s beneficial ownership of the C Limited  shares as at 2007 is a separate point.  Both Mr Glaser and Mr Warwick QC accept that the husband could not settle on the trustee property in respect of which he was not the beneficial owner.  I shall deal with this aspect of the wife’s case shortly.  First, it is necessary to consider whether the structure set up in August 2007 was itself a sham.  For these purposes, I accept that EW’s intentions are relevant because of his status as the director of Y Trustees Limited and Protector of the 2007 Trust.</p>

To an extent, she accepted this during the course of her oral evidence.  She told me that it was part of their national culture to pass on wealth to their children.  She acknowledged that, in due course, they both intended their children to inherit substantial wealth but she denied the existence of a separate and specific agreement to accelerate that benefit by means of an inter vivos ‘gift’ in 2007.  I have already found that, in this respect, the husband’s intentions were unilateral.  That fact, by itself, would not prevent him from making a genuine disposition of his assets through the vehicle of a trust since, absent a live claim by the wife at the time, he was perfectly entitled to deal with his own assets as he saw fit.  He sets out in his written evidence his wish to manage the transition of ownership to the girls efficiently.  He acknowledges that, given their ages (18 and 15 years old at the time), the business needed to carry on trading and he, in turn, needed to remain at the helm to manage it actively for their benefit.  He sought advice from EW as to how this could be achieved and EW suggested the possibility of a trust.</p>

He confirms in his statement that he had several meetings with the husband after N Limited  was incorporated to discuss how he might give part of his beneficial interest in C Limited  and D Limited to the children.  Ms Loizou records in her own evidence the separate conversation she had with EW in September 2015 that the idea in relation to the creation of a trust had come from EW in 2007.  She also contends that she was told by EW that part of the husband’s motivation for putting assets into trust was his desire to protect those assets in the event of future claims, a course which EW himself appears to have supported.  However, as is clear from the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">National Westminster Bank v Jones</span>, a desire to protect assets from third party claims is not sufficient, without more, to render a transaction a sham albeit that were such purpose the sole reason for the transaction, thus rendering it artificial, it might be a factor which the court would need to take into account.</p>

Nevertheless, I ask myself this question:  even if part (or all) of the husband’s/EW’s/Y TRUSTEES Limited’s intentions related to asset protection, who were they/it intending to deceive in 2007 ?    In order to qualify as a legal sham, I would need to find a common intention at the time of the creation of the 2007 Trust that the notional trust property was to remain throughout the husband’s property, as Mr Amos contends was in fact the case.</p>

She appears to have had a break of about a year in her employment in EW’s offices, whether as a result of illness or maternity leave, I know not.  Her emails leave open the possibility of either cause.  As I have already recorded earlier in this judgment, it is clear that she has ‘reconstructed’ a time-line which, in at least one instance, is entirely inaccurate.  I shall return to her evidence later in the context of the separate point relating to the wife’s alleged interest in 50% of the C Limited  shares but TU’s evidence is of little assistance to me in terms of what happened in 2007 because she was not there and was not privy to the discussions between EW and the husband nor does she refer to the existence of any contemporaneous documents such as attendance notes which might assist.</p>

Before turning to his submissions on the evidence, I need to deal with a preliminary observation which he made to me about his client’s position in relation to what he has called “round two” of this litigation.  It arises in this way.  If The ABC Trust is found to be genuine, it nevertheless has a resonance in these proceedings outside the limits of the preliminary issue which I am determining.  The husband has already made an open proposal to seek the support of the trustee and the children in varying the terms of the trust so as enable the court to consider its status as a potential ‘resource’ for the purposes of the wife’s claims.  Mr Amos contends that I should ignore this partial concession on his part because, by the time we come to ‘round two’, in the event of a finding that the Trust is genuine, he is likely to be contending that the assets under the control of the trustee are entirely quarantined in terms of the wife’s substantive claims for financial remedy orders.  He points to the lack of co-operation from EW in securing relevant documents in these proceedings and suggests that his client will be at a significant litigation disadvantage if I were to find the Trust was, and is, valid.  He submits that her position in this event will be “very heavily handicapped” <span style="font-style:italic">[Transcript: </span>20.xii.2016, page 83]<span style="font-style:italic">.  </span>It seems to me that point can be dealt with shortly.  </p>

The outcome in terms of my application of the law to the particular facts of this case is binary in its nature.  Either this was a genuine Trust or it was not.  On this issue, and subject to the separate issue of what went into the Trust at its inception, I have no discretion in terms of maintaining a level playing field for this wife.  Save in circumstances where her second application under section 37 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 were to succeed, I cannot at this stage concern myself about issues of perceived juridical advantage or disadvantage.  Even in the context of section 37 of the 1973 Act, I would have to be satisfied that the husband had set up the Trust with the specific intention of defeating the wife’s future claims for financial relief (i.e. by preventing orders from being made for her benefit or reducing the amount of any financial relief or frustrating or impeding the enforcement of any order which might be made by the court).  </p>

He describes him as both “the starting point” and “the finishing point” of the case.  He points to the fact that the husband had told me during the course of his evidence that he could rely on EW to sign documents as and when they were required.  Certainly, I have the evidence of EW’s involvement in the representations made to Gamma Bank in the context of the 2014 financial restructuring of the business.  Whether or not it is fair to characterise EW’s willingness to sign the stamped certifications of “true copies” of documents as active collusion with the husband in a deception practised on the bank, he was nonetheless prepared to advise the husband to sign documents which he knew to be untrue in terms of their underlying representations.  Mr Amos points to the fact that EW plainly has documents in files which relate to the husband’s professional relationship with his firm which he has removed from third party scrutiny.   In this context, I accept as true TU’s assertion in one of her emails to Ms Loizou that she had no access to some of the documents because they have either been removed by EW from the office or placed securely under lock and key.  Further, Mr Amos points to the significant omission in the list of documents produced on behalf of the second respondent, Y TRUSTEES Limited, in relation to the existence of the 2002 draft Deeds of Trust prepared on the husband’s instructions to record the wife’s beneficial ownership of 50% of the shares in C Limited .  I have reached the conclusion that the omission of any reference at all to the existence of these documents on the part of EW can only have been deliberate.  In his 2016 witness statement, he makes specific reference to the fact that his firm and Y Secretarial Limited (company secretary to C Limited ) have several thousand pages of documents relating to C Limited  and its property acquisitions.  He confirms that there is nothing in those documents apart from those exhibited to his statement which relate to the ownership of C Limited  or The ABC Trust.  Whilst I accept that this was the first time that EW himself had been willing to provide the English court with direct evidence of his own involvement in this matter, he is – and has been throughout – the lawyer who was acting for the second respondent in these proceedings.  As such it seems to me that I am entitled to conclude that he had seen, and approved, the list of documents which had been compiled by PH in November or December 2015 (the document in the bundle is undated) which was submitted to the English court on behalf of Y Trustees Limited.  EW does not say in his witness statement that the 2002 draft trust deeds were ‘late discoveries’.  Yet there is no reference to their existence in the list of documents notwithstanding EW’s knowledge that the issue at the heart of this stage of the litigation was the wife’s claim that she beneficially owned 50% of the issued share capital in C Limited .  I am aware that Mr Glaser has raised the point about a collateral litigation privilege but, if there is any basis for such a submission, it cannot rescue EW from a finding that he must have been aware that the existence of the 2002 Deeds was likely to be highly prejudicial to the husband’s case in relation to the beneficial ownership of the C Limited  shares.   </p>

This step took place in the context of Mr and Mrs R wishing to relinquish their previous role as the two shareholders in C Limited .  There were discussions between the husband and EW at the time as to whom those shares should be transferred.  Because EW’s firm was by then running the legal administration of C Limited , a decision was taken to keep everything ‘in house’ and transfer legal ownership of the shares to a new holding company which would also be run by EW’s firm.  That decision resulted in the incorporation of what was essentially a SPV<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

During his lifetime, they were for his absolute benefit and, in the event of his death, they were to go to his legal heirs “in the proportions which they would be legally entitled to the same”.  As I have already explained, there are two versions of this particular Trust Deed.  One was produced by the husband just before the start of the December (2016) hearing having been apparently found by his accountant in a safe at the London offices of B Limited; the other was produced from X country by PH as a result of a further disclosure order which I made on 14 December 2016.  The latter has been signed by the husband and YT and witnessed; the former only bears YT’s signature.  Both documents attest to the intention that he should be the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares in N Limited  but it is clear to me that the version found by the husband in London must be an earlier draft of the Deed which was eventually signed and retained in EW’s offices in P City.  In the first draft of the Deed, there is no provision for what should happen to the shares in the event of the husband’s death.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, says Mr Amos, we reach a position whereby a holding company has been created as the vehicle of ownership for the C Limited  shares and it is that corporate entity which subsequently becomes the trust property of The ABC Trust the following year.  Just pausing there for a moment, I see nothing sinister in the <span style="font-style:italic">creation</span> of N Limited .  I accept that there came a time when Mr and Mrs R wished to cease their involvement with C Limited  in order to concentrate on their own business interests.  EW in his written evidence has told me that they always treated the husband as the beneficial owner of the C Limited  shares.  In my judgment that statement takes me no further since I have to look at the underlying reality of beneficial ownership and I shall come to my findings in relation to that aspect of the case shortly.  However, I am prepared to accept that the incorporation of N Limited  was part of the strategic plan to provide Mr and Mrs R with an “exit” route and that is what subsequently happened.  It is equally clear that discussions were ongoing at the time between the husband and EW about setting up a trust structure for the ultimate benefit of the girls or, as Mr Amos, would have it, for the purposes of asset protection in the event of any future claims by the wife given the state of the marriage at the time.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next step in the sequence was the production on 8 January 2016 of the Deed of Trust dated 2 August 2006.     This was sent to the wife’s solicitors by Stewarts Law having been produced to them by the husband on 22 December 2015.  It was clearly a new document in the litigation.  The covering letter from Stewarts Law acknowledges that the document would need to be addressed in the husband’s Amended Reply to the wife’s Particulars of Claim and in the list of issues to be addressed in the context of the preliminary issue question list.  This particular Deed of Trust (V1) was the forerunner of The ABC Trust which was executed on 3 August 2007 (V2) and which is said to be the sham transaction at the heart of this case.   V1 is the document which the husband claims he received by fax from EW.  It is clearly an incomplete draft.  The date has been left blank as has section 8 which deals with the ultimate default trusts.  The major difference between V1 and V2, as I have already noted, is the inclusion in V1 of the husband as a named beneficiary with the two children.</p>

He appeared to think that he had signed the 2006 draft (V1) twice; once in EW’s offices in 2006 and then again on 2 August 2007 whilst he was staying overnight with his sister in X country just prior to his meeting with EW the following day.  Initially he told me that V1 was faxed to him as a draft by EW.  He received it in his London office.  I can see from the copy document that the draft deed left EW’s offices at 13.44 on 2 August 2007 but it must have been prepared some time before that date because the first line of the draft document appears thus:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The husband was travelling to X country to meet with EW as part and parcel of the ongoing discussions about the Trust.  He took the draft to read on the plane and spent the night of 2 August 2007 staying at his sister’s house in X country prior to his meeting the following day with EW in his P City offices.  Whilst at his sister’s house, or possibly the following day at EW’s offices, he completed the date section by writing “02” and “08” at the top of the document.  He did not change the year from ‘2006’ to ‘2007’.  He signed each page at the bottom and completed the section which required his passport number.  His signature appears on the final page and it has been witnessed by Mrs R, his sister.  However, he told Mr Amos in cross-examination that he had a recollection of signing a similar document in 2006, the year when he says he and the wife separated.  That document, he contends, was left in EW’s offices in X country as a “back-up”.  He said that he had told EW that if anything should happen to him, he should use it, “all signed”.  When he received the document by fax on 2 August 2007, it was a clean, unsigned version.</p>

It may well be that, with discussions about the formation of the Trust ongoing through 2006 and 2007, the husband did sign some sort of ‘holding’ document although, if he did, he must have done so after 11 April 2006 since the Trust Fund refers to the Trust Fund as comprising the N Limited  and D Limited shares.  In the absence of any evidence on this point from EW himself, I am left with very little reliable evidence upon which I can reach any clear conclusions about the 2006 Deed.  I have already found that the husband was untruthful in his evidence about the existence of a second, signed separation agreement.  It may well be that he is wrong about signing a version of the 2006 Deed prior to signing the faxed copy which was sent to him on 2 August 2007.</p>

EW had advised the husband in relation to setting up a trust and had subsequently produced a document for him to consider.  I am prepared to accept that the meeting between them in X country on 3 August 2007 had been pre-arranged and that its purpose, or one of its purposes, was to finalise the trust documentation.  It is clear that there were alterations made to the draft Deed which had been faxed to the husband the previous day.  His manuscript notation of his passport number was copied into the engrossment of the Deed which was executed on 3 August 2007.  Significantly, he himself is omitted as a named beneficiary with only the two children named as such although his position as a potential future beneficiary is preserved by the trust power in clause 3 to add new beneficiaries with the consent of the Protector (i.e. EW).   Whilst there is power under clause 4 to exclude named beneficiaries from future benefit under the trust terms, the husband is not named in the Trust Deed (V2) as an “excluded person”.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Why did that change occur between 2 and 3 August ?  The husband told Mr Amos during cross-examination that he had removed himself as a beneficiary. In an earlier skeleton argument prepared for the purposes of the abortive hearing before Flaux J in June 2016, his legal team had represented that he had not intended the 2006 Deed to take effect because it did not reflect his wish that the relevant assets should be held on trust for his daughters alone.  Whilst he also appeared to be suggesting that his removal as a beneficiary had occurred ‘by chance’ (as put by Mr Amos), I suspect the husband may by this point have become confused about the question.  I cannot reach findings by treading into the impermissible realm of speculation.  Whilst the husband denied that his motivation was to put up a shield to future claims, it may well be that EW advised the husband during their meeting on 3 August 2007 that his name should not appear as a beneficiary in order to maximise any protection which the Trust was designed to afford him in terms of either tax or future claims by the wife.  In this context, it might well be said that there was a degree of artificiality about these arrangements but that <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> is not enough to render this formally executed Trust Deed a legal sham if he did indeed intend to pass the benefit in his shares to the children.  The Trust Deed itself was drafted in sufficiently wide terms to enable him to continue running the business without interference from the trustees.  Clause 15 absolves the trustees of any liability without actual notice of dishonesty on the part of a director of C Limited  or D Limited even in circumstances where one of the trustees was also a director of those companies.  That clause, in my judgment, does not indicate an intention on the part of either the husband or EW that the Trust Deed should carry no legal significance whatsoever.  Similar provisions appear in many trust deeds prepared by English lawyers: it is familiar territory in terms of the delineation of powers in relation to the administration of the trust itself and parallel powers vested in a third party to run the underlying business assets owned by the trust.   That position is reinforced by the existence of the formal Power of Attorney which was drawn up on 11 February 1994 the day after the formal incorporation of C Limited  in X country.  That document has been signed and sealed.  Under its terms C Limited  appointed the husband as its attorney and granted to him the widest powers “to transact, manage, carry on and do all and every business matters and things requisite or necessary or in any manner connected with or having reference to the business and affairs of the company”. </p>

The absence of EW as an important witness as to fact from these proceedings necessarily means that there are evidential gaps which remain unfilled.  I have already found that there was never an agreement as between husband and wife that the shares in C Limited  would pass to the children as part and parcel of an informal agreement which <span style="font-style:italic">they</span> reached on separation.  Further, I am prepared to accept that the husband may well have had mixed motives for wanting to place the shares into trust but that, without more, does not allow me to find that  the entire edifice of The ABC Trust was a complete sham and void ab initio.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is significant, in my judgment that even for the purposes of corporate refinancing, the husband was maintaining to the Bank some seven years after the Trust was created that his daughters were the beneficial owners of the company.  That is evidenced by an email which he sent to Gamma Bank some six months <span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> his wife’s discovery of his Will at the North London property led her to initiate divorce proceedings in September 2014.  If he did not believe the children to be the true beneficiaries of a properly constituted Trust, I have to ask myself why he would have sent that email in circumstances where the parties had been separated for several years on any view and there was nothing to indicate that the wife was planning to take any steps to start proceedings.  It would have been far simpler for him simply to have told the Bank that he was the ultimate beneficial owner of the company, a representation which he subsequently made through the 2014 Deed which he accepts to be a dishonest presentation.  I accept that, when the 2014 Deed was created, there was a parallel intention (albeit one which was never acted upon) to make clear in fresh documents that the beneficiaries were in fact the children.  That much is evident from the letter which PH sent to the husband with the 2014 Deed on 21 March 2014.  Again, that predates the institution of the divorce proceedings by some six months and it was written at a time when the husband had no reason to believe that she had any intention to make financial claims against him.    As I have already remarked, the Will itself, whilst ambiguous, is certainly drafted in terms which permit a construction that the husband considered the C Limited  shares to be outside his residuary estate having been transferred to the trustees of The ABC Trust for the benefit of the children.  There is no evidence that he had discussed the drafting of his Will with EW.  That had all been undertaken (in some haste) by the solicitor he instructed in England.  Whatever construction is placed upon the rather unhappily drafted clause in the Will, there is a clear and explicit reference to The ABC Trust and to the children as its beneficiaries.</p>

In this context, Mr Amos has taken me to the evidence in relation to the preparation of Trust accounts which is relied on by the husband.  He was asked to produce documents to demonstrate what financial records had been maintained by the Trust.  The documentation he provided is within the court bundles.  The thrust of Mr Amos’ submission on this point is that money which the husband has been able to demonstrate he spent on the children or for their benefit has not emanated from trust funds.  Rather, it is his money and no more than financial support from a generous father.  Further, Mr Amos submits that there is no evidence of the husband ever having asked the trustee (Y Trustees Limited) to reimburse him for those expenses.  The “fiction” of the girls being maintained out of trust funds is simply part of the sham edifice which is The ABC Trust on the wife’s case.</p>

It is clear from his replies to earlier questionnaires and from the answers which he gave during the course of his cross-examination that the internal system of accounting within the companies might properly be described as fairly loose.  The Trust itself has made no distributions to the beneficiaries since its inception.  However, the husband has maintained throughout his written pleadings that he has dealt with all the children’s financial needs through C Limited  and, to a lesser extent, through D Limited.  In terms of how this arrangement worked, the husband told me that he was often operating under constraints of cash flow.  Essentially he would draw funds from whichever company had the greatest liquidity at any given time.  These funds would be used to meet the family’s expenses post-separation including the regular sums he paid to the wife’s Z country bank account, her credit card expenditure and the expenses which their daughters incurred independently whilst they were studying away from home.  At the end of the companies’ various financial year ends, all this information would be provided to the team which he employed at C Limited ’s London offices.  A team of five or six book-keepers would analyse the financial expenditure records for the purposes of preparing the individual annual company accounts.  Any expenditure referable to the children would be attributed to C Limited  regardless of the actual source of payment.  What he has described is essentially an exercise of reconciliation.  All this information would then be sent to the company’s auditor, an accountant based in X country called Mr HJ.  </p>

What he has produced for the purposes of the court bundles is essentially a distillation of those records into various sheets of ‘Trust Summaries’.  Copies of those summaries have also been produced in these proceedings independently by the Trustee (Y Trustees Limited).  Each has maintained that these documents are produced on an annual basis from the reconciliation exercise which I have just described.  The individual summaries (which relate to each of M and L) show that some of their expenditure has been met by B Limited, a company which is outside of the C Limited  trust structure.  The expenditure includes items such as the purchase of a car and the refurbishment of the company property in Kent which M was occupying whilst an undergraduate at a local university.  Medical expenses and college fees have also been attributed as expenses referable to the children.  He agreed with Mr Amos during cross-examination that neither of the children had ever completed a tax return in relation to the money they received from the Trust.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Trust Summaries themselves include an item called “Money transferred to M Limited”.  The husband told me that this was a reference to the means by which the company accounts were reconciled in relation what he described as “black money”.  M Limited is a Z country company which is a wholly owned subsidiary of C Limited .  Its core business is property development in Z country.  It acquired its portfolio of properties in Z country by means of inter-company loans from C Limited  in London.  Property prices in Z country are fixed, so he told me, by the government according to both size and the area in which they are situated.  Because of the way in which the local property market works in Z country, the purchase price which appears on the contract for sale (being the official government value for the property) will often be different from the (higher) price which is demanded by, and paid to, the seller.  He told me that this was a commonplace occurrence and was a recognised convention in the Z country property market.  As a result, since its creation in 2003, M Limited has built up a debt which is due to its parent company, C Limited .  This debt exists purely as an entry in the formal accounts of M Limited: there is no intention that it should be repaid.  It represents no more than the <span style="font-style:italic">actual </span>price paid for the individual properties which make up the Z country portfolio as compared with the (lower) contract price which appears in the books.  In order to strip this ‘debt’ out of the accounts, a notional dividend was declared albeit never paid out.  The husband accepted that these (often substantial) sums were not actual payments nor ones which could be described as benefitting the children in any way.  They were, on his account, no more nor less than accounting devices to “square the books”.  These figures were also reflected in a document described as a ‘C Limited  Fund nominal activity DIRECTORS ACCOUNT’ for the year ended 31 March 2014.  At face value, this document appears to show that the husband owes a sum of £1.317 million to the company although, as the husband is neither a shareholder nor a director of C Limited , he has no entitlement to have borrowed this money.  It was, he said, by and large a reflection of the manner in which the company’s auditors “parked” the “black money” which was stripped out of M Limited.</p>

I know not.  But his absence has certainly not helped me to get to the bottom of the truth or otherwise of Mr Amos’ submission that the Trust Summaries produced by the husband are themselves mere fictions which have been created purely and simply for litigation purposes.

I have given myself an appropriate <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas </span>warning.  Having found that the husband has been untruthful in one aspect of his evidence to this court does not necessarily mean that he is lying to me about other aspects.  I listened to him carefully as he was taken through the accounting material.  I accept that there is a process which is undertaken every year by his book-keeping team in the London offices.  This much would be necessary to prepare the detailed accounts which are sent to the auditor and to EW.  I can see from the material he has produced in relation to the credit card summaries that a detailed analysis of documents going back several years has been undertaken.   The evidence in relation to the accounting procedures which relates to M Limited and the corresponding debt which has built up in the books over the years has been explained by the husband in terms of the treatment of the “black money”, a practice or system which he tells me is widely recognised and acknowledged in Z country even by the government.  I do not have any evidence about that because it is not an explanation which he has provided before.  But, on balance and notwithstanding the rather timely absence of Mr HJ, I am prepared to accept his evidence that the several Trust Summaries which have been included in the court bundle are not documents which have been dishonestly fabricated for the purposes of this litigation.  I accept that there was indeed an annual internal reconciliation process by which expenditure which could be said to be referable to the children was “stripped out” of the various individual company accounts and treated as expenditure by C Limited.  I have not been shown the individual company accounts which have been produced over the years but I am assured by Mr Glaser that all the relevant documents have been disclosed to the wife’s legal team within the many lever arch files of disclosure which have been made available by the husband.  Indeed, he has produced for me what he has described as a “master list” of all the documents produced up to the end of May 2016.   Mr Amos accepts that the husband has provided primary evidence to substantiate the payments which he says were made for the benefit of the children but maintains his point that there is nothing to demonstrate that the Trust was the provenance of those payments.</p>

It may well be that much of this information lies in the sole control of EW and forms part of the information contained on the files he has removed from the office or otherwise kept securely to himself.  I am also prepared to accept that the slim clip of documents provided to Mr Amos and his team on 26 April 2016 in response to the request made by the wife’s solicitors in their letter dated 7 April 2016 for the underlying documents used to produce the Trust Summaries is certainly not evidence from which one can extract a comprehensive tracing exercise of payments made.  They do, nonetheless, support to some extent the husband’s case that significant sums were expended on behalf of the girls in terms of flights and other accommodation and living expenses.  I accept that many of the payments are simply shown by amounts or “allocations” without any narrative description as to the reason for those payments but they are nonetheless evidence of benefit received by the children.  Given my finding that there was on an annual basis some (albeit loose) form of internal reconciliation by the company book-keepers in relation to these sums, is that evidence which supports the existence of a Trust arrangement which the husband believed to be genuine and for the benefit of the girls ?  In my judgment, the mere fact that the process of allocating out the children’s expenses on an annual basis was undertaken does indeed provide some support for the husband’s case, and particularly in circumstances where I have found that this was not an exercise undertaken by the husband retrospectively in an attempt to create documents which did not exist before this litigation started. The fact that the <span style="font-style:italic">actual figures </span>in those Trust Summaries may not be an accurate reflection of all sums paid for their <span style="font-style:italic">exclusive </span>benefit does not mean without more that I can or should ignore the Trust Summaries as evidence of his belief that he had effectively transferred his interest in C Limited  and D Limited into The ABC Trust for their benefit.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Amos has produced for the purposes of his closing submissions an “Allocations table” which helpfully sets out on a single sheet of paper all direct and indirect payments which can be collected from the information provided by the husband to date.  Over the years between 2007 and 2015, these amount to just over £2.25 million of which approximately £604,000 are direct payments to the girls and the balance paid indirectly for their benefit.  Together, the £2.25 million is made up of payments made directly to the children; the mortgage payments made in respect of the Z country family home; money sent to the wife’s account in Z country and the discharge of her credit card expenses.  Thus, what it appears the husband has done in the post-separation years is to treat the financial support which was available to his children from the Trust as relieving him, at least in part, of the obligation to provide for them financially.  Whereas Mr Amos submits that this expenditure was simply coming from a generous father with the Trust a mere fiction, the husband invites me to accept that his actions over the years in separating out the children’s expenditure was a natural consequence of the arrangements which were put in place when the Trust was created in August 2007 for their benefit.  Regardless of whether or not the accounting process has been entirely accurate, and despite the fact that it may have included indirect elements of support for the wife during periods when the children were no longer living at home on a full-time basis, the husband’s case is that there is evidence from which I can properly infer that he considered the 2007 Trust to have been a genuine and valid disposition of his interest in the C Limited  shares which he owned at the time.</p>

But that submission presupposes that it was <span style="font-style:italic">his </span>money which he was spending.  That is not his case.  In effect, I accept that he was shifting the burden of the children’s support away from his own personal resources and onto the resources available to the Trust.  On his case, those trust resources included the financial benefits generated by ownership of the C Limited  shares.  There was clearly an element of “creative accounting” in the means by which the children’s expenses were allocated as expenses of C Limited  but I do not accept that deficiencies in that accounting process can necessarily be relied upon as evidence which is fatal to the existence of a genuine trust arrangement as between the husband and Y Trustees Limited/EW in 2007.</p>

Mr Amos points to the fact that this sits uncomfortably with the case now advanced by the husband in relation to the treatment of the sums paid out for their benefit through the company’s internal accounting procedures.  He says, in terms, that this is a new case which he is running and that inconsistency should lead me into the territory of adverse inference. However, as long ago as October 2015 when his Points of Reply to the wife’s original Particulars of Claim on this preliminary issue were filed, it was – as I see from the face of the pleading – the husband’s case that he had visited X country at least once a year and often more frequently to attend EW’s offices and report to him on the payments which had been made for the benefit of the children and his management of C Limited  and D Limited.  He refers in that pleading to the fact that the C Limited  annual accounts were finalised through EW who was also shown the accounts of other (non-trust) companies.  Each of these meetings is relied on by the husband as evidence of communications between him and EW in relation to the operation of The ABC Trust for the benefit of the children.</p>

The Trust Fund is set out in the second schedule to the Deed.  In addition to the shares in C Limited , there is a specific reference to “the shares held by the Settlor in D LIMITED”.  Clause 2(a) requires the trustee at the behest of the husband as Settlor “to hold the Trust Fund upon trust as to investments or property other than money in their absolute discretion”.  It is common ground that, as at 3 August 2007, the husband was both the legal and beneficial owner of 50% of the shares in D Limited. Mr Warwick has described the 2007 Deed as “an express lifetime declaration of trust”.  That is a description with which I agree.

At any time, Y Trustees Limited could have required him to effect the transfer of the shares into its name.  On this construction, the husband held the legal title to his 50% of the shares throughout but, since 3 August 2007, he has held those shares on trust for Y Trustees Limited.  During the course of his oral evidence, he told me that he was prepared to transfer them across as and when he was asked to do so.  Thus, in terms, this is one sense a purely technical point which goes to the formalities under which the trust property was formerly vested.  All the evidence which I have set out at some length earlier on in my judgment in relation to the accounting procedures operated by the various companies suggests that the husband himself has had no direct benefit from D Limited since 2007.  I suppose the only ‘benefit’ to him might be said to be the mitigation of his own liability to provide financially for the girls from his own resources.  </p>

I shall have to decide whether, as a matter of construction, the terms of the Deed on their face can amount to a sufficient declaration of trust.  In this respect, Mr Amos has taken me to the judgment of Arden LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Shah v Shah </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 1408.  The issue in that case was whether or not a potential donor of shares had effectively perfected the gift in favour of his brother so as to vest the legal and beneficial title in the done.  The case turned on the formalities employed to complete what the donor brother believed to be his outright gift of the shares to his brother.  The documents relied on in the <span style="font-style:italic">Shah </span>case were the signed stock transfer form and an accompanying letter.

In the latter event, it was an incompletely constituted gift and equity would not come to the aid of the potential donor so as to complete the gift.  At paragraph 13 of her judgment, Arden LJ said this:</p>

Here there is no doubt that Mr Dinesh Shah manifested an intention that the letter should take effect forthwith: see the words “as from today”.  To give effect in law to those words, there has to be a disposition only of a beneficial interest, since, for the reasons given above, legal title [of the shares] did not pass until registration.  The parties clearly intended registration to take place in due course because otherwise Mr Dinesh Shah would not have simultaneously have executed and delivered a stock transfer form.  Judged objectively, did the words used convey an intention to give a beneficial interest there and then or an intention to hold that interest for Mr Mahendra Shah until registration ?  Mr Dinesh Shah used the words “I am … holding” not, for example, the words “I am assigning” or “I am giving” and the concept that he <span style="font-style:italic">holds </span>the shares for Mr Mahendra Shah until he loses that status on registration can only be given effect in law by the imposition of a trust.  Accordingly Mr Dinesh Shah must be taken in law to have intended a trust and not a gift.  Added to that, as Norris J points out, he calls the document “a declaration” in his letter, which is more consistent with its being a declaration of trust than a gift.”</p>

Although the words are apparently words of outright gift they are essentially words of gift on trust…… But, it is said, TCP vested the properties not in <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the trustees of the foundation but only in one … Since equity will not aid a volunteer, how can a court order be obtained vesting the gifted property in the whole body of trustees on the trusts of the foundation ?

TCP has, in the most solemn circumstances, declared that he is giving (and later that he has given) property to a trust which he himself has established …. All this occurs in one composite transaction taking place on 17 February.

Other than a requirement to identify the property to be settled, he need do no more in the case of a self-declaration. The husband here has declared in the context of a formal legal document that he is giving property to a trust which he himself has established.  On one view it would be unconscionable and contrary to the principles of equity to allow him to resile from his gift.  His evidence is that he has no intention of resiling.  He acknowledges that, if Y Trustees Limited calls for the formal legal transfer of the shares, he will sign the necessary stock transfer form forthwith.  They will not become the legal owners until the shares have been registered but I am satisfied that the husband holds those shares, and has been holding them since 3 August 2007, on trust for Y Trustees Limited.</p>

I have already found that EW was implicated in that misrepresentation because it was he who prepared the false Trust Deed whilst assuring the husband that it would have no legal effect whatsoever because of the irrevocable nature of the 2007 Trust.  But it seems to me that I have to examine carefully the circumstances of that transaction before moving straight to a conclusion that these two individuals will say whatever might be expedient in a given set of circumstances so long as it meets their own ends, and that is evidence which I can therefore use to impugn the legal integrity of the 2007 Trust.  It might well be a breach of trust on the part of Y Trustees Limited / EW to put forward representations in a subsequent trust deed which are inconsistent with the primary trusts with which they are fixed.

In one sense the very fact that EW had privately reassured the husband that there was no need to settle any further deeds after the 2014 Trust in order to protect the children’s position as beneficiaries of the 2007 Trust is powerful evidence in itself that he, as a lawyer, regarded the terms of the 2007 Trust as inviolable.  </p>

	    <p class="msonormalcxspmiddle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The husband himself had sought advice from EW as to how he might transfer the benefit of his shares to the children.  Those discussions were initiated in 2005 and carried on through 2006.  EW suggested the mechanism of a trust as he confirmed directly to Miss Loizou.  This was no doubt part and parcel of his daily professional practice as a corporate lawyer.  He had taken the husband’s instructions and had drafted trust documentation for his consideration many months before the final version of the Trust Deed was executed.  The husband may well have had in his mind at the time the fact that his marriage was foundering.  He may well have considered that an acceleration of his intention to benefit his children might have the collateral effect of protecting family assets from future claims by the wife since they would by then be beneficially owned by the girls, but I am satisfied that when he put his hand to the final version of the Trust Deed on 3 August 2007, he did so in the knowledge, expectation and with the intention that he was transferring his shares to the trustee for the children’s future benefit.  I can find nothing in the evidence which leads me to a conclusion other than that EW shared that intention.  Whether or not there had been some discussion between the two of them prior to that point in time to the effect that transferring the shares into trust might be a sensible precaution given the state of the marriage, I know not.  I am prepared to accept that EW had a poor impression of the wife and her entitlement to share in the fruits of what he may have regarded as the husband’s labours.  But that takes the matter no further as a matter of law if in fact each intended the trust terms to take effect.  I have already referred to the fact that some years later the husband was representing to the Bank in an apparently entirely straightforward manner that the children were the beneficial owners of C Limited .  He had by that stage, as I have found, instituted an internal accounting system whereby monies spent on the girls or for their benefit were attributed as expenses for the account of C Limited  as property which was held on trust for their benefit.  Imperfect and flawed as that accounting system might have been, it nonetheless lends evidential support to the husband’s earlier intentions at the time the Trust was set up.</p>

Mr Amos sought to develop a submission arising out of a decision of Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">Carman (Trustee of the Estate in Bankruptcy) v Yates and others</span>.  I have already referred to this case in paragraph 175(c) of my judgment.  In that case, his Lordship was considering the validity or otherwise of the beneficial ownership of a property which a trustee in bankruptcy claimed to be available to meet the claims of a husband’s creditors.  The case turned on whether or not the transfer of his interest in that property to his wife and mother-in-law was a sham transaction.  Having set out the familiar propositions of law with which I have already dealt in my judgment, his Lordship said this at paragraph 219:</p>

	    <p class="msonormalcxspmiddle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, as part of his opening skeleton argument, it was said by Mr Amos on behalf of the wife that, in relation to the (admittedly sham) 2014 Trust Deed, the husband must now be presumed to be fixed by his representation that he was the beneficial owner of the C Limited  shares.  As the innocent third party, the wife is entitled to rely on the representation made in the later Trust Deed and he cannot now in this litigation advance a contrary case.  I agree with Mr Warwick that this is not a free-standing point of law but rather part of the jurisprudence in relation to the issue of sham transactions.  It is quite clear from the judgment of Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A </span>that a trust which is not initially a sham cannot subsequently become a sham.  I have found that The ABC Trust which was set up in August 2007 was not a sham and it therefore seems to me that nothing which was said or done subsequently in 2014 can make it a sham.  The husband could not give away in 2014 that which was not his to give.  For my part, I do not consider there is any further forensic mileage in the <span style="font-style:italic">Carmen </span>point although I can well understand why Mr Amos has included it as part of his initial assault on the integrity of the 2007 Trust.</p>

In relation to the C Limited  shares, she relies on the existence of a specific written agreement signed by both in 1994 with Mr and Mrs R that her sister-in-law would hold the legal title to 50% of the C Limited  shares on trust for her (the wife’s) benefit.  She points to contemporaneous documentation prepared at the time when C Limited  was incorporated which suggests a division of the original issued share capital into two separate portions to be held by two separate nominees.  She points to the recent development of the 2002 draft Trust Deeds prepared on the husband’s instruction which appear to acknowledge that she had, or should have, a 50% interest in C Limited .</p>

In November that year, they set up the previous incarnation of B Limited and the wife was working full-time in the business whilst the husband was employed elsewhere on a full-time basis.  I accept that he spent as much time working in the business with the wife as he could but they needed his income from his salaried employment in order to make ends meet in those early days.  B Limited was incorporated in London at more or less the same time as C Limited  (the following month in March 1994).  The parties were 50/50 shareholders and each was a director.  The husband has explained why C Limited  was set up in X country: he wished to expand the family business and saw significant tax advantages to trading offshore. </p>

In January 2001, the husband and wife became equal shareholders in F Limited, the holding company for G Limited.  Under that corporate structure they operated and ran a chain of five hotels in London.  When the Z country corporate limb of C Limited  was incorporated in June 2003, the husband and wife were 50/50 shareholders.  I accept that not all of the corporate entities were transferred into equal joint ownership: the catering company is one such example where the wife held a minority interest although she had initially held a 50/50 interest with the husband.</p>

In reply to each of his questions, she told me that she would need to see the document in question in order to confirm that the signature was hers.  Whether or not she took an active role in the day to day ‘paper’ administration  of these companies, I am satisfied that she was involved in their operation insofar as the demands of the family would allow.  It may be that, on occasions, the husband signed documents on her behalf.

	    <p class="msonormalcxspmiddle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">   As to the events of 1994, the wife told me during the course of her oral evidence about the concerns she had about tax issues and whether or not they were trespassing into the realms of tax evasion as opposed to tax avoidance.  Those are not her words; they are mine.  That was the sense of her evidence to me.  She said that at the meeting in 1994 she had said to the husband <span style="font-style:italic">“is it alright ? is it legal, all this that we are doing ?”</span>  She told me that there had been discussions at the time and thereafter when she made her unhappiness with the nominee arrangement with Mr and Mrs R clear to the husband.  We know that on 7 February 1994, three days before the incorporation of C Limited , I &amp; Co had secured the necessary permission from the central bank of X country.  The letter from the Bank is clear: it is quite specific in its terms that J Nominees Limited and J Secretarial Limited (both corporate X country residents) would be acting as nominees for the <span style="font-style:italic">“non-resident</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">s</span><span style="font-style:italic">” who </span>would each hold 500 shares <span style="font-style:italic">“as nominee of a non-resident individual”</span>.  Mr Glaser seeks to persuade me that the fact that there were two shareholders does not point to the fact that there were two beneficial owners.  It is correct that Mr P has confirmed that in 1994 it was a requirement for a private company registered in X country to have at least two shareholders.  He goes on to say that the fact that there may be two legal shareholders does not <span style="font-style:italic">automatically </span>indicate the existence of two beneficial owners.  That is as may be but, in my judgment, it is not a complete answer to the point.  It is just as possible in this case that there were two beneficial owners; indeed, the development of the unincorporated English lettings business before that point and the incorporation of B Limited the following month lends credence to the wife’s case about their respective intentions at the time that they were operating to all intents and purposes as business ‘partners’ albeit that their respective roles in the business were different.</p>

That account appears in her written evidence and she was asked about it during the course of her oral evidence.  She told me that they all travelled together in the car to the lawyer’s office.  There is no doubt in her mind that she signed paperwork which confirmed her beneficial interest in 50% of the shares in C Limited .  She recalls signing paperwork for the Bank in order to open the company’s bank account in X country.  Mr Glaser seeks to cast doubt on her recollection about these events because she could not recall whether the meeting took place in Q City or in P City.  He describes her evidence as “wholly unconvincing”.  He points to the fact that the husband has consistently said that there was no such agreement in 1994.  He points to the existence of the 2002 draft documents and asks why these would have been produced if documents to this effect had been signed in 1994.  </p>

I regret that I must also reject his evidence in relation to the events of 1994.  I accept the wife’s evidence that there was a meeting with someone in X country in the context of the incorporation of C Limited  (or shortly thereafter) and that she signed some form of document which confirmed that the shares in J Nominees Limited which were transferred to Mrs R four months after the incorporation of C Limited  were shares which were held beneficially for her, as they had been by J Nominees Limited.  I know not what became of the document or whether it still exists but I am entirely satisfied that she is telling me the truth about these events.  I accept that there was a short period of time after the incorporation of the company when the two “shelf” entities held the legal title to the shares before the transfer into the names of Mr and Mrs R.  It is not the wife’s case that she recalls signing documents in February 1994 when the company was set up.  Her recollection, which I have accepted, relates to the time when the extended family members became involved.  We know from contemporaneous documents that legal ownership of the first 500 shares passed to Mrs R in June 1994.  The wife refers to the car journey to the solicitors as having occurred “in the holidays”.  As I have said, I know not what document was signed but I accept it was, in one form or another, an acknowledgment that she was the beneficial owner of 50% of the shares in C Limited .</p>

This fax refers to EW’s instruction to secure a permit from the central bank of X country and mentions only the husband’s name in the context of share ownership.  That, says Mr Glaser, points towards EW’s belief that only he was entitled to a beneficial interest in the shares.  It seems to me that this submission carries very little, if any, weight.  First, there is incontrovertible evidence in the form of the draft 2002 Deeds that the husband had given clear instructions to EW in relation to recording formally the wife’s beneficial entitlement in the company’s shares.  Secondly, EW himself was not present during the meeting with Mr and Mrs R when, as I have found, her beneficial interest was formally recorded in documentary form.  Unless, as the wife suspects, he is part and parcel of a deliberate attempt to conceal crucial documents from this court – and, in his absence, I have made no findings in this respect – his subjective belief takes the matter no further in the light of my specific finding in relation to the family meeting in 1994.</p>

	    <p class="msonormalcxspmiddle" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">None of this deflects me from my finding in relation to the wife’s beneficial interest in 50% of the C Limited  shares.  I approach the evidence of EW with some circumspection because Mr Amos did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him as to the circumstances of his instructions from the husband in 2002.  By the time he prepared his statement for these English proceedings, EW was fully aware of the disclosures which had been made by TU.  He had secured an injunction against her and one of the reasons for his concerns was the adverse impact of her revelations on the husband’s position in these English proceedings.  There was very significant resistance by the husband’s legal team to the admission of the 2002 documents into these proceedings and that issue was only resolved in May 2016 when Moylan J ruled on the waiver of privilege issue.  It seems to me that it would not be appropriate for me to go any further in terms of my findings against EW because he has not had the opportunity to give evidence to me and submit himself for cross-examination.  For these purposes I am prepared to accept that he is gravely ill with a diagnosis of stage 4 cancer.  That notwithstanding, I am not prepared to follow Mr Glaser down the path of accepting blindly that everything which EW has put before this court is necessarily an accurate reflection of the whole truth in relation to his dealings with these matters.  I do not need to make adverse findings in this respect because there is sufficient evidence elsewhere to satisfy me in relation to the wife’s interest in C Limited , not least of which is my finding that she is a reliable witness as to the truth.</p>

Certainly, I do not regard the absence of a reciprocal request of the wife to take the matter much further forwards in terms of its evidential value on this issue.  By that stage, she had been based primarily in the family home in T City for some years and I know not what representations the husband had made to the Banks in this context.  It is highly likely in my judgment that he would have told them that the wife did not have a beneficial interest in any event and that representation, whatever his subjective belief, runs wholly counter to my finding in this respect that, in 2005 and 2008, the wife owned the beneficial interest in 50% of the shares in C Limited </p>

On the wife’s case the parties had not even separated when it was set up and there were no proceedings or any indication of a financial claim on her part until over seven years later.  In these circumstances, I fail to see how the transfer of the husband’s 50% interest in D Limited and C Limited  into the Trust can be said to have been undertaken for the purposes of defeating her claims in the context of an application for financial remedy orders.  The statutory presumption does not apply and my findings in any event have left her in a position where she currently holds a 50% interest in both D Limited and C Limited .  Given the present value of those shareholdings, and for the purposes of this preliminary issue hearing, this is not a case where section 37 is engaged in any event.</p>
