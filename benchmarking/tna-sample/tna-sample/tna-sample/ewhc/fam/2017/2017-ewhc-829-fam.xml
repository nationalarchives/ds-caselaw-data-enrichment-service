	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a very complex and worrying case. It is, I think, by some margin the most difficult and concerning case of its type I have ever been involved in.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am concerned with the future, the welfare throughout her life, of a little girl, W, who was born in November 2012. She has three older full siblings: a sister, X, who was born in September 2003, and two brothers, Y and Z, who were born in March 2007 and February 2009 respectively. Following care proceedings brought by the local authority, Brighton and Hove City Council, in December 2012, X, Y and Z live with their father but have extensive and now unregulated contact with their mother. W is, and has since January 2014 been, living with prospective adopters, Mr and Mrs A.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are in substance two applications before me: an application by Brighton and Hove City Council for permission to withdraw its applications for care and placement orders in respect of W; and an application by Mr and Mrs A to adopt W, their application including an application pursuant to sections 47(2)(c) and 52(1)(b) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to dispense with the consent of her father and mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be apparent from what I have already said, that this litigation has been proceeding for an unusually long time. To say that it has proceeded in an unsatisfactory manner would be understatement on a grand scale. The simple fact, which demands explicit acknowledgment, is that the system has failed W, her siblings, her father and mother and Mr and Mrs A, on a scale which although, happily, unique in my experience – no comfort, of course, to those involved – must be profoundly concerning to anyone and everyone involved in the family justice system. The delay for W has been deplorable. And the terrible reality, and there can be no shrinking from this, is that this delay – I am referring here to the delay down to the hearing before me, not to the very regrettable further delay, for which I apologise, since I reserved judgment – has, in the event, been determinative of the outcome; an outcome which <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> perhaps (I emphasis, might) have been different had the case been resolved sooner.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am conscious that this judgment is very long. It is designedly so. The case is complex. The history is both complex and disturbing. At the end of the day, the expert evidence, which is itself complex, lengthy and nuanced in much of its detail, is central to the resolution of the case. As will appear in due course, constructing a truthful ‘narrative’ for W, explaining – both for now and into and through her adolescence and adult life – what has happened to her and why, is both a crucial necessity and itself a task of no little difficulty and complexity. Inevitably no judgment, if it is to be kept within manageable proportions, can cover everything, let alone all the voluminous evidence I have read and heard. But in this case there is a compelling need, in my judgment, for the expert evidence, both written and oral, to be set out at more than usual length, for this judgment will itself, necessarily and properly, become part of the narrative. The same goes for the parties’ submissions. Furthermore, it is important that the detail and nuance of what has been said is not lost, as must always to some extent happen, if the material is paraphrased, however accurately, rather than quoted verbatim. Hence the unusual volume of the material referred to by way of direct quotation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Three weeks after her birth, W was placed in foster care. Care proceedings in relation to all four children were begun a few days later by Brighton and Hove City Council in the Brighton County Court. The local authority sought interim care orders in respect of all four children but was granted such an order only in respect of W. X, Y and Z remained with their father under interim supervision orders. Applications for placement orders in respect of Z and W were made in June 2013. Shortly before then the parents had separated. The mother had certain mental health difficulties which there is no need for me to describe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The final hearing came on before District Judge Gamba in September 2013. By then the local authority’s plan was for X and Y to be placed in long-term foster care and for Z and W to be adopted. Accordingly, it sought care orders in respect of X and Y and care orders and placement orders in respect of Z and W. The father’s case, supported the mother, was that he should care for all four children. The guardian supported the local authority’s case in respect of W but considered that the other three children should remain in their father’s care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Why a case which, at that time, was reasonably straight-forward should have taken nine months to reach a final hearing was not explored before me. The District Judge handed down his judgment on 19 September 2013. He rejected the local authority’s case in relation to X, Y and Z, making, in each of their cases, supervision orders for 12 months. He made care and placement orders in respect of W. His reasoning in relation to W was, on any view, thin at best:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“I feel that the father does have further work to do in relation to his own situation and that coupled with the care of the three older children will occupy his time fully. I feel that the risk to W of returning to the father’s care at this time is too great for the reasons given by the Guardian and [expert], and that therefore the only order to be made in her best interests is as sought by the local authority for a placement order. I also consider that the welfare of the child requires me to dispense with the consent of the parents.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his judgment, District Judge Gamba was critical of important parts of the local authority’s evidence. One social worker’s oral evidence he found “somewhat unconvincing,” observing that during her cross-examination it became apparent that there were “defects in the local authority’s position.” He was exceedingly critical of the evidence of Khrys Kyriacou, a domestic violence specialist. “Her report was commissioned in curious circumstances;” “She had limited access to the papers. She had no real overview of the case;” her conclusion was “startling.” He said “I do not rely on her evidence in any way.” At the very end of his judgment, District Judge Gamba invited the local authority to </p>

On 30 October 2013 – out of time – the father, acting as a litigant in person, filed a notice of appeal. This was considered by His Honour Judge Farquhar on the papers on 14 November 2013. He ruled that there were no grounds for extending time and that in any event the application would be dismissed on the merits. The father’s time for requesting an oral hearing expired on 21 November 2013 without him having made any request.</p>

In July 2014 the father, by now represented by different counsel, applied pursuant to sections 47(5) and 47(7) of the 2002 Act for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order. His application came before District Judge Gamba on 30 July 2014. It was refused. The District Judge’s reasons were brief, occupying less than two pages of transcript. He concluded that the father fell at the first hurdle: he had failed to demonstrate the sufficient change in circumstances required by section 47(7). The father’s response was two-fold: first, he sought to renew his challenge to the orders District Judge Gamba had made on 19 September 2013; secondly, he sought to appeal against District Judge Gamba’s order of 30 July 2014. Both applications came before His Honour Judge Farquhar on 12 November 2014. The first was refused; the second succeeded, the judge adjourning the re-hearing of the father’s application to himself. Judge Farquhar’s reasons are set out in a detailed judgment of which I have seen the transcript. Given subsequent events, there is no need for me to explore his reasoning. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The re-hearing of the father’s application for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order took place before Judge Farquhar on 19 December 2014. For the reasons set out in a very careful judgment, of which again I have the transcript, Judge Farquhar gave the father leave to oppose. He analysed the matter in some detail. I need not go into the detail here, but draw attention to what Judge Farquhar said in a striking passage in paragraph 32:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Are his prospects of success more than fanciful? As I say, I have never seen a case where a father is looking after three children or a birth parent is looking after three children … where the changes are so positive. It seems to me if leave were not to be granted in this case that it would be very difficult for any parent ever to be granted leave. He is looking after the three children fairly well. There are excellent reports from the school. He has been able to hold down his job. Of course it is only a mid-day supervisor but it does assist him, and for the most part it is accepted that things are going reasonably well.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the meantime, on 3 December 2014, the father had filed in the Court of Appeal his application for permission to appeal against the other part of Judge Farquhar’s order of 12 November 2014. That application was refused on the papers by King LJ on 28 January 2015 but on renewed oral application was granted by McFarlane LJ on 18 March 2015. The appeal came on before the full court (McFarlane LJ, Gloster LJ and Sir Robin Jacob) on 6 May 2015. The father’s appeal was allowed, the reasons being subsequently set out in a judgment handed down on 11 June 2015: <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Children) (Application to Extend Time: Merits of Proposed Appeal) </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 583, [2015] 1 WLR 5085, [2016] 1 FLR 952. The care and placement orders in respect of W were set aside. The local authority’s applications were remitted for hearing by Russell J, before whom the hearing of Mr and Mrs A’s application for adoption had already been listed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time the case reached the Court of Appeal, the local authority’s stance had changed markedly. At the hearing before Judge Farquhar on 12 November 2014, it opposed the father’s attempt to appeal root and branch. Before the Court of Appeal, it conceded that the appeal would succeed if permission to appeal were granted.</p>

Further, she points to the language used by the district judge to submit that even the factors set out in the judgment fail to establish sound findings relating to W’s welfare which indicate circumstances making it ‘necessary’ that her Art 8 European Convention right to family life should be interfered with to such a radical extent. She submits for the district judge simply to ‘feel’ that the father has ‘further work to do in relation to his own situation’ and to ‘feel’ that the risk to W of returning to the father’s care is too great is insufficient reasoning.”</p>

That this occurred may, in part, be explained by the fact that, as I have held, the judge herself had formed a similarly erroneous view. It is clear that Dr Willemsen understood that the Court of Appeal had held that W should not have been placed for adoption and this understanding had a major impact upon his overall analysis; indeed it caused him to change his recommendation to the court. What his recommendation would have been if he had been given a careful, comprehensive and accurate account of the Court of Appeal decision, we do not know, but I am afraid that I regard the errors that led to this key expert being given a wrong account of this, to him, important matter fundamentally compromised the court’s ability to rely upon his revised recommendation. This error, and Dr Willemsen’s changed opinion, in turn had a consequential impact upon the opinion of Mr Hatter and, ultimately, the guardian. </p>

It was asserted that “threshold is overwhelmingly met.” Again, it was said that W’s fall from the sofa was “unexplained” and although, in a section entitled ‘Is Threshold met?’, the local authority sought findings against the father in relation to certain other matters, including a bruise allegedly inflicted on Z’s ear by the father, nothing was said about paragraph 12 (13). The written closing submissions on behalf of the father conceded that “Each parent has made sufficient concessions for the court to find that the threshold criteria are met.” (I record for completeness the father’s evidence before me that he had not seen this document in advance nor given instructions to concede threshold.)

In a statement dated 14 April 2015 put before Russell J, Keli Reains, the social worker responsible for W, asserted that W was placed in foster care “after sustaining an injury whilst in her birth father’s care”, this being, as the statement makes clear, a reference to the ‘sofa’ incident. A similar insinuation was made by the practice manager, Gail Alsop, in a statement also dated 14 April 2015. The same misunderstanding as to what District Judge Gamba had and had not found is also to be found affecting – some might say infecting – both the report of Dr Sarah Helps dated 14 July 2016 (see below), where she recorded that “W sustained a non-accidental injury while in the care of her father which led to her being removed to a foster placement” and Mr and Mrs A’s understanding (see, for example, Dr Willemsen’s account, in his report dated 25 July 2016, of what they had said to him on 24 June 2016).</p>

As Mr Bagchi was driven to concede in his closing submissions, “there is still confusion as to the precise basis upon which DJ Gamba found the threshold criteria to be established in relation to all the children.” I make the point because, in my judgment, it would neither be safe nor fair to hold either the father or the mother to the terms of this flawed document. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is one other aspect of this to which I must draw attention. In February 2015 the local authority made certain disclosures to the father’s employer. The disclosure was inaccurate and misleading. It led to him losing his job. The disclosure took place in circumstances which involved significant breach of the principles that the Court of Appeal had laid down in April 2011 in <span style="font-style:italic">H and L v A City Council </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 403, (2011) 14 CCL Rep 381, [2011] BLGR 590, [2011] UKHRR 599, paras 49-52, 62. The local authority’s failure to comply with the law was shocking. The local authority has apologised and said that it did not intend the father to lose his job. This no doubt is true but quite beside the point. What happened was the all too foreseeable, indeed probably the little short of inevitable, consequence of the local authority’s actions. And, as the local authority well knew, this was a father who was bringing up three children.</p>

Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“134 <marker name="tab"/>The court reiterates that in cases concerning the placing of a child for adoption, which entails the permanent severance of family ties, the best interests of the child are paramount. In identifying the child’s best interests in a particular case, two considerations must be borne in mind: first, it is in the child’s best interests that his ties with his family be maintained except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit; and second, it is in the child’s best interests to ensure his development in a safe and secure environment. It is clear from the foregoing that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate, to “rebuild” the family. It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing. However, where the maintenance of family ties would harm the child’s health and development, a parent is not entitled under Art 8 to insist that such ties be maintained.</p>

The court has not previously set out an exhaustive list of such factors, which may vary depending on the circumstances of the case in question. However, it observes that the considerations listed in s 1 of the 2002 Act broadly reflect the various elements inherent in assessing the necessity under Art 8 of a measure placing a child for adoption. In particular, it considers that in seeking to identify the best interests of a child and in assessing the necessity of any proposed measure in the context of placement proceedings, the domestic court must demonstrate that it has had regard to, inter alia, the age, maturity and ascertained wishes of the child, the likely effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of his original family and the relationship the child has with relatives.”</p>

Foster carers will seldom expect permanence and, indeed, will have been trained so as to be able to support the child moving on if required to do so in time. Whilst undoubtedly foster carers and fostered children may achieve a fondness for each other, the establishment of a firm and secure attachment is not one of the primary aims of the placement, in contrast with adoption. One of the principal benefits of adoption is to achieve a secure, stable, reliable, permanent, lifetime placement for the child in the adoptive family as the adoptive son or daughter of the adopters. </p>

At the earlier time when a placement order is being considered, that side of the balance, which must now accommodate the weight to be afforded to the child’s place within the adoptive family, simply does not exist. The balance at the placement stage, therefore, naturally tilts towards a family placement where the relatives have been assessed, as these grandparents have, as being able to provide good, long term care for a child within their family. At the placement order stage, the other side of the scales (against a family placement) are likely to be populated by factors such as the risk of harm and the need to protect the child. The question of harm to the child occurring as a result of leaving their current placement will normally not arise as a factor at the pre-placement stage given that such a child is likely to be in temporary foster care and will have to move in any event either on to an adoptive placement or back to the natural family. </p>

No such ‘right’ or presumption exists. The only ‘right’ is for the arrangements for the child to be determined by affording paramount consideration to her welfare throughout her life (in an adoption case) in a manner which is proportionate and compatible with the need to respect any ECHR Art 8 rights which are engaged. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child)</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 1284 [the appeal from Russell J in the present proceedings] this court clearly stated that there is no presumption in favour of parents or the natural family in public law adoption cases.”</p>

The interests of the child will include the child’s interest in retaining its identity, and this is likely to be important to the child in adulthood. But identity is only one factor in the balance that has to be struck. Section 1 does not privilege the birth family over adoptive parents simply because they are the birth family.”</p>

Ms Bazley nonetheless contends that I need to consider whether ‘threshold’ is established as at the relevant date (which she says is 10 December 2012) and submits that it is not. She submits that W’s placement with Mr and Mrs A was an ‘agency placement’ and, therefore, that, absent parental consent, an adoption order can be made only following a placement order, so that ‘threshold’ accordingly has to be established: see section 47(4).</p>

Proof of threshold is, as she correctly submits, a pre-requisite to the making of a placement order: see section 21(2)(b) of the 2002 Act. But that is beside the point in this case, where, prior to the hearing before me, the care and placement orders had been set aside, so that W’s continuing placement with Mr and Mrs A was not by the local authority but by the court exercising its powers in wardship. Hence, the application for an adoption order is now properly pursued under section 47(2). Proof of threshold is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>a pre-requisite in such a case. Section 31(2) of the 1989 Act has no application in the case of a private law adoption application under section 47(2) of the 2002 Act. In any event, although she is rightly critical of District Judge Gamba’s analysis, threshold, subject only to certain specific matters, was in effect conceded before him. It is, in the circumstances, far too late to be taking the point and in any event, as Mr Bagchi comments, the forensic difficulties in trying the issue some four years later are manifest. The court he submits, and I agree, should not be engaging in mental gymnastics seeking to unpick what is now an historical question of risk which is irrelevant to the only live application. </p>

The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the responsible authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child.</p>

It is quite plain that in a number of respects, indeed in too many respects, he has been treated very badly by the local authority. And I bear very much in mind the deliberately strong language I have used earlier in this judgment to characterise the local authority’s conduct. But at the end of the day I do not think I need or should go further than I have. I am not conducting a general inquiry into the local authority’s conduct. There is no claim before me for damages or other relief under the Human Rights Act 1998. And, most important of all, even an adverse finding against the local authority and the grant of relief under the 1998 Act would not, of itself, ultimately affect the outcome of the proceedings under the 2002 Act which are before me. The local authority’s behaviour is not irrelevant, nor its impact on the father or W. But the fact is that we are where we are. Ultimately, and in the final analysis, this case has to be determined in accordance with the requirements of section 1 of the 2002 Act and the principles laid down in what I have referred to as the four key authorities. The law, both our domestic law and the Strasbourg law, has long recognised that there may be cases where the outcome is determined, to the prejudice of an unimpeachable parent, by the passage of time and consequential change of circumstances, even where this has been brought about by the actions, or lack of action, or the ‘fault’ of a public authority.</p>

All the experts made clear that they were working on the basis that the father is a good parent and that X, Y and Z are well cared for. Insofar as Dr Helps had an adverse view as to the father’s ability to ‘mentalise’, I am satisfied that this was based on clinical interviews rather than prejudicial matters in the papers.

She sees W as their child, themselves as her family, and the father’s application to have W rehabilitated to her natural family as unwelcomed and unjustified. Mr and Mrs A told Dr Helps that there had been too much focus on the wishes and feeling of [the father] and not enough on the needs of W. There is, it is submitted, a lack of empathy for the parents, and the father in particular who has sought to have his child returned to his care from the moment she was removed. If this is their view about the father that he is not putting W first, there is a risk that they will not be able to protect W from their own views about the unfairness to their family in the future.

Mr and Mrs A’s commitment to W, and to her well-being, throughout her life, is absolute. Their journey through litigation which has subjected them to appalling strain (just as it has the father and the mother) has been reflected in a gradual development and positive movement in relation both to their understanding of the father and of their recognition of the need for and willingness to facilitate contact, both indirect and direct. I accept Mr Diver’s assessment, which agrees with my own, of Mr and Mrs A being willing now, whatever may have been their stance in the past, to work towards direct contact, and moreover, direct contact sooner rather than later. The only additional point to be made, and this is absolutely no criticism of them, is that, although I am sure they would do their very best for W if she were to be returned to her father, I suspect they would struggle in facilitating any interim arrangements – and who could possibly blame them? </p>

In general, it appears that the earlier they are given such a narrative, the better the outcome. Of course, the narrative needs to be geared to their developmental level, becomes more detailed as the child matures and in relationship to their need and wish to know more.</p>

There are also cases where it creates major complications for their development, notably in terms of the stability of the adoptive placement, the child’s emotional development and their sense of belonging.

The distrust she feels and any hostility that arises on the basis of this is likely to be directed at him. While external support is important in supporting, it will be his capacity to contain, work with and provide the necessary remedial actions that will be key if those long-term benefits are to be realised.

He has done work on himself in terms of impact on him of the adversities in his own family background and has some appreciation in what he has stated as to the scale of the task of rehabilitating W to his care entails.

If she would give up on reattaching, having suffered the trauma once too often, she might find herself unable to relate to [the father]. W’s bereavement process, I think, is likely to be on the continuum between a bereavement in which she can suffer the loss, which will be significant in itself, and a trauma in which she withdraws from her internal objects. She might protect herself by not making new relationships.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The second scenario is one which is related to a risk of loss of identity, effectively felt as feeling a sense of belonging, and could have adverse consequences in the long-term. The possible consequences of confusion about identity will need to be seen against an existing background of early separation trauma as W has suffered. She would not grow up with her biological family and would, in time, become aware of her adoption and of there being a family elsewhere, to include three siblings.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">It is entirely unclear how W will develop in this adoption. There is ample evidence that adoptions are not always successful. On the basis of the available evidence, and the age at which W was placed, it is unlikely that a placement with Mr and Mrs A would breakdown, but this does not preclude developmental problems years down the line, on as a result of the early traumatic separations in W’s life, particularly the separation which took place when she was moved from her foster carers to her prospective adopters, which fell in a critical period of attachment formation (6 months to two years).</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The risk of identify confusion also plays a role when W grows up. It is more and more accepted that contact between birth and adoptive family is important and helps to develop a narrative that holds both families in mind and in which both families speak positively and benignly of the other family. Such contact also helps with teenagers who are adopted and begin to seek their biological roots, through social media without the knowledge of the adoptive family.  </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The adoptive parents’ openness is very important if not crucial in the identity development of the child. Allowing themselves to speak freely of the biological parents and siblings, benignly, is important for the development of a narrative that will protect against eventualities such as the adoptive child finding her biological family without the adopters knowing. Significant splits could develop in the adoptive family, but also in the mind of the child or adolescent.</p>

This task would be immense, as Mr Hatter pointed out in his first report, and would require significant attunement, as he said, but also an environment, the family as a whole, where she is received and where she can experience that she has been thought about, that she was alive in the mind of the family. It will take months and months, if not a couple of years, before she might have found herself settled in the new family. She will need to let go of her previous family, yet be allowed to have them in her mind. I consider that [the father] will be able to keep Mr and Mrs A in mind. [He] could be supported by a professional network that monitors the re-introduction and considers interventions that could be made at any possible juncture.</p>

When I visited the family this time, I thought that there was less excitement and cautiousness. This may partly have been because I saw the children on a Friday afternoon after a week’s school, but I also thought that the calmness, and indeed the sadness I could feel when I left the home, was related to the disappointment of the Court of Appeal’s recent judgment. W was missed.</p>

This may be very disappointing. W may reject [the father] in the first instance. W will need to be allowed to have these feelings and the family may need support to understand them, so that they can attune to her. She may also be reminded, perhaps not consciously, of the contacts, of the perceptual sense memories of the first year.”</p>

I think the children being at school in many ways will be very helpful because he will have time on his hands to just be with her to build that connection, to have this time with W.</p>

She would either become extremely withdrawn and turn inwards or she would express her distress and trauma in a very overt way. So, that could involve behaviour that is very challenging, it could involve running away, it could involve trying to seek out what she is looking for.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Firstly I will consider the scenario whereby W is removed from Mr and Mrs A and is moved to the care of [the father]. The experts who have reported in this case acknowledge that [he] is providing a good standard of parenting for [X, Y and Z]. I concur and have no criticism of [his] parenting. He is able to respond to the needs of his children and he is a good father. This scenario would have the benefit that W would grow up within her birth family. She would have a good understanding of her background and would have a relationship with her siblings.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">However, when considering this scenario I have been most heavily influenced by Dr Blincow. In his report Dr Blincow describes W having such a significant negative reaction to being removed from the only family she knows or is able to remember, whom she views as her Mummy, Daddy and brother, that it would have a lifelong negative influence on her. Her distress would cause short term effects that could become long term effects because she would be so unhappy she would not allow herself to be parented. This would test [the father] to a level which he has not been tested before and therefore becomes an unknown. The effects on [X, Y and Z] are likely to be negative in the short term, caused by the distress of the little girl that they have wanted to live with them for so long. This could affect W’s ability to make a place within the family and could lead to significant negative reactions for the whole family. As Dr Blincow suggests it would be a high risk to her emotional development in the short, medium and long term.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The second scenario is that W remains in the care of Mr and Mrs A. In this situation there are not the same short term risks.  In most respects her life will continue as it has been. The life story work which she needs can be furthered if there is certainty for her future. She will continue to live in her secure home with what she knows as her family.  </p>

In this scenario the risk is that W will not feel part of Mr and Mrs A’s family and will reject them leaving her without security. This is described by Dr Willemsen in his report. This is a possibility and is a risk, however, it is my opinion that this situation can be ameliorated by direct contact. If W has direct experience of her father, her mother (when [she] is well), and [X, Y and Z] this crisis is less likely to happen. She will still have questions but she will also have the ability to get answers.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">As I have said, it is my view that direct contact would support W’s future wellbeing if she continues to live with Mr and Mrs A. In my view direct contact should begin as soon as W is emotionally ready for it. The provisos would have to be that the birth family accepts that W will be growing up with Mr and Mrs A and will not undermine her home with them. In order to test this I would recommend a period following the end of these proceedings when both families are able to come to terms with the future. [The father, the mother], and Mr and Mrs A should then meet. My experience of them is that they are reasonable people who are able to put W’s needs first. With social work support, thought should then be given to direct contact taking place. If necessary further CAMHS support should be employed to advise on the timing.</p>

He formed a different view from that of Dr Helps about [the father]’s ability to understand and anticipate the problems which W would have were she to move to his care.

He considered that the risks could not be ameliorated by the support package because no one can get into a mind of a child of this age and simply tell her that it is going to be OK. The wraparound support would assist but would not address the distress for the child of the strange situation, the loss of her primary carers and the stress of not knowing where she was.</p>

None of the experts have been able to come up with a useful analogy within which to frame the risks in respect of either of the two placement options. The reality is that both options may represent a risk to W’s psychological well-being for the rest of her life. In view of the unique circumstances, neither the theory nor the experience of any of the professionals takes the court very far in terms of a conclusion as to what the likely outcome of either option will be for W.”</p>

Direct contact with her birth family in due course will, it is said, mitigate the risks. Conversely, it is argued by proponents of this view, if W were to be rehabilitated to her birth family, the trauma of a move from everything she has known will be severe, will almost certainly manifest itself within weeks at most of her move, and will very likely have consequences ranging from the severe, even assuming the placement does not break down, to the possibly catastrophic were it to break down. </p>

Conversely, it is argued by proponents of this view, the difficulty – it is said the impossibility – of creating an honest and meaningful ‘narrative’ for W which she will be able to accept if she remains with Mr and Mrs A makes the likelihood of a future breakdown of the placement if she remains with them very real and potentially very damaging. This is linked with concerns that the direct contact which is being suggested may itself put the placement under strain and make it even more difficult for W to accept the ‘narrative’.   </p>

I reject the suggestions that she was an incompetent, careless and unprofessional expert who approached the case with a closed mind. Nor do I accept the suggestion from Ms Fottrell (paragraph 209 above) that reliance on Dr Helps has led others astray. My criticisms of her are more narrowly focused (cf paragraph 90 above). Although I do not think that, at the end of the day, this affected either her clinical judgment or her ultimate conclusions, I was dismayed to hear Dr Helps justifying her mistaken understanding of the ‘sofa’ incident – a mistake for which, of course, the local authority bore the ultimate responsibility – as being due to “inaccurate language” and a “simple misreading of the papers”, defensive comments which suggested she either did not appreciate or was unwilling to acknowledge the significance of the point. Much more seriously, I cannot accept her view of the father as being unable to ‘mentalise’, an opinion supported by no-one else and which stood in stark conflict to a mass of evidence, both lay and professional, attesting to his qualities. This inevitably means that one has to view her other opinions with care, but it does not, in my judgment, mean that I can simply reject her evidence as fundamentally flawed and worthless. I cannot and I do not. But her opinions do have to be approached with caution unless congruent with other expert opinion. </p>

I have thought long and hard about Ms Bazley’s criticisms (paragraph 192) of Dr Blincow, and Ms Fottrell’s submissions (paragraph 211) that his approach was flawed and that he had not grasped the unique nature of the case. At the end of the day, however, and after giving all appropriate weight to those of their points which may have some, though I think limited, substance, I prefer Mr Diver’s appraisal of Dr Blincow, and essentially for the reasons he gave (paragraphs 173, 176, 220).

They are her parents, emotionally, psychologically and socially. They and their son are, and, so far as she can remember, always have been, her family. It may be that she has the implicit memory referred to by Dr Willemsen, but she has no actual memory of her birth family or of any other family. She may be familiar with the words “tummy mummy”, but she has no real understanding of what they mean or of their significance. Given her age and stage of development there is little that could be done to prepare her for a move to her father’s care, nor would it be possible to explain to her, in a way which would have any real meaning for her, what is happening to her, whether before, during or after the move.</p>

There is good reason to think that this phase will last many weeks; it might well last for some months, possibly longer. Even Dr Willemsen thought (paragraph 141) that this phase would last months and months and might last a couple of years; he described the task for the father as “immense”.</p>

What if she does not? Dr Willemsen paints a disconcerting picture of a possible “emotional void” with serious consequences (paragraph 146, though contrast paragraph 150). And, very importantly, by the very end of his oral evidence (paragraph 154) he thought that the plan for rehabilitation to the father “would work” and, notwithstanding the risks, “is the best way forward.” Dr Blincow (paragraphs 111, 126-127) and Dr Helps (paragraphs 156, 163, 168) paint a bleaker picture, of, on one view, a possibly “catastrophic” outcome.</p>

To state the obvious, it is difficult, in truth impossible, to predict with any degree of confidence what will or may happen. I bear in mind, as a very important factor, the father’s absolute commitment to W and the excellence of the care that, I am satisfied, he will be more than willing and able to provide for her. But this only brings into focus the question of the extent to which what happens is, ultimately, more down to him or to W. The sad reality is, as Mr Hatter (paragraph 134) and Dr Willemsen (paragraph 143) have suggested, that this may well be more about W than the father, and that much may – I suspect will – depend on matters internal to W, so that, at the end of the day, more may turn on her resilience, adaptability and psychological functioning than on whatever the father is able to do for her. Mr Bagchi, as we have seen (paragraph 183), identifies this as a possibly pivotal issue. It is something I have thought long and hard about. My conclusion is that the excellence of the father’s care will undoubtedly maximise the prospects of a successful outcome if W is returned to his care, but that, whatever support package might be put in place, it will not of itself suffice, because, in the final analysis, so much will depend upon W rather than the father.</p>

Not just the difficulty in crafting an honest account of an extraordinarily complex history, but, even more, an account which W would be able to accept and take in her stride without putting her placement with Mr and Mrs A under intolerable and, possibly, unbearable and unsustainable pressure, leading to a significant risk of breakdown. Ms Bazley (paragraph 196) characterised this as the “fundamental flaw” in the plan for adoption. Ms Fottrell (paragraphs 213, 215) saw it as a “key issue” and “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">the</span> unique element” in the case and one which, for Mr Hatter and Dr Willemsen, was potentially fatal to W's psychological stability in adolescence and adulthood. She elaborated this at some length (paragraphs 213-215), making the point (paragraph 215) that none of the professionals in the case had any experience of working with a child with such a narrative and that this had fed into what she described as a significant degree of misplaced confidence about the manageability of the narrative.</p>

Contact would expose W to a family environment in which it would become increasingly apparent to her that her siblings were thriving. Sooner or later, she would ask ‘Why am I not living with them? Why can’t I live with them?’ Would she be able to accept the ‘narrative’? The concern is that she would reject both the narrative and her adoptive family. In this context, of course, Dr Helps’ observation (paragraph 165), that in future W will have the cognitive capacity to think for herself, potentially cuts both ways.</p>

That there must be a narrative which, however potentially painful, is unflinchingly honest, is, I think, imperative in W’s interests, now and into the future, in particular into and during her adolescence and into and throughout her adult life. No-one disagrees. The dispute is as to the potentially damaging effect on W into and during adolescence, if she remains with Mr and Mrs A, of the narrative crafted on that footing. This is a matter on which I have thought long and hard. I agree with those who contend that such a narrative may well be very painful for W and very difficult for her to accept. And I recognise that there must be a risk that her reaction to it will put her placement with Mr and Mrs A under real strain or even worse. But this risk must be kept in perspective. W will be exposed to the narrative in its more troubling aspects only gradually and, in all probability, only when the passage of time has made her placement with Mr and Mrs A more and more secure. My assessment, at the end of the day, is that the risk of the narrative putting the placement under unbearable and unsustainable pressure, although real, is small.</p>

Mr Diver’s view (paragraph 175) was that the risks of a return to the father are “too great” and “not able to be lessened”, while remaining with Mr and Mrs A “represents the least amount of risk.” Adoption, in his view (paragraph 175), “is the only situation in which W will have the security that she needs.” ‘Nothing else will do’, he says, because, in his view (paragraph 219), the risks of a transition to the father’s care are “too great and “not able to be lessened.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Willemsen, recognising in his report (paragraph 141) that it is “entirely unclear” how W will develop if adopted, thought it “unlikely” that a placement with Mr and Mrs A would break down, but did not preclude developmental problems “years down the line.” His ultimate view, as we have seen, was (paragraphs 154, 235) that that the plan for rehabilitation to the father “would work” and, notwithstanding the risks, “is the best way forward.” I respect that opinion, even though it crystallised only at the very end of his oral evidence, but I cannot agree with it. In the face of <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the evidence, both expert and lay, although I can agree that Dr Willemsen’s plan <span style="font-style:italic">might </span>work, I cannot agree that it <span style="font-style:italic">would </span>work. Nor, taking everything into account, can I agree that it is <span style="font-style:italic">the best way forward</span>.</p>

At the end of the day, my paramount consideration has to be, as section 1(2) mandates, W's welfare, throughout her life.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am, at the end of the day, driven to the conclusion, which in the event I arrive at unhesitatingly, that W <span style="font-style:italic">must</span>, for her own good, for her own happiness and for her welfare, now, in the years to come, into and through adulthood, indeed for the whole of what I appreciate may be a very long life – she may well live into the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> century – remain with what for her is her family, that is, with Mr and Mrs A and their son. I have obviously considered very carefully, as section 1(4)(c) of the Act requires, the likely effect on W, throughout her life, of having ceased to be a member of her original family and become an adopted person and, as required by section 1(4)(f)(ii), the ability and willingness of her birth family to provide W with a secure environment and to meet her needs, and also, as required by section 1(4)(f)(iii), their wishes and feelings regarding W. But I am also required, by section 1(4)(f), to have regard, inter alia, to the relationship she has with Mr and Mrs A and their son and, by section 1(4)(f)(i), to the value to W of that relationship continuing. In drawing attention to these particular aspects of section 1, I do not, of course, overlook the other provisions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Drawing the statutory threads together, the sad reality is that W does not now have, did not at the time of the hearing before me have, any meaningful relationship with her birth family; the most important, indeed from her perspective the dominating, relationship for W is and has for some time been with Mr and Mrs A and their son. The value to W of that relationship continuing is enormous. And while I recognise – how could I not? – the strength of the father’s wishes and feelings, and his absolute commitment to W and unconditional willingness to provide for her every need, one has to question his ability to do so; not because of any failings or limitations on his part, because for all practical purposes there are none, but because what would be demanded of him would probably be almost too much for any parent in his situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In coming to this conclusion I make clear that I have very much in mind the point pressed upon me by Ms Bazley and others, that, as I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span>, para 74(viii), judges “should take a medium-term and long-term view of the child’s development and not accord excessive weight to what appear likely to be short-term or transient problems.” But the stark reality here, in my evaluation of what the future in all likelihood holds, is that the future for W if she returns to her father is not one of merely short-term or transient problems; far from it. The risks of moving W from Mr and Mrs A are simply too great, and potentially so unmanageable, as to demand that they not be run.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Given that analysis, given my conclusion that W’s welfare demands that she remains with Mr and Mrs A, I am also driven to the conclusions (a) that W’s welfare requires that she be adopted – for her long-term welfare cannot otherwise be secured – and, a separate matter, (b) that her welfare “requires” (in the sense explained in the authorities) that her parents’ consent to her adoption be dispensed with. Adoption is demanded by the overriding necessity of W’s interests and welfare. Nothing else will do.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a clear consensus among all the experts that, if W is to remain with Mr and Mrs A, it is in her best interests that there should be increased contact leading to direct contact with her birth family as soon as is practical. There was general agreement that W’s long-term psychological wellbeing – her ability to understand her status as an adopted person and to put her particular ‘narrative’ in context – would be best safeguarded if contact with her birth family took place sooner rather than later. I agree with that. I also agree that there should be no <span style="font-style:italic">order</span> for contact, something which no expert recommended. If Mr and Mrs A are to be W’s adoptive parents, and this is the hypothesis on which the question arises, it must be for them to decide when, how and in what circumstances contact should begin and develop. And, quite apart from that, it is quite impossible at this point to spell out any of these matters with the kind of precision which would be required in an order. All that said, I agree with Dr Blincow’s view, expressed in answer to questions from Mr Bennett, that Mr and Mrs A need to “commit themselves” to making such contact work and that “it is very, very important … that [they] adopt that course of action wholeheartedly.”</p>
