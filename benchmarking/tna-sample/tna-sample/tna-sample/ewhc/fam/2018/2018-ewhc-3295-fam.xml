	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There has been significant delay in arriving at this final composite hearing which was listed for 20 days.  That is due to a number of causes, including late revelations and allegations of sexual abuse, and inter-sibling sexual activity; subsequent police investigations and the international element.  I have been determined, largely due to that delay and my concern about the impact of that delay on the welfare of the children, to give a judgment on Day 20.  Therefore, this judgment is being given orally in order to achieve that objective, and accordingly I reserve the right to perfect this judgment; and at the conclusion of the judgment counsel are invited to indicate any areas that require clarification or to indicate any errors or omissions in the judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am dealing with seven children: A, born on 31 January 2005, aged 13; B, born 19 April 2007, aged 11; C, born 24 December 2008, aged 9 3/4; D, born 15 October 2010, aged 7, almost 8; E, born 3 December 2012, aged 5 years, 10 months; F, born 24 June 2015, aged 3; G, born 28 April 2017, aged 1 year, 5 months.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Local Authority, represented by Mr Crabtree, has made applications for care orders in respect of the older six children, and a placement order in respect of E and F.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother is represented by Ms Howard and Ms Halshall-Fischer.  The father is represented by Mr Khan and Ms Turner.  The parents' view is that the older six children should be rehabilitated to the care of the mother, and they would consent to the making of a care order on that basis.  They oppose the applications for a placement order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Their position is that G is being cared for by the paternal grandmother, and that following the allegations of sexual abuse against the paternal grandfather in Pakistan, he has left the family home.  Their case is that he is receiving good enough care in Pakistan, and there is an acceptance that he has not been returned to this country largely because if he was returned, he would be taken into care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Emergency travel documents are available, but without a NICOP card, he cannot leave Pakistan.  The evidence that I have, such as it is, is that the parents would need to cooperate in order to secure the NICOP card.  If the court rules that all of the children cannot be rehabilitated to the mother's care, then she asks that some of them are rehabilitated to her care.  The father accepts that he cannot provide good enough care for the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst the Children's Guardian supports the applications for care orders in respect of the older six children, and also supports the continuation of wardship in respect of G, he is opposed to the making of the placement orders on the basis that E and F should remain in their current foster placements on the basis of long-term foster care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are also issues around parental contact; a forced marriage protection order; and whether the parents' passports should be retained by the Local Authority.  The Local Authority has, pursuant to court direction, drawn up a final schedule of findings which appears, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, at C609.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to decide the issues in this case, I have an extensive hearing bundle, which runs to six lever arch files; a supplemental bundle; and I have prepared another bundle with the very helpful closing submissions made by counsel for all parties.  I have also had an opportunity to consider the DVDs of the interviews of the children.  I have also been given two bundles of documents by the parents.  The mother's bundle contained lots of letters, cards and pictures with loving messages from the children; the father's bundle contains school achievement, awards and other extracurricular certificates, photographs, letters and cards, and pictures with loving messages.  I have also had an opportunity to view more photographs this morning on a laptop provided by Mr Khan.As I will say later in this judgment, I have no doubt that the parents love their children, and the children love them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> I have also heard oral evidence from a number of witnesses, including the parents, the social worker, three experts, and the Children's Guardian.  I intend to deal with the evidence in some detail.  No party made an application for any of the children to give oral evidence or to be cross-examined.  The current position is that A is in a foster placement on her own, as is B.  C and D are in foster placement together, as are E and F.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I heard from the social worker RM.  Mr Crabtree on behalf of the Local Authority has very helpfully prepared a schedule of documents prepared by the social worker, as they are numerous.  She became the allocated social worker on 14 March 2017.  She co-worked the case with CC between March and July 2017, and with VJ between July and October 2017.  Since then, she has been the sole allocated social worker.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In her oral evidence, she was asked to deal with the assault perpetrated by the father on B.  At C284 and 285 she described that the father has a conviction for assaulting B between 11 and 12 March 2017.  The father pleaded guilty to the assault on 18 April 2017.  He received a suspended sentence, and was required to work with probation.  The father had said that the assault happened when the mother was out with F, and he was home with the other children.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The father's version of what happened is significantly minimised when compared to B's account.  At that stage, 6 December 2017, he was maintaining that this was a one-off incident.  On 20 July 2017, B told the social worker that both of her parents and all her siblings were downstairs when she was assaulted.  She was hit with a wooden spoon so hard she thought that her leg was broken.  It was the worst pain she had ever felt in her life.  She could not even walk properly.  The social worker observed that she was extremely fearful about saying what she did.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 20 November 2017 A described how the father had assaulted B.  She describes seeing the spoon break.  It was a wooden spoon, it snapped.  The mother did tell the father to stop.  The social worker described how A's body language changed when she was describing the incident.

He is less aggressive in the placement.  However, they still have difficulties with his behaviour.  The foster carer has noticed that his behaviour is most difficult after contact sessions, and can last for two days after the contact sessions.  E has started in Reception class since my previous assessment.  Staff said that when E first started in the class, he struggled, he was unfocussed and unsettled; he struggled with his concentration; he was impulsive.  They have said that he was not deliberately naughty.</p>

This usually calms down as the contact progresses.  He is angry, aggressive, and seems to be very unhappy."</p>

The turning point for the social worker was when the foster carers said that they would only be long-term carers for the children under a care order.  The social worker said that that would lead the children to be subject to statutory interventions for the rest of their minority.  I think actually that should be 18 months, not 16, but I will check that at the end of this judgment.</p>

The sort of exposure to statutory intervention involved personal education plans, meetings once per term; care planning meetings every six months; social work visits to the house every six weeks, but that could reduce to twelve weeks; child-in-care reviews, and being seen by the IRO every six months; yearly health assessments and foster carers having to check with the social worker on decision-making as they had no parental responsibility.</p>

The officer refused to lead into the evidence, and whilst few ABE interviews are perfect, this was of a reasonable standard.  She showed suitable reticence about making the allegations at the start, and was clearly concerned that her father should see it.  She also answered open questions in giving the evidence that she gave.</p>

Inconsistencies of accounts from the children must be seen against a backdrop of external pressure to conceal and change accounts from the parents, and the collectivist culture of the family.  That, taken with the analysis of Dr P about how we get inconsistent accounts from children, give a context for consideration of the children's evidence, and B in particular, that does not permit a simplistic, "It is inconsistent, therefore it is unreliable".  The picture is more complex than that.</p>

The social worker disputed that.  She confirmed that in a meeting with his probation officer and the social worker on 19 December 2017, the father had made certain admissions which are recorded by the probation officer at C415.  The father stated that he did regularly chastise and physically punish the children.  Not every day, and not all the children.  Mainly A and B.  He said he would mainly smack them, either on the back of their heads or on their legs.  He made it clear he very rarely smacked the younger children.  He estimated it was two to three times per week.</p>

The psychologist was very clear about the amount of work that the father needed to do, and that it was outside of the timescales for the children and the court.  His admissions were a positive as, until then, he was calling the children liars.</p>

He then said to A, 'Speak to R (social worker) if you want it back', and this upset A, and she started to cry.  It is unclear what the father's intentions were in this action, as it is generally understood by all who know A that her phone is important to her, and she has been fixated with having her phone returned to her following this being taken, after the father was found to be contacting her through WhatsApp.</p>

The father had demonstrated commitment to attending contact, and was asking to see more of them.  If the children were not placed with the mother under a care order, then the social worker said that contact should take place three times per annum.  That was to enable the children to achieve stability in their placement, and undergo the therapy recommended by Dr P.   The level of contact had also been set against the backdrop of issues that had occurred in contact to date.

That continued right up to the meeting on 19 December.  His admissions on 19 December represented a sea change in his approach, which caused concern for the probation officer, who felt that the work done up to that time had been wasted as a result.  He had been seen once a week since April 2017.  There was no interpreter at any meeting.  He never indicated that he needed one.  They had in-depth conversation, and he described the father as very articulate, with a good command of English.</p>

The probation officer received information from the social worker that the father was attending appointments, and recording their meetings.  He asked the father if there was anything that he was not telling him, and he said, "Nothing at all".  He asked him whether he had ever recorded the sessions, and the father said, "No", and added that he did not think that his phone could do that.</p>

He said that if they rang him, and he was not around, he would ring them back.  He was asked, what did he talk about with the children, and he said that A said she missed him, and that he misses her too.  The father said that the reason that A had attempted to take her own life was because she had been naughty, and was locked in a room by her foster carer.  Also, Children's Services had been putting pressure on her.</p>

She was not being asked to deal with questions in English, they were being translated.  I have no doubt at all that the word "kick" was capable of being translated into Urdu, and was translated into Urdu, a fact confirmed by the interpreter, who said that when he had translated, she understood.  In my judgment, the mother was trying to explain away any difficulties with cross-examination from the day before.  I also clarified with the interpreter that he asked the mother regularly if she understood in Urdu, as he was translating.  She had thought overnight, and come up with a fabricated explanation for any perceived difficulties from the day before.</p>

She said that she accepted it.  It was put to her that that meant that the assault took place when B was 9.  She agreed, and said he had probably hit B before then.  She was then asked why she had said earlier in her evidence that the slapping did not start before the age of 11.  She had no good answer for that.  She was also asked about D.  She had said that D would be slapped, until she was diagnosed with a kidney condition.  She agreed that she was diagnosed aged 5.  That meant that by definition, D was slapped before she was 5.</p>

She accepted that to cause the bruising, 3 by 5.5 centimetres, it would have go be a hefty blow and very painful.

In my judgment, she was giving a fabricated account.  I am satisfied that she was present at the scene of the assault on B with the spoon, and did try to prevent it, as reported by the children.  I cannot conceive of any sensible reason for them to lie about that.  The walk for the diabetes is an account that the parents are giving pursuant to a conspiracy to lie about the mother's presence at the scene, and to try to distance her from the assault, to try to strengthen their case that the children should return to her care.</p>

When B came back, she had sweets and crisps in her hand.  The mother did not ask the father why he had not brought treats back for the other children.

She came back on her own.  She said as he had no visa,  he could not come.  I do not believe her or the father on this issue.  They have conspired with family members to keep G in Pakistan, out of the jurisdiction, and away from the authorities here.

She did not know what she had done.  She thought that B had told the foster carer that A strangled her, however A said that she did not, she had simply pinched around the throat.  There was a picture of B's diary, and A claimed that they did not tell the truth.

I did not want to agree, and I saw a solicitor in Pakistan on 5 April to prepare the document that I need to start the divorce process.  I attach this document.  I was told that the process was not immediate, and would take time.  I took the document to the court on 17 April.  After 17 April, both families asked me to give my husband another chance.  They were concerned about the children and the fact that they were still very young.  They urged me to separate from my husband if this was still what I wanted, but did not want me to issue divorce proceedings.  I agreed simply to separate from my husband.  I am very angry with my husband for what he has done, and I remain separated from him.  He has let both me and the children down badly."</p>

She said that she did say this because she was scared that he would tell his mother not to give G back.  She accepted it was dishonest.  She was asked by Mr Khan, on behalf of the father, whether when she said that the father would hit the children on the back of the head, that in fact the father's case was that it was just the back of the neck.

This was a clear example of the mother's willingness to collude with the father to try and present a united front.  If the matters were not so serious, the amateurish attempt at trying to present a plausible account, that fitted with the father's account, would have been laughable.  Irrespective of any physical separation, in my judgment, the mother has not separated from the father emotionally or psychologically.</p>

She asked if he strangled the children.  He said the word "strangle" is one that he had just learned, and did not know it before.  He said, "No, never".  The probation officer said, "Maybe you just put a hand on her neck", and the father said that he said, "Maybe".  The social worker was taking notes, and he did not know what she wrote.  He only saw afterwards the word "grab".</p>

The social worker said to him that the children were alleging he had hit them with a cable.  He said he was under stress at the time, and he asked that if he accepted all things for the sake of his own children, would that make the Local Authority change the plan?  If so, then he would accept it.</p>

In cross-examination by the Local Authority, he said that he accepted full responsibility for the bruise to B.  He had hit her with a spoon that was roughly a foot long.  The wooden part of the spoon had broken.  He gave a physical demonstration of the force with which he had hit her, when he raised his hand above his head, and brought it down onto a carrier bag of papers on the desk.  It was forceful.</p>

He then sought to suggest that the conversation with the social worker had begun with him saying that if he admitted what was right, and what was not right, in the meeting with the Local Authority, then would they change their care plan.  He said that he had said that.  Whether it was true or untrue, he would accept everything if they changed their plan.

In my judgment, it is unlikely that he would make false admissions of this gravity, and with the detail given, if he had not done those acts, even if he was wanting the Local Authority to change their plan.

He had been told that B had said that A did something to her, which A had denied, so he said, "It is a matter for the judge".  He denied that he was burying his head in the sand.  He denied that he had had any responsibility if they had engaged in inappropriate sexual contact, because he did not know about it.</p>

He said that if the police had mentioned the pornographic movies that H had allegedly shown to his daughters, then he would have remembered.</p>

He had said that he accepted that G would be placed in care if he was returned to the UK, but that was not the sole reason why he remained in Pakistan.

Most recently it was in the face of my direction that he provide evidential proof of his father's illness that was better than the poor documentary evidence that had been provided; and in the face of my provisional observation that I would be considering allowing him to go to Pakistan, but on the basis that I made an order compelling him to return his son to this country, so that if he breached the order, he would be in contempt of court.</p>

The contact record at 2476 was put to him.  He had spoken about the Koran, and the first murder.  Then, the father had gone on to speak of falling for his cousin, who was the mother.  He was asked why he referred to the mother as a cousin, rather than his wife, and the father said that he did not think that he had used the word cousin.  I find that he did.</p>

He was asked to consider the contact record at 1789 when A was speaking to the contact worker, asking about marriage.  She also asked the contact worker whether she knew of the girl who had been killed, because she chose not to get married.  She said that that was like her family, not the killing, but the others.</p>

She expressed the view that the father has insight, because he accepts that what he has done in the past is wrong.</p>

Therefore, the care that she needs is of an incredibly high standard.</p>

She recognised that the father does not put himself forward in any event.  In terms of the mother, her concern was that after reassessing the mother, the mother talked of change that she experienced through the individual therapy.  Fundamentally, there had been a change in understanding herself.  However, when they met to talk about A and her difficulties, the expert was struck by the mother's inability to demonstrate a psychological understanding of A.  For a carer to meet A's needs, the expert would want to see conversation around the impact of the early attachment history; her relationships with her parents; and some psychological understanding of the abuse of the father on her emotional presentation, both currently and into the future.</p>

The expert would also want to see an understanding that the disclosures of A, which were denied by the mother and then later accepted, were highly significant for A, and the mother had shown little understanding of the impact of that on their relationship.  There was also significant impact on the attachment with the mother.  The majority of experiences for A through her life, were of the mother siding with the father as far as A was concerned.  It was now highly unlikely that A would see the mother as somebody who could keep her safe.</p>

So, her expectation would be that the mother would not keep her safe.  In terms of her needs for therapy, having experienced trauma like she had, she first of all needs to be in a home where she feels safe, with a level of permanence that would not change.</p>

He seemed to have made a shift in psychological understanding of the world around him, and the impact of the early history, and his behaviours of the past; and in terms of potential behaviours in the future.  However, in terms of relating that to the children, the expert had not seen any change.  The changes he had made in himself had not moved to the children. </p>

In terms of what he was self-reporting, it could be that he was simply demonstrating learned responses, the expert said, or alternatively, the changes were incredibly small changes related to him, and he could not extrapolate that to others around him.  For example, around the issue of sexual abuse, and non-disclosure, he was of the view that as the children did not disclose the sexual abuse to him, he could not do anything as a result.</p>

The parents need an understanding of the children's wellbeing.  The children need permanence and stability.  Further applications by the parents in respect of the contact, and to discharge care orders, could destabilise the placements as it introduces uncertainty.

The foster carers had skills, and presented an excellent option for the two children being cared for together in placement.  Whilst adoption may be considered the best outcome, the expert said: really we need to think about the quality of care.

She said that what we want to do is give the children the best chance in the future.  She had made it very clear that the children should stay together, and only if there was no placement together was it logical to consider separate placements.  There would be short-term harm if moved from the current placement, balanced against the risk of placement not being permanent, or breaking down in years to come.  It was clear that both placements, in long-term foster care and adoption, can break down.  It then comes down to the commitment to the children of the carers.  If they show long-term commitment, then there is no evidence to suggest that it is more likely that there will be a breakdown of the foster care placement as an adopted placement.</p>

At the moment, the current placement should be considered "very highly" as a long-term option, she said.  The children are flourishing there, and their care needs are being met.  There was a need for very clear thought and consideration of it as a long-term option.  She felt that there was no harm widening the search to look at all options, and the expert agreed to provide her own input.</p>

She described the interface between individualistic cultures such as the UK, and collectivist cultures such as in Pakistan.  She described the parenting styles in the UK as more authoritative with more compromise and more choice for children.  However, in Pakistan the culture was more authoritarian with a head of the household.  Individualistic cultures have choice and autonomy for children from a young age, where in collectivist there is more emphasis on children being obedient and compliant.</p>

B had come to the UK when she was 3, and it was tricky for both girls.  This was something more than sibling rivalry.  B's difficult behaviour in foster care, for example, smearing faeces on towels; her wilful and poor attitude; pouring water on the floor; picking off gems from a picture frame of her sister; trying to open the car door whilst it was being driven: was because she had been allowed to speak out about her experiences.  She had made disclosures that were very difficult in the context of a collectivist culture.  She had also been told that she was not telling the truth by her parents.  Smearing faeces was behaviour often linked to trauma, as were the attention-seeking behaviours of D.  B's behaviour was her way of displaying distress.</p>

Different narratives at different times can be caused by children's anxiety.  One should think about how memories are formed.  When we remember, it is rarely perfect.  We remember snapshots of a memory, and put bits in the middle to create the recollection.  Traumatic memories are more prone to distortion, the reason for this is that when something difficult happens, our instinct is to block it out.  We can also have intrusive thoughts, which are not accurate but intrusive.  That is how difficult memories are processed, and are less accurate than the more positive memories as we try to recollect.</p>

Also, research tells us that if you have a memory, and someone tells you persistently that it is not true, that can make a child question the accuracy of the memory.  So, different factors are behind different narratives.</p>

It was incredibly difficult to answer what the impact on the children would be over their lives of adoption.  In terms of separation from parents, it was possible to explain why adoption had taken place: because the parents are unable to care.  However, it is more difficult to explain why they are separated from their siblings.</p>

Contact and pitching the right level was about allowing the children to build attachment to new carers.  It was incredibly difficult to do that if there was regular contact with the parents.  There was a need to recognise the new carers as the primary attachment figures.  Whilst settling into new placements, the level of contact should not be pushed too much, at what will be a very difficult time.</p>

He referred to the extensive schedule of findings relied upon by the Local Authority, and said that the case centred around issues of dishonesty.

It was very rare that that opportunity arose in court proceedings, and it had demonstrated a positive change in the children, and integration into the foster carers' family.  What could be said without a written assessment of the foster carers was that they have, and will continue to, meet the needs of the children.

Foster care was more susceptible to breakdown, although in looking at this foster placement, the children had been there for 16 months.  The foster carers were able to meet their cultural and religious needs.  They understood E's difficulties, and his social and emotional needs, and the difficulties around his emotional regulation.  Their commitment to the children was quite tangible.  They are so committed, and have derived so much enjoyment from caring for the children.

If he realised he could be moved on again, there would be a significant impact, and a predictable change in his behaviour.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am grateful for the assistance with the law from counsel.  The following legal principles which I have taken into account in making all of the findings in this judgment can be distilled as thus: the burden of proof lies at all times with the Local Authority.  The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.  Findings of fact in these cases must be based on evidence, including inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence, and not on suspicion or speculation.  Suspicion is not enough, nor is surmise, speculation, or assertion.  The question is whether in relation to each discrete part of its case, the Local Authority had established on a balance of probabilities, applying that concept with common sense, the proposition for which it contends.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When considering cases of suspected child abuse, the court must take into account all the evidence; and furthermore, consider each piece of evidence in the context of all of the other evidence.  The court invariably surveys a wide canvas.  A judge in these difficult cases must have regard to the relevance of each piece of evidence to other evidence, and to exercise an overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to the conclusion whether the case put forward by the Local Authority has been made out to the appropriate standard of proof.</p>

It is important to remember that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct, and it is the court that is in the position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence.  It is the judge who makes the final decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common for witnesses in these cases to tell lies in the course of the investigation, and the hearing.  The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, and distress; and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything.  Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this country, we do not require documentary proof.  We rely heavily on oral evidence, especially from those who were present when the alleged events took place.  Day after day, up and down the country, on issues large and small, judges are making up their minds whom to believe.  They are guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities; any contemporaneous documentation or records; any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather than the other; and their overall impression of the characters and motivations of the witnesses.</p>

But it is the task which we are paid to perform to the best of our ability.  In the legal system, if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place.  If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When set against the very limited pool of potential adopters, the Guardian feels that it is too big a gamble to jeopardise the foster placement where the prospects for success of finding a suitable adoptive placement are so small.  Furthermore, the simple act of moving him into another placement will likely cause irreparable damage to his ability to form attachments, and could therefore bring an end to the current placement, and there is a high risk that the future adoptive placement would fail in any event.</p>

That would avoid the level of intrusion and intervention in the children's lives that the care order would bring.  The placement order would not mean that the Local Authority has to place for adoption, but simply that they could carry out the search, and then reach a decision with the benefit of Dr P's input as to which was the placement best suited to these children.</p>

His attachment style has impacted on his emotional regulation and pursuit of control.  His attachment is complex.  It is all or nothing.  Whilst initially his strongest attachment figure was his father, more recent contact sessions have revealed that he is aggressive towards his father, not listening to instructions.  He has kicked his father, and at times appeared unhappy and distressed.  He too has improved significantly in foster care, due to the high level of care that he receives.</p>

It is also something to be weighed in the balance when the professional assessment of the Children's Guardian, who has been to the placement to see the children on three occasions, is that as far as E is concerned, the simple act of moving him onto another placement, even if it is a suitably-matched adoptive placement, may so destroy his trust in forming attachments, that it may significantly harm, if not destroy, the prospects for success of forming a successful attachment in a new adoptive placement.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"(1) first, absent a statutory power, there was no power to permit the continuation of the passport order post the conclusion of the care proceedings until further order.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"(3) third, that the judge erred in failing to make any adequate provision for future review of the necessity of the passport order.  A Local Authority review from time to time of whether a future application by the appellant for the return of his passport should be opposed was a wholly inadequate review mechanism, implying that the onus was on the appellant to justify why his passport should be returned to him, when the onus should be on the state to justify the curtailment of that freedom."</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Black, LJ agreed.  I consider this to be a highly persuasive authority as no definitive view was expressed, and therefore, it is not binding.  Whilst I accept that the court has the power to make an order that provides for the continued retention of the parents' passports, having performed a close evaluation of the degree of risk for the children, and of the harm to which they would be exposed if the risk becomes a reality, and whether such a serious invasion of the parents' rights is proportionate and necessary, I have concluded that it is not.</p>

In giving evidence, the social worker expressed the view that if the passports were retained, then that might provide added reassurance for the children that they would not be removed and taken to Pakistan.  That, in my judgment, does not establish that there is a risk to be guarded against here to justify such a serious invasion of the parents' rights.  To be effective, the passports would need to be held for up to 13 years, as F is 3 years of age, and the Local Authority has put its case on forced marriage at around the age of 16.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is difficult to see how the court could ever be in a position, moving forwards, where the court could say that the risk of a forced marriage could be put to one side.  The father has already demonstrated, as has the mother, that they cannot be trusted.  The protection for the children against being taken to Pakistan, and forced to marry, must come from the combined effect of the care orders and forced marriage protection orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other limb to the Local Authority's argument is that there is an order providing for the ongoing wardship of G, and that the court should, in its inherent jurisdiction, make a passport order retaining the parents' passports on the basis that it is a time-limited order, and subject to review.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In giving evidence, the social worker said that the rationale behind this was to prevent the mother and/or the father secretly returning to this country with G.  Mr Crabtree suggested in his submissions that the court should also guard against the parents going to Pakistan, and resuming care of G there.  Once again, I am not satisfied that after a close evaluation of the degree of risk to the child, and of the harm to which he would be exposed if the risk became a reality, that such a serious invasion of the passport holder's rights is proportionate and necessary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It would be necessary to continue such an order until G attained the age of majority.  Whilst one could build in a time-limited order with review, unless he was returned to this country, the nature of the risk would be highly unlikely to change, in my judgment.  Therefore, the level of interference, and invasion of the passport holder's rights would be disproportionate and, in my judgment, not necessary.  After all, if the parents did bring him back to this country, albeit secretly, at least he would be back in this jurisdiction, and it would be likely, in my judgment, that the matter would come to the attention of the authorities.  In those circumstances, I make no order in respect of the parents' passports, and they should be released back to the parents.  That concludes this judgment.</p>
