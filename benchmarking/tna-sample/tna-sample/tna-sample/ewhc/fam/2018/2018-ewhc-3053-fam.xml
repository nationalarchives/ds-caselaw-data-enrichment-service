Within this there is a difference of some £3.5 million in the evaluation of the wife’s housing need and at the top end a difference of some £300,000 per annum in her income needs.  But more importantly there is the fundamental difference in principle between their approaches; on the one hand sharing with a crosscheck against needs, on the other a needs approach on its own without reference to any sharing principles.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The wife’s case in a nutshell is that this is quintessentially a sharing case. She says that from 2007 until 2013 the parties cohabited in London, The Alps, and France and that this period added to the four years of the marriage from 2013 to 2017 make this a medium duration marriage. She submits that in 2007 when the cohabitation commenced Zebra was in its early phase and was of limited value; possibly reflective only of the sums that the husband had himself invested into it. She submits that the husband has failed to disclose documentation which would enable her team to undertake any sort of detailed evaluation of the financial position of Zebra in 2007. The husband’s failure to disclose these documents which either he or his accountant must have or must have access to leads unerringly, she submits, to the conclusion that he has withheld them because they do not support his case that it was pregnant with value at that point in time. She submits that the vast majority of the value that was realised on its sale in 2017/18 was built up in Zebra from 2007 and that this was the result of the husband’s endeavours in the business over that period. She submits that whilst he made his contributions by building up the business, she made matching contributions on the domestic front by looking after her child and his children, helping in the design, renovation and furnishing of the various properties they owned, organising their lives on the domestic front and supporting him in his business endeavours both emotionally but also practically by introducing him to the social and financial elite of London, Europe and perhaps America. She submits that the evidence plainly supports her evaluation of the nature of the relationship between 2007 and 2013 and that this was truly a seamless transition from cohabitation to marriage. The relationship was committed and exclusive from 2007 and the pattern of their lives did not alter from before to after the marriage. She contributed to the children, to their properties and was prepared to contemplate seeking to adopt the husband’s son, HS. The husband’s daughter, HD, spent time with her in the summer of 2017 when the husband was away with his new girlfriend. The fact that HD saw Smith Place as her London home illustrates how close the wife was to the children. She submits that the parties led the life of an international family with homes in multiple countries, and a standard of living which involved the finest of all that money could buy albeit perhaps not at the level of the super-rich. On her formulation of her own open offer she would receive approximately 40% of the current net assets in the lump sum of £16 million. She says this is a fair share of the wealth that was generated during the time that the parties were together. She cross checks this against needs. Although she had not owned property prior to meeting the husband, Mr Cusworth QC submits that her need now is for an unencumbered property of her own. He submits that the fact that the parties owned homes in The Alps, The Principality, and France (albeit not necessarily held in their own or the wife’s name) justifies her now owning her own home. Her current home would cost approximately £6 million to buy on a relatively short lease. She aspires to buy something similar. Property particulars for alternatives she suggests range between £5 - £6.5 million pounds, giving a housing fund need taking account of stamp duty and cost of purchase of between £6 - £7 million. Her budget comes in at just under £600,000 per year, which she says is less than half of the overall rate of expenditure of the family during the marriage. She relies on a budget which she says shows annual expenditure in 2015 of €1.864 million, the equivalent of £1.341 million. She says since the separation her actual spending has been in the region of £355,000 over the year. She is currently 50 and says that her annual income need until 60 would be £500,000 per year reducing thereafter to £250,000 per year for life. Using standard Duxbury calculations, this would give a capitalised sum to generate income of £8.6 million. Thus she says an appropriate assessment of her income and capital needs gives rise to a lump-sum of £15-£16 million which demonstrates that the 40% share is also broadly comparable with her needs and thus fair.  </p>

He submits that the period from October 2007 until the marriage in 2013 should properly be regarded as premarital cohabitation which moved seamlessly into the marriage and thus the husband’s work in the business during that period and during the marriage itself represented contributions which were matched by the wife’s contributions to the welfare of the family. Thus she is entitled to share in the assets generated by the parties during the marriage. Mr Cusworth QC acknowledges that an adjustment to the wife’s share would be justified by reference firstly to the fact that Zebra plainly had some value prior to the commencement of the relationship and that its latent potential must be recognised. He submits that the court should discount the current value of Zebra to reflect what the husband introduced (albeit the value should be at the lower end of any bracket given his alleged non-disclosure) and that the wife is entitled to 50% of whatever is left. He also acknowledges that the husband also brought into the marriage the £12 million capital which was expended on the parties’ living expenses and that this justifies some departure from equality and thus some further discount from the 50% of that part of the assets which represents the marital acquest (i.e. after the deduction of the value the husband introduced). He submits that difficulties in the valuation of the various elements relating to Zebra (true value in 2007, latent potential/ springboard, passive growth) are not a reason for not applying the sharing principle. He says they are evidential and the court is entitled to adopt a broader brush approach as recognised by Lord Justice Moylan in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hart</span><span style="font-style:italic">. </span>He submits that the court should err in the wife’s favour on valuation of Zebra-linked issues given the husband’s attitude to disclosure (see later) and his decision not to call Mr N, his accountant.  </p>

However, the base numbers have not been available and the husband has not produced documentation to support it. In relation to cohabitation, the husband has had access to all of the documents which would prove his case that there was no cohabitation. The limited documents the court has are as a result of the wife circumventing the password protections on the husband’s laptop and being able to take photographs of a number of documents she thought were relevant. The husband could have produced more documents to contradict the wife. Furthermore, the husband has wiped the wife’s laptop and iPad which were left in France on the basis that they were not used by her and had been reprogrammed to other functions. Mr Cusworth QC suggests that these were deliberate actions by the husband to prevent the wife gaining access to material which might have supported her case. </p>

He submitted that there is a grey area where sharing or needs might both be appropriate approaches. Mr Marks QC submits that given Zebra was formed in 2002 and that the heavy lifting (including obtaining licences) had been done by 2007, the current value of Zebra is largely attributable to work the husband did before the relationship even commenced. Mr Marks QC referred me to the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Versteegh</span> case [2018] EWCA Civ 1050 and what Lord Justice Lewison said about the difficulties in valuing private companies. Mr Marks QC submits that Zebra is truly the husband’s asset which was never part of the marital arrangements (although I observe that £7 million in proceeds from share sales in 2015 were deployed to maintain the family). The husband argues that the pre-marital relationship cannot properly be characterised as leading seamlessly into marriage and thus the husband’s efforts during that period should also be viewed as generating nonmarital assets. Even if that premarital period from 2007 to 2013 (or some part of it) can be viewed as part of the marriage, much of the increase in value of Zebra was passive because the heavy lifting had been done before then. The husband also argues that from 2012 (when he stepped down as CEO) until 2017 (when he was involved to handle the sale) he was not actively working in Zebra and so passive growth which is not attributable to his efforts cannot be treated as a part of the matrimonial acquest; that period of course covering the entirety of the marriage. In addition Mr Marks QC submits that because it is impossible for the court to accurately value Zebra as at 2007; or the springboard value; or to discern a reliable means of indexation of the passive growth in the premarital value of Zebra from 2007 to 2017; or the passive growth of Zebra during periods of the husband’s inactivity in the company; the shortness of the marriage; and the absence of any children, it is wrong to adopt the sharing approach, because it is not possible reliably to make adjustments to reflect what Mr Marks QC argues are non-marital assets or plainly contributions by the husband which must be non-marital in nature. He describes any attempt at valuing the husband’s interest in Zebra pre-2007 or undertaking a latent or springboard value or indexation as being a stab in the dark. Having said that, he also seeks to rely on the 2007 balance sheet produced by the husband’s accountant and notes that the wife agreed with the other entries in the balance sheet, in particular the existence of the properties. That he says indicates the balance sheet is a genuine document from 2007. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the alternative, he asserts that a true valuation of the business at the date of the marriage would include a significant uplift to reflect its latent potential realised during the marriage and any passive growth attributable to inactive periods, so that any increase in the value of his shares in the business generated during the marriage which might be subject to the sharing principle was consequentially reduced. Furthermore, Mr Marks QC argues that in addition to the non-marital assets (which should not be shared) that the husband made an additional unmatched (by the wife) contribution in the form of the capital he introduced to the marriage which arose from the share sale of his first business. Given that almost all of that capital amounting to some £12 million was spent on meeting the parties living expenses over the ten-year period, the husband argues that this must be taken into account either in adopting a needs-based approach to the wife’s claim or by a significant adjustment if there is to be a sharingbased assessment of the wife’s claim. He points out that the husband brought seven properties into the relationship, within two years this was down to three and not long after that it was down to one property (in France) which is mortgaged 100%. In addition, he brought in liquid capital in the form of investments and guarantees which have all been deployed in meeting the family’s living expenses. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband says that if he is right that Zebra is truly to be characterised as a nonmarital asset then the wife’s claim falls to be assessed by need alone. He says that it is clear from the case law that non-marital assets are not subject to the sharing principle. If that is not applicable then needs are. The husband asserts that the home that the wife currently lives in is larger than she needs given that on her case it was acquired in order to accommodate the whole family of two adults and three children. Her needs now are for herself and for visits from WD, perhaps with a live-in member of staff as well. He has put forward a number of properties in the vicinity of the wife’s present home and further afield which show that a housing fund of £3 - £4 million would generously meet her housing needs.  The wife says none of them are suitable.  The husband says that in due course the wife would have ample scope for later trading down to a smaller or less expensive property and thus would be able to release capital to top up her income fund. The husband characterises the wife’s budget as an ugly and most improvident starting point for an assessment of her needs. He observes that prior to the relationship in 2007 she had very little; a small lump sum from her annulled marriage, small commissions from property introductions, irregular financial support from the father of WD, and had been in rented property apparently for most of her life. He says that the 2015 budget the wife relies on in fact was produced by him to demonstrate that if the parties met that expenditure they would be overspending by a considerable sum and they needed to cut back. He does not accept that they in fact spent at that level. He says that a proper assessment of her needs, even taking account of the parties’ standard of living, would be £200,000. He submits that this is roughly what she has spent in the last 12 months and that should be a starting point; she needs time to adjust to the real world and to accept that she will not be maintained at the level she lived for the rest of her life. He cross-references this to what he submits can be attributed to the wife as her expenditure in the last 12 months, excluding rental payments. He submits that she is able to meet aspects of her income needs from her role as a brand ambassador. Thus a total lump sum of £4.85 million, which after repayment of W’s loans would leave her with about £4.4 million, which will enable her both to purchase a property and to draw income from a capital fund, which would later be topped up by the release of equity from a sale of her property.  </p>

The Duxbury sum to generate this income is £2.786 million. Allowing for the wife downsizing in a few years and releasing around £1.2 million would require a payment of a lump sum of £5.1 million representing £3.5 million for housing and £1.6 million for income generation to be supplemented by the release of £1.2 million at some point in the future. </p>

Given that the trial template allowed for half a day each for oral submissions I declined his offer; experience suggests that this approach simply doubles the time required to consider the written <span style="font-weight:bold">and </span>oral submissions and the trial timetable simply did not contain the additional time that would be required to digest written submissions as well as a day of oral submissions. However, I did suggest that I would be assisted by an agreed summary of the legal principles. Although the silence was not quite deafening in response to this suggestion, it was not something which the parties were able to agree to provide. As will become apparent in the remainder of this section of the judgment, although the statutory provisions are straightforward and the overarching principles outlined by the House of Lords appear designed to make the determination of financial remedy claims less complex, the reality is far removed.  I was fortunate in having the assistance (within the remits of putting their client’s cases) of leading and junior counsel and solicitors whose experience is unrivalled. I was also fortunate in having a sensible time estimate in order to consider my judgment. Given that the issues of non-marital assets including business assets are likely to fall for consideration in very many cases, and where the assets are such that they exceed the parties’ needs although are nowhere near as substantial as those involved in this case, the task of District Judges (including Deputies) and Recorders and Circuit Judges up and down the country in seeking to apply the law which now derives from a myriad of cases is not an enviable one. No doubt the advent of the financial remedy court will ease the situation to some degree but for the busy Family Court Judge having to determine whether the case might be a ‘Charman (no.4)’ case where awarding less than one third of the assets would be entering dangerous territory, or how the ‘springboard’ value of  a pre-existing business is to be quantified or what indexation should be applied to passive growth of a non-marital asset, or whether the case was properly characterised as a short marriage, dual career case seems to me to be a big ask. Happily, recent decisions of the Court of Appeal in the field appear to support a less technical, more flexible and more common-sense approach to such issues. </p>

The other is counted in domestic comfort and happiness.

On the other hand is the view that this is unrealistic …. Some [assets] are not family assets in the way that the home, its contents and the family savings are family assets …. It simply cannot be demonstrated that the domestic contribution, important though it has been to the welfare and happiness of the family as a whole, has contributed to the acquisition.

The nature and the source of the property and the way the couple have run their lives may be taken into account in deciding how it should be shared. There may be other examples. Take, for example, a genuine dual career family where each party has worked throughout the marriage and certain assets have been pooled for the benefit of the family but others have not. There may be no relationship-generated needs or other disadvantages for which compensation is warranted. We can assume that the family assets, in the sense discussed earlier, should be divided equally. But it might well be fair to leave undisturbed whatever additional surplus each has accumulated during his or her working life. However, one should be careful not take this approach too far. What seems fair and sensible at the outset of a relationship may seem much less fair and sensible when it ends.

The Court of Appeal’s decision was based on the opinion of the majority of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span>, namely Baroness Hale of Richmond, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Mance. The two leading speeches in the House in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> were given by Baroness Hale and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead. As McFarlane LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Sharp</span> (at paragraph 84), there was much common ground in those two speeches, but on some points they differed and on those points it is the opinion of Baroness Hale, with whom Lord Hoffmann and Lord Mance agreed, which represents the authoritative view. As demonstrated by the extracts from the citations above, one point on which the two principal speeches in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> differed was whether or not the court should make a distinction between “family assets” and “business or investment assets”. Lord Nicholls was of the view that the court should be “<span style="font-style:italic">exceedingly slow to do so</span>” (paragraph 20). In contrast, Baroness Hale and the majority adopted a more flexible approach taking account of “<span style="font-style:italic">the nature and the source of the property and the way the couple have run their lives</span>” (paragraph 153).  </p>

For that reason, they wanted the notion of different treatment of unilateral assets in such marriages to be ‘closely confined’. Baroness Hale had herself recognised the need for care and limitation in the last three sentences of paragraph 153.

Moreover, it is a construct which is not always capable of clear identification. An asset can, of course, be entirely the former, as in many cases, or entirely the latter, as in K v L. However, it is also worth repeating that an asset can be comprise both, in the sense that it can be partly the product, or reflective, of marital endeavour and partly the product, or reflective, of a source external to the marriage. I have added the word "reflective" because "reflect" was used by Lord Nicholls in Miller (paragraph 73) and "reflective" was used by Wilson LJ in Jones (paragraph 33). When property is a combination, it can be artificial even to seek to identify a sharp division because the weight to be given to each type of contribution will not be susceptible of clear reflection in the asset's value.

It can, as he said, be artificial to attempt to draw a "sharp dividing line". Valuations are a matter of opinion on which experts can differ significantly. Investigation can be "extremely expensive and of doubtful utility". The costs involved can quickly become disproportionate. Proportionality is critical both because it underpins the overriding objective and because, to quote Lord Nicholls again: "Fairness has a broad horizon".  </span>

The court will have to decide, adopting Wilson LJ's formulation of the broad approach in Jones, what award of such lesser percentage than 50% makes fair allowance for the parties' wealth in part comprising or reflecting the product of non-marital endeavour. In arriving at this determination, the court does not have to apply any particular mathematical or other specific methodology. The court has a discretion as to how to arrive at a fair division and can simply apply a broad assessment of the division which would affect "overall fairness".

The appeal was dismissed notwithstanding that it was reached by an assessment of needs rather than by application of the sharing principle. However, Lord Justice Moylan concluded that the award could not be successfully challenged because the judge independently carried out an overview of the case to ensure that his proposed award was fair. Although assessed by reference to needs, the judge had considered alternative approaches including him assessing what weight to give to the husband’s premarital wealth when assessing the extent to which the parties’ current wealth reflected marital endeavour and the extent to which it did not. The judge expressly concluded that his proposed award gave proper weight to that factor and that his other approaches did not give proper weight to that factor and accordingly would not be fair.

He asserts that because the heavy lifting had been done in the development of Zebra as a business prior to 2007 that the business had a very substantial value at that time. The husband submits that the value that Zebra had at that point should be identified including its springboard potential and that the resulting figure should be subject to some form of indexation to reflect how it grew in value of its own momentum and without regard to the additional contribution of the husband over the marriage; the latter of course being a contribution to the marital assets matched by the wife’s contributions in the course of the marriage.   </p>

In parenthesis, I would add that, because of this principle of ‘reality’, I would reject the graphs provided by Miss Stone seeking to establish the values of the company at certain dates based on an artificial assumption of a straightline growth up to eventual sale. Secondly, if only passive growth is taken into account, the law rewards the spouse who buries her non-matrimonial assets in the ground rather than the spouse who actively manages them. The correct analysis in my judgment, in circumstances of the present, is that, where a spouse has a non-matrimonial asset of the present kind, he is entitled to that element of the company at the end of the day which can fairly be taken to represent the fruits of the non-matrimonial assets that accrue during the marriage, even if the fruits are the product of activity by him or on his own behalf</span>.” </p>

In some marriages, contributions may be very clearly delineated between the money earner and the homemaker but they are treated equally. In many, the dividing lines will be far more blurred with each party contributing to the various needs of the family in a wide variety of different ways. Ultimately a marriage is about a partnership in which usually both will contribute in the way in which they are able. Thus contributions almost inevitably have to be evaluated in the context of the marriage that existed. Where that marriage is atypical it seems to me that the court must approach it in that way. To do otherwise would be to risk discrimination. It is a regrettable feature of the husband’s presentation of this case that, at least in opening and in the documents filed by him prior to the hearing, he asserted that the wife had made no contributions to the marriage or no contributions of any value. The motivation for making such an assertion probably finds its roots in the husband’s post separation re-evaluation of the wife’s attributes and his unfair conclusion that she is and always was a gold-digger. As became clear in the course of the evidence and indeed in the husband’s evidence he accepted that she had contributed in various ways to the marriage, whether in assisting in the design and furnishing their various homes, in looking after WD and his own children, in dealing with domestic living arrangements including liaising with staff, organising travel and holidays, arranging their social life and a myriad of other tasks in the domestic context. By the closing of the case Mr Marks QC did not press to any real extent any argument that the wife had not contributed in ways of value to the welfare of the family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It emerges from the authorities that the issue of premarital cohabitation may be treated either as extending the period of the marriage so as to create a marriage of longer duration or it may be treated as a circumstance of the case which is to be taken into account more generally. It also emerges from the cases that cohabitation prior to marriage is relevant because it may indicate that, prior to the formal commencement of marriage, the parties had entered into the sort of partnership involving the mutual support, working together, rights and obligations which may be indistinguishable from those which arise when parties begin to live together only after marriage. It seems therefore that what the court should be looking for is a relationship of the sort which carries with it sufficient markers which justify being treated as a marriage. Mr Cusworth QC submitted that if there was no change in the nature of the relationship as between before and after the marriage that this of itself was an indication (possibly determinative) that the premarital relationship should be equated with marriage. As a matter of logic, I do not think this necessarily works. Take, for instance, a marriage which is entered into as a matter of convenience, or which otherwise is not followed with the usual panoply of mutual commitments which signify marriage. That would not entitle a premarital period which was similarly empty of such commitments to be counted. What the court must be looking to identify is a time at which the relationship had acquired sufficient mutuality of commitment to equate to marriage. Of course in very many cases, possibly most cases, this will be very obviously marked by the parties cohabiting, possibly in conjunction with the purchase of a property. However in other cases, and this may be one of them, it is not so easy to identify. The mere fact that parties begin to spend time in each other’s homes does not of itself, it seems to me, equate to marriage. In situations such as this, the court must look to an accumulation of markers of marriage which eventually will take the relationship over the threshold into a quasi-marital relationship which may then either be added to the marriage to establish a longer marriage or which becomes a weightier factor as one of the circumstances of the case. </p>

Mr Cusworth QC reminds me that at the case management conference I specifically declined to order a forensic accountancy report in respect of Zebra and observed that both in relation to that and in relation to a section of a new questionnaire raised by the wife, I was relying upon the husband to produce relevant documents which would illustrate the matters that he relied upon. The wife invites me to infer that the only explanation for the husband’s failure to disclose relevant documents is that he has something to hide. In this context it is not hidden assets that are the issue but rather that the wife contends that the value of Zebra as at 2007 must have been low. If it was of significant value, why, rhetorically, would the husband not have produced the documents to show that? As a consequence, Mr Cusworth QC invites me to draw inferences against the husband. In the context of the issues in this case, that inference would involve placing any valuation of Zebra at the lower end of the bracket, and placing the wife’s share or the value of her share in any matrimonial property at the upper end of any possible bracket. </p>

There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband, especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a substantial inquisitorial element. The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation.

The procedural chronology makes abundantly clear that the application has been vigorously and bitterly fought at every step of the way, with considerable skirmishing in the foothills prior to battle being joined before me.  This is undoubtedly a reflection of the hostility that the parties currently feel towards each other which I will comment on later. The collateral damage of the wife’s and the husband’s antipathy towards each other are of course their children. This became abundantly clear when WD, now aged 22, came to give evidence and found it difficult to hold back the tears. Even her relationship with her stepsister, HD, which was formerly close, and with HS, her stepbrother, have suffered to the extent that there is currently no ongoing contact, even digital. I very much hope that these are not fatal wounds to those relationships and that when these proceedings conclude the wife and husband will not force their children to choose sides as they so self-evidently have to date, if not expressly by their words, but by their behaviour. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The wife gave evidence first. Mr Marks QC submitted she was rehearsed, robotic and poised. He invited me to conclude that she was prone to exaggeration, inaccurate and unreliable in her dates, and that she lacked connection with the children with her being focused on material considerations. The approach she took in the witness box certainly suggested that she had been coached on how to present, although not perhaps so much in the content of her evidence although there were recurring phrases in the way she described the relationship and her husband which suggested a degree of rehearsal. The strategy she adopted of addressing not only her answers to me, but also whenever she did not understand a question Mr Marks QC asked was to ask me for clarification, suggested a considerable degree of preparation has gone into how she presented. However, I did not think these issues defined her evidence. What most clearly emerged for me in relation to her character and has a direct relevance to the reliability of her evidence is how she sees and describes life in very black-and-white terms. Either things were fabulous, wonderful, loving or they were not. One aspect I thought of her preparation for giving evidence was to seek to avoid describing anything in negative terms. Descriptions of the pre-marital relationship and indeed the marriage and the husband were almost always in glowing terms. Even after the calling off of the marriage in September 2012 she described how good the husband had been and how supportive he had been of her. After another row she described how they had had dinner in the evening and it was “<span style="font-style:italic">a beautiful perfect Sunday evening”</span>. I don’t think this is just how she gives evidence – I think this is how she sees and describes life itself. She is passionate and throws herself into life with great positivity and this chimes with the husband’s various descriptions of her as vivacious, charming and lighting up rooms when she comes into them. This may be one aspect of the wife’s personality which attracted the husband, he being very much more measured in his feelings. However, it emerged in the evidence that this positivity is matched by an equally passionate negativity. Those who love with passion hate with a vengeance – </p>

The text messages which emerged of the wife in 2011 telling the husband to get “lawyered up” and that she would be going to the Daily Mail, and her demands for an immediate transfer of £250,000 together with the husband’s own evidence of her demands and the rows all suggest that the wife has a negative side in which she is likely to view or describe matters in correspondingly dramatic or hyperbolic terms. How this sounds in her evidence is that it is impossible to believe that life was actually as she describes it. Thus in any description the wife gives there almost inevitably is a hefty degree of hyperbole or exaggeration and one has to therefore discount to some degree or another much of what she says. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">She is also capable of frank lies though. When I asked her in an innocuous context about whether she had been married before, she told me that she had and that should she had been divorced. Under cross-examination it emerged that this was not the truth. She had petitioned for divorce, but her husband had defended it and apparently cross-petitioned for a decree of nullity on the basis that the marriage was bigamous when it was entered into and that she knew as much. It was also asserted that she had claimed substantial financial remedies. However, she settled for a relatively modest sum of some £400,000; she actually received £320,000. Although it was far from central to any of the issues that I need to determine, it clearly shows that the wife is capable not only of exaggeration, but also of lying when she considers either she has something to hide or when it might be adverse to her interest. She also provided an inaccurate description of her marital status to the authorities in The Principality, describing herself as divorced when she was not. This does not mean of course that she is lying about everything, far from it; there was little if anything to gain in this court from lying about the bigamous marriage, although perhaps she was concerned that I might characterise her as a gold-digger for previously pursuing a substantial claim against her former husband.  In her description of the standard of living and her lifestyle she was clearly genuine in what she said and again was unabashed when describing the huge sums she spent on various aspects of her life. In this respect her openness was quite apparent. Overall, though, I conclude I have to treat her evidence with some caution in particular in relation to the nature of the premarital relationship. Although she held back from any personal criticism of the husband, the tone of the messages she sent in 2011 and those that she sent after separation were replete with vitriol and anger and I have little doubt that she feels extremely powerful negative emotions about the husband. It emerged in evidence that the husband had embarked upon an affair by June 2017 and the end of the marriage, has clearly caused the wife both anger and upset. She has withdrawn from communication with HD and HS although she said that she wanted to re-establish communications after this was over.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">WD was tearful even prior to entering the witness box. I believe it was the first time she had seen the husband for many months. Given that he had plainly fulfilled a father figure role for her over many years and she had become close to him it is hardly a surprise that she was emotional. She has had almost no relationship with him since her mother and the husband separated. Given the intensity of the way the wife feels, and indeed as the husband feels, WD has been caught in the crossfire of the bitter dispute between her mother and her stepfather. She has had to ally herself with her mother for understandable reasons. Given the intensity of how her mother feels and expresses her emotions, it would be impossible for WD at this juncture to have a relationship with her stepfather without incurring the displeasure of her mother. Having said that, the evidence she gave did not come across as being deliberately skewed in her mother’s favour although her statement and her evidence was clearly pro her mother’s position. Given that she was having to recall back to 2007 when she was 11 years old, it is hardly surprising that in respects her evidence was impressionistic rather than detailed. She may well have felt at times that she had been left in London being looked after by nannies whilst her mother and stepfather took off to exotic climes or base themselves in The Alps for a ski season. I do not think this was the reality given the wife’s own evidence, that of Ms U and the documents which were contemporaneous. Given that her own father appears to have been an unreliable figure in her life to the extent that she has made the choice herself not to remain in contact with him, it is hardly a surprise that she should have a rosy view of the extent to which a new family had constituted itself from 2007 onwards. She was a credible witness but did not ultimately add very much to my understanding of the premarital relationship as opposed to the intensity of conflict post-separation. </p>

Given that it is highly probable that any description the wife gave of her relationship with the husband, the extent of their cohabitation and the intensity of the relationship would be in exaggerated terms, it may well be that Ms U would have been given the clear impression that, as early as October 2007, the wife and husband were indeed in a relationship which was as close to marriage as it could be without them having undertaken the ceremony. Ms U’s evidence was supportive of the theory that the wife was struggling to balance the competing needs of caring for a school aged child and basing herself in London whilst also seeking to pursue a new and exciting relationship with the husband with all of the hedonistic pleasures that that brought. She was credible insofar as she was able to offer observations based on her own direct knowledge. However, her evidence was not inconsistent with the husband’s own account of his life when in London. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband appeared on the surface to be more measured and balanced in his giving of evidence. He at times was able to accept that things he had said in his statements were inaccurate or misleading. He was careful to try not to tell obvious lies. He is clearly a very intelligent and careful man. He must have thought carefully about his presentation in the witness box and had probably been assisted with this. His tone in the witness box was markedly different to that which was given in his witness statements which consistently denigrated the wife’s contribution and role. It emerged very clearly in his evidence that he now views her as a gold-digger. He said that his children view her likewise. It is clear from the emails that he was sending to his friend, R, in 2007 that this was a fear that he had. I don’t know if his three-year relationship which preceded that with the wife and post-dated that with his ex-wife was undermined by this issue. That view of the wife has clearly dominated his thinking about her, has infected his children and has dictated his approach to this case and how he has framed his offer to her. That gives him a reason to give dishonest or unreliable evidence as much as the wife’s anger and desire to get her fair share does for her. In June of this year I made it clear to the husband that I sought his assistance (or that of his accountant) in understanding his financial position in 2007 in relation to Zebra and yet almost no documentation at all was produced. Some emerged during the course of the hearing, I having made some observations on how the husband had not apparently taken up my invitation to provide assistance to me. The husband is a very astute and intelligent man. He identified an opportunity in one deregulated sector and made a fortune from it. He later identified an opportunity in another deregulated sector and has made another fortune from it. He acted as CEO for Zebra for several years. He remained on the board and was brought back specifically to assist in the finalisation of its sale. The idea that the only document he could produce in relation to the value of his interest in Zebra in 2007 was the balance sheet, which did not even directly value Zebra, is risible. The idea that his accountant had nothing is equally improbable. The husband is too careful I think to deliberately destroy documents which would have been relevant to the court process but I have little doubt that, whether prior to the issue of divorce proceedings in November 2017 (perhaps much earlier) or subsequently, he has been able to adopt with a clear (by his standards) conscience the attitude which says these documents do not exist or are not available. I also conclude that he is not preoccupied with his money in the way that some individuals are. He appeared interested in money for what could be done with it, whether in terms of business opportunities or what could be bought with it. He was not preoccupied with figures in the way that some are. His original evidence had been that he sold shares in a successor company to his first business for £15.75 million. When the documents eventually emerged they showed he received £15.332 million. Thus his attitude to precision on figures was not always to his interest and illustrated a relative lack of both interest and accuracy. Ultimately the husband perhaps is defined by being a risk taker, that is why he has made fortunes, and I can only conclude that he decided that the risk of not producing the document and playing the innocent was one he was prepared to take. Whilst it may not be dishonest, it is far from compliant with the duty of <span style="font-weight:bold">full</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">frank </span>disclosure that this process and this court requires. However, this fact does not automatically convert into adverse conclusions in respect of values. I believe that part of the reasoning process that has influenced the husband’s decisions in this regard is not to hide evidence from the court scrutiny but rather to hinder the wife personally as much as he can and to cause as much frustration to her as he can given that he now clearly feels that she has had the benefit of millions of pounds of his money under false pretences. It is curious, but perhaps understandable, that he should so devalue his 10 year relationship with the wife by now characterising it as one of a gold-digger. It says much about the husband’s own insecurities that he should now be unable to objectively accept that for the majority of the relationship and marriage he and the wife were in love with each other and wished to make a lifelong commitment to each other and to bring children into the world together. Perhaps that is a downside of having the level of wealth that the husband has had that it causes him to doubt the motives of those who care for him.  </p>

The level of hostility they felt towards the other, although carefully masked whilst giving evidence was still apparent and clearly influences how they recall the marriage and how they present their cases. Neither of them truly tried to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but to mould it, suppress it, gild it as they thought would best suit the presentation of their case. </p>

His previous relationship had endured for three years but not moved on to marriage. It is evident from his email that he was wary. He was of course still married to his first wife. His main home was in The Alps. I do not consider that the relationship at this stage can be considered to be equivalent to marriage. It is entirely possible that the parties had different perceptions and, given the wife’s tendency to rose tinted spectacles, she may have invested very high hopes in the relationship and viewed it as having reached a level of intensity akin to marriage. However, I do not accept that the husband viewed it as this when I do not accept that objectively it can be characterised in this way. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:2.01in;margin-right:0.04in">H purchases land in The Alps for development and later builds a Chalet on this land. The wife’s case was that this purchase was by both of them and for both of them to build a family home. The husband says it was bought to provide a main residence for himself, not for the two of them. W was involved with the internal design, visiting on a couple of occasions while H designed it on ‘Sketch-Up.’ H pays CHF1.5m for large plot with dilapidated house.  Subsequently a new property was part built on the land. W’s evidence on this seems improbable – in the context of the e-mail H sent to R and the early days of their relationship it does not seem likely to me that the parties discussed purchasing this land at this time as a home for the two of them. That subsequently between 2007 and its sale in 2012 it came to be viewed retrospectively as a potential family home would be unsurprising. But I do not believe that is how either of them saw it at the time. If the wife did, it was a product of wishful thinking rather than objective reality. </p>

However, the totality of the letter makes clear that the parties were still making progress in the relationship. The email refers to disagreements and underlying friction. It explores their attitude to each other’s friends and in particular addresses an issue to do with what would appear to be the wife’s suspicion that the husband’s relationship with R was more than just business/friendship. The contents of the email are more consistent with the relationship still edging forwards. In a new relationship one may well suppress one’s hopes to one’s partner and one’s fears to one’s friends. It does not necessarily mean the husband was insincere but rather is a reflection of conflicting emotions. </p>

The husband says that it was in 2007-2008 that he spent the most number of nights in England; around 80 or so, still well below the 90 maximum permissible. The husband was having alternate weekend contact with his children and on occasions they were travelling to London and spending the weekend with the husband, wife and WD. I think WD’s recollection of them spending regular periods in London and regular periods in the European country where HD and HS lived was accurate although whether that endured over the whole period is another matter. The husband continued to retain his main home in The Alps and travels to see HD and HS and to London to be with his children every other weekend. At times, all three children were transported to The Alps along with the wife in order to spend time together there. The husband described how all of his personal possessions remained at his home in The Alps until they were moved to France. Equally, the wife retained all of her personal possessions in London. </p>

Whether it had reached the stage where it could be characterised as equivalent to marriage I remain doubtful. Although the parties were and had been involved in a sexual relationship for between 18 months to 2 years, they were not and had never used (as I understand it) contraception. This approach to the possibility of having a child does not in my view necessarily indicate that the relationship had reached the quasi matrimonial stage. After all it appears that they were not concerned about the possibility of conception from very early on in the relationship before it could ever be characterised as quasi matrimonial.

	    <p style="margin-left:2.01in;margin-right:0.04in">H forms SCI Lennon. SCI purchases the property in France the parties had previously rented. Cost was €3.85 million and some €3 million was spent on renovations.  The wife’s evidence as to her involvement in the renovation of the property powerfully confirmed the level of her input. Given her flair for all matters design and fashion orientated it is hardly a surprise that within the marriage she should have undertaken this sort of role. Whilst I doubt that she flew 3 to 4 times a week for any purpose or any combination of purposes, she undoubtedly was heavily involved in a quite hands-on way in aspects of the development of this home. It seems to have been a recurring feature of the relationship that the parties could not settle upon a single place to make their home. WD continued to be schooled in London but the husband continued to be tax resident outside the UK and so could not base himself there. The husband says that the wife continually promised to relocate either to The Alps or to France but never fulfilled her promise. His inability to understand her position perhaps reflects the difference between a father who has contact with his children and a mother who cares full time for hers. He of course had been able to relocate away from the European country to the Tax Haven and then to The Alps and had maintained his relationship with his children at a distance whilst their mother remained the primary carer. At C303 the wife gives her account and says that she wanted to remain based in London due to WD. This conflicted with her oral evidence that she had in effect made her home in The Alps and France. This was a construct to fit her narrative of the relationship being quasi matrimonial from 2007 onwards.  </p>

The neighbour says she was of the impression that the wife generally lived in London caring for WD. Ultimately, I do not consider I need to resolve the issue of whether the wife was living in The Principality or not. The wife maintains that she had essentially relocated to The Principality after the marriage. Again this seems unlikely given that WD was still at school studying for her A-levels. But ultimately by this time the parties were married and had chosen to arrange their lives as they had. That there may have been a disagreement as to whether the wife had fulfilled an alleged promise to locate more fully to The Principality is neither here nor there. </p>

Although the total of its purchase price and the amount spent on renovations comes to some €6.85 million, the property is now only valued at €3.62 million. This came as something of a surprise given that for FDR purposes sums north of €6 million I think were mooted. However the SJE was not called and his valuation is not challenged and so in that respect the parties are sitting on a very substantial loss as compared to the sums invested. Having regard to the mortgages which are secured against the property it represents a net deficit of £326,486. Similarly the boat represents a net deficit of £427,615. The boat is valued at €650,000 and an offer has been received of €600,000. The husband said that he was hoping to get €700,000 for it. </p>

The husband said that some of them were exaggerated by him for the purpose of embarking on a discussion with the wife about reducing their expenditure. On examination of them by Mr Cusworth QC it was clear that if some of them were exaggerated it had little impact on the overall picture. The following are illustrative. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Marks QC in one of the schedules produced suggested that if one isolated the wife’s expenditure out of this schedule, one achieved a figure of €278,468 or £206,273. This figure was achieved by, amongst other things, attributing only 25% of the holiday costs and 25% of the Amex costs to the wife. I think this was done on the basis that the holidays and the Amex also covered the children. This seems to be a somewhat arbitrary and rather unrealistic approach. The evidence made very clear that the husband and wife took numerous luxury holidays on their own and if any adjustment were to be made it would not reduce it to 25% of the total and in any event if anything the holiday figure seems to underestimate the total costs. More significantly, the wife was clearly at least the equal spender of the husband on the American Express card. She described aspects of her expenditure to me. £2000 for a dress, £500-£750 for a pair of shoes, £750 for hair extensions and £1000 to put them in. Of the €360,000 per annum Amex expenditure I would have thought that at least half of it was attributable to the wife. Those minor adjustments to the budget would result in adding in a further €15-€25,000 per annum for the wife’s holidays and another €90,000 per annum for Amex expenditure. That would bring her share of the total up to about €388,000 or £287,000 (at 2015 exchange rates £1=1.35e). At current exchange rates the figure would be closer to £350,000.  </p>

That included approximately £5.2 million which the husband attributed to the value of his interest in Zebra at June 2007.  Mr Marks QC and Ms Singer’s schedule B identifies £11.35 million worth of assets which have been expended during the relationship.  The wife agreed that the assets identified in the June 2007 balance sheet existed (well at least the properties) and that they had now been sold. So the parties spent in the region of £11 million between 2007 and 2015. In evidence the husband told me that save for a sum of around a £100,000 he did not receive remuneration as CEO of Zebra. In addition, a further £7 million received in respect of the sale of Zebra shares in 2015 has been spent since 2015. Some of those funds went on what Mr Marks QC describes as big-ticket items. The refurbishment of France absorbed €3 million, the refurbishment of the The Principality property €500,000, the boat cost €900,000, and the husband made further investments in Zebra of €800,000, totalling €5.2 million or roughly £4 million. Allowing for sums which are owed to the husband of €5.71 million the husband’s team calculates that the parties have spent around €15.3 million in 10 years. Depending on the exchange rate used that somewhere between £10 and £14 million.  Mr Cusworth QC estimates that the figures are more and in particular questions where the £7 million received from the Zebra shares sold in 2015 has gone. I do not consider it necessary to embark on any more detailed analysis of the figures. It is manifestly plain that the husband has spent all of the capital that was left over from the sale of his first business on meeting the lavish standard of living that the parties have led for the last 10 years odd. </p>

He did not expand on the sorts of sums he had spent, but I got the impression he was not holding back. The fact that he has given his brother £100,000 and his father a classic car is illustrative of the sort of expenditure that the husband finds it easy to make.  </p>

Her maintenance pending suit budget totalled £444,463. The husband’s proposed budget totals £199,744.  The husband’s criticism of the wife’s expenditure in the context of his own generous expenditure is harsh. In his time, he has spent huge sums on properties, has owned Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Bentleys, has taken private jets, flown first class, and lavished money on his family for the very best that money can buy. The husband says that the wife can reduce her budget because she receives freebies as a brand ambassador. For how long that will continue must be doubtful. In any event, given the sort of lifestyle the husband has indulged over the last 10 years, annual expenditure in the tens of thousands of pounds for clothes footwear handbags and coats is not unreasonable. In addition, sums spent on food wine and entertaining in the tens of thousands of pounds are not unreasonable. And budgets for holidays and air travel of a hundred thousand per annum is not unreasonable. I have little doubt that the husband will be spending similar sums on himself, his girlfriend and his children.  </p>

He made a small fortune by challenging the established providers in the deregulation of one sector. What had at one stage looked like £100 million profit was reduced to only £15 million. With some of the same business partners he then embarked on the establishment of a challenger in another deregulated sector. The chronology of the establishment and development of Zebra makes clear that it had been an entity which was being built for several years even before the husband met the wife. The husband’s principal endeavour in the early days was in developing the various software systems which were integral to the viability of the idea and the acquisition of the licences. Although there may have been difficulties along the way, for instance the bringing in of the software team, this does not detract from the overall assessment of a viable business idea having been developed and well advanced by 2007. I accept the husband’s evidence as to the reasons for dispensing with the IT team and bringing in another team in order to build a system that would be robust for years hence to replace one initially designed by himself which appeared likely to be fragile when confronted with the demands of a mass consumer business.  </p>

His criticism was that their accuracy in valuation terms was unreliable in part because the methodology used to reach the valuation was not known. However, the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2003 balance sheet shows Zebra reflected by a payment to a law firm of £500,000 or €724,000. This I believe was the payment made to acquire the customer base. As at 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2007, the husband’s private equity investments were valued at €8,999,000 or roughly £6 million. The ZCo schedules suggest that the total value of the other assets held by them totalled some £800,000. The husband said there had not been significant changes in respect of the other holdings. The ZCo schedule shows Zebra Ltd initially valued at £570,000 (original cost). The 2007 balance sheet thus indicates that the Zebra value at that point was £5.2 million. The 2009 balance sheet shows private equity investments of broadly similar valuations. The ZCo balance sheet for 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span></p>

What the ZCo balance sheet does show is a huge revaluation as between 2012 and 2013 where the original cost at 4.5 million CHF has increased to 37.4 million CHF - roughly £25 million.  </p>

In 2007 it was ready to fly, it secured the licences to compete in the deregulated sector and it began to trade, making a profit in the year to 2010. This further corroborates the assertion that the business had very significant latent value at an earlier stage.  But how does one assess that latent value? If I accept Mr N’s valuation in June 2007 of £5.2 million does that fully reflect the latent potential of the business? If it does how should one index that to reflect its current value. Or should one take the Mostyn J straight line approach to attribute value on the basis of equal accrual year by year since its formation in 2002 until 2017 (I take the later commencement and end year in order to bear on the side of generosity to the wife having regard to the husband’s failure to be full and frank)?   The current sums held in respect of Zebra are £36,407,538 and the husband says the total actually received would be around £37.5 million - although the figures appear to vary both within the chronology and within the parties’ documents. If one takes the figure of £37.5 million and undertakes a straight line valuation over the 16 year period some of the figures would be as follows </p>

I identify this only because I conclude that the nature of Zebra was such that it can only sensibly be compared to some index which has demonstrated very high rates of growth. No doubt others could be identified by the parties. To link Zebra to something like the FTSE 100 index or any other mainstream index would in no way be a fair comparison. If one took the husband’s investment of £1.8 million in 2009 (H had put in £500,000 and invested a further £1.9 million in 2009 some of which was repaid and so this year perhaps represents the high point of his financial investment) and applied the NASDAQ technology index from 2009 to 2018 results in that figure being multiplied by 7.04 giving a figure of £12.672 million out of the total of £38.5 million.  </p>

In the circumstances I am confronted with it seems to me that an alternative approach is mandated. It is quite plain that the business had very considerable latent value whether at 2007 or 2009 the point at which I think the premarital relationship had crossed the Rubicon into quasi marital territory. After that the husband worked hard in the business to develop it from its fledgling status in the mass consumer market to the point in 2012 when he handed over to a CEO with greater experience in that sort of industry than he had. However he continued to play a role whilst the business built on those original foundations to become the company spoken of in the business press article and subsequently becoming the target of the purchase. Thus the part of the husband’s interest in Zebra which predated the marriage and which should properly be considered as the nonmarital portion of the whole is a very significant part of it. On the other hand the part which was developed during the quasi marital relationship and the marriage was also a very significant part of it, albeit somewhat greater. I consider that the two should be assessed so as to apportion 40% of the value of Zebra to the husband as a non-marital asset and 60% as a marital asset.  40% of £37.5 million is £15 million. 60% of £37.5 million is £22.5 million. By crosschecking these figures against the sorts of figures produced by the various other methodologies I am fortified in my conclusion that the husband’s premarital asset is properly valued at in the region of £15 million.  In adopting this approach I am very much taking the non-formulaic approach. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The nature of the relationship between the parties is hard to fit into any recognised category. The authorities tend to refer to the parties’ cohabitation and the seamless transition from cohabitation to married life. In this case at the commencement of the relationship the wife lived in London, had done for many years and continued to do so her main home being here to this day. In contrast the husband left the UK in the late 1980s and has had his main home overseas ever since. At the commencement of the relationship his main home was in The Alps although he also owned properties in France, the Tax Haven and in Asia.  In October 2007 the husband began to stay at the wife’s London property on a regular basis for somewhere in the region of 60-80 nights per year. The wife at the same time began to spend significant periods of time, in particular during school holidays, but also for periods during term time at the husband’s home in The Alps. As time moved on a piece of land was acquired in The Alps which, whatever its origins, came to represent an intended family home. From the summer of 2008 the husband and wife rented a property in France and this became in due course the husband’s main home and the family’s main base for the summer. In June 2012 a home was rented in The Principality it being intended to be the main base of both the husband and wife albeit never really became that. From late 2007 when the husband was in London not only was he staying with the wife but also with WD and he took on the role of stepfather to her and took on financial responsibility for her school fees and general maintenance. As I have identified in the chronology, the relationship continued to develop over the course of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 by which time I consider it had crossed the Rubicon and was in the territory of a quasi-marital relationship. That continued to develop until by the time the parties were exploring fertility investigation in early 2010 it was firmly established.  </span>

The initial phases where the husband was captivated by the wife developed into a more robust and mutually committed relationship. The fact is, though, that this was a committed and exclusive relationship which endured for some six years before being sealed by marriage. The hiccups that the relationship experienced and which are clearly evidenced by the email exchanges, the text messages in 2011 and the calling off of the wedding in September 2012 do not represent a serious fracture. The husband’s case that there had been a separation of some months from August 2012 to late 2012 are not borne out by the evidence that within days they went on holiday together to Italy and throughout the autumn were spending significant periods of time together; to all intents and purposes back as a happy couple </span>

However the SJE assesses the possibility as only being 20%.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The husband’s deployment of all of his pre-2007 capital to meet the family’s expenses between 2007 and 2015 does amount to a very significant contribution to the welfare of the family. It was unmatched by the wife. To the extent that she had any pre-relationship assets, she frankly accepted she spent them on herself on items of art and jewellery which she retains. Whilst she is right that those very significant sums have been spent and cannot be ringfenced, that does not mean that they should be ignored entirely. It would be unfair to ignore the unmatched financial contributions of the husband in bringing in excess of £10 million of capital into the marriage and deploying it for the benefit of the family. It is probably theoretically possible to calculate roughly how much of the £12.4 million can be attributed to the husband’s family in the European country, to his own needs, to those of the family, to Zebra, but I do not consider that to be a useful exercise. The deployment of those funds is clearly a very significant contribution which must be taken into account in the overall discretionary exercise. The figures produced by Mr Marks QC and Ms Singer show that £11.35 million of the 2007 assets were spent. I do not consider it appropriate simply to add them back in any arithmetical way. The husband chose to deploy them and has benefited from them as have his children, the wife and WD. The family are fortunate that his divorce settlement to his first wife did not require him to pay her 50% of the assets. I consider that that contribution warrants an adjustment to the sharing of the matrimonial assets in the husband’s favour. In broad terms a 60/40 split of the matrimonial assets would in my view reflect this very significant additional contribution that the husband has made. That at first blush would put the wife’s share of the Zebra matrimonial assets at £9 million and the husband’s at £13.5 million.  Of the remaining assets amounting to some £775,000 there is no reason why they should not be split in the same proportions. It is almost impossible to identify where their origins lie but given the parties received some £7 million from the sale of Zebra shares in 2015 some part may be referenced to them in some part may be referenced to other matters, including ages old assets brought by the husband into the marriage or the proceeds of sale of the property in The Alps. That division results in the quantification of the wife’s share of the marital assets adjusted to reflect the husband’s additional financial contribution at £9.31million. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">This is perhaps the most contentious issue. However I have no doubt that Zebra had a very significant value prior to 2007. The current value of that 2007 value is a contribution which is solely attributable to him; the difficulty is in assessing the value in 2007 and how that sounds in the 2018 share sale proceeds. The Zebra business has not become mingled in the general matrimonial assets. However the matrimonial contributions (of the husband and in which the wife is entitled to share) have become mingled with the non-matrimonial contributions of the husband relating to the pre-2007 value and the passive growth of that value.   </span>

Per W: H has failed to provide any reliable evidence about this. Per H: probably only broadly relevant to outcome and not capable of being established definitively. Per W, in the absence of such evidence, the court should take a broad view on the best available evidence; bearing in mind that if there were any evidence available to suggest that H’s contribution was greater than the £2.2m which he has claimed for tax purposes, no doubt he would have produced it. <span style="font-style:italic">Although the wife is right in her assertion that the husband has not provided reliable evidence about the value of the husband’s interest in Zebra prior to 2009, even had he done so I’m not sure that I would have been in any better position to carry out the exercise of valuing it given the difficulties in valuing private companies. As I foresaw at the case management hearing in June, it was likely that I would find it more apt to deploy a broad brush approach which is what I have eventually concluded is appropriate having explored some of the other possibilities which could be used to value the husband’s non-matrimonial interest in Zebra. I have to the extent that I consider it fair adopted figures which probably operate to the detriment of the husband in valuation terms and which operate favourably to the wife.  </span></p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The wife clearly has a need for a 2/3bedroom property in the Prime London area. It is not unreasonable for her to seek such a property given she has lived in that area for a very significant period of time. In particular, the parties chose to base themselves in Prime London when in London and that is where the wife’s roots now are. The husband’s property particulars for that area provide a range between £3.5 - £4.1 million. The wife’s properties range from £5 - £6.485 million. She has clearly chosen properties which are broadly comparable to her current home, the husband has chosen properties which, whilst beyond most people’s dreams, are significantly lower in standard than the current property. I conclude that a property somewhere between the wife’s bottom end and the husband’s top end would provide the wife with suitable accommodation in the Prime London area. Including purchase costs, that would require a sum of in the region of £4.5 million. I do not consider it appropriate for the wife to be required to downsize at some point later in her life. If anything she will be more embedded in Belgravia and may as she grows older have more need for care and for live-in staff. Once she finds a property she should be able to remain there for as long as she chooses although she might relocate in order to release capital. The husband’s housing needs are met by France. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The wife’s assessment of her income needs included a second home which is no longer pursued. However, her needs are still quantified at £500,000 a year for the next 10 years. Having considered the 2015 budget which illustrated expenditure of €1.86 million per annum or £1.34 million per year including £436,000 of payments for property and the boat it seems that more appropriately the family’s total expenditure at the height of their expenditure could fairly be assessed at £800,000 per annum excluding properties. That budget included further extensive payments (in the region of £156,000 per annum) for staff which will not form part of the wife’s budget save in respect of £24,000 per annum for a housekeeper. As I explored above, I consider that the Husband’s calculation of the wife’s share of the 2015 budget was unrealistic. I conclude that a sum of £300,000 per annum more accurately reflects the sort of expenditure that was attributable to the wife to generate the standard of living that she has experienced since about 2007. The duration of the marriage including relevant pre-marital cohabitation or quasi matrimonial relationship is about eight years; so not a short marriage but not a long marriage. I consider it reasonable for the wife to continue to live at that general standard of living for an equivalent period and so for the next 9 years I consider that her income needs are £300,000 per annum.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">long marriage with children I consider it reasonable to look at how long periodical payments should be made for and whether the wife would be able to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of her financial dependence on the husband. The reality is that the wife’s ability to secure any income is negligible, particularly by reference to her needs judged against the standard of living enjoyed by the wife before the breakdown of the marriage. Hardship, and undue hardship are relative terms which I consider I should assess by reference to the standard of living enjoyed by the family during the marriage. The termination of any periodical payments would undoubtedly create objective and subjective undue hardship. However, I do consider that given the duration of the marriage and by reference to the wife’s life prior to the marriage that it is not reasonable to expect the husband to continue to maintain her for life at anything approaching the level that she enjoyed during the currency of the marriage and will continue to enjoy for a further nine years. I consider that she could adjust without undue hardship to a significant reduction in the periodical payments. I consider it to be fair for the husband to maintain her after the age of 60 at a rate of £100,000 per annum only. That sum will still enable her to lead a good, if modest in comparison, standard of living in Belgravia. It will still provide sufficient to hire staff, to meet her other general outgoings at a reasonable level and to enjoy holidays. If the wife wishes to seek to maintain a much higher standard of living she would have the option of downsizing in Prime London and freeing further capital.  I thus consider that her income needs after 60 should be set at £100,000 per annum as suggested by the husband. This takes into account in addition a need for the wife to adjust away from the hugely lavish lifestyle that she has led as a result of the combination of the huge financial contribution that the husband brought into the marriage.

He also has other expenses in relation to France and the boat. However, all his needs are easily met by his non-marital share in Zebra and his share of the marital acquest. Whether the husband still has it in him to establish a further business and to make a third fortune is a matter of pure speculation. He certainly retains an earning capacity of sorts; whether it is at fortune levels as an entrepreneur or whether simply at the very significant levels that may be achievable through deploying his experience as a consultant or director I cannot determine.

It is achieving fairness as between the parties given the particular factual matrix that their marriage took place within, that is the aim. Not fairness as viewed by the modern-day equivalent of ‘the man on the Clapham omnibus’ but fairness judged by the standards of this particular couple in their particular circumstances having regard to the principles contained in the MCA 1973 as explained by the House of Lords. In reaching my decisions above I have sought to apply the principles of sharing, needs and compensation on a non-discriminatory evaluation as outlined by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">White</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Miller,</span> and have sought to apply the section 25 factors to the factual matrix as I determined it to be having regard to the guidance from the authorities I have referred to. I have sought to undertake various cross-referencing analyses in order to test the outcome. I am entirely satisfied that it is right that a significant portion of the value of Zebra represents a non-marital asset that the husband owned prior to the commencement of the relationship or the transition of the relationship into a quasi-matrimonial one and that in respect of the non-marital asset no sharing issue arises. In respect of my departure from equality in respect of the sharing of the matrimonial assets, I am satisfied that it is both essential to make an adjustment and that the adjustment I have made is fair. As I anticipated at the case management hearing I have had to deploy a broad brush rather than a fine sable, but standing back and viewing the result with the perspective of a broad horizon, I am satisfied that the outcome is fair to both the wife and to the husband. I have not sought to address each and every argument made by the parties’ legal teams – I do not consider it proportionate to do so. My aim in this judgment is to reach a decision and to explain it in a way which allows the parties to understand why I have reached the conclusions that I have. </p>
