	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">B was 4 ½ years old when he was abducted from Spain by his mother and brought to England on a date between 2 &amp; 4 October 2014. As a result of the mother’s actions, compounded by subsequent events including shortcomings in the responses of almost every agency involved in his life since then, it is only now, in June 2018 that a court is in a position to make real progress in addressing the consequences of that abduction and resolving his future. In the period since his abduction B had no contact with his father for over three years; led a chaotic peripatetic existence in England, Scotland, Ireland, and possibly the USA; was received into state care in England where he has lived with foster carers for the last 2 ½ years; was separated from his older brother W with whom he had lived for his whole life; and was separated from his mother when she chose to return to Brazil and found herself unable to return to England in February 2016. As Mr Perkins said, the combination of circumstances which led to this disastrous state of affairs was a perfect storm where the mother’s covert abduction and evasion of court process in Spain and England was compounded by oversight, error, inadequacy, and shortcomings, one building upon and magnifying the effects of the earlier to whip up the most destructive maelstrom which engulfed B and his brother W, but also his mother father and everyone else involved in his life. B has been ably represented in these proceedings by his guardian Mr Walker together with counsel, Mr Gration.</p>

That is in no sense a criticism, far from it, but is simply a reflection on the factual and legal consequences that courts must confront where there is not rapid and effective action by the relevant individual and state agencies following on from an abduction. In terms of this hearing I have received immense assistance from all the lawyers and also from the parties themselves.</p>

I have added into the list of issues the parties’ respective positions on each of these issues in summary form. I shall explore the substance of their arguments in the course of my analysis of the factual background and my more detailed analysis of the issues at the conclusion of this judgment. Given that the skeletons and the chronologies I’ve been provided with run to over 120 pages alone, my summary will necessarily be brief but I hope I have been able to absorb the substance of each parties case and have eventually been able to address the principle legal and factual arguments made on behalf of each party and ultimately to give reasons which allow each of the parties to understand why I have reached the conclusions that I have. This judgment is already of very considerable length and I do not think it would assist either the parties or anybody else who may be called upon to read it to set out in more detail than I do the written and oral arguments made, the evidence heard or the legal framework which applies.</p>

The Guardian submits that on a review of the documents from the Spanish court, it does not appear that the court determined the father’s application for an assessment of the two children. No later document suggests that the question of whether and if so how B’s wishes should be taken into account was ever raised. The Guardian also submits that the context in which the May 2015 judgment was delivered demonstrates that it was not properly viewed as a situation of urgency.

The report on the court file in November 2015 illustrates this, it is said. Ms Fottrell submits that the content of the report and the absence from it of any views from B is nothing to the point. An attempt was made to get his views which was frustrated by the mother’s abduction and going to ground. It is submitted that an opportunity was given but could not be fulfilled. It is argued that the judgments of 29 January 2015 and the subsequent judgment of May 2015, both delivered by the same judge, demonstrates that the judge was alive to the need to take account of B views.</p>

It is submitted that he was well integrated into a social and family environment in England and had become familiar with the country, language and life. In particular the mother submits that the chaotic and unstable nature of life in Spain, the lack of any permanent intent on her part to relocate to Spain, the short period of time that the family was in Spain, the instability in the parental relationship, the lack of education and the lack of registration for residents and medical care in Spain all illustrate that B’s roots remained more in England than in Spain. </p>

The chaos and instability that had characterised their lives over the three years in England meant that the roots never had time to dig deep. B at one to four years of age was primarily integrated into his family unit consisting of his mother and his brothers. There was little or no social or community integration. When he moved to Spain it was with his entire family unit and indeed that was completed by the presence of his father and paternal family. The move was planned and implemented. England was abandoned. No home, no possessions, no friends and no links were maintained. A family life was established in Spain in a new home opposite a school to which W and B would have gone. A life was commenced involving the extended family. In those circumstances the father argues that B’s habitual residence in England was rapidly lost as the shallow roots were pulled up and new routes were put down in Spain. The seesaw quickly tipped away from England in favour of Spain.</p>

The father points to the instability in B’s life following his return to England in late 2014 and the chaos that reigned in his life over the following year. Ms Fottrell refers to the evidence in the care proceedings in particular Dr Butler and her views on the instability that permeated W and B’s lives. How, she asks rhetorically, could they be settled in the circumstances. By September 2017 B had even been separated from W. </p>

In common with every other aspect of this case the timeframe over which they have been conducted is protracted. The obligation contained in Article 11 of BIIa is to conclude proceedings within six weeks. Happily, there is a rider to that which is where it is impossible to do so. Using even the most expeditious procedures available to this court has led to the proceedings taking some nine months. Given their unique nature this is hardly surprising. Most Hague Convention proceedings and enforcement proceedings are capable of being dealt with in anywhere between one and a maximum of three days. On 7 December 2017, Mr Justice Holman set this matter down with a time estimate of five days for the final hearing. The earliest five days that the court could accommodate was 11 June. On 22 February 2018, Deputy High Court Judge Lieven QC, confronted with applications to discharge the care order in addition to The Hague and enforcement applications, gave a further three days of time on 9 July. Unwisely in retrospect, when the matter came before me on 12 April 2018 I transferred the discharge aspects of the case to Her Honour Judge Rowe QC in West London with a five day time estimate; the additional two days reflecting the fact that her honour Judge Rowe would be coming to the matter afresh. </p>

The reality of this case is that all matters have had to be considered together and I therefore propose to deal with all the issues.  I do not think that the recent decision of the Court of Appeal Re: S (Abduction: Hague Convention or BIIa) [2018] EWCA Civ 1226 assists much in this regard as it focuses on the appropriate approach in England and Wales to an outgoing abduction rather than an incoming abduction. </p>

It would appear that there is no discretion if one of the exceptions is established.

However, in respect of applications for registration for enforcement BIIa, Art 28 says registration may be refused. It is not clear what the purpose of the distinction is and how the two provisions sit together. Their predecessors in BII were considered by Holman J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Brussels II: recognition: best interests of child) (No 2)</span><span class="footnote"> </span><span class="case" style="font-style:normal;color:initial">[2003] EWHC 2974 (Fam)</span><span style="font-style:italic">, </span><span class="case" style="font-style:normal;color:initial">[2004] 1 FLR 582</span>, but he did not come to a clear conclusion on the implications of the difference.

In the event that there is a dispute about whether the judgment was ‘urgent’ it is unclear whether a conclusion on this by the court delivering the judgment will be binding. It could be argued that to go behind such a determination might be to review the substance of the judgment in contravention of Article 26. However, it seems to me the issue of urgency is a matter of procedure rather than substance and therefore in conformity with the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> to other matters of procedure, even those certified in an Annex II certificate, I consider that it is open to this court to consider from its own perspective whether the judgment was from our perspective urgent. If I could not consider this issue in tandem with the opportunity for the child to be heard it seems to me that it would artificially circumvent an aspect of the fundamental rules of procedure which I’m obliged to consider.</p>

It ought to be a yes or no answer. Questions as to whether the means of hearing the child were adequate or would comply with the procedures of the requested court ought not to be relevant to the answer to that question. The BIIa Practice Guide recognises the divergence across Member States as to how a child is given an opportunity to be heard. So far there is no decision on the issue of whether an inadequate opportunity to be heard is no opportunity. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (international recognition) (a child)</span><span class="footnote"> </span><span class="case" style="font-style:normal;color:initial">[2016] EWCA Civ 12</span> it was accepted that the child had not in fact had an opportunity to be heard and that the court had not considered whether to give the child the opportunity, although at para 42 the court recognised that there were variations of approach and that differences should not undermine the principle of recognition and enforcement.</p>

The approach of the Court of Justice of the European Union in <span style="font-style:italic">Zarraga-v-Pelz</span> (Case C-491/10 PPU) at paragraph 65 the court expressed the view that the Article 24 obligation requires  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The requirement to consider the question of whether and if so how to hear the voice of the child applies whether the judgment is delivered at first instance or superior appellate court. It seems to me that it must be an ongoing obligation upon the court to be asked as and when the court is delivering a judgment of substance in relation to a child; and in particular where the child’s views have either never been before the court or have not been before the court for some time. The fact that proceedings are ongoing and that an application within them is part of a continuum does not abrogate the need to consider the question. As Mr Justice Peter Jackson said at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, the court must consider the issue in the context of the proceedings as a whole. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Abduction: Hague Convention or BIIA)</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 1226 Moylan LJ identified that one of the benefits of the use of Hague Convention remedies rather than domestic orders was the difficulty in enforcing such orders when the child had not been given an opportunity to be heard. This fortifies in my view the approach taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> that even in abduction cases such as confronted the Spanish judge that fundamental principles of procedure in England and Wales require that the court ask the question of whether and if so how the voice of the child is to be heard.  It seems to me that the mere process of identifying and asking the question is a safeguard to ensure the Article 12 UNCRC or Article 24 EU CFR rights of the child are at the forefront of the judge’s mind.  Identifying the question enables the court to consider a range of options. It is perfectly possible that having considered the question the court might conclude that it was in the child’s best interests for the order to been made notwithstanding that it could not in practice secure the child’s views because of their disappearance. However, and importantly, the court might also pause to consider whether making such an order was in fact the best course to adopt. It might indeed cause the court to consider more fully other options by which the child’s voice might be heard which would then bring onto the radar the issue of the 1980 Hague abduction Convention and the obligation in Article 11(2) on a requested state to give the child an opportunity to be heard. Thus in asking the <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> question a range of other routes to promoting the child’s welfare might fall to be considered. That it seems to me is another reason why it is a fundamental principle of procedure in England and Wales that the question is explicitly asked and answered. The primary reason may be that it directly supports the Article 12 and Article 24 rights of the child but it also indirectly promotes the Article 3 UNCRC and Article 24 rights of the child in respect of their best interests.  The Court of Appeal recognised there might be good reasons for not ascertaining their wishes and feelings (which the Court of Appeal concluded was identical to hearing their voice) and a reasoned decision not to hear their voice ought not to lead to the conclusion that the failure to hear it was in breach of fundamental principles of procedure in England. The Supreme Court hinted that the decision of the Court of Appeal may have been expressed in wider terms than they would have endorsed but this was no more than an observation in their judgment striking out the appeal: <span style="font-style:italic">In the Matter of D (A Child)</span><span> </span><span class="case" style="font-style:normal;color:initial">[2016] UKSC 34.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court of Appeal recognised that if the child's voice is to be heard there are a variety of ways in which that can be fulfilled in England and across the other Member States. Is it open to an appellant to argue that the way the requesting state heard the child's voice in English terms represented no opportunity at all? The tenor of the Court of Appeal judgment is that differences in approach between Member States should not lead to non-recognition but it remains arguable that a wholly defective ‘opportunity to be heard’ was in fact no opportunity at all. </p>

If valid service has taken place, it then has to be established whether in all the circumstances the defendant had sufficient time to arrange for his defence. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (international recognition)</span> the Court of Appeal (applying ECJ cases) from paras 76-93 held that this required a case-specific evaluation of all the circumstances of the case, which might include the respondents own conduct and whether they had taken reasonable steps in relation to a nominated service address to make sure they received documents served there. The right to a fair hearing and due process also has a component which include due process for the Applicant and thus where a Respondent is evading service the court may in all the circumstances conclude that even where only technical service has occurred (for instance by publication in a Gazette) that the defendant has been served in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable that person to arrange for his or her defence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">BIIa recognises that when a child moves from one Member State to another substantive jurisdiction over the child will move to the new Member State of habitual residence. That being so, the courts of that Member State may be seised of an application in respect of the child and may make orders which ‘conflict’ with or have the effect of altering an order made in the former country of habitual residence. Article 23(e) therefore reflects the child's best interests that an order should not be enforceable when the court which is most ‘proximate’ to him in time and jurisdiction has made a later order based on an assessment of his ‘up to date’ best interests. This by and large presupposes a lawful move because jurisdiction only transfers with a change of habitual residence if the move is lawful and thus not in conflict with Article 10. This is made clear by Article 9 BIIa.  It would run wholly contrary to the scheme of the regulation to permit nonenforcement of a judgment delivered in the court with substantive jurisdiction because of a contrary judgment delivered in a court without jurisdiction; in particular where that judgment was (knowingly or unknowingly) delivered in circumstances where jurisdiction was retained by operation of Article 10; see the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in <span style="font-style:italic">Povse-v-Alpago</span> (Case C-211/10 PPU) </p>

Parental intent has to be factored in along with many other relevant factors in deciding whether a child has a sufficient degree of stability and is sufficiently integrated so as to be habitually resident.

It has to be kept in mind that the settlement exception is intended to reflect welfare. The Article 12 settlement exception of all the exceptions is most welfare focused. The underlying purpose of the exception is to enable the court in furtherance of the welfare of the child to decline a summary return because imposing a summary return (i.e. without a more detailed consideration of welfare) might compound the harm caused by the original abduction by uprooting a child summarily from his by now familiar environment. </p>

Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention provides that the requested state is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm, or otherwise would place the child in an intolerable situation.

It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for the resolution of the parental dispute. So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors which may well include integration in a new community.  A child’s welfare cannot be made to suffer for the general deterrence of the Convention.</p>

The documentary evidence, extensive though it is did not answer all the questions. In considering the credibility of the parties I have looked at the consistency of their evidence internally (i.e. with other statements they have made), at its consistency with other evidence in particular, can temporary documentary evidence; I have considered whether they have any motive to lie or otherwise present a different picture to reality and I have considered their demeanour in court.

He was careful and measured in his evidence and I was impressed by the way he had analysed settlement identifying in his own mind the physical, emotional and psychological components. He had obviously considered with care the conclusions he reached in respect of objections and settlement. He had spent a day at LBH’s offices going through the social work files and whilst he had not had very extensive time with B he had spent time speaking to his parents and I’m satisfied that he fully met the function that I assigned to him when I made him B’s guardian last year. He was clear that B primarily identified with his mother as his carer and that he wanted to return to her and to his brothers. This is hardly a surprise given his life experiences. It is interesting though that B does express some positive memories of Spain even this far removed from his time there. B spoke about his mother and father fighting, although Mr Walker said that his body language didn’t change. This suggests to me that what he witnessed was not deeply distressing. No doubt his reintroduction to his father has awakened some perhaps buried memories. But his three islands analysis showed that he still primarily identifies with his mother and brothers as those he wishes to live with. He placed his father on a separate island as a person to spend time with. However, when he described what he wanted he expressed clear preferences. First of all was to live with his mother and brothers. Second was to live with his father. Thirdly was foster care.  He was clear that he would prefer to live with his father than remain in foster care. He clearly delineated between his carers and his family. He is committed to living with his family. His letter to me indicated as is so often the case that he wanted everybody to live happily together. Sadly, this does not appear to be likely.</p>

He said that he remembered that his mum had been quite settled when they lived together and he thought that perhaps he and B could live together with the father. W believed until he was eight years old that the father was his biological father. W was of course eight in 2014 which suggests that the father’s account of how his paternity was disclosed might be true. He himself remembered a big argument when the mother told the father that he was not W’s father. This again seems to be consistent with the father’s description of the argument in July 2014. B said he did not want to live with his mother because of the fact that she kept moving around. He said he wouldn’t mind living with his brother and that was why he wanted to live with the father.

I only here address issues to do with his credibility as I set out below in the chronology his evidence and my conclusions in relation to matters in dispute. Overall, I found the father to be a credible witness. He appears to be accurate and to pay attention to detail. Almost his first act in giving evidence was to note the fact that in one of his statements the interpreter had signed it with the wrong year identified.  He was measured – he didn’t jump in with information if he wasn’t sure. He was concise and accurate and sought to answer the question asked of him.  He showed an impressive degree of attunement to his son and was able to clearly describe B to me and what he was like. Interestingly within this he said B was more mature than his age which of course was an admission against his interest given that it would support the child’s objections defence. His oral evidence was consistent with his written evidence which in turn was consistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother’s evidence I’m afraid was in very significant respects unsatisfactory and indeed dishonest. Even allowing for issues with interpretation it is inescapable that the mother is not an honest witness. I’m not even entirely sure the extent to which the mother speaks English. In March a Brazilian interpreter was requested. In April no interpreter was requested. On the first day of the hearing the mother chose to use a Spanish interpreter who was booked for the father. The mother’s statements are all provided in English without an interpreter’s certification. During her evidence she occasionally spontaneously answered questions in what appeared to me to be good English but I was told by Mr Hames and of course I accept she feels more comfortable speaking in Spanish. There are aspects of her account where she plainly was not telling the truth. One was in respect of the frequency of the father’s visits between 2011 and 2014. She maintained in her statements that he visited only three times. The tenor of her evidence and indeed the cross examination of the father was that it was far more frequently. She denied ever having returned to Brazil prior to 2016 after having left as a teenager. This flatly contradicted her statement and when pressed she floundered to seek to provide an explanation. Her account of not being aware that there were children related applications in Spain and that she was unaware that she could not remove the children from Spain was wholly incredible given the contents of the Spanish documents in particular those submitted on her behalf by her Spanish lawyers. They are redolent with details that can only have been provided by the mother and it is inconceivable that she was unaware that she was prohibited by law from leaving Spain. Her attitude to the law and legal obligations was offhand to say the least. Her approach to her immigration status and the fact she had been unlawfully present in various countries was insouciant; everyone does it she blithely said. Her attitude to the Spanish laws which prohibited her removing B was best illustrated when she somewhat indignantly asserted that he was her son and who was to tell her what to do. Sadly, when she was asked to describe B and W, and she was pressed repeatedly by her own counsel to do so she was almost wholly unable to do so. This was in stark contrast to the father who has had so much less time with B. Her answers were about herself. When asked what impact she thought the instability and abduction had had on B she was unable to put herself in his shoes at all. She simply maintained that it was her not responsibility for the situation. I’m afraid she came across as self-centred and not at all attuned with her children. Her evidence was inconsistent with itself, inconsistent with the majority of the other evidence, with contemporaneous documents and at times frankly seem to be made up on the hoof. The most obvious example was when Mr Gration was robustly questioning her about contact between B and the father after the abduction. Within moments her position changed from that she had promoted contact to stating that she had not made any attempt to maintain contact because of the bad experiences she had had. That’s not to say that everything she said was untrue. There were moments of spontaneity some of which were quite surprising in their content. She spoke of needing a man to reliably support her which may explain the constant changes in her life. She spoke fondly at one point of the father as her partner and how when she first went to Spain they had hoped to become a family. I think to general astonishment when it was suggested that she had been in a relationship with a Mr R she asserted that she had never been in a relationship with a black man. I’m not at all sure what to make of the mother overall; I will have to consider this further at a later stage. What I am sure of is that I cannot rely on her to give honest or frank or child-centred evidence save where it is against her interest. As it happens they are rare windows in her case for she spends much of her time justifying her actions mainly in circumstances where they are simply unjustifiable. Where there is a dispute between her and the father I have no hesitation in preferring the father’s evidence over hers.</p>

Although the judgment itself refers to it being urgent I’m satisfied that it is open to this court to consider independently whether it was urgent given that this ground relates to a fundamental right of the child and arises in relation to an Annex II certificate where the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> considered that it was open to the requested court to consider a matter relating to the circumstances in which the judgment was delivered notwithstanding that the certificate itself addressed that matter. Given that B had been subject to proceedings relating to his custody for some 10 months, whose whereabouts had been uncertain for seven months, in respect of whom a judgment had been given in January where his custody had been conferred on the mother, and where the application for a variation of that January order had been issued in February 2015, I do not consider that a judgment delivered on 21 May 2015 some three months later is urgent. By reference to the approach taken to urgent cases under Article 20 I consider that urgency involves an immediate need to determine an issue. In the context of B having been missing for some months I do not think that this judgment can properly be characterised as urgent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that B was not given an opportunity to be heard in relation to this judgment which is in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of England and Wales.  Although I’m satisfied on balance that the Spanish court initially made provision for the assessment of B which I think must have contemplated his views being taken and this resulted in the filing of a report (albeit it contained nothing in relation to B’s voice)  and that fulfilled the fundamental duty identified by Lord Justice Ryder in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> to ask whether and if so how the child’s voice was to be heard this was relevant to the decision the Spanish court took on 29 January 2015 when custody was granted to the mother. I’m satisfied from the contents of the application dated 6 February 2015 and issued by the court on 20 February 2015 which sought to review the order of 29 January 2015 on the basis of a material change in circumstances and from the court decision which determined that that application was admissible and which subsequently imported the evidence from the earlier custody application that this amounted to a fresh application seeking the transfer of custody from B’s lifetime primary carer to his father and that this constituted a significant further step which brought with it an obligation to consider whether and if so how B’s voice was to be heard. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> such an order represented a very significant step relating to B’s welfare and as Lord Justice Ryder said at paragraph 34 and 35 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> the issue must be looked at in the context of the proceedings as a whole. The judgment of May 2015 clearly related to this specific application and the wording of Article 23 (b) requires me to consider whether the<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>judgment was given without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard. The case management orders made and the final judgment contain no reference to whether and if so how B’s voice was to be heard. I appreciate in the context of this case that it being known that B was out of the jurisdiction and his whereabouts had not been ascertained and he was only five years of age that asking the question whether and if so how his voice might be heard may very well have led to the answer that he was too young or that it was not possible to ascertain his views. On its plain and simple wording as applied to this case the judgment was given without B having been given an opportunity to be heard. The Regulation is expressed in simple terms. It does not inquire into the reasons why the child was not given that opportunity. The fact that it was impossible to obtain the child’s views might be a relevant consideration in determining whether the lack of opportunity was in breach of fundamental rules of procedure. The position in England and Wales, as outlined by Lord Justice Ryder in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> is that in all cases the court must consider whether and if so how the child’s voices to be heard. Even in abduction cases the court must ask itself that question. The court might answer it by saying that it is not necessary or possible to hear the child’s views and may go ahead and make an order.  That would be a valid order.  However, it is also possible that in asking the question the court may conclude that it was either unnecessary to proceed to judgment, that it was inappropriate to do so or that further steps should be taken to locate the child before proceeding to judgment. The court might also recognise that in proceeding without hearing the voice of the child that an order which might be valid in England and Wales might be vulnerable to challenge in another jurisdiction. The net result in this case was that a judgment was delivered which provided for a change in primary carer in which no consideration was given to B’s views or possible views on that matter and no alternative ways forward being considered. I’m therefore satisfied that the judgment was given without B having been given an opportunity to be heard and that this was in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of England and Wales.</p>

She was served by the procedural representatives who were on the record at the time that the application was made and case management directions were given. The application itself generated an application by the mother’s representatives to come off the record because they had not been able to communicate with her.

	    <p class="ParaLevel4" style="margin-left:1.97in;text-indent:0.5in">I’m satisfied that service on CD of that application took place in such a way as to enable the mother to arrange for her defence. The decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, relying on CJEU authorities makes clear that the question of the mother’s actual knowledge of the application and her conduct in relation to service and her failure to take steps which would have enabled her to respond to the application are relevant considerations. I have reached this conclusion because I’m quite satisfied that the mother was aware that proceedings were ongoing in Spain and that she was well aware that she should have kept in contact with her lawyers so that she could respond to those proceedings. Her evidence was that she was able to communicate with them by phone and by Facebook. I reject her evidence that her lawyers told her not to communicate with them and that they would contact her if anything significant happened. The evidence from the Spanish lawyer makes clear that they were attempting to contact her but she was not responding. I reject the submission that the mother’s literacy in some way hampered her ability to maintain contact with her Spanish lawyers. It is quite clear on the evidence that having left Spain she cut off her links with her lawyers. That was her choice. She could have remained in contact with them and been able to respond to this application. Responsibility for the case proceeding in her absence lies entirely at her door. As the Court of Justice has pointed out, and it is perhaps trite in English law, service is about fairness of the process. This involves fairness to both the individual seeking an order and the individual responding. In this instance I’m satisfied that fairness and justice support my conclusions.</p>

Pursuant to FPR 27.5 the father may apply to set aside the care order. Applying FPR 27.5 (3) the father acted promptly on finding out the court had made an order against him, he had good reason for not attending the hearing and given the assessments of him he has a reasonable prospect of success of opposing the making of a care order. It would therefore be open to the court to set aside the care order on this basis in consequence of which there would be no care order which this judgment would be irreconcilable with.</p>

When such orders are made the Article 20 measures would lapse. In this case the Spanish court has made an order and whilst it is not enforceable as a result of my decision under Article 23 (b) it remains a valid Spanish order which provides for B’s care. The care order would therefore lapse, or be replaced by the Spanish order if and when implemented. </p>

Given that the same judge made both the main orders and signed the Annex II certificates it seems most likely that for the purposes of Spanish law both judgments or orders remain enforceable.</p>

I also need to consider the status of the care order that was made. It seems to me that it is for the Spanish courts to determine the Article 10 loss of retained jurisdiction questions rather than me. It is clear from the orders that the Spanish court made in the course of 2016 and 2017 that they consider that they still have jurisdiction in respect of B. If the Spanish court continues to exercise substantive jurisdiction in respect of B pursuant to Article 10 then this court cannot exercise substantive jurisdiction over him even though he is now habitually resident here. It seems to me that with the benefit of the wider perspective that this court now has in relation to a retained jurisdiction in Spain that the true jurisdictional basis upon which Her Honour Judge Mayer’s order lies is the Article 20 jurisdiction which permitted the court in November 2015 and thereafter to make urgent provisional protective measures in respect of B. That Her Honour Judge Mayer was unaware of the retained jurisdiction of Spain does not render the orders made void providing there was some proper jurisdiction for making them. I’m satisfied that the Article 20 jurisdiction was properly available to Her Honour Judge Mayer at that point in time. The fact that it was not identified as such does not mean that it was not in fact that jurisdiction which was being exercised.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">I conclude that B was habitually resident in Spain immediately prior to his removal by the mother in October 2014. He was undoubtedly habitually resident in England immediately prior to his journey to Spain in March 2014. However, the roots he had in England were shallow. The chaotic and unstable life he had led moving from one part of London to another, from London to Scotland and back, from one unstable form of accommodation to another, without being in school, leading a life largely revolving around his mother and brothers, with little integration into the community, where Spanish was still the principal language spoken by his mother and B all lead me to conclude that his habitual residence in England had shallow roots and the roots that did exist were largely linked to his family environment, namely his mother and brothers. I’m satisfied that when B, his mother and brothers travelled to Spain they did so on the basis that it was a move intended to be permanent, or at least indefinite. I’m not satisfied that the mother moved on a trial basis. I believe she hoped applying the short-term perspective that seems to dominate her thinking that this was where their future lay; whether or not objectively an outsider would have seen it as such. In any event all of her and the children’s possessions were packed up and shipped to Spain; W left his school with no arrangement that he might be back; the mother gave up her accommodation; she sold a car; she left her husband behind. B’s family unit moved to Spain with him - his mother and brothers, the essential components of his life were there with him. He joined his father. The family constituted itself in a house near to a school which the children would have joined. B resumed relations not only with his father but with his grandparents, aunt, uncles and cousins. Spain was a country that was familiar to him with a language that he spoke. He was involved in a social and family environment. The mother said that the initial period in Spain was at least okay and that they were making a life together as a family. For a period of three months or so family life was relatively stable. At this point in time B was four years old.  In June or July the relationship between the mother and father deteriorated. The mother moved to another town. B did not then see his father or his extended family. I’m satisfied that having left England in the circumstances that he did that the relatively shallow roots were pulled up. The seesaw began quickly to tilt towards Spain as the practical consequences of the planned move, the reunification of the family and the establishment of a new way of life resulted in the putting down of new albeit shallow roots. The seesaw tilted beyond the tipping point within a matter of weeks such that by the time the relationship between the mother and father began to deteriorate B was already habitually resident in Spain. It may not have been a deep-rooted habitual residence but by that stage it significantly outweighed any residual roots that had been left in England. In the period between June and October, B remained with his mother and brothers in Spain. He clearly had not regained a habitual residence in England even if the roots he had put down whilst with his father had become somewhat shallower. Applying Lord Wilson’s guidance that the court should seek to establish a habitual residence I am quite satisfied that B’s habitual residence was established in Spain and remained in Spain up to the point of his abduction. It may have been marred by a degree of instability and may have been by objective standards of most other four-year-olds a shallow form of habitual residence. For B given the chaos and instability that have characterised his life in England it represented for him a significant degree of integration in a social and family environment which for him undoubtedly amounted to his habitual residence.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">In the same way that habitual residence does not require complete integration or permanence so settlement does not necessarily require that the child is fully settled or views their situation as permanent. Settlement must be viewed both holistically (incorporating physical, emotional and psychological aspects) to reach an overall assessment but must also be evaluated having regard to the underlying purpose of the exception. It is a welfare exception. It is designed to protect the child from the summary return that would be ordered under Article 12 in circumstances where a summary return might represent a further sudden uprooting of the child from an environment into which they have become settled. It is designed to protect them from the harm that might accompany sudden changes. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">By September 2017, B had been living with the A’s for 21 months. W had been living elsewhere for some 16 months. B was attending and enjoying his school life. Mr Walker considered him to be settled in his physical environment. In the care proceedings the social worker and the Guardian considered that by the summer of 2016 he was settled with his foster carers. Mr Walker considered that he was emotionally settled in that in his day to day existence he was content, he was thriving, there were no issues with his behaviour. Mr Walker defined emotional settlement in terms of a more short-term or day-to-day perspective which I thought was helpful. He approached psychological settlement from a more deep-seated, or longer term perspective thinking about it insofar as it might impact on B’s psychological development. From that perspective he considered that B was not settled because he did not see his long-term future in care. He expected either to return to his mother or father. As at September 2017 his expectation was to return to his mother as his father was not then an option on the table. The importance which he placed on family rather than carers indicated that psychologically he was not settled with his foster carers because he was looking to move on. Ms Fottrell QC also emphasised that B clearly viewed his situation as a temporary one with an expectation that he would be moving on. To that extent it could be said that he was treading water.</p>

I entirely accept that a child in care expecting to move on is likely to have a limited degree of settlement. For B given the entirely unsettled and unstable life he had experienced prior to December 2015 it seems to me that the 21 month period up to September 2017 must have been the most settled period in his life and thus I am driven to conclude that overall notwithstanding the psychological aspects that overall he was settled.</p>

In fact the protective measures which would ameliorate the risk to a very substantial degree and which applying Art 11(4) have to be taken into account would include the hearing of a welfare evidence and the completion of proceedings in relation to W. Thus in this case the Art 13b risk to B would be ameliorated largely in the hearing of the welfare evidence although I appreciate that does not deal with the ‘jurisdictional’’ elements Ms Chaudhry identifies, but those are not within my gift. The jurisdictional framework is as it is. If Spain retains jurisdiction over B – as I have concluded it does then unless AH prorogues jurisdiction to this court I cannot exercise a full domestic jurisdiction over B however much the OS would like me to. </p>

That course would of course be open to her even if this court exercising a substantive jurisdiction were to permit B to relocate to Spain to live with AH. CD would be able to instigate litigation in Spain as soon as he became habitually resident there and that court would not be bound by my decision although it would accord it significant weight.

I leave aside the issue of whether it is the return itself to Spain which would create the grave risk or intolerability as opposed to the legal consequences of that return. Life on the ground for B will not be intolerable or create a grave risk. The more nebulous but real psychological consequence of returning without finality may or may not fall within the definition.

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.50in">In assessing whether B objects to being returned to Spain I apply the approach set out by Lady Justice Black in re M. B is now eight years old. Mr Walker assesses him as being of a maturity somewhat in excess of his chronological age. Interestingly the father also in his description of B described him as being a mature boy. He is therefore of an age and a degree of maturity where it would be appropriate to take account of his views. The question is whether his views amount to an objection. Objects is not a term of art nor does it have any special meaning within Article 13 of the Hague Convention. I do not think expanding on what objects means will assist beyond that which Lady Justice Black has identified. In a sense you know it when you see it. A preference is probably not an objection although it is possible that a very strong preference could well amount to an objection on any particular set of facts. The reality here is that B has said his first choice is to live with his mother and his brothers. He cannot live with HG . It seems unlikely given W’s current views that he could live with W and his mother. He could live with his mother. So that would be his first choice. His islands exercise as well as that which he has said to Mr Walker and others makes it clear this is his first choice. That is hardly surprising given that his mother was his primary carer from birth through to December 2015. However, his second choice is that he live with his father. This is not a reluctant choice but a genuine preference over remaining in foster care. He has no objection to his father, no objection to Spain per se. He has some positive memories of Spain and his family and life there. It seems to me that this is a preference which does not amount to an objection. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.50in">I recognise that in evaluating an objection it is to a degree subjective. Another judge might reach an alternative conclusion. As it happens in this case even if I were wrong in respect of whether B’s views amount to an objection it would not alter significantly the ultimate outcome. If his views do amount to an objection then the court would need to go on to consider its discretion and to bring to bear an evaluation upon issues such as whether his views are rationally held, whether they are founded in fact, what his perspective is, whether he has been influenced, and ultimately determine what weight an objection should be given. If I’m undertaking a broad discretionary exercise in relation to any exception inevitably I will be considering B’s views and giving them appropriate weight within that discretionary exercise. Although the fact that an exception had been made out might add some weight within the discretionary process I’m not convinced, particularly on the fact of this case, that it would make much difference. I am however alive to the issue.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in">Having regard to my conclusion in respect of settlement a discretion does arise. As described by Baroness Hale in re M (Zimbabwe) the discretion is at large. I must take account of policy considerations, the circumstances of the exception established and general welfare issues. The nature of the enquiry into the discretion is a matter for me. One size does not fit all. On the unique facts of this case it seems to me that it cries out for a tailor-made approach. It may be like creating a pattern for a suit for Robert Pershing Wadlow. It may be used once and never again. The court system owes it to B and indeed to W to craft a solution to the conundrum created by the unique facts of this case. In the circumstances of this case and given the imminent hearing of the discharge application in relation to W and what had been planned to be a discharge application in respect of B himself the court is in a position to carry out a full welfare enquiry in respect of both W and B. The legal consequences of that welfare enquiry will be entirely different in respect of W and B because in respect of W the full range of domestic substantive orders will be in play in relation to discharge and any orders that might be made subsequently. However, in respect of B given that the courts of Spain retained substantive jurisdiction the outcome of the welfare enquiry can only sound in the exercise of the discretion, unless the father at some point prior to the final conclusion of the welfare enquiry prorogues jurisdiction to this court to enable this court to deploy a full range of substantive orders. There is much that weighs in the scales at present in favour of returning B. The policy considerations in terms of condemning child abduction and promoting the operation of the Hague Convention both points strongly in favour of a return. This was a flagrant abduction by the mother knowing full well that she was not permitted to leave Spain and leaving during a court process in which her own lawyers were seeking permission to leave Spain. She then hid B from his father and prevented them having any relationship for over three years. When care proceedings were instituted rather than informing Haringey that B had a father in Spain who was interested in his future she selfishly withheld this information hoping that she could regain care of B at the conclusion of the care proceedings. As a result of her actions her son has not only been prevented from having a relationship with his father and his paternal family but has also been removed from his mother and has been in the care system for some 3 ½ years. It is hard to imagine a more flagrant and serious abduction the consequences of which will undoubtedly have lifelong consequences for B. Her actions are also likely to have lifelong consequences for W. Had she informed Haringey about the father in December 2015 it might be that he could have offered a home then to W as well as B. All of this weighs heavily in favour of a summary return. However, B now has a degree of settlement which in my view requires a fuller exploration of the welfare consequences for him of ordering a summary return. Insofar as W’s best interests are concerned they are a primary consideration as well. I think I owe it to both B and W to look at the welfare issues for both of them at the same time albeit the legal remedies available to the court are fundamentally different. That is a consequence of the situation visited upon them by the mother’s actions and is unavoidable. This court must do the best that it can to promote the welfare of B, albeit within the context of Hague proceedings and having regard to the other factors which arise in relation to the exercise of the discretion. I will therefore carry out an investigation of the welfare aspects in relation to B’s future in tandem with consideration of the discharge application in respect of W. At this stage I decline to speculate on the range of possible outcomes of that process or the legal implications of my concluding either that B should return to Spain to live with his father or that his welfare would best be promoted by returning to the care of his mother and going to live with her in Brazil. This case is already complex and convoluted enough without me indulging in that exercise.  Policy considerations are only one part of the equation. As Baroness Hale identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, in a settlement case they will usually weigh less heavily given the passage of time in the child’s situation are likely to create material welfare considerations which might well outweigh policy considerations. An individual child’s welfare is not to be sacrificed to deter child abduction generally or to condemn and abducting parent’s behaviour. Unusually although perhaps not unexpectedly in this particular case the welfare and settlement related factors are far more nuanced. B is in state care as a result of him suffering significant harm or being at risk of suffering significant harm by reason of his mother’s parenting not being that which it was reasonable to expect. He has been in state care for two and half years. Given the positive parenting assessment of the father there is a strong case for saying that B’s welfare will best be met by him returning to the care of his father in Spain. That being so there appear to be strong reasons pointing towards him not remaining in state care in England. The only other potentially realistic alternative is a return to his mother’s care. Given her track record within the care proceedings, subsequently and my conclusions in relation to her credibility there are clearly major obstacles confronting her application for the return of the children to her care. In addition to those obstacles the fact that W has to date said he does not wish to return to her care because of his own assessment of the deficiencies in her parenting creates another significant obstacle for the mother. However, the Brazilian assessments were positive. I directed a further independent social work assessment of the mother which regrettably has not yet been undertaken. In order to provide a full and balanced evidential foundation for welfare evaluations to be undertaken that further social work assessment of the mother court if possible to be available to the court before those evaluations are undertaken. In undertaking the welfare evaluation in respect of B the court also in my view should be in possession of the welfare evaluation for W. B and W are brothers and their welfare, their pasts and their futures are inevitably linked. In my view to reach a sound evaluation of B’s welfare the court ought if at all possible to undertake a joined up or holistic evaluation which includes considerations of W’s future and how W and B’s futures can be interwoven with each other either by conclusions or by orders. It is conceivable, albeit perhaps most unlikely on the evidence as it currently appears that an evaluation of B’s and W’s welfare individually and together with the assessment of the mother might result in a decision other than B returning to his father’s care. Even if return to AH is the outcome the court will be able to link that in some way with W’s future. </p>

Given CD at this stage had HG (10) and W (1) and was without papers for Spain and had come to the attention of social services as not coping I think it probable that she returned to Brazil both to remove herself from a situation where her care of the children was being scrutinised and was under threat and in order to find some greater security which would accompany no longer being ‘paperless’.  CD’s approach to her children in oral evidence was very much that as the mother she had control of the children and struggled to see that anyone else – a father and I conclude SS – had any rights to interfere with her decision making. In 2008 she returned to Spain leaving HG in Brazil. I do not know why she returned or why she left HG behind. </span>

CD’s case is she was struggling to pay the rent, did not have enough money and AH was not helping. She says she had a friend who said she could get a cleaning job in London. Having seen both give evidence and heard from them I conclude it is probable that AH’s account is more likely to be accurate. Apart from anything else the mother made clear in her oral evidence that she expected her partner to provide for her and I have no doubt given her difficulties with papers, housing and her approach to relationships and the obligations they bring for the man that she would have lived with AH for as long as she thought the relationship was meeting her needs. I accept AH’s account that he was still infatuated with CD both because of the physical relationship but also by this time because she had borne him a son and he was very proud of this and committed to B. I think it likely that AH and his family (who appear to be close to him) were very interested in and committed to B. Why CD decided to leave Spain is not clear, she was still without papers although was the mother of a Spanish national. She may have had some legal problems. I think it more likely that she had become unhappy with the relationship or her position in Spain where she was surrounded by AH’s family and perhaps could not cope with their presence in her life or AH’s interest in B and perhaps she felt neglected as many new mothers do when they are tied to the child meeting that child’s needs who is also the apple of the father’s eye. I do not accept that AH was running a cannabis farm or was disinterested in B. Both run contrary to his character, nor do I accept the suggestion she made in oral evidence that she was fleeing AH – insofar as that carried with it a suggestion he was abusive.   How CD thought that going to another country where she had no immigration status, no accommodation, no job and no physical support from AH was a good idea is beyond me but CD is a determined woman who is both impulsive and determined to do what she believes is best. CD says she made it clear this was a permanent move and AH agreed. AH says she said she needed to leave for a while in order to avoid the problems she faced in Spain but would return when they were resolved.  Given my conclusions on CD and AH’s general honesty, I find AH’s account is likely to be true. Apart from anything else I do not believe AH would have agreed to B being relocated permanently to England but I can believe he felt unable to withstand the force of CD’s personality and that she would have said what was necessary to get him on board – including maintaining a relationship with him.</span>

In her statements she says he visited only 3 times over the 3-year period – in November 2011, March 2013 and March 2014. In questioning of AH and in her evidence, she appeared to accept it was more than this. AH’s account is wholly different. He says he visited frequently in order to see CD, W and B bringing with him money for his 1-4 days trips.  CD and AH agree that on one occasion he stayed an extended time in order to see if he could get a job here and he stayed 3-4 weeks, obtaining a NINO. But the job did not work out and he returned to Spain to work. It seems clear from this that CD and AH’s relationship continued from both their perspectives. I accept the fathers account. He described 3 or 4 homes CD and the children lived in in England and described what they did when he visited.  He did not insist on B’s return accepting CD’s assurances that she would return when she could although there must have come a point when it became apparent she was not returning in the short term and he decided to live with that. Had it been relevant I think this would have amounted to acquiescence. </span>

Given that the court considered it necessary to determine whether it had jurisdiction and granted leave to proceed seems to me that this must constitute a fresh application albeit within existing proceedings. The case management order made provision for the filing of evidence but made no reference to whether and if so how B’s views might be obtained whether through seeking to locate him and obtaining views through the taking of evidence regulation or through a social services visit. The order itself together with the mother’s representative is responsible G 80 to make clear that the application itself was served via the mother’s procedural representative and received by her.

		    <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11.5pt;color:#000000">the mother gave evidence that she had various other means by which the father could have been contacted. The spelling of the name provided to social services is of course wrong although given the mother’s issues with literacy there could be an innocent explanation. However, I have absolutely no doubt that the mother had many other ways in which she could contact the father or his family or friends which she did not provide to the social services. Nor did she inform them that there had been legal proceedings in Spain. Nor did she provide them with details of the two lawyers who she had been instructing in Spain. The only inference which I can draw from this is that she did not have any real intention to assist the local authority in locating the father. Regrettably the local authority and the court itself do not appear to have pressed the mother for more information for instance by requiring her to produce her phone and to either make calls to relevant numbers or to allow the phone to be examined for information. Nor regrettably did the local authority take any further steps to seek to locate the father. Though they contacted the Spanish consulate to notify them that B and W were subject to proceedings they did not take the other steps that they might have to locate the father. They do not appear to have approached the English central authority to use Article 55 of Brussels to seek information from Spain about the father. Nor did they approach the consulate itself to seek information about the father or to enquire whether they could obtain further information from Spain. However nor did the court itself initiate for instance judicial liaison with the Spanish Hague network charge or suggest enquiries were made by the central authority. The net result of the insufficiency of the enquiries made by the local authority and the court in England combined with a similar insufficiency of activity at the Spanish end combined with the mother’s obstructive attitude resulted in care proceedings taking place in respect of B without any involvement of his father. Given that at the same time his father was searching for B and keen to take custody of him and, the court now having the benefit of the report of Peter Horrocks, probably being in a position to have offered him a home, perhaps along with W it is a tragedy for B and W that they have ended up in foster care or residential care for over two and half years when they might have been living with their father/stepfather.</span>
