	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">I apologise to the reader for its length not least because, as will appear in Part 4, I have concluded that the core facts and magnetic factors to be taken into account can be stated reasonably succinctly.  The length of this judgment flows from the way in which the factual disputes were prepared and presented and the general points that I have decided to make in that context (Part 2).  But also, as appears from Part 3, the case has raised points of principle that are not directly covered by existing authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">This has been a hard fought claim for ancillary relief in which there was a number of disputes of fact advanced that raised credibility issues.  The procedure adopted in respect of such issues, and the general preparation of the case, followed the rules and a fairly standard path in proceedings of this type.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that the comments and criticisms I make of the product of that path are criticisms of the path, and thus an approach to the preparation and presentation of “big money” cases that is generally adopted, rather than to the individuals involved in this case, who it seems to me have adopted an approach that accords with that adopted by many others who specialise in this field of litigation.  This is not surprising because the solicitors and counsel involved are experienced and respected practitioners in the field.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, the product of this fairly standard path was that a number of the factual stepping stones or building blocks in the rival arguments were not constructively or adequately addressed.  So, in my view, this case provides an example of endemic failures of the approach generally adopted in respect of the trial of “big money” cases to properly identify issues, and the evidence required in respect of them.  I make some general closing remarks at the end of this judgment for consideration by the profession (Part 5).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties were married in June 1996 shortly after they had met for the first time.  For both of them it was their second marriage.  At the date of the marriage the husband was 44 and the wife almost 30.  The marriage finally broke down and the parties separated at the end of January 2006.  So they were together  as a married couple for 9 and a half years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">There are cross applications for ancillary relief.  In his affidavit of 11 October 2007 the husband asserted that both claims should be dismissed.  The wife pursues her claim (which was issued later) and seeks a substantial award.  She has therefore been treated as the Applicant and the husband has made her an open offer.  So his stance is no longer, and for some time has not been, that both claims should be dismissed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">The date fixed for the hearing, with a 10 day estimate, was 16 March 2009.  The respective open positions of the parties (then and now) are dated 3 March 2009 (wife) and 10 March 2009 (husband).  They are a long way apart.  The wife’s open position is that she seeks a lump sum which will result in a division of the total assets as to 60% to the husband and 40% to the wife on the basis of a clean break and that costs be dealt with by the court.  The lump sum (subject to refinement by reference to updating disclosure and add backs) was estimated at £10 million.  The husband’s open position was that he would pay the wife £2,896,448 representing one half of the net increase in the value of his company between the date of the marriage and the date of separation, less the amount paid to the wife on account of her lump sum, and that there be no order as to costs.  The offer was based on Mr A’s valuations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">When the case came on for hearing in March 2009 (with its 10 day estimate) I gave the parties the opportunity to demonstrate to me that the case was ready for trial.  Having heard them I gave an ex tempore judgment to the effect that in my view the case was not then ready for trial on a central dispute of fact, namely that the wife had undisclosed substantial assets or ready access to such assets.<span style="font-style:italic">  </span>I therefore adjourned the trial on 17 March 2009.  It was, and remains, my view that there had been significant failures to take proper steps to prepare the case.  Fortunately a date in June 2009 was found for the trial.  I rejected what to my mind was an inappropriate approach by both counsel that the case should be re-fixed for their convenience. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">I ordered further disclosure in respect of that central dispute.  It seemed (and still seems) to me that this disclosure was an obvious and vital element of any properly prepared and argued determination of that issue and I therefore fail to understand how the parties had not made provision for it prior to the first hearing.  The point that the District Judge had limited disclosure of such material to dates after the breakdown of the marriage does not prevent the parties recognising that the issues raised in this case merit wider disclosure and it being provided by agreement, or further order.  The terms of my order were agreed between the parties who took the opportunity to include provisions for disclosure in addition to the disclosure triggered by my decision. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">In an attempt to focus the minds of the parties on basic aspects of the preparation of a case for trial, namely the identification of (a) the issues, (b) the facts that were agreed and (c) the facts that were in dispute, and thus the evidence that was needed to prove them, I also gave directions that:</p>

As I understand it, the wife is resident and domiciled in the UK and therefore liable to UK tax on foreign assets.  If that is wrong, and she is not domiciled in the UK, she would be liable to UK tax on remittances.  So it seems to me that the dispute as to the ownership of the relevant foreign assets had at least the potential for serious “knock on” effects outside this litigation for both the wife and her mother which warranted close attention being paid to its presentation by both sides.  </p>

Indeed, the wife was asked in questionnaire to provide a valuation but did not do so, asserting that the collection went back to when she was 17 and that her large wardrobe had a negligible value.  It is at least possible that an expert could date and identify what would have been paid for the clothes etc.  From that the wife’s expenditure on her wardrobe during and outside the marriage could have been identified.  It seems to me that if this issue was to be properly pursued, as a minimum, the content of the wardrobe should have been more accurately identified.  No such evidence was sought or provided.

In respect of the source of the funds it seemed to me that I would be asked to make findings as to the size of the wife’s father’s estate, its devolution and the funding of the payments shown to have been made by the wife’s parents to the wife by the disclosure by the wife of heavily redacted bank statements.</p>

In commenting on the draft of this judgment counsel for the husband argued that the approach taken in final written and oral submissions was an appropriate and conventional way of presenting a case when a client holds a deeply committed view which he is nonetheless unable to establish on evidential grounds and referred me to paragraphs 303 and 708 of the Code of Conduct.   Although I fully accept that counsel were acting in a manner they considered to be correct and conventional: I do not agree with that view and I have not come across this convention.  Rather, in my view, if a client who is funding the litigation will not give instructions to concede a point because he does not accept advice that his assertion cannot be established to the civil standard on the evidence as a whole then, unless for some professional reason counsel is unable to do so (e.g. he is aware that some evidence is false or of a refusal to put relevant material before the court), it is his duty to advance the assertion to the best of his ability on the evidence before the court, albeit that he is of the view that he has little or no chance of persuading the judge to make the finding sought by his client.  The relevant assessments (e.g. of credibility and weight) are ones for the court to make.</p>

This evidence was at the centre of the presentation of this poorly defined aspect of the husband’s case in the written evidence and during the oral evidence.  So far as I am aware there was no professional reason why that evidence could not still have been relied on in submissions on the basis that its assessment was a matter for the court rather than counsel.   The final position of the husband through counsel means that to a large extent the relevance of those two disputes falls away.  However, as they both remain issues that were explored at some length and which go to credit, I comment on them elsewhere.</p>

In reaching this view I have not forgotten that she naturally had a number of discussions with him about the business and some problems that arose, particularly in connection with employment issues, and helped in drafting some documents.

This was a proper and inevitable acceptance that her assertion in her Form E, and the parts of her written evidence directed to it, that she was a “fully contributing wife” in this sense was flawed.

When he was shown these forecasts Mr A accepted that the weighting to the profits to 31 January 2006 should be 100% and therefore this dispute, as was obviously predictable, evaporated.  The husband’s counsel accepted this before Mr G gave his evidence. </p>

This is because on the hypothetical basis of his valuation (i.e. willing seller and willing buyer) it is highly likely, if not inevitable, that such forecasts would have been produced.   I accept that an assessment of what they would have contained, if they had not existed, has some problems, but that does not mean that a view should not be taken as to what they would have contained. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">The wife’s leading counsel embarked on a series of questions of Mr A directed to inviting me to find that the 2006 profits as forecast (or as they turned out to be) should be incorporated into the weighted profit figure in the valuation as at 31 January 2006.  The purpose of this was to seek to establish the finding sought by the wife that both accountants were wrong in their valuation as at 31 January 2006 (albeit that the wife’s primary position was that it was unnecessary to decide what that value was).  To the non-accountant this point may have potential.  But, as it related to the methodology used by both accountants (and thus to something that was well within their expertise as the expert witnesses instructed by the parties), in my view, as a matter of good practice relating to expert evidence and common sense, it should have been raised with the accountants, together with any published material from an appropriate source which was to be used to support it, before the hearing.  This was not done.  When the point was put to Mr A, unsurprisingly he did not agree with it.  Counsel did not put to him that Mr G would be agreeing with it, or what Mr G would be saying about it.  This is a clear indication that the questioning was pursued either on the basis that it was not known what Mr G would say, or in the knowledge that he did not agree with the point being made.  Also no published material indicating that the suggested and different approach / methodology would be appropriate was put to Mr A or Mr G.  When the matter was raised with Mr G, he too did not agree.  </p>

Mr G added, and I accept, that the multiple they had both used was a high one.  It follows that both experts agreed that the point was a bad one and counsel did not point to any contrary expert view in published material or elsewhere.  Accordingly I find that the point has no substance.</p>

As he commented, the position is that although, of course, accountants do the best they can to put an accurate value on a company applying the hypothesis of a willing seller and buyer (and like to cross check against actual offers and sales) the hypothetical nature of the exercise they are carrying out, and its methodology (which leads to wide differences in result if components of the figures and multiples used are varied within a permissible range), mean that there is uncertainty in the valuation given and often a wide range of reasonable figures. </p>

These included the view taken of the expansion (through leasing rather than as originally planned purchase) into Norway.  This led to the losses incurred in respect of the business based in Norway for the year to 31 January 2007 being discounted in the assessment of the profit to 31 January 2007 that was included in the calculations.  This indicates a view that these losses, or losses in Norway would not recur.</p>

Although the wife described herself as an independent woman, it is clear that the wife has never based that independence on her own work and earnings.  Rather after she left university and before her first marriage she did not work.  During and after that marriage, and during her second marriage, she did not work.  Before her first marriage she received generous support from her father and mother through a settlement and otherwise, for example she was given a BMW and later a Mercedes car.  When her first husband was having financial difficulty in paying the mortgage on their matrimonial home there was no suggestion that they should move to the flat the wife had lived in before the marriage, or that the wife should work, or that they should in effect fend for themselves with some modest assistance from the wife’s parents.  Rather, the solution suggested and put into effect was that the wife’s parents should provide the funds for a substantial home in Buckinghamshire and its refurbishment.</p>

Further the evidence shows that the wife and her parents did not have any expectation or plan that the wife would support, or partly support, herself by working.  None of this is recorded or set out by way of criticism and when her first marriage broke down I recognise that she had a very young child and shortly after it she and her mother suffered the loss of the wife’s father.  </p>

In that analysis (a) the sum of £148,500 is included as “inheritance”, and (b) a sum of £30,000 from her mother in 1998 and a sum of £29,000 for ad hoc gifts are included (which is broadly in line with an analysis of credits into the wife’s disclosed bank accounts prepared by the husband over a different period, albeit that an accurate comparison is not practical).  For the purpose of identifying annual spend over and above what was provided by the husband characterisation of receipts as inheritance or gifts is irrelevant and so the maths of these calculations is not affected by my conclusion that the £148,500 was not paid in respect of the wife’s inheritance.  </p>

This result also equates to the figure asserted by the wife to be her expenditure from her own money before these calculations were produced to the other side and the court.  (Whether or not the wife had done either of them earlier and, if so, the records she had used was not pursued).  In final submission, although inheritance and gifts are included in the above analysis, it was said that her expenditure was funded by the husband, from her own money which she had consistently put at £40,000 per annum <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> by money from her parents by way of inheritance and periodic gift (and therefore from 3 sources).</p>

An example of this is bills rendered by the wife’s present solicitors in respect of her first divorce and, as I understand it, in respect of disputes concerning the wife’s daughter.  Some of these bills may have been paid before the marriage but, for example, by the letters of 6 December 1996 and 9 January 1998 Mishcon de Reya sent bills to the wife’s mother for payment and, on 9 January 1998, there is an internal memo to the effect that all bills relating to the wife are to be sent to her mother for payment.

In November 2008, the husband’s solicitors asked the wife to sign an authority in relation to the obtaining of copies of the statements for that credit card.  They replied that she had complied already with her disclosure obligations.  But the husband then issued a summons for this disclosure and on 28th November 2008 the wife’s solicitors said in relation to the bill for the husband’s 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday party that:</p>

By the time of his death that marriage was in major difficulty, the wife’s daughter was very young and she suspected that her husband was having an affair.  The wife’s mother said, and I accept, that her first husband’s greatest pleasure in his final years was seeing the beautiful and confident young woman that his daughter had become; but that this pleasure “was marred in the final months of his life by [her first husband’s] behaviour”.

This approach and understanding could be an explanation for the conversation related by the wife’s mother with her first husband shortly before his death to the effect that she would be alright and there would be enough for her.  This is because the money would be used for her and their daughter.  Although I acknowledge that these points could also fit with, or support, other conclusions relating to the creation of a trust or other formal arrangement outside the will for the benefit of the wife, in my view the provision in the will coupled with an understanding of a continuance of generous support (which her parents could well afford) fits readily and easily with what has been proved and admitted to  have happened. </p>

Albeit that the wife’s father did purchase an annuity (its amount was not contained in the evidence) I reject the balance of this evidence of the husband.  Even in temper or distress I do not accept that the wife would have said this and her father’s will and the information we have (albeit limited) as to the size of his estate indicate that this was not true.

For example, when she was describing the terms of the will of her second husband she left me with an impression that the provision of his will she described as a love letter was unfair and she should have received more, albeit that she had to accept that this passage in his will was accurate as to their respective wealth.  So, it seems to me, that in asserting that the husband had provided generously for their daughter she could well have given the same impression because of the moral obligation this imposed on her to make this provision for him to the daughter he doted on, even though by doing so there would be still be very substantial sums available for her own use.  I add that to my mind both impressions do not reflect the considered  underlying views of the wife’s mother on the fairness of the approached adopted by her husbands.</p>

The making of, and limited persistence in, this allegation does the husband, and his advisers, no credit.  In my judgment when he made this allegation it was intended to, and did, carry the implication that the parties effectively ran separate economies.

This additional disclosure covered a joint account and cards used during the marriage and other payments made by the husband and the company for the years 1998, 2001 and 2004.  The analysis carried out by the wife demonstrated that the wife’s assertions (which she had made without access to this or similar material provided by the husband and the company) as to the total amount of the funding by the husband of expenditure on, or attributable to, her, was reasonably accurate although her division between direct financing and money spent on credit cards and through the joint account was less accurate.  (This is an example of the wife’s ability to detail items of expenditure from limited records and memory that was lacking in her evidence relating to the agreement alleged relating to her legacy from her father and her requests for payments in respect thereof.)</p>

Rather the award to the wife should recognise that, as was the case during the marriage, the day to day expenditure of the wife included an element for the child’s maintenance reflecting what was provided by the husband to the household.</p>

Further, that decision to buy a new build house, that she did not move into until 2004 (and thus only about a year before her alleged planned return to Scotland), does not fit easily with a plan to return to Scotland even though Christmas cards had both addresses on them and the wife bought the same crockery for both houses.  </p>

In my judgment the retention by the wife after she and her daughter moved to live in Scotland of her first house in Buckinghamshire was in large measure based on her stance accepted by the husband that this asset had been bought with money from her family assets and that she could and would use funds provided by her mother (from the funds made by her father) as she saw fit.</p>

It had the effect within the way that they ran their married life together of “ring fencing” the wife’s houses which she purchased with the benefit of the “speciality loan” the first of which was a pre-acquired asset.  In this context I note that in her allocation of expenditure the wife has treated the insurance premiums on her house in Buckinghamshire as being 100% for her and not a joint expense which in my view reflects and supports my conclusion.</p>

But I have concluded that the sum for holidays to be added back should exclude the sum of £33,363 listed by the husband and which primarily relates to trips to London for the purposes of this litigation.

No argument was addressed to this.</p>

There is no indication that the wife has suffered a drop in her standard of living and so this shortfall, and the point that the wife made no application for interim maintenance until one year after the husband ceased to maintain her, are supportive of the views I have reached (without taking this into account) as to the level of support that her mother has been giving to her.</p>

If £450,000 is so treated, and so equated to the husband’s expenditure that has not been added back, and that £350,000 allocation in respect of the wife’s costs and the costs incurred by the husband that he has paid are added back, the assets available become:</p>

Any or all of them might supply such a reason, although one must be careful to avoid double counting.  The cardinal feature is that each is looking at factors which are linked to the parties’ relationship, either causally or temporally, and not to extrinsic, unrelated factors, such as a disability arising after the marriage has ended.</p>

In the great majority of cases, the court is trying to ensure that each party and their children have enough to supply their needs, set at a level as close as possible to the standard of living which they enjoyed during the marriage (note that the House did not adopt a restrictive view of needs in the <span style="font-style:italic">White</span> case [2001] 1 AC 596 ant 608G – 609A).

Need had become "reasonable requirements” and thus more generous to the recipient, but it was still a limiting factor even where there was a substantial surplus of resources over needs ------------ .

Confusion might be avoided if courts were to stop using the expression "reasonable requirements" in these cases, burdened as it is now with the difficulties mentioned above.  This would not deprive the court of the necessary degree of flexibility.  Financial needs are relative.  Standards of living vary.  In assessing financial needs, a court will have regard to a person's age, health and accustomed standard of living.  The court may also have regard to the available pool of resources.  Clearly, and this is well recognised, there is some overlap between the factors listed in section 25 (2).  In a particular case there may be other matters to be taken into account as well.”</p>

The origins of the yardstick lay in s. 25(2) of the Act, specifically in s. 25(2)(f), which refers to the parties’ contributions: see the preceding argument of Lord Nicholls at p. 605D-E.  The yardstick reflected a modern, non-discriminatory conclusion that the proper evaluation under s. 25(2)(f) of the parties’ different contributions to the welfare of the family should generally lead to an equal division of their property unless there was good reason for the division to be unequal.  It also tallied with the overarching objective: a fair result.</p>

It concerns property acquired during the marriage by one spouse by gift or succession or as a beneficiary under a trust.  For convenience I will refer to such property as inherited property. Typically, in countries where a detailed statutory code is in place, the legislation distinguishes between two classes of property: inherited property, and property owned before the marriage, on the one hand, and "matrimonial property" on the other hand.  A distinction along these lines exists, for example, in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 and the (New Zealand) Matrimonial Property Act 1976. </span>

According to this view, on a breakdown of the marriage these two classes of property should not necessarily be treated in the same way.  Property acquired before marriage and inherited property acquired during marriage come from a source wholly external to the marriage.  In fairness, where this property still exists, the spouse to whom it was given should be allowed to keep it.  Conversely, the other spouse has a weaker claim to such property than he or she may have regarding matrimonial property. </span>

The nature and value of the property, and the time when and circumstances in which the property was acquired, are among the relevant matters to be considered.

	      </a>, it was recognised that the source of the assets might be a reason for departing from the yardstick of equality (see p 610c-g). There, the reason was that property had been acquired from or with the help of the husband's father during the marriage, but the same would apply to property acquired before the marriage. In <span style="font-style:italic">White</span>, it was also recognised that the importance of the source of the assets will diminish over time (see p 611b). As the family's personal and financial inter-dependence grows, it becomes harder and harder to disentangle what came from where. But the fact that the family's wealth consists largely of a family business, such as a farm, may still be taken into account as a reason for departing from full equality: see <span style="font-style:italic">P v P (Inherited Property)</span> [2004] EWHC 1364 (Fam); [2005] 1 FLR 576. So too may be the nature of the assets, where these are businesses which will be crippled or lose much of their value, if disposed of prematurely in order to fund an equal division: see <span style="font-style:italic">N v N (Financial Provision: Sale of Company)</span> [2001] 2 FLR 69. </p>

To this list should clearly be added family businesses or joint ventures in which they both work. It is easy to see such assets as the fruits of the marital partnership. It is also easy to see each party's efforts as making a real contribution to the acquisition of such assets. Hence it is not at all surprising that Mr and Mrs McFarlane agreed upon the division of their capital assets, which were mostly of this nature, without prejudice to how Mrs McFarlane's future income provision would be quantified. </p>

The other party has often made some contribution to the business, at least in its early days, and has continued with her agreed contribution to the welfare of the family (as did Mrs Cowan). But in these non-business-partnership, non-family asset cases, the bulk of the property has been generated by one party. Does this provide a reason for departing from the yardstick of equality? On the one hand is the view, already expressed, that commercial and domestic contributions are intrinsically incommensurable. It is easy to count the money or property which one has acquired. It is impossible to count the value which the other has added to their lives together. One is counted in money or money's worth. The other is counted in domestic comfort and happiness. If the law is to avoid discrimination between the gender roles, it should regard all the assets generated in either way during the marriage as family assets to be divided equally between them unless some other good reason is shown to do otherwise. </p>

Even modest legislative steps towards this have been strenuously resisted. Ownership and contributions still feature in divorcing couples' own perceptions of a fair result, some drawing a distinction between the home and joint savings accounts, on the one hand, and pensions, individual savings and debts, on the other (<span style="font-style:italic">Settling Up</span>, para 128 earlier, chapter 5). Some of these are not family assets in the way that the home, its contents and the family savings are family assets. Their value may well be speculative or their possession risky. It is not suggested that the domestic partner should share in the risks or potential liabilities, a problem which bedevils many community of property regimes and can give domestic contributions a negative value. It simply cannot be demonstrated that the domestic contribution, important though it has been to the welfare and happiness of the family as a whole, has contributed to their acquisition. If the money maker had not had a wife to look after him, no doubt he would have found others to do it for him. Further, great wealth can be generated in a very short time, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span>case shows; but domestic contributions by their very nature take time to mature into contributions to the welfare of the family. </p>

The present case is an example, with arguments about whether Mr Miller can be said (by reason of his contacts, his gentleman's agreement with Mr Duffield and/or his experience) to have brought into the marriage any asset relating to his potential interest in New Star. To take into account the shortness of a marriage could enable a court to cut through some of these more intricate arguments in a manner consistent with section 25(2)(d) of the 1973 Act. More fundamentally, to allow the duration of a marriage as a relevant factor would cater for the considerations that, while some people may make a large amount of money in a short time, the nature of their work or other factors may mean that they do not do so at a consistent rate over their lives as a whole or for more than a short period of their lives, and furthermore, as Baroness Hale has pointed out, that there may be long-term risks in relation to non-business-partnership, non-family assets which remain with those directly involved in generating them. The longer the marriage, the less likely these are to be significant considerations. In a short marriage, the timing of which may or may not coincide with a period of significant increase in the value of non-business-partnership, non-family assets, such considerations argue in favour of some further flexibility in the application of the yardstick of equality of division. I see force in and would agree with the views expressed by Baroness Hale in paragraphs 152-153 of her judgment to the effect that the duration of a marriage, mentioned expressly in section 25(2)(d) of the Act, cannot be discounted as a relevant factor. </p>

The present marriage had what one might call a traditional aspect. Mr Miller worked, and Mrs Miller gave up work to look after him. But there can be marriages, long as well as short, where both partners are and remain financially active, and independently so. They may contribute to a house and joint expenses, but it does not necessarily follow that they are or regard themselves in other respects as engaged in a joint financial enterprise for all purposes. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Intrusive enquiries into the other's financial affairs might, during the marriage, be viewed as inconsistent with a proper respect for the other's personal autonomy and development, and even more so if the other were to claim a share of any profit made from them.</span> In such a case the wife might still have the particular additional burden of combining the bearing of and caring for children with work outside the home. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">If one partner (and it might, with increasing likelihood I hope, be the wife) were more successful financially than the other, and questions of needs and compensation had been addressed, one might ask why a court should impose at the end of their marriage a sharing of all assets acquired during matrimony which the parties had never envisaged during matrimony. Once needs and compensation had been addressed, the misfortune of divorce would not of itself, as it seems to me, be justification for the court to disturb principles by which the parties had chosen to live their lives while married.</span>.”</p>

	      </a>, at [28], as "pre-matrimonial") or the introduction into it of property received during it by inheritance or gift (being property there described by Burton J. as "extra-matrimonial"), the generation of wealth during a marriage has conventionally been taken as one obvious form of contribution to the welfare of the family. Here, however, Baroness Hale articulated a refinement, namely that the generation of wealth should not always qualify as a contribution to the welfare of the family and in particular perhaps that in excess of a certain level its generation should not so qualify. The dividing-line is no doubt elusive. But, if the present case were to be one in which, in excess of a certain level, the husband's wealth were not to qualify as the product of a contribution to the welfare of the family, how should the court treat the excess? Mr Singleton submits, albeit with diffidence, that the excess would not be susceptible of redistribution and so should all lie in the hands into which it has fallen, namely those of the husband. We reject that submission: a party's property would not fall outside the court's redistributive powers in s.s.23-25 of the Act just because it was not the product of a contribution within the meaning of s.25(2)(f). With equal diffidence Mr Pointer submits, by contrast, that, because it is only a special contribution to the welfare of the family which justifies unequal division, the excess, not being the product of a special contribution, should fall for equal division. Such a result would in our view be almost absurd. The facts are that, before the judge, the case was accepted on both sides to be one in which, apart from £1 million which is the subject of the third subsidiary ground of appeal, all the property, notwithstanding its size, was the product of the husband's special contribution to the welfare of the family within the meaning of s.25(2)(f); and that Mr Singleton, followed reactively by Mr Pointer, now uses this difficult passage in the speech of Baroness Hale as a bandwagon on to which to jump. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">In our view the size of the property in the present case should not compel departure from the usual conclusion that wealth generated by a party during a marriage is the product of a contribution on his or her part to the welfare of the family.</span></p>

Baroness Hale described such cases, at [150], as "non-business-partnership non-family asset cases". In <span style="font-style:italic">FS v.

In summary Baroness Hale suggested, at [149] to [152], that within the definition of matrimonial property a distinction fell to be made between "family assets" and the fruits of a business in which both parties had substantially worked, on the one hand, and the fruits of a business in which only one party had substantially worked, i.e. unilateral assets, on the other.

By dismissal of the husband's appeal against dismissal of his appeal to this court, the decision of the House was to uphold the judge's award to the wife of £5 million, i.e. one third of the ostensible matrimonial property. </p>

It was in this area that the members of the House were in substantial disagreement; and we cannot subscribe to the ingenious attempt of Burton J. in <span style="font-style:italic">FS v. JS</span>, at [30] and [31], to reconcile their differences. We suggest with respect that, while the approach of Lord Nicholls was perhaps the more logical, the approach both of Baroness Hale, with which Lord Hoffmann agreed, and of Lord Mance was perhaps the more pragmatic. Lord Nicholls, at [17] to [20], stressed that the sharing principle was as fully applicable to short as to long marriages and that the concept of treating unilateral assets differently from other matrimonial assets discriminated in favour of the bread-winner. He justified departure from equal sharing of the matrimonial property in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span>by reference, at [73], to the amount of work done by the husband prior to the marriage referable to the venture. In a section entitled <span style="font-style:italic">"The source of the assets and the length of the marriage"</span> Baroness Hale, at [147] to [152], squarely faced the conceptual difficulties inherent in the different application of the sharing principle to short marriages but considered that, on balance, perceptions of fairness justified it.

They cover three of Mr Pointer’s four submissions summarised in [21] above.  The third, namely that much of the husband's fortune was generated in the six years post separation, receives no reflection because in my opinion it is inherently fallacious.  The assessment of assets must be at the date of trial or appeal.  The language of the statute requires that.  Exceptions to that rule are rare and probably confined to cases where one party has deliberately or recklessly wasted assets in anticipation of trial.  In this case the reality is that the husband traded his wife’s unascertained share as well as his own between separation and trial, particularly committing those undivided shares to the investment in Baco.  The wife’s share went on risk and she is plainly entitled to what in the event has proved to be a substantial profit.  If this factor has any relevance it is within the evaluation of the husband's exceptional contribution.”,</p>

One problem about any such attempt is evident from the first sentence of paragraph 37 of the judge's judgment quoted in paragraph 162 above. If "this marriage may well have been doomed", what significance can there be in the fact that one party recognised this earlier than the other? How is one to judge between harsh realism and wishful thinking? More fundamentally, section 25(2)(g) recognises the difficulty and undesirability, except in egregious cases, of any attempt at assessing and weighing marital conduct. I now recognise the same difficulty in respect of marital contributions - conduct and contributions are in large measure opposite sides of a coin: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">G v.

The approach taken to post nuptial agreements, and thus the conduct of the parties in entering into them and in applying them, are more relevant for present purposes.  This is because these matters relate to choices made during the marriage that set or influence (a) the way in which and the principles (and expectations) by which the parties ran their married life together, and (b) how their assets should be divided after a separation.  As Wilson LJ comments in paragraph 119 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher</span>, the Board<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in <span style="font-style:italic">MacLeod </span>helpfully explained that as the spousal duty to live together no longer subsisted, the public policy based on it that founded the conclusion that agreements that made financial arrangements for a separation that had not already occurred were void at common law, no longer subsists.   </p>

To my mind it would not be, both in assessing their relationship generated needs and a departure from equality in applying the sharing principle (see again paragraphs 27 to 29 of the judgment of  Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher</span>).

Whereas the way in which, or the principles by which, the parties have run their lives would generally relate to the period when the relationship was not breaking down and to conduct based on choices that were agreed, accepted, or at least at the time not criticised.  </p>

This reduces the risk of there being  an analysis of matters relating to the choices made, the principles adopted and the way a married life has been run that are susceptible to different perceptions which an outsider would have great difficulty in unravelling and concentrates on  the obvious and  major choices made by words and conduct.</p>

Both approaches  would run counter to the point that we have a matrimonial property regime which still starts with the premise of separate property (see Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span>at paragraph 153) and the nature of a claim for ancillary relief.</p>

This conclusion is supported by the points made by Mance LJ in paragraph 133 of <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan </span>when he says that the bulk of the assets was between separation and the hearing the husband’s and under his control and he could do with it as he wished.

Similarly the 'equal sharing' principle might suggest that each of the party's assets should be separately and exactly valued. But valuations are often a matter of opinion on which experts differ.

In other words there was a  financial continuum, the groundwork for which was laid and the seeds sown during the parties’ married life together, through how they chose their respective marital roles.  Attempted forensic distinction between the differing assets in the kitty creates issues which are in many (though not all) cases sterile. In my view, therefore, whilst the ‘matrimonial property’ may nowadays need to be identified, the court should still strive to take as broad a view as possible, especially in cases such as this, where the husband’s asset-accruing role has not changed in any way since the separation and where the accruals have not come from any new source of risk, endeavour, or luck”.</p>

Whilst this might be technically correct, it is a highly artificial argument and, even in its own terms, glosses over the fact that the buy-out in fact occurred after the effective end of the marriage. It is artificial because it is clear that the present value of the business is very significantly based on the fact that it has been operating successfully at the same site for over 30 years.”<br/><br/>“[116] … the current value reflects 33 years of endeavour.

But, in this general discussion of the approach at law I mention that, in a case where the need principle based on the standard of living during the marriage points to a capitalised award that is higher than a half (or approaching one half) of the value of the immediately available assets, questions arise as to whether the factors that potentially provide a good reason for departure from equality in an application of the sharing principle:</p>

By definition in the latter case the donor can act unreasonably.  But that does not mean that it should be assumed, or that the starting point should be, that the prospective donor will act unreasonably or differently from the way in which that person has acted in the past.  So, in my judgment, if for example a child of an extremely rich father has always had a very high standard of living before and during his or her marriage met by gifts from the father, and has not been given a stake in the wealth made or a beneficiary under trusts, the court can in applying the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">TL </span>make an award by reference to the history that the father has generously provided funds in the past and will be likely to enable the child to pay the award.

Using Duxbury, and capitalisation calculations provided by the parties, as a guide in my view a fair capital sum to provide the wife with an income of £150,000 a year for the rest of her life would be of the order of £4.2m.  (In their helpful comments on the draft of this judgment counsel informed me that a conventional capitalisation for a female aged 43 at £150,000 per annum is £3,981,000.  But my higher figure is an estimate based on the material referred to, and could be said to have a small cushion over that amortised figure.

In my view it cannot be said that the product of those choices was not agreed or accepted by the parties as a lifestyle for their marriage or that that lifestyle is sufficiently unusual to warrant a different approach.

The starting point under FPR Rule 2.71 is therefore that each side will bear their own costs.  However in my judgment, at this stage in applying the sharing principle the costs of both parties should be allocated to a top slice of the assets now representing the moneys received by the husband for his shares and I should proceed on the basis that it is the balance of those assets that is available for sharing.  That top slice can then be dealt with separately before the order is drawn up, having regard to any argument raised on costs under FPR Rule 2.71 (e.g. 2.71(5)(f), which returns one to the overall quest for a fair result).  This approach enables the parties and the court to consider those arguments in the light of the conclusions reached by the court that impact on the matters listed in sub-rule (5).  It also enables the court to consider the impact of the starting point for costs on an award that does not (a) equate to an equal sharing of the available assets, and/or (b) mirror the split between the parties of the total of their costs bills.</p>

The later years will have had a more immediate impact on the value of the company as at separation and when it was sold.  Very little evidence was directed to the development of the business between inception and sale and in my view correctly it was not urged that the valuations obtained provide any real help in assessing its development over the whole of this period, in contrast to the help they give in assessing the reasons for the increase in its value between separation and sale.  </p>

To my mind a constant was the husband’s full-time contribution and its central part in the creation of the company’s business, its business approach and practice and its position in the market.  In my view, it is likely that if more evidence had been directed to the development of the business over all the years from its creation to its sale, it is unlikely that it would only have been possible to take anything other than a broad approach to the “spring board effect” of this pre-acquired asset to its value as at separation, and thus to the attribution of its value as at that date between (a) its creation and the work done in its development prior to the marriage, and (b) its further development during the marriage. </p>

This reflects the importance of the later years but also has regard to the creation and earlier life of the business and thus the point that absent its creation and formative years there would not have been a company.  Also it takes into account that there is no evidence of a major change in direction during the marriage and before separation.

So (adopting the description used by Bodey J) it was in large measure a continuum of the decisions that had created that platform albeit that, fortunately for both parties, it (together with the other factors I have mentioned) led to a sale at a significantly increased figure over the valuation as at separation.</p>

So, they are an integral part of the process of establishing the building blocks of the case to be presented by the parties to the court as to how it should exercise its broad statutory discretion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, in my view the very nature of the overall statutory task, and the broad discretion the court has to exercise in performing it, highlight the need to carry out the basic tasks I have mentioned to identify the facts and matters relied on, and thus the building blocks for the rival arguments as to the assets that are the subject of the s. 25 exercise and how that exercise should be carried out by the court.  It seems to me that this should save money and promote the fair resolution of cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">So the process of Forms A and E, general identification of the issues through a short statement of issues couched in general and brief terms, questionnaires and s. 25 affidavits does not readily lend itself to a clear and succinct identification of the building blocks of the rival contentions, particularly when there are disputes of fact to be resolved.  No doubt this process provides other advantages particularly at the early stages of proceedings and in smaller cases.  It is also the basic procedure that has to be followed.  But this does not mean that it cannot be supplemented where appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the suggestion made by counsel for the wife that in many cases after a failed FDR it would be appropriate for directions to be given for an exchange of documents identifying the building blocks of each side’s case, particularly when there are disputes of fact and, even more so, if allegations of dishonesty are being advanced.  It seems to me that often no such exercise is carried out, or committed to paper, before the preparation of skeleton arguments which is obviously much too late to inform the process of gathering evidence, and in any event often such skeletons do not set such matters out.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.5in">To my mind, by the time of an FDR each side should have identified the building blocks of their respective cases.  Indeed, the assessment of them and their product is at the heart of an FDR. So the process of considering them should have started well before the FDR, and reducing them to writing after it should not be a burdensome or particularly expensive task.   In my view, it will often be very helpful to set them out in an exchange of documents, and therefore I invite practitioners and judges after a failed FDR to consider carefully what should be done to clearly identify the building blocks of the cases advanced by the parties.  I also invite the parties to consider setting them out in writing in an open form before an FDR.</p>
