	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This case has been before the courts on a number of occasions and both sides have incurred very substantial costs.  As a result of orders made by this court in favour of the Petitioner for maintenance pending suit the Respondent has been funding the costs of both sides.  This has occurred against a background in which the Respondent has been disputing the jurisdiction of this court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The matter comes before me pursuant to directions made by Bennett J on 15 June 2004.  These directions followed an order of the Court of Appeal made on the previous day.  Dates in June 2004 had been set for a full hearing.  In April 2004 Bennett J. had made an order debarring the Respondent from defending the suit.  The Respondent appealed that debarring order and other earlier orders.  The overall result of the appeals heard in June was that Bennett J. directed that two preliminary issues should be heard in respect of the Petitioner’s first petition dated 19 February 2003.  That petition has since been amended on 29 June 2004.  The issues were (a) whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain that petition by reason of the Petitioner’s habitual residence, and  (b) whether a stay of the suit should be granted.  These points raise issues under DMPA 1973 and in particular under s. 5 and Schedule 1 thereof.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Petitioner has issued a second petition dated 29 June 2004.  The same points arise in respect of this petition and it is common ground that I should deal with them.  Additionally the Respondent seeks an order that this petition be dismissed as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or because it is vexatious or an abuse of process.  At the outset of the hearing there was a dispute as to whether I should deal with this issue but (and in my view correctly) opposition to me doing so was not pressed in later argument, although it was not withdrawn. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The petitions are brought under the MCA 1973 and by them the Petitioner seeks a decree of divorce or alternatively of nullity.  This relief relates to status and is clearly the first step towards the Petitioner being able to claim ancillary relief under the MCA.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A potential alternative route to claiming financial relief would be under Part III of the MFPA 1984.  Leave is required before such a claim can be made.  As to this possible alternative the position of the Petitioner altered during the course of the hearing.  When opening the case leading counsel for the Petitioner told me that if the present petitions were stayed the Petitioner would not be able to claim financial relief in this country. As I understood that assertion was in part based on a claim that she would not be able to remain here unless the Respondent continued to maintain her.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Later leading counsel for the Petitioner accepted and averred that the MFPA 1984 was a possible alternative. Later still he argued that if I granted a stay I could continue interim freezing orders and orders for interim periodical payments (including an element for costs).  It was accepted by leading counsel for the Respondent that the MFPA was a possible alternative basis for claiming financial relief after decisions relating to the status of the parties had been decided in Nigeria.  But it was disputed that I could grant interim freezing orders and orders for periodical payments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was common ground that if a stay was granted the children would (or would be likely to) seek financial relief under the Children Act 1989.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To my mind the potential for claims by the Petitioner under the MFPA and the children under the Children Act form part of the relevant statutory provisions against which the matters before me should be considered, but it is the DMPA 1973 that is directly applicable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties are both Nigerian.  In giving their evidence they have both referred regularly to the position in their culture.  They have done so in the context of sharp disputes of fact and issues of credibility that exist between them.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that although issues of status are involved and have  independent effects the dispute between the parties is primarily, if not exclusively, about money and thus what, if any, financial provision the Respondent should make for the Petitioner and for the benefit of her children.  The Petitioner asserts that she and the Respondent married.  The Respondent denies this.  The Petitioner relies upon a customary and not a statutory marriage.  It is common ground that as a wife under a customary marriage she would not have a claim for financial relief in Nigeria (see also <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mark v Mark </span> [2004] 1 FLR 1069 at para 39).  She relies in the alternative on two ceremonies of customary marriage.  Her first petition relies on a ceremony that she alleges took place on on 22 December 1993.  This petition could not have relied on the second alleged ceremony of customary marriage relied on by the Petitioner because it took place within a year of the issue of this petition. By amendment on 29 June 2004 the first petition also seeks to rely on a marriage by cohabitation and repute.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Petitioner’s case is that the first ceremony was a low-key affair.  The Respondent denies that this ceremony ever took place.  Naturally this raises a stark dispute of fact.  The Respondent says he was not present at any such ceremony whereas the Petitioner and, for example, her father say that he was.  The Respondent therefore seeks to establish a negative.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the alternative the Respondent asserts that if he was present and took part in a ceremony on 22 December 1993 as the Petitioner alleges what occurred is not sufficient to constitute a valid customary marriage. On this alternative the Respondent asserts that what the Petitioner alleges took place lacks essential features of a customary marriage.  This raises points of Nigerian law and some issues of fact as to events leading up to, and after, the alleged ceremony.  Naturally the Respondent has some difficulty in disputing the detail of what actually occurred on the day given that his primary case is that he was not there.  But it is not impossible that a credible witness may be found whose account of what took place is accepted although it does not accord with the cases advanced by either of the parties. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second ceremony relied on by the Petitioner took place over 8 years later on 16 March 2002.  It is common ground that a ceremony took place on that day. There is a video of it.  There is however a dispute as to the nature of the ceremony.  The Respondent asserts that it was a ceremony through which he acknowledged that he was the father of the twin girls born to the Petitioner on 20 June 2001.  Additionally there are arguments of law and fact as to whether this ceremony constituted, or could constitute, an effective customary marriage ceremony.  The disputes of fact are stark and relate to discussions between the parties and between the Respondent and the Petitioner's father.  There are also disputes of law as to whether what the Petitioner alleges occurred is sufficient to constitute a valid customary marriage.  These include the point whether either or both of the parties had the relevant intention and points as to whether essential features of a customary marriage were present.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are also stark disputes as to the alternative of a marriage based on cohabitation and repute.  The particulars relied on date from the first alleged ceremony and, as one would expect, in large measure to conduct in Nigeria and how the parties have treated, and held each other out, since 1993.  I add that although in both petitions the Petitioner alleges that the parties last lived together as husband and wife at A Avenue, London, as  appears later, she accepted in her oral evidence that the parties did not cohabit in England and Wales.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties are Roman Catholics and there are two systems of marriage in Nigeria that are potentially relevant namely statutory marriage under the Nigerian Marriage Act 1914 and customary marriage.  Statutory marriage is monogamous.  Customary marriage is not. There are a number of similarities between statutory marriage in Nigeria and marriage in England.  Unsurprisingly there are formal requirements in respect of a statutory marriage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An alternative case of the Respondent is that he entered into a statutory marriage in 1974 with a lady, who I shall refer to as G, and therefore any customary marriage he entered into thereafter would be void.  It is accepted by the Petitioner (a) that the Respondent and G went through a ceremony of marriage, and (b) that, if this was a valid statutory marriage, her alleged customary marriage with the Respondent would be ineffective and unlawful.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to this alternative case the Petitioner (a) disputes the validity of the alleged statutory marriage between the Respondent and G, and (b) asserts that if there was a statutory marriage between the Respondent and G she was tricked into her customary marriage with the Respondent as a result of an express representation made to her (and as I understood her evidence to me to her father, although this is not mentioned in the amended petition and was not expressly addressed before me) by the Respondent that his marriage to G was a customary marriage.  This assertion is an indication that the Petitioner was aware at that time that a valid statutory marriage to G would mean that a customary marriage would be ineffective and unlawful.      </p>

Although not argued before me in my view there is, or may be, an issue as to what relief the English court could, or should, give having regard to the disputed position in Nigerian law (see Dicey &amp; Morris Rule 77(2) and MCA 1973 s. 14).</p>

Thus the knowledge and intent of both parties to the ceremony is relevant and there is a Nigerian case which holds that the attitude of mind of both that must be shown is “I know there ought to be a certificate, I know there is not a certificate, nevertheless I shall go through with the ceremony”.

However, as one would expect, when it was put to him the expert in Nigerian law called by the Petitioner accepted that if the issues were whether the Respondent was present and thus whether a ceremony took place at all, and there was an issue as to the credibility of one of the proposed witnesses to the ceremony (here the Petitioner's father) the evidence would not be confined to that of two (or more) elders, or respected members, of the village.  To my mind an analogous situation would arise in the case of a dispute as to the execution of a will if, for example, it was asserted that it was not executed by the testator because he was not present.  This does not mean that all of the considerable number of witnesses the Respondent says would have to be called would all be important and relevant witnesses.  But, in my judgment, witnesses as to the behaviour of the parties both before and after the alleged ceremonies would be relevant.  Further, there is likely to be an overlap between the witnesses that the Respondent would wish to call on the alternative case advanced by the Petitioner that there was a marriage by custom and repute.  Further it is probable that the Petitioner would not want to rely only on her own evidence as to how the parties behaved and held themselves out in Nigeria not least given the assertion that since 1994 the Respondent has lived there in the same house as Y and the Petitioner’s counter assertion that between 1994 and 2001 Y lived in the USA.</p>

The Respondent says that the Petitioner would have known that when she asserted that a ceremony of customary marriage had taken place on 22 December 1993 he would deny that he was present and would be likely to check his passport to see whether or not he was in Nigeria on that date and, on discovering the stamp, would assert in reliance on it that he was not.

She gave this evidence having heard discussion between me and her counsel on the issue of stay as to whether it was necessary to establish a connection of the marriage, or married life, with this country as opposed to establishing that one party to the marriage was habitually resident in this country.  In cross-examination (arguably to her credit) the Petitioner fairly quickly acknowledged that this evidence was untrue and that it had been given in the light of the discussion between me and her counsel and that the Respondent did not stay with her when he was in this country, but she visited him at his hotels.  She therefore effectively admitted that (a) she had lied in an attempt to seek to bolster her case, and (b) the above mentioned assertion in her petitions and assertions to that effect in her statements are not true (although these point were not specifically addressed before me).  Naturally I accept that this does not mean that she lied about other aspects of her case concerning habitual residence and the grant of a stay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that although I do not for one moment seek to condone, or excuse, the Respondent's conduct that has been criticised by other judges in this country and I do not regard him as a person who has been doing his best to assist the court to the best of his recollection, I have concluded that the stark disputes of fact raise real issues as to which the trial judge will have to hear a number of witnesses and consider a number of documents.  As appears above this conclusion is not based solely on the point that findings on issues of fact such as those raised in this case cannot be decided without the parties being given the opportunity to give oral evidence on them. Rather it is based on my estimate of the prospects of success on the factual issues.  There are a number of indicators on both sides by reference to the conduct of the parties.  I was taken to many of them during the course of the hearing for example cards written by the Respondent, the fact that he has felt free to go through marriage ceremonies with Y and his financial support of the Petitioner over many years and in differing situations support the Petitioner’s case.  I agree.  However in contrast some letters written by the Petitioner, the lack of passport entries recording (or published assertions of) marriage by her before the second ceremony and her description of herself as single in a number of application forms support the Respondent’s case.  I shall not refer to other matters or analyse those that I have mentioned further.</p>

This was a point made by the Petitioner and was probably in part responsible for the fact that the opposition to me dealing with the application to strike out the second petition was not pressed (although it was not withdrawn).  Further it was accepted by the Respondent that in respect of the second petition the only point on habitual residence and thus jurisdiction was the point relating to the lawfulness of the Petitioner’s presence in this country.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In view of this, and the fact that I heard the argument in respect of it, it seems to me that I should consider whether the second petition should be struck out.  If it should not be, then I see force in this alternative approach which has regard to the points that although the first petition cannot be amended to include reliance on the second ceremony (because it took place within a year of its issue) the second petition could be amended to rely on the first ceremony (and to cover all the issues raised in that petition).</p>

Her solicitors were O &amp; O.  In this action she sought declarations as to the paternity of the twins and the quads (to the effect that the twins were the children of the Respondent and that the quads were not).

It was in support of an application for interim relief to prevent the Defendants (the Respondent, Y and the quads) from threatening, harassing or arresting her.  The Petitioner discontinued this action on 24 March 2003.  On 10 June 2003 the Respondent filed a counterclaim in this action seeking a declaration that he was never married to the Petitioner.  The Petitioner successfully applied to strike out this counterclaim, the Respondent applied to reinstate it but later on 27 July 2004 he applied to discontinue it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">On 2 August 2004 the Respondent filed a no-fault petition in the High Court of Delta State for the dissolution of his 1974 statutory marriage with G.  She is the only defendant and has entered an appearance but not as yet filed an answer.  The petition is based on separation.  At a late stage of the hearing before me, through his counsel the Respondent gave an undertaking to this court not to take any further steps in these proceedings.  Following the hearing before me there has been some skirmishing in correspondence in connection with these proceedings, the undertaking and a hearing in Nigeria.  This is typical of the history of this case and in my judgment it is not relevant to the issue before me.</p>

The defendants are the Respondent and the Petitioner and they are both defending these proceedings.  Injunctive relief has been granted in these proceedings preventing the Respondent making payments to the Petitioner and restraining the Respondent from continuing with the English proceedings.  This was one of the matters he has relied on to defend, or excuse, his failure to make payments to the Petitioner pursuant to orders of this court.  These proceedings were strongly criticised by Thorpe LJ during the hearing before the Court of Appeal on 23 September 2004.   </p>

It asserts in its introduction that the extraordinary complexity and expense of the litigation, not only in this jurisdiction, but in Nigeria, has been brought about entirely by the husband's determination to see that the wife and children, now three years of age, receive no financial support from him.  Mr Scott adds that, in order to achieve this goal, the husband has demonstrated a willingness to use every imaginable tactical device both in this jurisdiction and in Nigeria.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before me the Respondent by his counsel accepted that valid and severe criticism can justly be made of some of the Respondent’s conduct, particularly as to the failures to disclose assets and failures to comply with orders of this court. Indeed his conduct bears many of the hallmarks of a Respondent who has taken, and is likely to continue to take, inappropriate steps to avoid, or delay, making payments of financial relief to the Petitioner albeit that I accept the point made on his behalf that part of the problem has been that the issues of jurisdiction and stay have not been dealt with and the Court of Appeal recognised that this was an error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of this general acceptance of fault the Respondent did not pursue with any diligence points and evidence in an attempt to show that he did not effectively control the plaintiffs in the Saki proceedings and like the Court of Appeal I proceed on the basis that directly, or indirectly, he does and that the injunctive relief in those proceedings was a device.  In any event, on the evidence before me I have concluded that the Respondent could ensure that the plaintiffs in the Saki proceedings lifted the injunctive relief not least by making payments to the adult children.  Thus like the Court of Appeal I do not accept that the Respondent is faced with the difficult situation of being restrained by contradictory injunctions obtained by hostile opponents in different jurisdictions and it is fair and correct to describe the injunctions in those proceedings as a device.</p>

Further at this stage I comment that it seems to me that it should be remembered that having made these criticisms the Court of Appeal made orders that allowed the Respondent to appeal orders of this court which he had been heavily criticised for not obeying and to challenge jurisdiction.  Additionally the Court of Appeal did not have the advantage of hearing the parties give oral evidence.</p>

Additionally it seems to me that from the Respondent’s perspective his case could be opened reasonably and moderately by asserting that the litigation here and in Nigeria has been brought about by the determination of the Petitioner to obtain orders for financial relief (1) when she knows that she and the Respondent were not married, and (2) even if, as she alleges, they were married against a background of (a) her knowledge that she would not be entitled to such relief in Nigeria as a wife under a customary marriage, but might get it in England and Wales if she could establish that she was habitually resident here, and had entered into a customary marriage with the Respondent in Nigeria, (b) her having told lies to the immigration authorities, particularly in October 2002 when the relationship between the parties was, as is common ground, in difficulties to obtain leave to enter and remain in England and Wales and thus be in a position to assert that she was habitually resident here, (c) her having caused the arrest of the Respondent, Y (and the quads) in Nigeria, and having issued a number of proceedings in Nigeria, thereby demonstrating a willingness and ability to use the authorities in her home country, Nigeria, when it suited her and (d) in an attempt to bolster her case on habitual residence her having procured a letter dated 19 August 2004 from Luton University by providing its author with false information.  </p>

It is not just residence but <span style="font-style:italic">habitual</span> residence that has to be shown.  The question of habitual residence is a factual one.  The illegality of a person's residence may be relevant to considering that factual question.  Thus someone who has not got a permanent home, is evading immigration authorities, or someone who is under an order for deportation, will be unlikely to be able to establish habitual residence.

Indeed the passage cited by Hobhouse LJ in which Lord Goff refers to the appropriate forum is the passage in which Lord Goff states that the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted if the court is satisfied that there is a more appropriate forum; Lord Goff then goes on to set out the approach that should be applied in making that decision (see the passages cited above).</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“ It is, I consider, in this connection desirable to consider the meaning of the expression "balance of fairness" in para. 9(1).  No doubt there are circumstances when it can plainly be perceived that it is more fair that proceedings should proceed in a foreign jurisdiction than this country.  But experience shows that there are difficulties.  First, there are factors which cannot evenly be weighed, the one class of factors may be simply relevant as <span style="font-style:italic">connecting</span> the dispute with a particular forum; whereas another class of factors (which may embrace the former) may point to injustice arising if the dispute is remitted to that forum.  It is necessary, therefore, so to structure the enquiry as to differentiate between these two classes of factors, and decide how each should be approached in relation to the other.  Second, a factor may be such that its advantage to one party may be counterbalanced by the disadvantage to the other; and a decision has to be made as to how such factors should be taken into account in considering "the balance of fairness” between the parties.  The principle of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> has now been developed in such a way that such matters can be approached both consistently in the cases and always in accordance with the underlying principle of justice.

In carrying out the exercise under s. 25 , to what extent should the judge reflect the fact that this is primarily a Nigerian family with only secondary attachment in this jurisdiction and culture? It is my opinion that if the ancillary relief order is to be determined by a London judge (and any order would be manifestly enforceable against London assets) he should give due weight to what I might loosely described as Nigerian factors and not ignore the differential between what the wife might anticipate from a determination in London as opposed to a determination in Lagos.  The dispute to date, like most of these disputes as to jurisdiction, has undoubtedly been driven by the husband's conviction that a Lagos award would be to his advantage and the wife's contrary conviction that a London award be more generous.  These contests are particularly arid and in my view should be discouraged by permitting a reflection of the differential within the review under s. 25(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 of "all the circumstances of the case".  I accept the consequence that the ancillary relief trial in London would be more complex and more expensive than it would be in a conventional case between British subjects. ”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The wife opposes a stay of her divorce proceedings in England and the courts below refused to grant a stay for one reason and one reason only.  In divorce proceedings in this country the wife is likely to obtain substantial financial relief by way of maintenance and a lump sum payment, notwithstanding any responsibility she may have for  the break-up of the marriage.  Under French law a wife is entitled on divorce to similar financial relief if the breakdown of the marriage is due to the conduct of the husband or if responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage is shared (as it usually is shared) by both parties.  But a wife who is found to be exclusively blameworthy for the breakdown of the marriage may be denied financial ancillary relief, save for maintenance payments which will enable her to provide a home for an infant child of the marriage in the style and manner appropriate to the expectations of the child and suitable for the comfort and welfare of the child.  By prosecuting the English divorce proceedings the wife insures against the risk of the consequences which might ensue if she were found by the French court to be exclusively responsible for the breakdown of the marriage.  </p>

There are many circumstances in which it would be unfair to the wife to deny her the advantage of claiming maintenance from an English court.  For example, if the husband's assets were wholly or mainly in England, or if the wife remained in England, or if the English proceedings would render the French proceedings wholly unnecessary, it might well be unfair to tell the wife to litigate in France and unfair to stay the wife's English proceedings.  The extent of the possible disadvantages to a wife if she is confined to the remedies in a foreign forum is another relevant circumstance.  For example, if French law provided that on divorce a guilty wife shall be punished and an innocent wife returned to her parents without maintenance or compensation, the wife, at any rate if resident in England, could fairly claim from an English court maintenance from the husband's assets in England; the husband would behave unfairly if he refused to support his wife and sought a stay of the English proceedings.  Fairness depends on the facts of each case and there is no shortcut.</p>

All we are imposing under paragraph (iii) of the proposed order is that there be a strike out unless the husband pays the two instalments of future maintenance pending suit that will fall due between today and the fixture in the Family Division.  Mr Scott has told us that each month the due date is the 28th and therefore the obligation -- let everybody be clear about this -- is to pay the £39,000 for the month of September on 28 September, and the £39,000 due for the month of October on 28 October  Thereafter the position will be entirely dependent on the outcome of the trial on 15 November.

I respectfully agree that absent a statutory provision that continued an MPS order (which provides for payments on a regular basis during and ending with the determination of a suit - see s. 22 MCA 1973) the natural consequence of a stay of the suit is that the MPS order ceases to have effect over the course of the stay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 makes provision for the continuation of an MPS order when there is an obligatory stay by reference to the first three types of matrimonial proceedings (as defined) in a related jurisdiction (i.e. Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man).  Clearly this is not directed to discretionary stays and to my mind does not provide any real guidance as to the effect of a discretionary stay on an MPS order.  But, if anything, in my judgment it is an indication that the natural consequence of a stay of matrimonial proceedings (which has the result that until the stay is lifted (i) no order for divorce, judicial separation or nullity could be made, and thus (ii) no order for ancillary relief could be made) is that an order for MPS made in the stayed proceedings should cease to have effect on the grant of the stay.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Also it seems to me that the continuation of an order for MPS for three months (subject to an order under sub-paragraph 11 (2)(c)) on a compulsory stay is a recognition that the stay is compulsory and of the close connection of the related jurisdictions, rather than an indication that on a discretionary stay an MPS order would, or should, continue absent an order staying it.  Further, and  in any event, in my view it is not an indication that the court should not as a matter of course when making an order staying matrimonial proceedings under the MCA 1973 also an make an order that an MPS order made therein is to cease to have effect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However a stay in pursuance of the statutory power is not a dismissal (although whilst it continues the court is in effect declining to exercise its jurisdiction – see CPR 9A-165) and it could be lifted pursuant to paragraph 10 of Schedule 1.  Thus a possibility remains that a stay could be lifted and an order for divorce, judicial separation or nullity could be granted in the stayed proceedings which would trigger the power in s. 23 MCA 1973 to make an order for ancillary relief in those proceedings.  In my judgment this possibility has different consequences in respect of a freezing order and an order for MPS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I add that in my judgment on the true construction of Schedule 1 the circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 thereof are not the only ones in which a stay can be lifted or will come to an end.  To my mind given the discretionary nature of the jurisdiction and the nature of the order for a stay if there was a significant change in circumstances that had not been foreseen when the stay was granted the court could lift the stay.  Also in my judgment, as appears below the court can impose conditions on a stay and thus provide that it is to last for a defined time or whilst a condition subsists (in both cases subject to further order in the meantime) or simply until further order (with liberty to apply in defined circumstances or generally).  Further paragraph 9(1)(b) shows that the balance of fairness is considered by reference to the question whether the foreign proceedings should be determined before further steps are taken in the English proceedings and thus first.  In my judgment this indicates that the stay can be, and perhaps in many cases should be, in terms that it comes to an end on disposal of the foreign proceedings, or could be lifted when this occurs.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the point that a stay is not a dismissal and the possibility that it may be lifted before the foreign proceedings are determined, or will then come to an end (or may then be lifted) leaves in place matrimonial proceedings under the MCA in England (and a right to relief) in respect of which an interlocutory order (and thus a freezing order) could be granted or continued under s. 37 Supreme Court Act 1981.  As such interim orders are granted until further order it seems to me that any existing freezing order should be reconsidered if a stay of the proceedings in which it was granted is ordered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The same point on reconsideration applies to an order for MPS.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However in my judgment there is a significant difference between the continuation, or re-granting, of a freezing order and an order for MPS.  It arises because the effect of a freezing order is to preserve assets so that if a final order is made in favour of a party, funds will be available to meet it. In contrast an order for MPS provides for regular payments during, and ending with, the determination of the suit (or earlier order).  To my mind this means that a prerequisite, or condition precedent, to the exercise of the discretion under s. 22 to make an order for MPS is the existence of an active petition for divorce, judicial separation or nullity under the MCA 1973 and thus the trigger for the grant of an MPS order.  In my view the point that a stay might be lifted or that it will or may come to an end does not satisfy that requirement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus in my view, absent statutory provision to the contrary (i.e. paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 DMPA 1973) an implied or inherent term of an order for MPS under s. 22 MCA 1973 is that it ceases to have effect, or falls away, if the proceedings under the MCA 1973 in which it was made are stayed because the stay brings to an end the existence of the trigger to the power to make an MPS order.  But to avoid doubt it would in my view be good practice for a court granting a stay of matrimonial proceedings to expressly stay any existing order for MPS as a matter of course.</p>

However, to my mind there are some problems as to how this provision operates because it is clear that Schedule 1 is to be exercised rather than the inherent jurisdiction when the basis for a stay of matrimonial proceedings is the existence of foreign proceedings and thus as to whether it can be regarded as a “back stop” or alternative in such circumstances.  In my judgment it may be that this provision is designed to cover other bases for a stay not involving foreign proceedings (as to such other bases for a stay see CPR 9A- 161 et seq, which also shows the flexibility of an order for a stay granted on such bases, and under the inherent jurisdiction, for example as to its length).</p>

Rather in my view they found the conclusion that when satisfied on the statutory question posed by paragraph 9(1)(b) the court can grant a stay until that event or further order, or until further order with liberty to apply to discharge or vary the stay when the foreign proceedings have been disposed of or under paragraph 10 or on other defined terms or generally.  </p>

Further, in my judgment she was of the opinion (which proved to be correct) that if she sought leave to enter and remain on arrival in this country from Nigeria at Heathrow airport armed with her enrolment for Luton University she had a good prospect, and certainly a much higher prospect than she would have had if she had applied in England and Wales or Nigeria, of being given leave to enter and remain for the purposes of that course.</p>

Thus I accept that on 22 November 2002 the Respondent was compelled to go to the police station with the quads and that Y also attended at the police station.  I accept that if they were not formally arrested they were in effect arrested, detained for some hours and questioned in worrying and unpleasant circumstances.  </p>

Mr O gave oral evidence before me.  I am sorry to have to record that in my view he was a partisan and unimpressive witness.  He was not very forthcoming about this meeting.  This may be explained by the difficulty he was in having regard to his written evidence and correspondence to which I will return when dealing with the application made by the Petitioner for an anti-suit injunction on 15 April 2003.</p>

Rather, in my judgment the reason for this was, as the Respondent asserts, the police were made aware of the arguments, allegations and counter allegations (which included allegations of threatening behaviour by both sides to the other) and took the view that these were domestic issues in which they were unwilling or unable to intervene, or deal with it as a criminal matter. Further in my judgment both the Petitioner and Mr O were well aware of this.</p>

Indeed in her affidavit in support of the anti suit injunction the Petitioner asserts that he lives with Y. The Petitioner accepts and asserts that she was making complaints as to the support and attention given to her and the twins by the Respondent.

A consequence of these allegations, if true, would be that she would not be able to obtain even handed justice in Nigeria.  Indeed in her affidavit the Petitioner refers to the Respondent’s proceedings in the Customary Court in Nigeria and asserts that even if it were safe and practicable for her to go to Nigeria she would not receive a fair trial in those proceedings and that her lawyers in Nigeria would be attending the next hearing thereof to pursue her motion to dismiss or strike out the petition (albeit, as I understand it, not in those grounds).  </p>

Further as appears earlier in this judgment in my view at the time she swore this affidavit she knew that as a customary wife she had no claim to ancillary relief in any Nigerian court and her assertions later in paragraph 27 of this affidavit that the Customary Court does not have “powers and procedures to deal with complex financial issues” and that she is trying to establish from her Nigerian lawyers what powers the Customary Court has to grant financial relief but understands that they are very limited, are disingenuous.   In reaching this conclusion I have not forgotten the evidence before me to the effect that a customary marriage has to be dissolved in the Customary Court, (and thus that it is the court that would grant ancillary relief) but that the Customary Court has no power to grant ancillary relief (see also <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mark</span> at para 39).  I have reached this conclusion because of (a) my findings as to her knowledge of the position under Nigerian law, (b) her active communication with her Nigerian lawyers before and at the time she swore that affidavit, and (c) the common ground before me that the customary law marriage system (rather than a particular court) has no provision for the making of orders of ancillary relief to the wife (whether complex financial matters were involved) although there is a power under it to make financial provision for the children of such a marriage.</p>

One brother says a letter was delivered by police asking the Petitioner to report to the police station in connection with a criminal investigation  relating to a gun threat made by Mr B O (the Respondent’s lawyer who had written the letters in early March).  The other brother says he was told by the police that the Petitioner would be placed under arrest for threatening to kill the Respondent and Y. To my mind this evidence does not provide grounds for a dramatic or serious change even if (and for present purposes I shall assume that) the allegation of the threat to kill had been made recently and thus after the earlier letters in March 2003 from the Respondent’s lawyers.  Further to my mind this evidence does not provide a proper basis for the views expressed by the Petitioner’s Nigerian solicitor in the letter that was exhibited.  </p>

Also this extract indicates that Mr O was confident of being able to enforce an English order against the Respondent’s Nigerian assets, which does not sit well with the allegations made concerning the influence and power of the Respondent and that the Petitioner will not receive a fair hearing in Nigeria.</p>

We believe the police will detain her indefinitely, and in practice, this can run into several months while investigation and preparation to prosecute under the "holding charge" system, goes on.  <span style="font-style:italic">(I comment that this too is plainly a very serious allegation.)</span>  This is because we understand she will be arrested on a high felony charge and there is little or no guarantee that she will get a fair trial with the overbearing influence of an influential husband on the entire process.

Thus, for example, the evidence does not indicate why if the position in Nigeria was as alleged the Petitioner had returned to Nigeria in February 2003 and why she not been arrested on this visit which lasted until 16 March 2003 (and during which she commenced proceedings in Nigeria and England) or on earlier visits.  To my mind the service of the first petition if this took place after 16 March 2003 is not a sufficient ground for making the allegations relied on in support of the application for the anti suit injunction. </p>

In this context the letter dated 28 March 2003 from an employee at his firm was put to Mr O and he was invited to justify the assertions made therein by reference to events concerning the Petitioner or other events.  Although he gave an example of a case in which he had been involved in which he said people had been wrongly arrested with a view to exerting pressure on them in connection with civil proceedings, and made general allegations against the police and the courts in Nigeria in my view he wholly failed to provide an evidential basis for the risks to the Petitioner asserted in the letter dated 28 March 2003 from his firm.

Further, in particular one of the twins has had medical problems and has been treated in this country.  Apart from that, in my judgment the connection of the relationship with this country is that the Petitioner has been here since the year 2000 (initially as a student) at the expense of the Respondent (as either one of his wives or a mistress) and when the Respondent has come to this country they have met up at his hotel.</p>

As I understand that report my findings as to the letter of 19 August 2004, the intention of the Petitioner when she entered England and Wales on 2 October 2003 and 16 March 2004 and her non-attendance at Luton University lead to the conclusion that if she had to rely on the permission given on October 2003 she could not establish that her presence in England and Wales was lawful at the dates that the petitions were issued.  This is because Mr Magrath’s report, and thus the submissions of the Petitioner, are founded upon (a) her not having formed an intention by 16 March 2004 to give up, or not to start, her studies at Luton University, and (b) her attendance there until April 2004.

The fulfilment of that hope and wish was naturally capable of being affected by the continuation of support from the Respondent, or immigration matters.  At the time both petitions were filed the relationship between the parties had broken down but in my judgment it is plain on the findings I have made that the intention and settled purpose of the Petitioner was that she and the twins would make England and Wales their home if they could and (as appears from paragraph 186 above) it was in that context that (a) she sought and obtained permission to enter and remain in England and Wales in October 2002, (b) she returned to England and Wales  in March 2003, and (c) she pursued her petitions and applications for MPS and ancillary relief.  In my judgment it follows that applying the approach set out earlier under the heading “jurisdiction” she had an abode here which she had adopted for a settled purpose albeit that circumstances might alter in the future (for example by reference to immigration matters or financial support) which made it unlawful or impractical for her and the twins to remain her or she decided to go to another country.</p>

For the reasons I have given the trial judge will have to consider the evidence of a number of witnesses who live in Nigeria.  Indeed it seems that the only important witness who lives in England is the Petitioner.  Naturally I accept that the Respondent does travel here, and that he could do so for a trial, but he does not live here.  As mentioned earlier (paragraph 46) in my view it is clear that the issues of fact and law that arise in respect of the status of the parties are overwhelmingly “Nigerian issues”.</p>

I therefore find that if a stay is granted the Petitioner will be able to remain in England and Wales and therefore she was right not to pursue with any vigour an argument that in practice she would not be able to pursue a claim under Part III MFPA if a stay was granted because in that event she would be unable to remain in England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the English proceedings (a) were instituted in an attempt to improve the Petitioner’s position and to claim support from the Respondent that would not have been available in Nigeria, and (b) have been pursued against the background of the underlying dispute between the parties as to whether they ever entered into a marriage ceremony in Nigeria and according to Nigerian customary law.  In those circumstances, for the reasons and having regard to the findings referred to in paragraph 321 and the other findings I have made (e.g. as to litigation conduct) I have concluded that in all the circumstances of this case the balance of fairness favours the issues of status being decided in Nigeria and thus the grant of a stay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The point was raised on behalf of the Petitioner that if she succeeded in establishing that she and the Respondent entered into a ceremony of customary marriage and the issue of status turned on the Respondent’s alternative argument that his marriage to G was a statutory marriage the customary marriage would, or might, not be “annulled” by the Nigerian court, and this would prevent her seeking to make a claim under the MFPA, whereas in the same circumstances the English court would grant a decree of nullity.  As to that, I was not clear what the Petitioner submits was added by the allegations of misrepresentation and deception but as I have set out they are part of the Petitioner’s case and it may be that they are directed to  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Rampal v Rampal (No 2)</span> [2001] 2 FLR 1179.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On my understanding of the views of the experts on  Nigerian law there is a reasonable prospect that in those circumstances the customary marriage would be annulled.  Further and in any event in my view there would be a reasonable prospect of establishing that the effect of the Nigerian order satisfied the trigger of a marriage being annulled in the MFPA on the basis that it should be construed  by considering whether what has been found and done in the foreign court would in English eyes be, or warrant, an annulment.  </p>

Such a payment is a round figure assessed against the expenses the Petitioner will have to incur in arguing her case in Nigeria on travel and other costs and will therefore ameliorate her problems in doing this and thus in advancing her arguments in Nigeria or, if she so decides, on other expenses whilst she is making the changes having regard to the ending of the orders for MPS.  Further in my view such a payment would have promoted and achieved overall fairness if the application for a stay had been heard before any order for MPS had been made.  </p>
